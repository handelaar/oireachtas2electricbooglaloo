      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a notice of motion under Standing Order 30 from Deputy John Bruton.</P>

      <P>I seek your permission, Sir, under Standing Order 30 to adjourn the Dáil to have the Government clarify a statement made by the Taoiseach on the Order of Business on 25 May, column 673 of the Official Report, that the Tánaiste was truly reflecting the Programme for Government when he stated there would be no further disposal of State assets in the lifetime of this Government. In light of the Government's reported statement at last night's meeting with Aer Lingus that the judicious disposal of assets is an intrinsic element of the strategy for survival and the imminent discussions here on the Transport Estimates next week, it is urgent and important for the House to know if these statements of policy on the part of the Tánaiste are accurate.  If the policy is to be changed this should be done openly in the Dáil and not elsewhere.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 4, 5 and 6.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: 1.  Business shall be interrupted at 12 midnight; 2. the sitting shall be suspended at 8.30 p.m. for 15 minutes; 3. the proceedings on the Second Stage of No. 4 if not previously concluded shall be brought to a conclusion at 6.45 p.m.; 4. the Second Stage of No. 5 shall be taken today and the proceedings thereon if not previously concluded shall be brought to a conclusion at 12 midnight. Private Members' Business shall be No. 17.</P>

      <P>On the question of concluding at 12 tonight, the general point raised yesterday related to the fact that every Stage of every Bill we are dealing with this week is being guillotined, and a particularly serious guillotine is being applied to the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill to be taken tomorrow, for which only 55 minutes is being allowed on Committee Stage.  Will the Taoiseach indicate that he is prepared to extend the time available to that Stage of the Bill in view of the serious implications in certain sections of it in relation to new offences and penalties?  I would like the Taoiseach to give such an indication before we proceed to agree the order of guillotines for today's business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>A total of five and a quarter hours is being allowed for Second Stage of this Bill today; in fact its duration will probably be somewhat less now because of the vote on the Order of Business and so on.  The Bill is of major significance.  Its preparation continued for more than two years, with the establishment of the Culliton committee and the report of that committee.  The Bill does not in any way reflect the recommendations of that committee which is a cause of concern to many people.  It is of huge importance to the future industrial development of this country.  The fact that it is being guillotined in this manner is totally unsatisfactory.  I understand it is proposed to take Committee Stage first tomorrow morning, with almost no interval between the very short Second Stage and an even shorter Committee Stage.  I protest at the manner in which the Government is ordering business this week and guillotining this Bill through.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the only Bill the Government has put forward since assuming office that has any relationship to the jobs crisis.  To suggest that Members of the Opposition be asked to have their amendments ready tomorrow morning, after a brief Second Stage debate today, is not to take the jobs crisis seriously.  In my view the Government is wrong in attempting to deal with a matter of this potential significance in such a cavalier manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there should be any limit on the Committee Stage of this Bill.  We are willing to accept a limit on Second Stage, which is what is being decided today, but we do not believe there should be any limit on Committee Stage.  On Committee Stage Members are afforded an opportunity to examine the precise meaning of sections, to propose alternative wording and so on.  To suggest that all of that should be taken within 45 minutes tomorrow is not to take the House seriously.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three and a quarter hours allocated to Second Stage of this Bill this evening.  The Bill is of considerable importance in that it proposes to make major changes in the law. The changes do not relate simply to changing the law relating to homosexuality; they extend far beyond that. Indeed, it is many of the other areas of change that give rise to particular concern. It is impossible, given the diverse views that undoubtedly are held by Members, for that concern to be expressed on Second Stage within three and a quarter hours.  I wish to protest vigorously against that.  My party shall not be voting against the Bill on Second Stage, but we have a number of amendments tabled for Committee Stage, for which 45 minutes will be devoted tomorrow. It is quite a long Bill and effectively no amendments can be discussed within that time.  It is totally unsatisfactory.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to create the new State agency structures which will underpin industrial development in the coming decades.  Three new bodies will be created &mdash; Forfás, Forbairt and the Industrial Development Agency (Ireland) &mdash; IDA.  Each of the agencies will be autonomous and will have its own board.  Each will have a distinct mission and goal.  However, all three agencies will operate within a framework which facilitates co-operation and mutual support. <Col N="1727" /> Forfás will be responsible for overall policy co-ordination and administration.  In addition, Forfás will play a proactive role in ensuring co-ordination in those areas of industrial development which are outside the direct remit of my Department, such as food and foreign trade.  Forbairt will develop indigenous industry by bringing together the existing functions of Eolas and the IDA, and finally, IDA Ireland will continue to promote the attraction of overseas industry to Ireland.</P>
    <P>The creation of these new bodies represents a major step forward in the development and implementation of industrial policy in Ireland.  I will return to this point in detail later, but, first, I would like to place the Bill and the topic of industrial development within the broader context of Irish economic development.  As the House will be aware, the boundaries of this broader area have been explored and developed through the work of the Industrial Policy Review Group, chaired by Mr. Jim Culliton and in the subsequent task force chaired by Dr. Paddy Moriarty.</P>
    <P>The effect of Culliton was to widen the whole industrial policy debate by pointing out that industrial development comes about through the harmonisation of a broad range of factors, many of which extend beyond the remit of my Department and its agencies.  Culliton builds on this new analysis by calling for a different approach in which the requirements of industrial development would become the driver for many areas of economic and social activity.</P>
    <P>In the Programme for Government, my ministerial colleagues and I indicated our clear agreement with this approach and stated that we would: strengthen Ireland's industrial, scientific and exporting base; increase the level of directly productive activity; encourage a dynamic spirit of enterprise; put a new emphasis on building up small industry, and broaden industrial strategy to take in all the factors that affect output and productive.</P>
    <P>The Moriarty task force reinforced this <Col N="1728" /> central message and undertook, with great commitment, the difficult job of translating the need for a more co-ordinated approach to enterprise development into a series of specific tasks to be fulfilled by various Government Departments, State agencies, and the semi-State sector.</P>
    <P>In the document <i>Employment Through Enterprise</i>, the Government gave its proposals for dealing with the task force recommendations in the areas of taxation, energy, ports, communications, transport, environment, commercial State enterprises education and training, competition policy, the legislative process and of course, the reorganisation of the State agencies.  Taken together, the programme set down in that document represents the most concerted effort ever undertaken to address the requirements of employment and enterprise development in the State.</P>
    <P>As far as the industrial development agencies are concerned, the conclusion of the Culliton report was that their role is an important but limited one.  When reviewing industrial performance there has for too long been a tendency to believe that the agencies are responsible for job creation and for any failure to meet this country's employment needs. Set against the broad panorama of issues addressed by Culliton this view is patently flawed.  However, this broader view should in no way allow complacency to creep in.  The current agency structures are inhibiting the most efficient and effective development of industry and we must change them.</P>
    <P>The problem to be tackled is evident when we look at the breakdown of jobs gained and lost in both Irish and overseas firms in the country over the six year period 1987 to 1992 inclusive.  During this period an impressive total of 118,500 jobs were created but, unfortunately, this was accompanied by total losses of 108,600.  Some would say that this represents a poor success rate, especially since the new job gains came from overseas companies.  I dispute this overly simplified view.</P>
    <P>Let me be clear from the outset that the <Col N="1729" /> contribution which overseas firms have made to Ireland, and the success which the IDA has achieved in attracting them, is not to be dismissed.  On the contrary, it deserves the highest possible praise. Around three quarters of our industrial exports come from foreign firms and those same firms employ half the total workforce in manufacturing.</P>
    <P>Over the past few years, however, the global industrial economy has been going through a recession of unprecedented proportions.  Even Japan, whose industry seemed invincible during the 1970s and 1980s has started to feel the cold wind of falling orders and job losses.  Against this backdrop we must consider ourselves very lucky to have been able to attract new industry and to create new jobs to replace those which succumbed to the effects of the international recession.</P>
    <P>The danger is that we may take too much comfort from this strong overseas performance.  What has been happening, in this regard, is that our successes in the field of attracting mobile investment have been obscuring our failure to really get indigenous industry moving.</P>
    <P>The current situation, where a single agency is responsible for both indigenous and overseas firms, exacerbates the lack of clarity.  This is understandable and inevitable, since any organisation will strive to present its performance in the best possible light.  Its inevitability means that we must change the structures to get the clarity we require.  This is what this Bill is all about.</P>
    <P>The indigenous industry development role will be addressed by Forbairt.  Before I talk in detail about Forbairt, let me pause for a moment and go back to Culliton. A great deal has been made about what the Culliton report did or did not propose in relation to the structures of the State agencies.  There have been protracted debates on whether the finest points of the report are being interpreted correctly and acted upon, the more intricate the debate becomes, the more people deviate from the central point of Culliton, which was to lay down a broad strategy for industrial development and economic growth.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1730" /> In the area of organisation design, many different approaches can be taken. One of the leading experts in this field. Richard Pascale talks about the constant need to achieve a balance between &ldquo;fit&rdquo; and &ldquo;split&rdquo;, in other words, the need to develop organisations which are coherent and consistent in their strategies and structures, but not so unidimensional that they stagnate and become hidebound by size and bureaucracy.  In the structures which this Bill will establish, I am fully confident that we have struck the right balance between these two opposing forces.  In this regard, I would say with some force that I am much more concerned with getting this balance right than with conforming to some abstract notion of adherence to a precious text.</P>
    <P>The challenge facing Forbairt will demand a different package of solutions from those which have traditionally been dispensed.  In particular, it will mean changing the widespread perception within industry and the State agencies that cash grants are the main vehicle for development.  If this were the case we would have solved our problems long ago.  The truth is that the developmental requirements of industry are far more fundamental and the problems more deep seated.  The key issue is whether our firms have the necessary competences to produce the technologically sophisticated, high quality, goods and services which international markets require and also whether firms have the internal efficiencies needed to bring those goods to market on time and on budget.</P>
    <P>At present, we have two problems. First, not enough of our existing firms have the necessary mix of such competences to develop and grow.  Second, we are not developing sufficient new start-up firms to expand the overall indigenous sector to the levels that our unemployment problems require.  These problems are being addressed by the existing agencies.  The IDA, for example, is developing capability-related programmes, focusing on company development and management development.  It is also increasing its equity participation in firms and tying its financial supports to <Col N="1731" /> the development of the strategic fundamentals in firms.  At the same time Eolas is offering technology audits, quality programmes, graduate placements and a host of other technology development facilities.  However, this short list of initiatives demonstrates the piecemeal approach which the existing structures bring about.  In creating Forbairt, this Bill will allow a much better planned approach to the development of indigenous industry.</P>
    <P>However, we should not delude ourselves that the new structures will bring results overnight.  The problems I have referred to will take time to solve.  As Professor Michael Enright of Harvard Business School and adviser to the Culliton Review Group pointed out:</P>
    <P>Firms and governments must take the long view if they are to be successful in improving their competitiveness. Industrial competitiveness is built over decades, not business or political cycles.</P>
    <P>The objective in creating Forbairt is not to achieve a quick fix solution.  Rather it is to create a clear focus on the problem and in so doing to ensure that performance targets for the new agency can be set out and appraised in unambiguous terms.</P>
    <P>The same holds true of IDA Ireland which will be mandated to maximise the return from the attraction of mobile international investment at minimum cost to the taxpayer.  This involves more than just &ldquo;selling&rdquo; Ireland as an attractive location.  It means being aware of movements in the business and technological environment and of being able to make a successful appraisal of the strategic fundamentals of potential client firms.</P>
    <P>In the interests of minimising grant expenditure, it also requires that IDA Ireland should be able to demonstrate the attractiveness of Ireland in terms of other factor advantages such as the quality of the labour force, our clean environment and other infrastructural assets such as our telecommunications system. In these regards the importance of the <Col N="1732" /> wide ranging reforms which the Government has instituted in response to the Moriarty task force recommendations can once again be seen to make eminent good sense.</P>
    <P>I also want IDA Ireland to strengthen its efforts within the Single European Market.  All of the assets which I have referred to above are as attractive to European firms seeking to expand as they are to US or Japanese firms.  The opportunities offered by the Single Market are also conducive to the development of joint ventures, strategic alliances and technology transfer between Irish and European firms.  This is another area which I want IDA Ireland to explore in conjunction with Forbairt.</P>
    <P>Having mentioned linkages between the agencies, I should like to turn now to the issue of co-ordination.  As I have shown, the separation of indigenous and overseas functions will lead to a greater clarity of mission at agency level. However, we must also be on our guard that this separation of functions will not lead to any overlap between the indigenous and overseas functions being ignored.  This necessity for co-ordination is part of the <i>raison d'etre</i> of Forfás.  The Programme for Government established this point.  It was further reinforced in the document <i>Employment through Enterprise</i> where we point out that:</P>
    <P>Forfás will have a vital co-ordinating role and will promote greater linkages between the indigenous and international sectors of Irish industry.</P>
    <P>In the context of promoting linkages it is vital to ensure that opportunities to exploit synergies between indigenous and foreign firms are exploited to the greatest extent possible.  Such business linkages are of vital importance for employment creation, indigenous business development and continued attraction of new greenfield investments.  Because of the small size of the country, indigenous companies have a limited domestic market in which to grow their business. This is a significant drawback.</P>
    <P>As Professor Michael Porter pointed out in his book <i>The Competitive Advantage <Col N="1733" /> of Nations</i>, the size of the home market and, more specifically, the nature of home market demand, is a major determinant of the rate at which a nation's firms can develop.  The opportunity to supply multinational companies based here therefore represents a very significant expansion of the domestic market for Irish firms.  It also represents the kind of challenge, in terms of buyer standards, to which indigenous firms need to rise if they are to compete internationally. By developing as successful suppliers to multinationals in Ireland these firms can develop world class standards with less investment in marketing and product development than would otherwise be the case.</P>
    <P>The whole area of linkage development also raises the question of industrial clusters as developed by Porter and recommended in the Culliton report.  The issue of cluster development is a complex one since it requires the formation of linkages between overseas and indigenous companies and between companies in different sectors.  For example, an agro-industrial cluster could involve companies in food processing, engineering companies in production equipment fabrication and electronics and software companies in process control and monitoring. Clearly, it will be difficult for either Forbairt or the IDA to implement the clusters concept while at the same time focusing on their sectoral responsibilities.</P>
    <P>This, then, is a perfect example of the type of area where Forfás can play a role. That role will involve developing policy for cluster and linkage development and working with staff from Forbairt and IDA Ireland to ensure that, at an executive level, policy is implemented in a flexible and pragmatic way.  For example, Forfás will need to work with the two agencies to determine the operating guidelines to be used in negotiating particular support packages with companies. The objective will be to ensure an equitable approach to overseas and indigenous companies operating in similar sectors or in competition with one another.</P>
    <P>Another area where co-ordination will <Col N="1734" /> be required is in the area of company ownership changes and takeovers.  The global nature of business today means that the ownership of companies cannot be seen as a static phenomenon.  As Culliton pointed out, overseas companies have transferred to Irish ownership and <i>vice versa</i>.  This is frequently in response to the developmental needs of those companies and can be a positive step.  But in the agency context such transfers of ownership need to be managed to ensure that full support is provided during the transitional period.  Here again Forfás will play a co-ordinating role.</P>
    <P>The policy and evaluation role of Forfás generally is very important.  In this regard I see Forfás as an important link in the policy chain between my Department and the two agencies.  This centralising of the policy and evaluation activities of the agencies at the level of Forfás will make for a more open dialogue in the industrial policy area.  Since Forfás will not have a direct involvement in the implementation of programmes it will be in a better position to objectively analyse the performance of the executive agencies and, on foot of this, to provide policy advice to my Department.</P>
    <P>In referring to Forfás as a link in the chain, I want to make it clear that both myself and my Department will be the driving force in the policy area.  The Moriarty Task Force made a number of recommendations &mdash; for instance, how my Department's resources in the policy area could be strengthened &mdash; and these are being pursued.  I will be continuing my programme of restructuring and organisational development within the Department with the objective of ensuring that the changes which are proposed in this Bill at agency level will be fully reflected within the structures of my Department.</P>
    <P>I would like to touch specifically on the question of policy for science and technology as I know that there is some concern among the scientific community that the focus on science and technology which has developed under the aegis of my Department in recent years will be distorted or diluted by the new structures. <Col N="1735" /> I would like to make it clear that I am fully committed to continuing to develop the role which technology can play in industrial development.  Indeed, I am convinced that the incorporation of Eolas into Forfás will create a structure in which the technological needs of firms can be better serviced.  Technology development is a vital part of company development and is something of which Irish firms are showing a growing awareness.</P>
    <P>This was demonstrated by the huge demand for the new Structural Funds supported industry research and development scheme launched by my Department last year.  Under our plans for the next round of Structural Funds, Forbairt will continue to respond to industry demands for research and development support and this is entirely in line with the capability development approach which I want Forbairt to take up with vigour.  As I have said, the integration of Eolas into Forbairt will bring science and technology very much into the spotlight, not relegate it to the shadows.  But I am totally committed to extracting the maximum value from the entire industrial development budget over the short, medium and long term.  This means that science and technology activities will be subject to the same scrutiny and performance appraisal as the other programmes of the agencies.  Expenditure on science and technology is necessary; but it is equally necessary that such expenditure should provide value for money.</P>
    <P>These sentiments are also in line with the recommendations of Culliton that my Department's science and technology activities should be fully responsive to the needs of industry.  However, I am aware that the views of Culliton on science and technology were interpreted in some quarters as being too concerned with short term gain at the expense of a long term strategy.  Such a view would be inconsistent with the need to take a strategic long term perspective on the development of industry and is not based on the facts.  Under Forbairt, longer-term science and technology <Col N="1736" /> initiatives, such as the programmes in advanced technology which are harnessing the capability of our third level institutions, will continue to be supported and there is no question of this longer-term perspective being disregarded.</P>
    <P>On the subject of policy and evaluation, I must return again to the role of Forfás.  Eolas is presently undertaking a comprehensive programme of science and technology evaluation which is providing a valuable input to the policy formulation process in my Department. This activity will now be integrated into Forfás and will continue.  The same is true of the broader science and technology policy functions which are incorporated in the Science and Technology Act, 1987. In particular, I would refer to the important horizontal role which Eolas exercises in relation to international programmes such as the EC framework programme. This function extends across a number of Departments and agencies and I am anxious that it should continue within the Forfás context.</P>
    <P>When speaking of interdepartmental co-ordination, I would like to address the role of Forfás in relation to trade and marketing.  Much has been made of the fact that An Bord Tráchtála (ABT) has not been merged with Forbairt.  In the Programme for Government we stated our intention to establish the new Department of Tourism and Trade which would bring a new dynamic to this area. The retention of An Bord Tráchtála as a separate body reporting to the Minister for Tourism and Trade is consistent with our belief that export development and trade promotion should be the main focus of that organisation.  As far as the question of incorporating some elements of An Bord Tráchtála into Forbairt is concerned, I have reviewed this matter carefully in consultation with the Minister for Tourism and Trade.  Our conclusion was that any division of the trade and marketing functions of An Bord Tráchtála would simply lead to a damaging sub-optimisation of both elements.  Such an outcome would not serve well the objectives of industrial development or trade development.  The need for co-ordination <Col N="1737" /> remains, however, and this will be achieved in the first instance through the mechanism of Forfás.  To assist in this process the chief executive of An Bord Tráchtála will be a member of the Forfás board.</P>
    <P>In addition, there already exists close co-operation in the regions between An Bord Tráchtála and the IDA-Eolas personnel. The IDA's Irish industry directorate has on-going liaison with An Bord Tráchtála as part of its activity in assisting indigenous companies to structure and implement company development plans. This activity involves day-to-day interaction between IDA and An Bord Tráchtála project executives at headquarters and in the regions.  This &ldquo;on the ground&rdquo; interaction will be complemented by Forfás which will work to ensure that common criteria and negotiating guidelines are applied by both companies when dealing with their client firms.  With these arrangements in place I am confident that industry will continue to be fully supported in respect of its marketing requirements at the level of the individual firm.</P>
    <P>In the training area, the main recommendation of Culliton was that there should be a clear division of roles within FÁS so as to ensure that the distinct training needs of those in work and those out of work were properly catered for. This recommendation has been addressed by the establishment of a new industry division within FÁS.  The objective of this division is to improve the quality of training for Irish business and to increase the amount of training undertaken.  The division will work closely with industry and business to identify training requirements and assist in the design and implementation of training programmes. It will be assisted in its work by statutory and non-statutory industrial training committees in areas such as engineering, clothing and footwear and chemicals and allied products.  The new division is in the process of commissioning studies in all major industrial sectors to further assist it in catering for the training needs of industry.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the FÁS industry <Col N="1738" /> division will create a clear focal point for interaction between FÁS and the new bodies established under this Act.  Legislative provision already exists under the Industrial Development Act, 1986 for liaison between the IDA and FÁS and this will continue to apply to the new structures.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, the development of the food industry is of key importance.  I have discussed the new agency arrangements with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and we have agreed that the current situation where the Irish industry division of IDA is responsible for all food companies, regardless of ownership, will continue to obtain in the new structures.  That is to say that Forbairt will have sole responsibility for the development of the food industry.  I will also be ensuring that the industry is represented on the board of Forfás.  The Bill also provides for a general enabling provision to allow the type of co-ordination that I have proposed between An Bord Tráchtála and Forfás to be extended to any new marketing body which may be established in the food area.</P>
    <P>Turning to matters of practical administration, I have been anxious to guard against the creation of additional layers of bureaucracy when establishing the new structures.  It is my intention, therefore, that central administrative functions relating to areas such as finance, land and personnel for the agencies will be centralised in Forfás.  This approach will allow for the smoothest possible transition to the new structures and will minimise the administrative overheads and costs in the operation of the new bodies.</P>
    <P>As I have been stressing to the House, the plans for agency restructuring which I am presenting here today are part of a concerted effort by the Government to bring a spirit of enterprise and progress to all areas of economic development with a view to tackling the pressing problems of unemployment.  In a related area, the establishment of the county enterprise boards will help to bridge a gap in the current support system for local enterprise initiatives.  That is why I have <Col N="1739" /> placed such emphasis on the county enterprise boards having clear enterprise and job creation objectives in those business areas not already covered by Forbairt. The operation of these boards at county level will be complemented by Forbairt's industrial development role at regional level.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to ensure that the proposed administrative arrangements for the new boards are kept simple and non-bureaucratic.  The support team will be headed by a county enterprise officer who will act as facilitator, directing individual projects or local community enterprise initiatives to the existing State agencies where this is appropriate.  Thus, we will ensure that the county enterprise system picks up those worthy projects which might otherwise slip through the net but at the same time ensure that the activities of Forbairt and other agencies are not duplicated.</P>
    <P>Indeed, on the contrary, the county enterprise boards will draw on the skills resident in Forbairt wherever possible. In particular, the expertise which the IDA has developed in project appraisal techniques will be available to the boards through the presence of a Forbairt specialist on the evaluation committee which each board will be establishing. These committees will consider all project proposals and will make recommendations on the most appropriate degree and form of assistance for projects, having regard to the quality, local relevance and cost-effectiveness of the proposals.</P>
    <P>In devising the structures and organisation for the county enterprise boards, I have sought to ensure that their operations will be consistent with the need for a flexible yet comprehensive approach promoting local enterprise and economic development.  The new boards will, by working closely with Forbairt and other relevant agencies at regional and national level, help to develop a local initiatives approach which generates community support for integrated efforts to promote economic development through making maximum use of local resources.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1740" /> I have mentioned before that many detailed powers and functions of the new bodies will continue to be provided for in the new legislation.  I should also mention that the legislation covering SFADCo and Údarás na Gaeltachta, of course, will remain in force and these bodies will continue to exercise their regional development remit within the context of the new structures.</P>
    <P>Forbairt will actively pursue a regional development role.  In the case of Forbairt, each region will continue to exercise autonomy in the administration of the small business programme.  In this regard, each regional board makes its own decisions on grant applications within the context of overall sectoral development policy.  The regional offices have a wide range of functions in respect of small businesses.  In addition to the area of grant assistance and business advice they also maintain close links with entrepreneurs and industries in the regions, identifying and nurturing development opportunities.</P>
    <P>The new structures will assist closer integration between the business and technology services currently provided in the regions.  In recent years Eolas has considerably increased its regional activities in areas such as technology acquisition, graduate placement and technology audits.  Through its regional technology transfer officers it has been building up a hands-on relationship with firms and has been compiling an inventory of the technology needs of these firms.  One of the essential shortcomings of many Irish firms is that they rely too much on their existing products and therefore lose out to competitors whose product life cycles are shorter.  The integration of IDA and Eolas staff into Forbairt will enable deficiencies like this to be addressed much more effectively, with Eolas staff identifying product and technology opportunities and IDA staff providing access to the business know-how and sources of finance.</P>
    <P>The combined objectives of Forfás, Forbairt and the county enterprise boards will be to actively foster and promote the creation of new enterprise and <Col N="1741" /> the growth and consolidation of existing indigenous firms.  This is the central task upon which we must focus our energies and concerted efforts.</P>
    <P>I propose to turn now to the detailed structure and content of the Bill.  At the outset, I should say that the central purpose of this Bill is to enable the new agency structures to be put in place in a rapid but orderly way.  The Bill, therefore, does not seek to reinvent the wheel. As I have already emphasised, the point at issue is not whether the established agencies are doing the right thing but whether the existing structures within which they are operating allow them to optimise their approach and deliver their programmes in a way which best benefits firms.  Against this background, the House will, I hope, appreciate that the activities of the agencies, for the most part, are adequately catered for in the existing <i>corpus</i> of legislation.</P>
    <P>This is not to say, of course, that the creation of Forfás, Forbairt and IDA Ireland will not give rise to innovative new approaches to industrial development which will require to be given substance and power through legislation in the future.  If that is the case, and I expect it will be, then I assure the House that I am ready and willing to bring forward the appropriate proposals as and when the need arises.  In the meantime, the Bill before the House is the first step towards a new and more clearly focused strategy for industrial development.</P>
    <P>A number of detailed points arise in respect of the Bill which I now propose to highlight.  On the question of the repeals referred to in section 4 and in the Third Schedule, I have not sought to remove any of the existing IDA or Eolas functions.  The purpose of the repeals listed is to remove inconsistencies arising out of the merging of IDA and Eolas within the new structures.</P>
    <P>In section 5 I propose to fix the establishment day of the new agencies by order so as to allow some flexibility in catering for the logistical arrangements which will require to be made on foot of <Col N="1742" /> the transition.  Sections 6 to 9 deal with the functions of Forfás and the agencies. It is consistent with the spirit of this enabling legislation that these have been stated in general terms.  In order to provide flexibility, the existing functions of the IDA and Eolas will be vested in Forfás but, for the most part, will be exercised by the two agencies subject to my direction.  I assure the House that there is no question of Forfás acting as a super agency and, in this regard, I would draw the attention of the House to the fact that the provision of grants to companies by Forfás is specifically prohibited by section 9.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides for the normal powers of delegation of functions and for the constitution of committees or other bodies for the purposes of exercising the functions thus delegated.  In this regard, I would recall to the House the recommendations of the Moriarty task force in relation to the need for a separate body for industrial standards.  This arises out of the need to separate the certification activities of the National Standards Authority of Ireland from the consultancy activities of Eolas.  I propose, therefore, to constitute the NSAI as an autonomous body attached to Forfás for this purpose. A similar arrangement will be made for the Irish Accreditation Board which accredits industrial testing laboratories, if required.</P>
    <P>Returning to the question of autonomy for the agencies, I would refer the House to section 11 where it is provided that Forfás and each agency will have separate grants-in-aid, thus ensuring their financial autonomy.  In section 13, the provision of the 1986 Act for carrying out a review of industrial performance has been restated and expanded to include a review of industrial policy.  This is in line with the recommendations of the Culliton report that the policy activities of my Department should be strengthened and is one of a number of initiatives which I am currently examining in this regard.</P>
    <P>The transitional provisions in the Bill dealt with in sections 14 to 21 provide for the normal transfers from the existing agencies to the new structures <Col N="1743" /> and for the dissolution of the IDA and Eolas.  The First Schedule &mdash; Forfás and the Agencies &mdash; provides for the appointment of boards of Forfás and each agency, for the conditions of office applying to board members and for other matters such as the provisions for annual reports and accounts.  This schedule contains the normal provisions applying to the members of the existing IDA.</P>
    <P>The Second Schedule deals primarily with matters relating to the staffing of Forfás.  In that regard I would ask the House to note my concern that the minimum disruption be caused to staff of IDA and Eolas in the establishment of the new structures.  The Bill provides that all staff of the new agencies will hold their contracts with Forfás but will be seconded to the agencies as appropriate.  Staff will effectively be able to move from one agency to another bringing their experience and expertise with them.  This interchange of staff will create a dynamic open and pro-active culture required for the development of industry in the nineties and beyond.</P>
    <P>This Bill forms part of an overall long term strategy for tackling the industrial development and employment generation problems facing us.  As far as the agency structures for industrial development are concerned, it will usher in an era which will be marked by a greater clarity of mission and a strengthened emphasis on catering for the real needs of indigenous firms.  It will also promote better value for the taxpayer in the moneys expended on attracting overseas investment and will maximise the benefits to be derived from linkages between the overseas and indigenous sectors.  All of this will lead to a new dynamic in Irish firms and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will resist the temptation to go into the matter of the deplorable mess this Government has made of taxation policy.  In the industrial sector, where we are trying to create jobs, it costs £2.30 to put £1 in a worker's pocket <Col N="1744" /> and, when everything is taken into account, many people on low pay are worse off in employment than unemployed. It is impossible to take seriously a strategy for employment promotion in the industrial sector that has aggravated that position in the 1993 budget despite all the recommendations of Culliton and others in that regard.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, I will devote my attention to this Bill.  As the Government has restricted the time limit for debating such matters, we must concentrate on the Bill before us today.  A great deal of money and energy will be wasted in implementing the reorganisation planned in this Bill.  It will increase the complexity of the industrial support system instead of simplifying it and it is a step backwards from the main objective of building up the capacity of firms to create employment in Ireland.  This legislation will result in agencies taking their eye off the ball as they jockey for positions in the new line-up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill before us is a political compromise in a struggle for power between Ministers McCreevy and Quinn.  It does not reflect the needs of an effective industrial policy and to illustrate that we need only recall some of Culliton's recommendations seeking to simplify our approach to industrial and business development.  Where Culliton suggested two industrial agencies, we are to have six.  He proposed that the specialist agency for indigenous development should integrate marketing, design, product technology and other development supports under one roof, but this is not to be the case.  Instead, An Bord Tráchtála is to be split off from the indigenous agency, which is totally in contradiction of both Culliton and Moriarity. Indeed, in five separate places in two pages of his report Moriarty emphasises the need to have such a degree of integration with An Bord Tráchtála and the valuable marketing and trading support it would offer to indigenous industry. I am glad to note that the Minister at least deleted from his speech his claimed endorsement by Culliton and Moriarty for that proposal which he made in the <Col N="1745" /> Seanad.  Where Culliton recommended that there should be one Minister in charge who would take a firm hold of industrial policy, we are to have policy divided between two Ministers.  We are to have agencies, agencies to mind agencies and agencies to pull together Ministers who are pulling apart.</P>
    <P>In AD 66 Caius Petronius, whom I consider a very wise writer, stated:</P>
    <P>We trained hard, but it seemed that every time we were beginning to form up into teams, we would be reorganised. I was to learn later in life that we tend to meet any situation by reorganising, and a wonderful method it can be for creating the illusion of progress while producing confusion, inefficiency, and demoralisation.</P>
    <P>As testified by this Bill, little has changed since then.</P>
    <P>I must ask the Minister to seriously reconsider his strategy.  He seems to be more concerned about giving the appearance of change than with the substance of change, which is necessary.  I will list five critical issues of business development strategy for Ireland in the future. To what degree do we continue to rely on foreign industry?  Do we cut grants and make a decisive shift from grants to equity support for our indigenous industry? To what extent do we now abandon manufacturing as the core of our employment strategy?  How do we achieve genuine subsidiarity in our approach to support for business development?  On none of those critical issues does the Minister give the impression that he has a thought-out position and a strategy which he proposes to adopt.  Instead, we see the Minister flying by the seat of his pants, announcing decisions first and groping around for the rationale afterwards.</P>
    <P>Let us take the example of foreign industry.  Before we set up a dedicated agency for supporting foreign industry we must have far greater clarity on the policy the Government intends to pursue.  The Minister made a revealing reference to this in his speech.  He stated that the point at issue was not whether the established agencies are doing the <Col N="1746" /> right thing but, rather, whether the existing structures within which they are operating are allowing them to optimise their approach and deliver their programmes in a way which best benefits firms.  We cannot decide whether the structures of those agencies are right until the Minister decides what it is he wants them to do, and manifestly we have not done this.</P>
    <P>For example, we must have clarity in the foreign industry area.  The IDA is currently paying 66 per cent more in grant aid to create a job in an overseas industry than in the indigenous sector.  When asked about this in the Dáil the Minister could offer no reason other than the competitive bidding with agencies from other countries.  We must seriously question why we should give a foreign industrialist 66 per cent more grant aid to create a job than an Irish industrialist.  We must bear in mind that foreign companies source a far smaller proportion of their industrial materials in Ireland &mdash; 31 per cent compared to 72 per cent by Irish companies. We must bear in mind also that foreign companies devote a lower proportion of their sales to either Irish wages or bought-in Irish services.  Foreign companies are more profitable but repatriate their profits in substantial measure.  Equally, foreign companies have generally not brought their product development capacity to Ireland and are vulnerable to the winds of change which occur in their trading markets.</P>
    <P>Culliton's critical proposal in this area of policy was that the industrial grant budget for supporting foreign industry must be squeezed, that it must be systematically reduced.  In contrast the IDA has been systematically increasing the share of funding to foreign industry.  It has been increased by six points in the past five years to a level of 63 per cent of industrial supports.  The Minister should tell us today what policy the agency will pursue and whether it will have a shift of resources away from it.  There is no point in setting up agencies and then wondering what they should do.  Naturally, each agency will try to claim as much of the action as possible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1747" /> The Culliton report recommends a decisive shift from grants to equity; but when asked in the Dáil yesterday about this matter, the Minister expressed the belief that this was in fact happening.  The reality is totally different.  Equity investment represents only 6 per cent of IDA investment at present and this is borne out by the Moriarty report.  We must bear in mind that NADCORP has been abolished.  The amount of equity investment being undertaken by the State in industrial development at present is declining; it has decreased from £10 million to £6 million in the past two years for which we have recorded figures.</P>
    <P>Culliton was very decisive in this area. He envisaged the IDA becoming an aggressive venture capital organisation. He said it should be prepared to take as much as a 60 per cent stake in companies if necessary.  He recommended board representation by the IDA and a separate division for seed capital.  The Minister should state whether this is the proposed approach.  Is this what Forbairt will be doing when it is independently established? The Minister confused me yesterday. He expressed very warm support for equity involvement by the IDA; he deplored the passing of NADCORP but did not say he would reverse the policy in these agencies.  It is time to indicate a strategy.  Let us have the strategy first and then decide if this is the vehicle for executing it.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the third critical issue, the question of the future of manufacturing. There is a very real question as to whether we should dramatically shift our focus from the manufacturing sector as the centre of our employment strategy. Culliton rightly questioned the value of the £600 million spent each year on industrial support.  He observed that only 65 per cent of proposed jobs were achieved at the peak by industries establishing in Ireland and that by the seventh year employment had fallen to just 42 per cent of the target they set when they got grant aid.  He concluded that there was no robust evaluation of the success or value of the grant support programme, <Col N="1748" /> still a critical question.  A recent FÁS study showed that over a five year period we can expect to have only 12,000 extra people at work in manufacturing.  During that time we will have spent £3,000 million in trying to support manufacturing industry when one takes in not just the IDA, SFADCo, Udarás and FÁS budgets in different areas but the £150 million that Culliton estimated is available through tax breaks and other supports. I will not do the obvious calculation of dividing the £3,000 million by the 12,000 to come up with the figure. It is just mind boggling.  We are talking about millions of pounds per job.  The Minister has the knowledge and supports, perhaps he could do the calculation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Deputy's equation is flawed I will not do the arithmetic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not pretending the equation is not flawed.  I am trying to illustrate the scale of expenditure if we continue the strategy of spending £3,000 million of taxpayers' money and at the end of five years have 12,000 extra jobs. It must be seriously questioned.  Culliton questioned whether the money we were putting in was needed.  These figures should stop us in our tracks.  We should be asking why we have heaped tax burdens on the service sector which is clearly the only sector promising growth in employment.  FÁS anticipates 63,000 extra jobs, five times the employment growth expected from manufacturing. We seem to have learned nothing from Government strategy in this area.  We are asking services to bear 21 per cent VAT and 21 per cent PRSI on their very high labour content.  We are asking them to bear four times the rate of business tax and hoping they will find it easy to create employment.  It is against the odds that they will create 63,000 jobs.  The money allocated to support services from Bord Fáilte and the IDA in the international service sector is a tiny fraction of the budget, less than 10 per cent of the IDA budget and, about £3,000 per prospective <Col N="1749" /> job, compared to the hundreds of millions of pounds in the manufacturing sector.  This issue should be seriously addressed.  We should be looking for a decisive shift in this Bill from reliance on manufacturing to support tradeable services.  That should be the core of this Bill but it is not and has not been mentioned by the Minister.</P>
      <P>The fourth issue I want to address is subsidiarity.  I very strongly believe that there is great scope in Ireland for &ldquo;bottom up&rdquo; strategies, we should support initiatives from the bottom up and find innovative ways of reinforcing that support.  However, the county enterprise boards are an <i>ad hoc</i> response.  Instead of wiping the slate clean of a flawed proposal from the previous Government the Minister has tried to limp along with the same policy.  The proposal was not guided by an assessment of how successful regional development could be achieved. No one has convinced me that the 36 bodies which propose splitting Dublin into five different areas are the proper vehicles for regional development.  That is not the way to go about it.  There has never been an overall strategy for regional development which would underpin this as a sensible step forward. Culliton rightly said that a lot of the devolved power should be to regional bodies and regional authorities where there is an ability to assess infrastructure for a region and take a broader view of what will happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend the Minister for trimming down the extraordinary original proposal, but he has still not changed or reassessed policy.  His recent announcement regarding the arrangements for appointing 450 board members was made before he decided the boards' policy.  His statement gave no details of powers such boards will have to allocate grants.  It did not give any idea of how their results will be judged.  It did not set out a system of clear, democratic accountability for money spent and work undertaken. There has been no real consultation with the communities and experts on regional policy who shape effective regional strategy.  There will not be a Dáil <Col N="1750" /> debate on their establishment and yet these bodies are to be entrusted with the spending of millions of pounds of taxpayers' money.  This is another serious case in which the Minister, under pressure to be seen to be doing something, announced a decision without having taken care to decide the new policy strategy.</P>
    <P>In the four critical policy areas I have listed there seems to be a depressing continuity of existing policy.  Even worse, there seems to be a new set of political lamp posts against which our unfortunate public servants in industrial agencies have to cock their legs.  I expected from the Minister a programme of radical change in policy but we are getting more of the same, which Culliton and many others have shown has not served us well.</P>
    <P>Even if one accepted the proposed reorganisation in this Bill, there are surprising gaps.  Culliton clearly called for proper regional structure within Forbairt which would embrace SFADCo and Údarás na Gaeltachta.  It is not clear how these will be linked as they are not mentioned in the Bill.  The Minister seems to suggest that they are in some way hidden in the structure but it is not clear whether they will be controlled by Forbairt in their execution of policy or influenced by Forfás in the co-ordination of policy. They do not warrant a mention in either place.</P>
    <P>In the area of science and technology the Minister is at pains to try to damp down fears about the downgrading of science and technology. One of the core issues which came up yesterday is that the Government has taken the opportunity of using EC funds to cut its budget. EC funds were there for additionality. The thrust of the EC's plan was to see Ireland make a new effort in research and development to support the growth area from industry to come, the seed potatoes, as I said yesterday.  Instead the Government has taken this short-sighted view.  When it saw money on the table it grabbed it and put it into its pocket to find something else to do with it. Additionality was always a part of this <Col N="1751" /> and is even more critical in the research and development area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a 50 per cent increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a slogan.  We are not on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; today; we have some time.  The reason for the 50 per cent increase is that the EC has supported a programme which did not include any State aid.  The Government has taken the opportunity to cut its budget.  On Friday we will have time to discuss this when dealing with the Estimates. The Estimates show a cut of 25 per cent, 27 per cent when account is taken of the micro-electronic line.  That is the reality.  The Government is spending less and the EC is making up for its shortfall as well as trying to achieve growth.  That is not sensible.  Culliton criticised this and in his report stated:</P>
      <P>We are concerned that the formulation and implementation of industrial related S and T policy has not been clearly defined.  The present situation for example, where some industry related S and T programmes are developed and administered by Eolas directly and some initiated by the Department ... is unsatisfactory and a cause of confusion.</P>
      <P>That matter has not been addressed in the Bill.  There is not a clear statement that the Department's S and T initiatives will be pushed out and put into the industrial sector, where decisions in that regard can be made.  That matter should be included and perhaps the Minister will return to this issue later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to consider if fundamentally the split between domestic and foreign industries makes sense.  Fine Gael and I seriously question the sense of separating foreign industry from that of indigenous companies.  Judging from the existing position, higher grant aid is allocated to foreign companies and the separation is likely to make the uneven treatment even worse.  The new agency will be trying to prove its prowess in the competitive <Col N="1752" /> bidding the Minister describes and will be trying to land mobile foreign investment. When the Government examines those split agencies, the indigenous agency will have a much lower success rate on paper. The Government should be spending more and not, as is now the case, less per job.  People will be of the view that supporting indigenous companies is not worth the long haul and that it is best to opt for the short fix and support the IDA. If the Minister does not make a policy decision to endorse the squeeze on the foreign section, coming near to an election he will want to make many announcements in order to provide the quick fix the people demand.  Such announcements will relate to foreign industry, and it will not matter if only 42 per cent of the jobs promised are realised.  That is where the pressure will tend to be.  The split will make that a more likely outcome.</P>
    <P>Culliton in his report advocated the need to move away from the question of ownership of companies.  The critical issue for him is strengthening the capabilities of firms operating in Ireland and developing their integration into the Irish economy.  The logic of that is to develop industrial policy based on functional divisions and not on divisions based on ownership.  If Culliton and the industrial review were faced with two separate agencies &mdash; for example, the IDA and Forbairt &mdash; I would not be surprised if Culliton would recommend that because of the diminishing significance of ownership those agencies should be amalgamated to provide a coherent approach.  It must be questioned if reorganisation is taking place in a way that makes sense.  The Minister stated: &ldquo;The fact is that the current agency structures are inhibiting the most efficient and effective development of industry.&rdquo;  I do not consider that fact has ever been established. I have never seen any analysis of why indigenous industry has failed to respond to the support available to it.  I am not aware that anyone has claimed that the reason this is the case is that the IDA was not split.</P>
    <Col N="1753" />
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely if you are claiming the IDA is only interested in foreigners and not interested in&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>They are claims, but I would expect analysis, justifications and sensible explanations from the Minister and not just an undertaking to establish agencies because it was suggested in a report that this might be an improvement. There is a need for serious analysis to consider if such agencies will work. The Minister rightly said that we need a separate package for the indigenous sector, but he has not said what the package should be or why the split in the IDA is necessary to put the package in place. It is a reflection on the Minister's Department if insufficient attention has been given to the indigenous sector.  Why did his Department allow the position to evolve that it did not have specific measurable policy objectives so that it could identify that it had gone down the wrong road and that our indigenous sector was being strangled?  I would rather the Minister state that he will not accept the IDA's policies and that he will change the policy and issue specific policy directives to that agency.  The mistake is being made of putting the restructuring of the agencies before deciding on policy. It would be better if both problems were resolved by addressing the policy defects in regard to the agencies and not changing their structure, which involves major settling-in problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that clustering developments, joint ventures and sub-supply are critical factors if we wish to strengthen our manufacturing base.  A coherent policy in this area will be more difficult after the split.  Forfás will have to put back together what this Bill has torn apart.  It will be more difficult once the new structures are in place to have a coherent policy on cluster development and a coherent strategy on joint ventures, sub-supply and linkages.  The two agencies are being pulled apart.  The hope is that Forfás, which has no directive power, will be able to put those agencies back together again.  Forfás will have to struggle hard to get the information and <Col N="1754" /> scope to put those agencies back together.</P>
    <P>Culliton in his report said that companies that had their head office functions in Ireland should be treated as indigenous. It would appear that his suggestion will not be endorsed in this Bill.  How can the position which might emerge from this new arrangement be justified, that a foreign owned industry, for example, a development agency, could gain access to capital grants on the basis of competitive rates with other countries while an Irish company with the same idea would be denied those grants and have to obtain funds elsewhere?  A distinction based on ownership is no longer meaningful, given the change in business today.  Policy changes are necessary.  The Minister's attitude in regard to the food industry is revealing and in his speech he said that the position as it stands in the food sector should be maintained.  The food sector is not dramatically different from other sectors.  Indeed, the food sector is perhaps a stronger sector and what appears to be within reach in the food sector should be emulated in other sectors. Instead, we are providing for a different way of handling the food sector.  The food sector is the sector that has the strongest indigenous base.</P>
    <P>The best industrial policy for Ireland would be one that extended to include all services, including tourism, and not confine itself to manufacturing.  That is the type of change I would like to see. The test should be that firms can create new business based on new foreign earnings. There should be a much broader consolidation of industrial agencies, including agencies like BIM, CBF and An Bord Tráchtála.</P>
    <P>By the end of this year Ireland will have a most bewildering panoply of more than 55 agencies disbursing State funds.  Regional authorities may continue to be established by the Government. However, strategy in regard to the critical issues facing us today is not in place.  Policy measures are being adapted without adequate regard to their consistency and without a clear and unified policy agenda.  Against a <Col N="1755" /> background of 300,000 unemployed, this is unforgivable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The premise established before the Culliton report, the Moriarty task force and other publications was that the Minister of the day had a clear understanding that there were too many agencies with overlapping responsibilities competing with each other.  This caused enormous bureaucracy and led to difficulties for people getting the information and support they needed, whether such support was required financially or in an advisory capacity.  It was not necessary for Culliton to tell us that was the premise or for Moriarty to emphasise it.  It was understood for the last number of years that something had to be done about it.  That is the base from which we should be starting and while the Minister subscribed clearly to that on many occasions in this House or at committee meetings, and had a very definite grasp of the difficulties and the changes he wanted to bring about, based on the most recent reports, he should have gone in the direction of reducing substantially the layers of bureaucracy involved in the administration of the agencies, thereby creating a target number of agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is what was agreed by all but in the context of the Bill before us today that is not what will happen.  Indeed, even in practical terms it will be worse than it is in theoretical terms.  It is in the practical sense that we required change.  On my reading of this Bill, and comparing it to the other reports we have received, I am greatly concerned about its practical application.  The creation of Forfás over Forbairt and the IDA is an unnecessary structure.  Despite the Minister's speech this morning, which was delivered in very carefully chosen language, I remain unconvinced of the need for Forfás. Indeed, it will create a super-structure, which is what the Minister said he did not want to do and which will inevitably be the controlling dead hand over the activities of Forbairt and IDA Ireland.  For this reason the strength of authority will, by <Col N="1756" /> perception and practicality, rest with Forfás.  Though in theory autonomous, the IDA and Forbairt will inevitably find themselves subject to the control and influence of the board of Forfás.  That concerns me and I do not see it bringing any direct benefits to the operation of Forbairt or the IDA.  I cannot see what contribution it will make to making those agencies &mdash; one concerned with indigenous industry and the other with foreign industry &mdash; dynamic in their role of bringing various projects, either international or indigenous, to fruition.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that we are creating competing structures by setting up these agencies in the manner outlined here today.  Human nature being what it is, competition is inevitable and they will use their position of power and influence to promote their <i>raison d'etre</i> as opposed to the creation of jobs, the enhancing of industry and encouraging the growth of industry.  We have witnessed this in the past and the Minister is well aware, as are all Members in this House, of the type of propaganda which can occur and the tendency of these agencies to protect the agency at all costs.  That was the first principle: the agency must survive irrespective of whether it is doing the right job.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Bruton, I found it extraordinary that the Minister would say:</P>
    <P>... the point at issue is not whether the established agencies are doing the right thing, but, rather, whether the existing structures within which they are operating are allowing them to optimise their approach and deliver their programme in a way which best benefits firms.</P>
    <P>The second part of that statement is fine but there appears to be a contradiction between the two.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that but I do not <Col N="1757" /> think one can divorce the two, particularly in the light of what the Minister has stated today.  Surely we should be considering whether they are doing the right thing and whether they are delivering the policy to do the right thing.  That is the context in which I see this issue. I understand the Minister's point about structures but I am concerned greatly about the thought processes that actually put those sentences together because it is a very dangerous viewpoint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that the way it is expanded upon there is extremely unhelpful.</P>
      <P>The message that this Bill is sending forth from this House today is that once again we have tremendous ability as politicians to create consistently an enormous number of structures which address the theory of what we believe to be necessary. But we fail, as we have failed, particularly in the last decade, to create the required jobs.  The theory does not match what is happening in practice.  The plethora of agencies, the part amalgamation and the overlapping of these agencies is a further weakness in the structures that are being created here today.</P>
      <P>The question of indigenous versus foreign industry concerns me greatly.  I do not subscribe to the view that it is Irish industry versus foreign investment.  They are both crucial elements in the development of our economy in a broader sense as well as in creating jobs.  The fact that over the years we may not have obtained the best results from our efforts in those areas does not negate the need for continuing growth and particularly the availability of mobile investment.  With the globalisation of markets and companies, particularly manufacturing plants, seeking strategic locations and carrying out marketing and research we must play our part and I believe the Minister agrees with that.  It is nonsensical to suggest that we should not continue to attract foreign industry to this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1758" /> Because of the globalisation of markets it is absolutely crucial that we continue to seek as much as possible of that investment because it is investment which is legitimately creating jobs here.  I know we have had some unfortunate experiences with companies who came here, availed of the grant aid and, after a period of time, disappeared.  I do not believe that was their intention; that is the way the markets went and we must live with it the same as everybody else. It is in the area of grants versus equity that the problem can be addressed so as to overcome the obvious difficulties that caused great anger within the trade union movement, among employers and right across the board, in regard to how these funds were perceived to have been used, or abused, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>I agree that establishing an agency to overlook the development of indigenous industry and a separate agency to attract foreign industry here is correct.  My difficulty in this regard was the creation of Forfá over the other two.  It is clear, as the Minister said here some time ago, that there is a view among Irish entrepreneurs &mdash; I am not talking about high flying, successful people, but smaller business people who create 15 or 20 jobs, which are crucially important &mdash; that if a person goes to the IDA with a German or Dutch accent&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Or a Danish accent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or even a Danish accent, he is very welcome, is given the red carpet treatment.  The bureaucracy seems to disappear and the person is asked what he wants.  However, for an Irish person trying to set up a similar business there are all sorts of barriers in the way.  I disagree with my colleague in that I believe there is much evidence that this happens.  The fact that a task is given to an agency to deal specifically with the development of indigenous industry will be extremely helpful in expanding our economic base, with our ability to create jobs in the economy in Irish-led industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many industries which we create have the capacity to grow.  One does not need <Col N="1759" /> to be a massive employer to compete on an international market.  One of our failings is that when we reach a certain point we are loath to share part of our companies.  That attitude is endemic in the Irish psyche.  We must learn that when business grows to a certain size, to secure its future, we must look to outside investment, whether from within this island or outside it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It may come from within the staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>It may come from many areas.  Why should so many Irish pension funds invest in companies outside this country, sustaining jobs abroad?  I would like to see the day when almost all money invested in pension funds is put to work in this economy for the creation of jobs here.  That is of crucial importance.  We all know that there is a tremendous fund of money outside this country, creating and supporting jobs in other countries.</P>
      <P>As regards joint venture, Forbairt must work in conjunction with IDA Ireland in seeking potential investors in Irish companies.  As our market is limited many companies who fail in terms of ongoing development must look abroad for investment.  However due to their cost base and financial structures these companies do not have the capacity to make that move.  It is at that point that we need dedicated people to attract foreign investment.  Many indigenous Irish industries have failed due to a lack of proper advice or lack of courage to go into partnership with other industries.  I am talking now about industries right across the board in all sectors.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been an imbalance between direct support for foreign industry and for indigenous industry, and that matter must be fully addressed.  In a study carried out for the Progressive Democrats of medium-sized indigenous industries we were taken aback that the need for more grants was not top of the <Col N="1760" /> list &mdash; it was substantially down the list &mdash; but rather the cost structures that caused difficulties &mdash; in other words, the cost of renting property.  The cost of renting even an IDA owned property may be prohibitive.  We have made some strides in the area of telecommunications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is absolutely right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost base is the determining factor in creating and sustaining jobs.  Until such time as our taxation policy marries in with these areas we will not reap the benefit of consistent growth in employment creation and the sustaining of jobs.  Small indigenous companies wish to see these matters addressed in the first instance.</P>
      <P>Another matter that has been referred to is the possibility of equity investment to ensure seed capital for companies.  I recently spoke to companies who had negotiations with the IDA in this regard and I am confused, as are these companies, as to the criteria laid down for equity investment and the demands made by the IDA as to the requirements on companies in return for equity investment. The Minister should consider this matter.  There is confusion in the IDA in this regard and the message coming out to people trying to set up companies is by no means clear.  There should be clarity and consistency in this area so that the issue is quickly understood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Equity capital provided through State agencies should be circulated on an ongoing basis.  For example, if £500,000 is put into company X and £500,000 into company Y, as that £1 million percolates through the IDA and back into the system it could make £20 million.  This is a much better way forward than providing grants, which is dead money.  The State should not necessarily try to make profit from its equity.  If there is some benefit that would be welcome, but the money should circulate on a continuing basis.  As resources are scarce, the more we utilise and circulate money through industries the greater will be the return.  We must consider the maximising of available <Col N="1761" /> funding on an ongoing basis in those areas.  Another matter that must be considered by the Department is the abolition of grants.  It is not necessary to abolish all grants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is absolutely right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>There must be flexibility among experts in State agencies in attracting industries and helping them grow.  There should be a change from the grant mentality.  It is not legitimate to state that that will never exist again.  It must diminish in the types of funding available and that money could perhaps be used in better ways.  It cannot be removed totally from the agenda.</P>
      <P>A point that keeps cropping up is the question of the continuing decrease in employment creation in the manufacturing area.  Throughout the world the manufacturing base is consistently falling. The big job creator is the services sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a 10 per cent manufacturing tax and a 40 per cent tax for the service industries.  I do not suggest that the 40 per cent should be reduced to 10 per cent but the gap is too wide.  There is tremendous potential for growth in specific service areas.  There has been a growth in companies dealing with estates and processing VAT bills and all that sort of thing.  The services area is labour intensive and the banks need not necessarily get into this area.  The 40 per cent rate needs to be reconsidered with a view to creating an incentive for the services sector.  We must recognise the potential for job creation in that sector. In advance of the next budget the Minister will have to take a hard line in terms of the artificial barriers which taxation creates to creating sustainable employment. We can talk here and introduce legislation until the cows come home but the Minister more than anybody must recognise that the greatest barrier to employment creation is taxation.  The things we are dealing with will remain peripheral if the core issue of taxation is not tackled.  Not alone am I talking about <Col N="1762" /> personal taxation but about taxation in areas where companies can be created to give sustainable employment.</P>
    <P>I am unhappy with FAS.  That is not to say that there are not excellent people in the organisation.  I am sure my view represents the view of many politicians who deal with small industries and with people trying to deal with FÁS which has become one of the most bureaucratic self-perpetuating organisations ever.  I regret to say that, and it is not a reflection on individual talent in the organisation. What has happened with that organisation in the last number of years greatly distresses me.  People dealing with FÁS are equally distressed.  Hundreds of millions of pounds are available to be channelled through FÁS but we are not getting the best return for that money. Is that because much of it comes from Europe and we feel we do not have to be quite as concerned about how we spend it?  Recently I was approached by a small operator involved in selling computers. Over the last number of years computers and telecommunications equipment has become disposable so that a servicing sector in a small company is not needed. This operator was in the small end of the retail end of the business.  He does not have the business any more because now when a telephone or a computer breaks down people get a new one.  It became unnecessary in a small company to have full time maintenance staff.  The young man had never sought anything from the State and as his job had gone he decided to seek contracts from a number of small companies in the same position and set up his own maintenance company which would employ himself and two others. This 24-year old man went to FÁS. Because I could not believe their attitude I, too, got on to FÁS who confirmed that they would be delighted to help provided that the man signed on at the labour exchange for the next 13 weeks.  Words fail me.  This young man did not want the dole.  He wanted to earn his living but that £60 per week would have made an enormous difference in that it would enable him to buy petrol in order to get around in the car.  The man had not the <Col N="1763" /> money but all contracts had to be moved straight away once the original company closed down.  The man lost his opportunity and he is deflated by the attitude of the State.  He considers that perhaps the State wants him on the dole.  I am using this case as an example.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>This man wanted to earn his living and create a few jobs but the State said, &ldquo;sorry, we want to pay you to do nothing for 13 weeks and then we will look at your case&rdquo;.  That is the reality of some of the FÁS schemes and how they operate.  I regret it.</P>
      <P>An Bord Bia should be under the auspices of the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  It should not be in the Department of Agriculture.  The Government should forget about setting up this body if it is to be in the Department of Agriculture.  It must be a dedicated specific marketing organisation for the agricultural sector in its broadest sense. We should not have the poacher and the gamekeeper in the same organisation. There is a legitimate battle to be fought by the Department of Enterprise and Employment who will be supported in this House in the best interests of the food and agricultural industry.  I wonder why we needed the agency structure which the Minister has outlined.  A point that has been mentioned is that the Department of Industry and Commerce, as it was for decades, failed to be the policy maker.</P>

I compliment the former Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, who saw this and began to institute the necessary changes.  We agree on who should be the policy maker for the foreseeable future; it should lie within the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fair to say that never in the history of Irish industrial policy has there been so much hype and expectation surrounding an industrial Bill.  Two successive Governments have contrived to cloud their appalling management of our economy on the basis that implementation of the Culliton report recommendations was just around the corner. The impression has been fostered that the Culliton proposals somehow are a panacea for our endemic unemployment problems, a claim which the authors of that report never made.  Government Ministers and backbenchers have learned the defensive mantra that they are committed to Culliton.  Asked what they are doing about the unemployment situation, invariably the answer is that they are implementing Culliton.</P>
      <P>Apart from the budget this is the first legislative measure introduced by this Government that purports to address the jobs crisis.  However, anything that could be remotely associated with Culliton has been claimed by the Government as yet another decision implementing Culliton, even when this was purely coincidental. Even when it was not a matter of coincidence, such as the proposed revised telephone charges &mdash; the euphemistic term used was rebalancing of telephone charges &mdash; it was purported to be the implementation of another Culliton decision.  I read the Moriarty report very carefully and I am satisfied it does not do anything except anticipate the EC directive on competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Eighteen months since the publication of the Culliton report this Bill does not even mention jobs policy.  The Minister has said &mdash; I think to the amazement of the public watching or listening &mdash; that the Bill was not intended to address <Col N="1765" /> policy.  I will return to that point later. Notwithstanding the delay, the Bill is a rushed effort characterised by compromise between the partners in Government and running counter to Culliton's proposals.  This is not a Bill to simplify, rationalise and render more effective, as Culliton recommended, but rather one that will authorise the creation of three State agencies where previously there had been one.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the Bill was reshaped in the Christmas spirit of good will and compromise.  The outcome is a panoply of agencies, excessive bureaucracy and the roots of a new conflict between the wish to locate the industrial effort within a single Government Department and the creation of a new Department which serves only to fragment that effort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The crucial function of marketing is to be split from the other functions of industrial development.  The marketing board.  An Bord Tráchtála, will report <Col N="1766" /> to the Minister for Tourism and Trade. Forbairt, the agency to stimulate the indigenous drive, will report to the Minister for Enterprise and Employment. This is an unfortunate and unnecessary division.  It appears that the Government is destined to repeat its mistake in the pivotal food industry.  Attention has been drawn to the Minister's comments on that.  Forbairt will have the development of the food industry as a key objective. However, the promotional function is to be allocated to yet another board, this time under the aegis of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, to be titled An Bord Bia.  I could not agree more strongly with what Deputy Culliton&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is taking the mantra much too far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>One wonders why I made that slip.  I could not agree more with Deputy Cullen when he said that, if we must have a board to promote our products in the agricultural area or specifically in the food industry, the last place it ought be located is within the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  I am thoroughly in the Senator Feargal Quinn camp on his comments on the recent report.  If this becomes the preserve of the producers in the industry it will undermine the entire thrust toward industrial development because over the past 25 years our big failure has been to industrialise agriculture to the extent we might have done.  Instead of focusing on the industrial drive &mdash; as recommended by Culliton &mdash; we have five agencies and three Ministers.  Of course, that excludes the Minister for Foreign Affairs whose Department could and should logically perform those functions of the Department of Tourism and Trade not allocated more properly to the Department of Enterprise and Employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clearly certain functions of the Department of Tourism and Trade &mdash; for example, the reporting function of An Bord Tráchtála &mdash; should be a matter for the Minister for Enterprise and Employment. I can see no reason that the foreign, promotional aspect ought not be the <Col N="1767" /> task of Iveagh House.  This duplication is repeated abroad where this small country finances separate offices for the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Industrial Development Authority and An Bord Tráchtála; indeed, SFADCo is also represented abroad.  That is not the end of the story.  We are advised that the existing regional structures are imported into this Bill.  New regional structures are contemplated within the context of EC structural funding.  SFADCo and Údarás na Gaeltachta remain in place.  An entire new web of county enterprise boards, remote from the proposed new agencies, inconsistent with existing regional structures, is being put in place.  This array of State agencies could scarcely be more confused or confusing, excessively bureaucratic, often contradictory and focusing on the wrong problem.</P>
    <P>I accept and have long argued the need to shift the focus of the industrial effort to indigenous industry.  More than ten years ago Telesis consultants provided the supportive arguments for that analysis, concluding that Ireland had strong agencies and weak indigenous companies.  I do not believe that the solution to our unemployment crisis is to weaken the agencies or create a super agency and subordinate new agencies.  I find it hard to be persuaded that the IDA could not have been directed to reorganise so that there was a clearer focus, structurally a separate division, on the development of indigenous industry. I acknowledge that the IDA always has been more successful in accommodating itself to the language of Telesis and, indeed, to the language of other analysts than it has to implementing their recommendations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

      <P>However, most people will look askance at the Minister's remarks.  They were essentially the same as those delivered in the Seanad except that the Minister has since discovered Monsieur Richard Pascale.  I met Professor Michael Enright&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I read Professor Porter's views but I am acquainted with Monsieur Pascale.  It is interesting that Monsieur Pascale has been quoted to justify the structures the Minister proposes to put in place.  I am fascinated by the concept of &ldquo;fit&rdquo; and &ldquo;split&rdquo; and I am sure the Minister will tell us more when he responds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The final sentence of that paragraph reads: &ldquo;In this regard, I would say with some force that I am much more concerned with getting this balance right than with conforming to some abstract notion of adherence to a precious text&rdquo;.  That was the first time I heard a Government Minister refer to the Culliton report as a precious text.  There is some truth in the point, nonetheless, having regard to the fact that we sheltered beneath it and that this and the previous Government claimed for so long that Culliton would be our rescuer, it is now the precious text.</P>
      <P>The Minister also said: &ldquo;The fact is that the current agency structures are inhibiting the most efficient and effective development of industry&rdquo;.  That is a subjective judgment and the Minister is entitled to his opinion.  I presume the advice available to him is better and more structured than the advice available to me but, essentially, I regard that as a criticism of the IDA.  For some extraordinary reason SFADCo&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point but this criticism can be justified.  It has nothing to do with the present occupant of the post but where were Government Ministers and, indeed, Governments during the past 20 years who thought the IDA could do no wrong?  I remember being heavily criticised in this House when I raised certain questions about the efficacy <Col N="1769" /> of the IDA, its priorities, concentration and focus.  This was tantamount to betraying the national interest.  Down through the years successive Ministers have been very happy, not only to praise the IDA without qualification, but to exploit the public relations opportunities provided by it to open a plant and get the kudos.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>In that sense I am uneasy about the fact that suddenly the conventional wisdom swung around to make us believe that the IDA is part of the problem rather than the solution and that we must revamp it and create new agencies.</P>
      <P>The IDA, in regard to its glamour role, did what it had to do very well.  Unfortunately, it did not accept the argument advanced at the time that, as well as attracting mobile investment, it had to develop the indigenous sector if we were to have a permanent industrial base.  My criticisms of the IDA centre on its extraordinary ability to adapt to the language of criticism of its role and not do a great deal about it.</P>
      <P>The Telesis report published in 1982 was not the first but it made many of the points which are reinforced in the modern language of today in the Culliton report.  The representatives of the IDA were quick, on the equivalent of the &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; of the time, &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo;, to say that they were ahead of the Telesis report, that some of the reforms had already been implemented and that they were getting on with the task of implementing its recommendations.  This did not happen, it took a decade to implement even the more moderate recommendations in the Telesis report, which is regrettable.  This has been the predeliction of the IDA in protecting its own institutional role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the IDA has accumulated many skills and acquired valuable knowledge which can only be used to optimum effect in developing indigenous industry if there is interaction between the experience garnered in the international <Col N="1770" /> marketplace and in developing domestic industry which can be partially or wholly foreign owned these days.  The issue of ownership was dealt with by Deputy Bruton or Deputy Cullen.  Interaction is critical and unless we develop and accelerate these linkages we will continue to fail to make any real impact on the jobless figures or build up a strong indigenous industrial sector.  Therefore, if the IDA has been trady in relinquishing the glamour role in favour of the hard slog in constructing a strong indigenous sector then it was &mdash; and is &mdash; the task of the Minister of the day to redirect that focus. On balance, ministerial intervention could, even at this late stage, cause the IDA to concentrate on indigenous industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>If restructuring is necessary, the IDA, as currently constituted has moved beyond the point of being reformed from within.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps but I would like to refer to what I think the Minister's reference was when in Opposition &mdash; the dual structure or agency, which we do not have.  If my argument is out of date, in terms of the capacity of the IDA to reform itself, so be it but my point is that one could have a reorganised Industrial Development Authority and a genuine regional structure beneath it which would obviate the necessity for county enterprise boards.  That would be a far simpler, more effective, less costly and wasteful structure for the promotion of industrial development.  Less time would then be spent in jockeying for advantage in the new hierarchy and duplication and unnecessary competition would be minimised.</P>
      <P>I accept that Culliton recommended two stand alone agencies.  As I said, that was the Minister's preference when in Opposition&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister had gone back to the drawing board, it did not <Col N="1771" /> have to be the alternative.  The Minister's preference has not been given expression in this Bill.  This seems to be the classic case of the Minister preferring the dual structure and the Taoiseach, heading the Fianna Fáil element, preferring the super agency.  The Taoiseach tells the Minister that he can have his two agencies provided he can have his super agency with the result that we now have the Taoiseach's super agency and the Minister's two agencies.  That is the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Bruton, I give the Minister credit for trimming the wilder fringes of that web.  However, it remains to be seen if he will be able to control the lads at local level and prevent them from engaging in wholescale patronage.</P>
      <P>The Minister indicated that we are dealing with a technical Bill.  Like Deputy Bruton, I think this is regrettable because we have waited a long time to debate the Culliton report in this House.  Despite the establishment of new committees and the additional sitting hours, we have not yet had an opportunity to debate the Culliton report in any great detail. Indeed, some of it is now out of date.  It is a mistake, in the rush to enact legislation before the House rises, to restrict us to a technical Bill which does not give us any insight into the Minister's views on major policy questions in regard to industrial development, industrial strategy and on wider economic policy today.  In so far as the Minister refers to policy questions, for example, equity participation and the role of science and technology, it is by way of justifying the proposed structures; he does not give us any indication of where he or the Government stand on these crucial policy issues.  Rather, he justifies the proposed technical structure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to the four main areas of change which Culliton is seeking in our strategy for industrial promotion.  First, he says there is a need for a decisive <Col N="1772" /> shift from grants towards equity, taking account of the requirements for attracting the more mobile firms for which we are competing with industrial promotion agencies abroad.  We have not heard where the Minister stands on the critical issue of the shift from grants to equity, apart from an untypical slip-up by him yesterday.  I was amazed at this slip-up. Deputy Bruton and I &mdash; the Minister very kindly arranged a briefing for us the previous day &mdash; raised the extent of the shift to equity away from grants and the open-ended approach under which, as the Minister rightly said, we doled out hundreds of millions of pounds in the past without necessarily getting value for money in the process.</P>
    <P>It emerged yesterday at Question Time that the Minister had bought hook, line and sinker the new IDA line, that is, &ldquo;What is Culliton talking about?  Everybody knows we have been shifting towards equity; we have made great progress in this area, the graph has been on the way up in recent years&rdquo;.  It transpires that progress has been minimal and is declining.  When one takes into account the abolition of NADCORP, which had a minimal role in equity participation, &mdash; this was one of the <i>ad hoc</i> measures brought before this House rather than a comprehensive approach to the revamping of industrial policy &mdash; the IDA's 6 per cent looks even more paltry.  I presume the Minister will consult his advisers and the IDA on this matter.  There is very little point in paying lip-service to Culliton in the critical area of taking an equity stake rather than giving grants if the situation turns out to be otherwise.</P>
    <P>According to the Culliton report there is a need for a refocusing of the target for industrial promotion in favour of promoting industrial clusters.  That is the nub of my argument for trying to maintain some coherence and single agency control. We have failed to foster clusters, interaction and the linkages which we so badly need.  In fairness, some progress has been made in this area by the IDA in recent years but it is too little too late. The size of our domestic market does not allow us to expand and create jobs, etc. <Col N="1773" /> unless, as the Minister said, we feed-in in terms of supply to the multi-national companies located here.</P>
    <P>One of the interesting aspects of Culliton's reference to the tax dimension is that he does not put forward any argument for the elimination of a great many of the tax reliefs, tax shelters, etc.  In discussing these deficiencies, Culliton failed to mention that the existing tax regime and tax shelters encourage transfer pricing manipulation which, in turn, discourages the development of local linkages &mdash; it suits the multi-national corporations to maintain international linkages in order to facilitate transfer pricing. This was exposed in the NESC report of December 1992 entitled, Association between Economic Growth and Employment Growth in Ireland.  That report dealt with the phenomenon of transfer pricing, the extent to which the multi-national corporations have used it and which, in turn, raises very serious questions about the reliability of our output and the current account surplus in our economy.</P>
    <P>The Culliton report stated that there should be a squeezing of the budget of the agencies to ensure efficiency and value for money.  We are deluding ourselves if we think as, apparently, the IDA does &mdash; it is on public record as saying it is doing precisely this: perhaps it has been doing this since the open-handed days of the seventies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is desirable, but the figures show that it is not anything like we would have expected and that the shift has not taken place towards equity. The fact that there will be three agencies competing in this area will mean it will be very difficult for the Minister to do this for them.  There will be extraordinary pressure, rivalry etc., and it will be very difficult to squeeze the budget in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Culliton report suggested that there should be a new deal for the commercial State enterprises, giving them a clear mandate, the resources and day-to-day <Col N="1774" /> independence to accomplish this. What can one say about this?  There is nothing in the Bill about the commercial State enterprises.  It seems that Culliton is a great deal to the left of the Minister in this issue.  I cannot see where the Minister is giving these enterprises any clear mandate or resources for this day-to-day independence or to accomplish it.  I will not refer to any of the major issues of the day in this area, but this has not happened.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that the Minister has gone for a minimalist approach and that, in order to enact legislation before the House rises, he has come before us with a purely technical Bill which does not afford us the opportunity to debate any of the major or crucial policy decisions which have to be made.  How long do I have left?</P>
    <P>I made a submission to Culliton on behalf of my party.  As the record will show, many of my recommendations are reflected in Culliton's report.  There are a number of minor defects in the report which ought to be put on record.  We will be inducing a sense of complacency if we somehow go along with the view that if only we could implement the Culliton report we would make a major impact on the level of unemployment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The authors of the report have been very careful to point out that that is not the case.  We should keep this to the forefront of our minds. One of my minor criticisms is that having raised the issue of industrial policy at EC level in the context of rationalising national aids to industry the report does not expand enough on this point.  There is a need to say much more about the requirement to build-up the organisational capabilities of firms if they are to succeed in international markets. Questions such as the size of firms and their corporate structure are largely ignored in the report.  While the report argues for the shutting down of many of the tax shelters, ending section 84s, etc., it does not venture into the dangerous <Col N="1775" /> territory of how these act as an inducement to multinationals to engage in transfer pricing.</P>
      <P>The report also fails to note that it may be part of the general strategy of transnational corporations to split up production among various countries, thereby hindering the development of local linkages.  This raises very difficult questions for a small country like ours and makes it all the more important to address this question at European level. If we have a Common Agricultural Policy, I cannot see why we cannot attempt to construct a common industrial policy.  It would be foolish to suggest that the Government can address this question within the confines of this island.  It cannot and I urge that this matter be raised at European level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on this Bill in the wake of the Culliton report and the subsequent Moriarty task force on its implementation affords us the opportunity to debate at some length the industrial issues of today.</P>
      <P>In his opening address the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, said that in the years 1987-92 a substantial number of 118,500 jobs were created but that we lost in the region of 108,600 jobs in the same period.  That statistic bears out the very significant change in the industrial base.  Further on he states:</P>
      <P>... our successes in the field of attracting mobile investment have been obscuring our failure to really get indigenous industry moving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate affords us the opportunity to focus on the reasons for our relative failure to create employment in indigenous industries.  It is timely to ask why we have lost so many jobs and where they were lost.  I do not have the background <Col N="1776" /> information available to the Minister but I believe that jobs have been lost in the labour intensive industries.  I can give a statistic I elicited from a parliamentary question some time ago.  In 1973 there were 7,000 people employed in the footwear sector but, by 1992, that figure had fallen to approximately 700 people.  This is of particular interest to me because the footwear industry was a very significant employer for many years in my constituency of Louth.  Unfortunately, the contraction of the industry is reflected in the very high levels of unemployment in Dundalk, Drogheda and Ardee.  It is worth asking whether there is an argument for introducing on a pilot basis a special environment for the footwear industry.  More people would be employed if the industry was buoyant and, by its nature, the footwear industry is labour intensive and will continue to be.</P>
    <P>The Culliton report identifies the urgent need to reform taxation but we are realistic enough to know &mdash; having regard to the commitments to the national debt and the range of demands on public expenditure &mdash; that this will be a slow and tedious process.  It is worth asking whether we should take certain industries and introduce taxation reform on a pilot basis to monitor the impact of the reforming measures in terms of job creation.  The failure of our indigenous industry to grow and develop is most disappointing.  While we have invested very heavily in our educational structures it is not unreasonable to ask why this investment has not been reflected in more entrepreneurs coming on stream.  Is it because the enterprise culture is not as strong in Ireland as in other economies in Europe and round the world?  The Minister referred to Professor Porter's book <i>The Competitive Advantage of Nations</i> which supports the importance of the home market.  With a population of approximately five million our home market is very small indeed as a consumer market base.  Naturally, industries need a home market but they must also export. However, there are additional costs in exporting as a result of transport costs <Col N="1777" /> and the attendant marketing structures required.</P>
    <P>This debate gives us the opportunity to question our propensity to tinker with our structures.  More colourful phrases have been used to describe the establishment of new State bodies.  The decision to reorganise the Industrial Development Authority and set up the three bodies which the Minister proposes is quite a dramatic change.  We need to establish a demarcation line between the areas of responsibility of Forbairt and the county enterprise boards to avoid any overlap and duplication of roles.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is our largest industry and we can learn some lessons from what has happened to it over the years.  Up to the early 1970s, agriculture was a dormant and less than progressive sector but on our entry to the Community with the opening up of new markets that changed. Given the constraints of the tenure and size of farms, other factors were at work that ensured the rapid development of the industry.  ACOT, now Teagasc, has responsibility for research, advice and development, all essentially operating under the same umbrella.  From my experience as a public representative over a long number of years I know &mdash; from the various people who have come with an idea for a small industry &mdash; that there is a great lack of advisory help.  I went to the bother of compiling a list of the various aids, incentives and supports in County Louth and I was quite surprised at the range of services available from statutory and non-statutory sources.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of people contemplating setting up their own small industry would simply be unaware of their availability.  If an advisory service had been available to individuals who, for some reason or another, were in difficulties with financial management, technical expertise and so on, to guide and help&mdash;in effect to act in a guardian angel role&mdash;many of the small industries which went out of business might well have been saved.  If the Minister and his officials have an opportunity to study in closer detail the role and significance of the <Col N="1778" /> combination of advisory, educational and research sections operating within the same organisation there may well be lessons to be learned.</P>
    <P>In this House we are all practitioners of the theory of industrial development. Having listened to a fine contribution from the previous speaker, Deputy Rabbitte, one could not but think that the gap that exists between the theory of industrial development and the practical difficulties on the ground is quite significant. This is something we must all bear in mind when deliberating on the subject.</P>
    <P>I hope the formation of the new structures for industrial development in Ireland will bear fruit.  We need jobs and we need them badly.  None of us will pretend there are readymade opportunities on the ground nor that there is potential there which is not being taken up.  It is not like that.  We are living in a competitive world where production cost structures are relevant to the cost of the product we will be selling into Europe, America or markets outside those trading blocs.  The Culliton report clearly identifies the need to get those structures right.  I hope that over a period when the new bodies are in place that can be achieved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the opportunity to congratulate the Minister and join other speakers in welcoming the Industrial Development Bill.  While I agree it may be a theoretical exercise, I am satisfied that already such practical divisions operate within the IDA both at headquarters and at regional level, with various personnel being primarily responsible for the promotion of the Irish manufacturing base abroad and for promoting indigenous industry.  It may be a theoretical Bill but it gives us an opportunity to focus on the necessity to promote industrial development.  With 300,000 people unemployed, our manufacturing and service industries have come under the microscope, more particularly the State agencies whose responsibility it is to encourage industrial development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1779" /> Having been for many years an agriculture-based economy with agricultural produce still playing a dominant role in the value of our exports, this country has had a fair degree of success in attracting foreign industry and assisting indigenous industry to evolve, to satisfy the sophisticated market requirements of Irish and world consumers.  In this age of transparency I support the efforts of the Government in separating the functions of the old IDA.  Many Irish manufacturers and potential entrants often felt they were treated as second class citizens or that Irish industry would not be given the same consideration and financial assistance as glamorous overseas projects. I welcome the refocusing of attention on the role of indigenous industry as a vehicle to create growth and employment levels.  Unlike foreign industry, who have a plan to establish in Ireland for various reasons &mdash; be it to gain a foothold in Europe or, alternatively, because of our extremely attractive taxation regime &mdash; Irish manufacturers, in the main, have been unable to make their plant and accummulated skills and workforce mobile.  That was particularly noticeable during the last currency crisis when there were several closure threats, one of which materialised and none of the industries involved was Irish-owned.</P>
    <P>Today market forces require industry to make radical changes in a very short period if they are to survive at a time of rapid technological change.  There is a perception that foreign-based industries have high levels of productivity, that they have been more dynamic and more competitive. Many of our native industries have established very successfully overseas branches and joint ventures which can compete with the best of their competitors abroad.  Very few Irish firms can survive without penetrating export markets as the demand on the Irish market would not be sufficient to justify high levels of investment in plant and machinery.</P>
    <P>Forbairt, who will have the responsibility of developing indigenous industry, will have a singularly important role to <Col N="1780" /> play.  It is my belief that our ability to attract overseas industries is diminishing for several reasons, not least of which is the increasing unemployment levels in those countries which originally provided much of our foreign-based industry.  We have also seen a tightening up of tax regimes in those countries which has the effect of diminishing the attractiveness of repatriated profit or, at the very least, ensuring that the tax regime here is not taken in isolation when it comes to the taxation of group profits.</P>
    <P>I should like to express my grave reservations in relation to the new United States proposals which have been mooted for some considerable time.  Reference was made in the media yesterday to the proposal to tax undistributed foreign profits of American companies operating abroad.  Such a move could be disastrous for Ireland in relation to existing foreign-based industry here.  I call on the Government to mount a vigorous campaign against these proposals.  I am deeply concerned about the new legislation which has gone through the House of Representatives which proposed that undisbuted, unrepatriated foreign earnings would be taxed at source.  This would blunt Ireland's preferential 10 per cent corporation tax as an incentive in attracting foreign industry.  This would also have a greater impact on Ireland because of the number of US firms located here as a proportion of industry.  A particularly disturbing aspect of this new legislation is the proposal that all profits retained in Ireland, or more particularly in overseas accounts, would be subject to a retroactive US corporation tax at 24 per cent or a total of 34 per cent, allowing for the 10 per cent Irish manufacturing tax.  This would cause considerable damage to investment potential in Ireland and the ability of those firms to develop here.  At present many US firms, based in Ireland, are using this country as a means to penetrate the European market but also markets further afield, such as the Far East. These new proposals will handicap them at source and in doing so will stifle the process of job creation.  I urge the Government to do everything in its <Col N="1781" /> power to campaign against these damaging proposals and to call on our friends in the US Congress &mdash; we have friends there &mdash; to support us in this objective and to help the Irish Chamber of Commerce in fighting the proposals or, at the very least, to ensure they are watered down and particularly that the retrospective taxation of unrepatriated profits would not take place.</P>
    <P>Encouraging US firms to locate here is one of the foundation stones of Irish industrial development policy.  This policy has provided us with thousands of jobs over the years.  In my own county of Mayo there are at least 2,000 US-based jobs which are the primary industrial force in the county.</P>
    <P>Some of our traditional-type industries, particularly clothing and footwear, are the subject of attack from low cost countries and from our own taxation regime which should be more sympathetic to this particular weak sector of Irish manufacturing.  We have competitive advantage in certain indigenous industry.  Since the imposition of the extra 5 per cent VAT on the clothing and footwear industry in the budget the Minister has had discussions with the representative bodies.  Despite the fact that we had been told there would be an examination of the impact of PRSI on low manufacturing costs, that the Minister would consider a market development fund and that there would be a change of focus in relation to IDA grant assistance for machinery, nothing has happened. Last night another company, namely, Baize Textiles Limited lost their support, and the workers and management are doing their utmost to survive.  We have already witnessed several closures in the clothing industry.</P>
    <P>As a person who knows a certain amount about the industry I appeal to the Minister, three months on from the budget, to respond to the representations he has received, to his meetings with IBEC and to put in place a scheme to reduce the level of PRSI on the low manufacturing base.  The clothing industry continues to provide a large number of jobs in Ireland.  We talk about indigenous <Col N="1782" /> industry; let us put some practical focus on it as a matter of extreme urgency.</P>

      <P>Am I to understand that there will be no extra finance but the possibility of extra staff if they apply? Perhaps the Minister will confirm that is what he said.  Will he indicate exactly how these regulations will be enforced by the said officers of the local authorities? How will the private sector be monitored as distinct from the public sector?  Is it not expecting local authorities to act as judge and jury if they are enforcing these regulations on local authority and public accommodation?</P>

      <P>The new standard regulations are a development of existing <Col N="1787" /> measures which certain local authorities currently enforce under by-laws in accordance with section 70 of the Housing Act, 1966.  In 1992, for example, Dublin Corporation inspected 2,170 dwellings as part of the enforcement of its by-laws, served 287 notices for non-compliance and initiated 18 prosecutions. The by-laws will cease to have effect when the new standards for private rented accommodation come into effect on 1 January 1994.  The system is already in place.  This is simply an extension so that the whole country is covered and local authorities who did not use their powers under the 1966 Act will be obliged to implement the standards under the new regulations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister assure the House that these two new regulations will offer greater security of tenure, particularly to long-term tenants such as those in the Mespil flats?  Perhaps he will explain how this could help to avoid another Mespil flats scenario?  Why, with the introduction of the standard regulation, is the operation date for private rented accommodation to be 1 January 1994 while for dwellings let by local authorities it does not come into operation until 1 January 1998?  Is the Government prepared to commit the necessary finance to ensure that people who live in local authority houses can expect the same minimum standards as those in private rented accommodation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course they apply, and the benefits of the regulations will apply to tenants of the Mespil flats as to tennants everywhere else but it does not particularly affect the terms of tenure. That is the subject of another question which will be dealt with later.  The regulations <Col N="1788" /> will come into effect on 1 January 1994 for private rented dwellings and on 1 January 1998 for dwellings let by local authorities.  Deficiencies in local authority stock are being dealt with under two headings, the remedial works scheme and the bathrooms sub-programme.  Funding under these schemes will total £19.7 million in 1993.  Over £84 million has already been spent under the schemes.  Returns to the end of 1991 show that a total of about 4,500 dwellings lack a bathroom or shower.  Of these 2,300 do not have hot water.  Local authorities spend over £80 million annually on the management, maintenance and improvement of their dwellings.  The increased amount of money spent to bring all local authority housing up to an acceptable standard can be seen, and this programme will be completed by the end of the programme for Government.  Hence the date 1 January 1998.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 44 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the period 1989-93, projects funded <Col N="1789" /> through my Department and attracting Structural Fund support have received, or are receiving, either 25 per cent or 50 per cent co-financing from national resources.  Community aid rates of 75 per cent and 50 per cent apply to national primary roads and non-national primary roads investments, respectively, under the peripherality programme.  The balance in all classes is met from national resources.  Water and sanitary services projects receive 50 per cent national and 50 per cent Community funding under the Operational Programme for Water, Sanitary and Other Local Services.  Coastal sewage treatment projects supported by the Community initiative ENVIREG receive 25 per cent national funding and 75 per cent Community funding.</P>
    <P>It is too early to determine the national financial requirements which may be attached to environmental projects under the next Community support framework. The National Development Plan will have to be negotiated with the EC Commission before this framework is established.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister be clear on this issue and stop adding to the confusion in relation to additionality?  Even the ESRI pointed to that in its recent report.  Has there been national co-financing of at least 25 per cent for every project within the Minister's Department financed under the last programme of CSF funding?  Will the 25 per cent additionality clause apply to the next programme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the second part of the Deputy's question is yes.  In regard to the third part of the question, it is too early to determine the national co-financing element in the new national plan.  Under the Cohesion Fund the co-financing from EC resources could <Col N="1790" /> be as high as 85 per cent, leaving 15 per cent under that heading to be funded by the national Government.  Consideration is being given to amending the regulations regarding the Structural Funds.  In very exceptional meritorious cases, it is possible for the funds to go as high as 85 per cent under the present proposals. However, the number would be extremely limited.  No projects under the existing programme have gained less than 25 per cent from national resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it is a lack of understanding on my part, but I find it hard to accept the Minister's explanation. Given the huge overall increase in spending on our roads programme, aided and abetted by a very generous contribution from Europe, will the Minister agree that the national Exchequer contribution to the roads has decreased by 24 per cent in the last four years?  That fact just does not marry with what the Minister told me.  Can he explain it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is quite clear to everybody on this side of the House.  In 1988 the total provision for national, primary and secondary roads was £80 million.  In 1993 the total provision for national, primary and secondary roads was £242 million and the 25 per cent provision by the Government is greater than the total amount spent in 1988.</P>

      <P>I am aware of what the junior Minister said at the time.  The Minister is aware of the widespread concern in environmental groups about the regulations and the Minister's interpretation of the directive.  It would be very helpful for those groups if the Minister determined a specific time by which he would review the regulations.  I have made this point before but I am afraid it is falling on deaf ears.  However, the issue of An Bord Pleanála is causing grave concern.

      <P>I beg the Chair's indulgence but I do not know which world the Minister is living in.  He is not correct in saying we have one of the most open planning systems in the world and the most open interpretation of regulations in regard to planning.  In Norway, for instance, practically every letter within the planning process is available for inspection by the general public.  Why can the inspectors' reports of An Bord Pleanála not be available for scrutiny here?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have explained on a number of occasions that the inspector's report forms part of the total analysis of a planning appeal.  Planning appeals constitute approximately 7 per cent of the total number of planning applications.  In other words, 93 per cent of applications are dealt with at local authority level, and without reference to An Bord Pleanála. Information in relation to more than 90 per cent of the applications is not now at issue.  Information in regard to 7 per cent of the applications which are dealt with by An Bord Pleanála are at issue.  The planning inspector's report is one aspect of the planning process.  If this House wishes to repose the total responsibility for deciding planning appeals in the inspectorate and not in the board I will be <Col N="1793" /> happy, under new planning legislation, to listen to arguments on that basis but so long as the board decides on such appeals, taking into the account the inspector's report and other relevant data it deems appropriate, it is reasonable to accept that the inspector's report forms part of the decision only.</P>

      <P>My Department will at any time, have a large number of proposals for sewerage schemes before it; these vary considerably according to stage of planning, size, and priority status with the local authority concerned.  As it would entail a disproportionate commitment of staff time and resources to compile a complete inventory of these proposals, I do not have the exact information sought by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Precise information is, however, available for sewerage schemes forming part <Col N="1794" /> of relevant EC approved operational programmes.  It was a policy objective, in the context of these programmes, to increase the share of investment on sewerage schemes relative to water projects, and this has been done.</P>
    <P>Under the Operational Programme for Water, Sanitary and other Local Services 1989-1993, some 47 sewerage schemes had been completed by end-1992 and a further 12 schemes were under construction. Under the Community Initiative ENVIREG, which was approved in 1991 and is directed at coastal sewage treatment except in major urban areas, two projects have been completed and a further 11 are under planning or construction. The INTERREG programme has seen the completion of two schemes with a further five under planning or construction.</P>
    <P>Given the ongoing and widespread need for sewerage schemes throughout the country and the demanding requirements of the EC Directive on Urban Waste Water Treatment, major investment in sewerage services is set to continue. Some £80 million is being devoted to sewerage schemes in 1993.  This is by far the highest annual allocation ever made to these services and includes some 28 schemes to be supported by the Cohesion Fund.</P>
    <P>The environment action programme provided that substantial investment would be devoted to water and sanitary services during this decade.  The Programme for a Partnership Government undertakes to build on and speed up implementation of this programme. These commitments will be met by the ambitious works programmes referred to and by a continuing substantial provision for water and sanitary services under the forthcoming National Development Plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister the number of schemes awaiting approval and he did not give that information.  I did not ask the Minister how many schemes were completed.  The reason I asked the number of schemes awaiting approval is that I am aware, as I am sure is the <Col N="1795" /> Minister, that there is a serious backlog in his Department.  Does the Minister accept this is the position?  As a result of that serious backlog the Minister has failed to give the number of schemes awaiting approval which would be an embarrassment to him and his Department. There is a serious pollution problem in the many towns and villages in respect of which local authorities have submitted schemes to the Minister's Department and are awaiting sanction.</P>

The resources being provided for sewerage schemes this year is an all time record which is a recognition that there are more schemes being approved.  As the Deputy is aware resources are not unlimited.  The Fine Gael policy on public expenditure is to cut it and I am not doing that in those areas.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that there is a serious pollution problem as a result of the delay in sanctioning those schemes?  Is the Minister aware that the stance of local authorities, who are pollution control bodies, is being undermined because they are seen to be polluters? Recently a case taken by a fishery board against a local authority was adjourned in the District Court because the judge wanted to state a case to the Circuit Court on the issue of fault, the local authority or the Department of the Environment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>No Member should try to pretend that there are no problems or that there are unlimited resources to solve all the problems at one time.  It is better to say to the taxpayers that the maximum resources available at national and EC level are being used to provide such schemes.  Without funds from the EC such schemes would progress at a much slower pace.  I am determined in <Col N="1796" /> negotiations on the National Development Plan to work towards increasing the resources available for those services.  I accept that environmental domestic, industrial, agricultural and other concerns must be addressed.  I will not pretend to the public that I can solve all those problems at once.  The schemes will have to be phased in and the resources, when available, directed to priority cases. The programme which has been intensified dramatically this year, can be pursued, we hope, as intensively in the next few years.</P>

      <P>In regard to the sale of local authority houses, under section 90 of the Housing Act, 1966 as substituted by section 26 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1992, local authorities are authorised to sell dwellings as follows: (1) where the dwelling is occupied by a tenant, it can be sold to the tenant in accordance with the purchase scheme adopted by the authority, in effect, a tenant purchase scheme; (2) to another housing authority or to a body standing approved of for the purposes of section 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1992 i.e. a voluntary or non-profit housing body, and (3) a house can be sold, also when the dwelling is not occupied by a tenant, to any person, including another housing authority. Legislation does not provide authority for the sale of local authority dwellings to institutional investors on the lines mentioned in the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy asked if we intended to sell council houses to institutional investors. We have no intention or authority to do <Col N="1798" /> so.  We intend to introduce shortly a new purchase scheme to enable tenants buy their local authority dwellings.  The scheme will be on-going and no fixed closing date will apply to it.  Therefore, tenants can make applications to purchase if and when their circumstances permit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the tenant purchase scheme, will the Minister tell us when the long promised scheme will be announced and come into effect as there are many tenants awaiting it?  We have heard the word &ldquo;shortly&rdquo; for a long time and I would like to get an exact date. With regard to the power that exists to sell local authority houses to voluntary bodies and other housing authorities, does the Minister intend to sell local authority houses to these bodies who might in turn obtain the funds from financial institutions?</P>

In regard to the new purchase scheme will the Minister of State ensure that all purchasers take out a mortgage protection policy?  This was not the case in the past and I am currently dealing with a widow who did not have such a policy and who will be forced to revert to renting the house even though the family have been buying it for the past 12 years.  The Minister of State should ensure that all such purchasers have such a policy as they would be required to if they were buying a house in the private sector.</P>
      <P>May I ask the Minister why he did not take an opportunity under the corrections and clarifications section of <i>The Irish Times</i> to correct the false story put out in relation to private investors?

      <P>The responsibilities of my Department in relation to the programme for provision of halting sites for travellers extend mainly to: policy aspects; the provision of finance for the construction of sites, for which a special allocation of £3 million is available annually; the encouragement of local authorities to press ahead with their sites programme; and the provision of a general advisory and supervisory service to ensure that technical standards and cost control procedures are observed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the Minister's reply I would like to probe this matter a little more deeply.  From my experience in Dún Laoghaire there is much concern about the cost of specific sites.  For instance, for a three bay site in Dún Laoghaire the initial cost was quoted at £250,000, which seems exorbitant.  What is the Minister's role in ensuring value for money and how does this figure compare with figures for other sites?  How does the Minister intend to access needs?  For example, how does one determine who is in greatest need?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>We will insist that we get good value for money.  Unit costs per site are normally about £25,000 outside Dublin and about £40,000 in Dublin.  As long as we are satisfied we are getting value for money we will not allow a cost factor to prevent development of the programme. I ask Deputies who are members of local authorities to ensure that in making proposals there is control over cost.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister accept that in the provision of halting sites some local authorities make adequate provision and have done very well &mdash; Cork Corporation is a case in point &mdash; while other local authorities have not met their obligations in this matter and therefore there is a huge number of unauthorised encampments throughout the country? Will the Minister require local authorities to make provision for a fair share of halting sites in each local authority area?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>In the overall programme for the accommodation of travellers emphasis is placed on provision of halting sites and an annual capital allocation of £3 million is set aside for this purpose. On 30 March 1993 I wrote to the chairpersons of housing authorities enclosing details of the number of travelling families in each county and county borough area as per the count carried out in November 1992, the latest available data, and urged them to make a major effort to increase the programme of accommodation for travelling people in their <Col N="1804" /> areas.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Cork Corporation has an excellent record.  The House should be mindful that the policy of the Progressive Democrats and the Government is to devolve authority to local authorities from central Government.  I am mindful that there is now a demand that we take back authority when there is a thorny issue to be handled.  That is not the policy and it is up to the elected members and local authority managers to fulfil their obligations.  The provision of finance is not at issue.  If the £3 million provided is not adequate this year further provision will be made to meet the demand, and that has always been the case.  It is a matter for local authorities to get their programmes up and running.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister accept that to expect local councillors to vote for halting sites in their area is unrealistic?  Ia this not a function of the executive at local authority level rather than of the elected members?  Would the Minister accept that, for example, there is no halting site whatever in Wicklow and the position in Dublin county is so bad that the local authority proposes to open two temporary sites in west Dublin, each of which would accommodate 40 families?  Would the Minister agree this is unacceptable for travellers and also for the settled community who have to take the whole burden of what is a huge national problem?  Would the Minister agree that the £80,000 sanctioned by his Department by way of grant aid to a local authority for a halt and washing facilities, excluding site costs, is grossly inflated? The Department should ensure that the sum is more realistic because it is hindering the provision of additional halting sites.  The figures of £250,000 for Shankill and £240,000 for the Turnpike site&mdash;</P>

      <P>The county has a good record of housing travellers in accommodation other than halting sites and quite a lot of work has been done in that regard.  Therefore because there is no halting site in the county does not mean nothing has been done.  Temporary halting sites are not the best solution. Whether halting sites, housing or temporary halting sites are provided I will ensure we get value for money.  The fact that some halting sites may be expensive will not prevent the provision of halting sites in other areas.  If financing above what is being provided is required, it will be provided.</P>

      <P>The specifications for sites was agreed with my Department and other interested voluntary and statutory bodies in 1985 and circulated to councils at that time.  They have not been changed since.  The specifications are of a very good standard.  The specifications have been used all over the country to good effect.  On halting sites there are now 834 families and 1,814 families are in council houses.  On the roadside there are still 1,180 families.  About two-thirds of the travelling families assessed as being in need have been accommodated.  The other one-third on the roadside must be accommodated.  The assessment is carried out by the local authorities who this year have been instructed to include the need for halting sites as a new point in the assessment.  We get quarterly progress bulletins from all local authorities so that we can have a clear view of what is happening.</P>

      <P>The matters arising in relation to these flats predominantly concern the landlord and tenant code for which the Minister for Justice has responsibility.  In reply to Private Notice Questions on 11 May 1993, the Minister for Justice indicated that she is considering what amending legislation might be possible to deal with such situations. In these circumstances any questions in regard to a possible working party in the matter are appropriate to the Minister for Justice in the first instance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an appalling passing of the buck by the Minister.  This is the second occasion within the space of two questions that the Minister has passed the buck to another Department. The Minister recently published a charter of tenants' rights.  Has the Minister any plans to deal with the problem of long term tenure which was at the core of the Mespil flats issue and when will we see some legislation in that area?  Will the Minister not agree with the proposal put forward by Threshold, who deal with tenant/landlord relationships and at whose seminar the Minister was recently present, that a working group should be established to address the issues which have arisen from the Mespil controversy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not passing the buck. I carry out my responsibility fully.  The Government in its wisdom decides to give responsibility in various areas to various Ministers.  I am not part of that decision-making process but I accept the decisions made and carry out my functions within my remit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rights of tenants in private rented accommodation are in the first place <Col N="1809" /> determined by reference to the terms of the lease or tenancy agreement under which the tenancies are held.  These are governed by the provisions of the landlord and tenant code, which is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice. In reply to a pariamentary question on 11 May 1993 on the Mespil flats, following the sale of the property, the Minister, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, said that she is considering the need to amend the landlord and tenant legislation.  My Department will co-operate as necessary with the Department of Justice in the review of the landlord and tenant code.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that with regard to the landlord and tenant relationship about which the Minister spoke so eloquently recently, there is not much point in introducing a charter of rights for tenants if landlords can circumvent it by evicting their tenants once they reach a certain level of tenancy? Will the Minister of State accept that some landlords deliberately evict their tenants in order to ensure that these tenants do not secure long term tenure in their accommodation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <P>The question refers to Mespil flats.  Let us not have an extension thereof.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that there is a strange coincidence of notices to quit being served on people before they qualify for the 20 year terms of tenancy. Whether it is deliberate or not is something I could not judge.  The question of further reducing the length of the qualifying period of 20 years was considered in 1991 as part of the preparations of the plan for social housing. It was considered that it would not be in the interests of tenants to reduce the qualifying period because a further reduction would give less flexibility in leasing arrangements since landlords could ensure that the duration of the tenancy was reduced correspondingly to ensure that no right of renewal would occur.  If the period was reduced to five years instead of getting notice after 19½ <Col N="1810" /> years people would get notice after four and a half years.  On balance it was decided not to reduce the period.</P>
      <P>The parts of the charter of rights for tenants which we have put in place since this Government came into office are considerable.  Now a minimum notice of four weeks is required before any tenant can be evicted.  The right of distress which a landlord had, where he could seize the goods of a tenant in lieu of rent, has been removed.  The regulations concerning mandatory rent books and prescribed standards of minimum accommodation are now in place.  The other legs of the Programme for Government in regard to tenants' rights are the registration of all tenancies and the right of tenants to have a tax rebate on rent paid.  Let me assure the Deputy, again without attempting to pass the buck, that is a matter for the Minister for Finance, in the first instance, rather than for me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to say I am not surprised that the Minister for housing, who denies responsibility for housing conditions, should attempt to pass the buck in relation to this matter; it is entirely in line.  Would the Minister agree that part of the problem here, indeed, the reason for great urgency is the fact that so many of these tenants are elderly, vulnerable, afraid and action should be taken as quickly as possible?  Would the Minister further agree that in relation to his so-called tenants' charter the fact that it is so vague and makes no provision for adequate inspection renders it largely meaningless, which I think he will discover as time progresses?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the questions raised by the Deputy are not relevant to the one before us.  I repeat I am not passing the buck but this is a matter for another Minister.  Another Minister has already dealt with it in the House.  It falls under the landlord and tenant code so that the question should have been properly placed <i>vis-à-vis</i> the legislation affecting that matter.  I cannot convince the Deputy by simply stating that I am not attempting to pass the buck.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Minister's earlier reply when he expressed some concern that if the length of a tenancy was reduced it would result in earlier notices to quit, I put it to him that is not the issue at all, that the issue here, irrespective of the length of tenancy, is that long term tenants should have security of tenure?  May I ask him again what steps is he taking, apart altogether from the Minister for Justice, as he is Minister for housing, to protect the rights of tenants who find themselves in circumstances in which they can be evicted from their accommodation because some landlord does not want to give them the kind of security to which they are entitled?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that a comprehensive report following investigation, is called for, not merely for the sake of ensuring that justice is done but also for the sake of the learning process being teased out in the course of this question into what happened in the case of the Mespil House flats affair?  Would he accept that it is difficult to account for the very cheap purchase price, which seemed to add insult to injury, in the case of tenants in those flats, that is the price for which their accommodation was being sold regardless of its condition given the location?  Can he give any explanation of why that should have happened?  Is there a report to be published on those anomalies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no idea why the prices of various properties were different. <Col N="1812" /> I simply have no answer to that.  I am not sure it is my business to know or to have an answer to that since it is completely beyond my remit.  I can tell the Deputy very clearly that the Minister for Justice has indicated that she is reviewing the legislation concerning landlord and tenants arising from the Mespil House flats case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the very minimum requirement, or would he support as a very minimum requirement, learning from the problems of the Mespil House flats affair, that long term tenants &mdash; whether or not they have reached 20 years of tenancy &mdash; should, by right, have first refusal on the purchase of the flat in which they live?  Could we have even that accepted?  If they do not want to buy, they do not want to buy; it is a private market and there are other rules dealing with that.  Could we get an insistence that such tenants be given first refusal on any purchase option in terms of the flat in which they live?  Would the Minister agree that many of the problems that arose in the case of the Mespil House flats could have been avoided?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of whether or not I would support such a proposal might be irrelevant.  We are dealing with a very complex area.  To single out one part of what might be a package and ask whether one supports that part of the package is rather foolish.  My inclination would be that whenever a flat is being sold, the tenants should have a right of first refusal anyway, whether they be short or long term.  That is something that should be done normally.  Indeed, I know of cases where such first refusal has not been allowed.</P>

      <P>The Road Traffic Acts already contain extensive legislative provisions to regulate traffic, including private motor vehicles.  I will shortly be introducing a Bill to strengthen and amend these Acts.  However, I have no specific plans to introduce legislation to restrict the use of private cars in urban areas.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Dublin area, the Dublin Transportation Initiative is at present preparing a final report which will recommend a balanced and integrated transportation strategy.  The DTI interim report placed particular emphasis on ensuring a rightful, but not a dominant, place for the car in the urban transport system.  Its aim was to encourage car commuters to transfer to public transport where possible, while ensuring that people who needed to use a car for business, shopping and other purposes would continue to be able to do so.  Among the proposals in the interim report were the introduction of traffic calming in residential areas, improved parking restraint with particular emphasis on all-day commuter parking and better traffic management and enforcement.</P>
      <P>The DTI recommendations are being considered in the context of the National Development Plan.  Some of them may be relevant also to other large urban areas.  I intend that this aspect will be further considered when the final report is available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>While thanking the Minister for his reply I regret that, in principle, the Minister does not recognise the need at this stage for some form of legislative restriction on the use of private motor vehicles.  I recall that in an earlier question the Minister mentioned figures: that in 1988 £80 million was invested in roads and in 1993 the figure was £242 million.  My question was tabled specifically on matters arising in larger urban areas, particularly in cities like Dublin, Cork, Limerick and so on.  Would the Minister not accept that despite all of that investment traffic flows have worsened, journey durations have become longer, leading to enormous frustration on the <Col N="1814" /> part of the motoring public?  Would he accept that the time is now ripe for a radical shift in investment away from roads into public transport initiatives based on the necessity to protect the environment and improve the quality of life in inner city areas generally?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Culliton report, the Moriarity report and, indeed, others I will not now name, have sought consistently greater investment in roads.  I should have thought that Deputy Creed, travelling from Glanmire to Cahir, through Portlaoise and Newbridge would himself have recognised how he is able to reach this House much more rapidly because of the investments that have been made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt the Deputy.  There is a major investment being made in roads in and around Cork city and in the searing in Dublin.  Nobody is denying that there is traffic congestion. The principle behind by-passes, behind the sea ring, behind developments in Cork city is an endeavour to take heavy vehicular motor traffic out of the city centre which I am as concerned to achieve as is the Deputy, and making very considerable investment to ensure that happens.  Of course, consistent with investment in roads has been the growth in traffic, rising at the rate of approximately four per cent per annum, which means that even accelerated expenditure on roads &mdash; if followed by and generating new traffic &mdash; will mean, as the Deputy rightly said, we will still have <Col N="1815" /> considerable congestion.  It calls for investment in public transport, pedestrianisation, cycle ways and a variety of different proposals to endeavour to deal with what is &mdash; and I am not denying this &mdash; a real problem warranting a number of different types of measures all being considered within the context of available resources.</P>

      <P>Apart from mentioning a number of measures, may I ask the Minister to take on board some suggestions and give some concrete examples of actual measures targeted specifically at the problem?  May I remind the Minister that his reference to a four per cent growth in motorised traffic, if one is to rely on statistical studies, understandably is directly linked to his own policy of belief in the panacea of road construction?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>While I appreciate that there is a need to maintain and construct roads, has the Minister tried to implement the DTI restrictions on motorised traffic?  I hope he will take into account the fact that when the City Swift service is introduced there will be fewer cars on the road.  This transition will have to be made.  Does the Minister believe that the proposal to build a snake-like motorway across the country, via Birr, is realistic in view of the fact that motorised traffic causes many problems?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with that proposal.  It is outrageous that people with engineering qualifications waste their time proposing an alternative route from that already provided at great expense.  I will respond to the first part of the question relating to the growth in traffic and I reject the Deputy's assertion. When one considers our population structure, the fact that rural co-operatives and various other industries compete in European markets and that we export 75 per cent of what we produce <Col N="1816" /> one can see that the road network forms an important part of our infrastructure. Indeed, many of the heavy trucks are mobile warehouses.  Therefore, there is a need for investment in the road network.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy's remarks in relation to Dublin and other cities.  There is a need to integrate the various proposals which have been put forward following wide consultation with the public. The public will have to accept that there is a need for restraint.  I differ from Deputy Creed in regard to the legal aspects.  The public must also accept that pollution is caused unnecessarily in parts of our cities and that other options are available. These include greater use of public transport, the provision of cycle lanes and pedestrianisation.  We will have to look again at how the various elements will result in a thriving city which will not be choked to death because of pollution caused by unnecessary motorised traffic.</P>

The area running from Creeslough in the north to Killybegs in the south is not served by a national primary route.  Will the Minister consider, in the interest of industrial job creation, extending an artery to the west?  In my parish, as the Minister is aware, 1,000 people are employed in an industrial estate but have severe difficulties in getting to a national primary route through mountains as far as Letterkenny.  Will the Minister consider an allocation, perhaps from the Cohesion Fund, to improve that road?</P>

While I accept the point made by the Deputy that the terrain in County Donegal is difficult, the designation of new primary roads would present a difficulty.  However, there is a need for additional resources to upgrade existing regional routes.  The designation of a primary route would not mean anything unless it can be improved. <Col N="1818" /> I hope to achieve two objectives in the context of the national plan, the first of which is to have a more even spread, in terms of total resources, across the country so far as possible and, second, to provide for increased investment in non-national, regional routes which serve industry, farming and tourism in many of the areas to which the Deputy has referred which need better support.  I will try to find the resources necessary to upgrade existing roads.</P>

      <P>The National Co 2 Abatement Strategy, which I have recently published and placed in the Oireachtas Library, is directed at the principal man made emissions implicated in climate change.  It includes a range of measures in the areas of energy conservation, fuel switching, transport, waste management and afforestation designed to limit the levels of carbon in the atmosphere and to improve the energy efficiency of the Irish economy. The strategy also embodies significant research measures in the areas of energy efficiency and conservation, renewable energy, afforestation and coastal erosion.</P>
      <P>As regard acid rain emissions, the Environmental Research Unit and the Meterological Office monitor and report on Irish emissions and deposition for the purposes of the relevant monitoring programme of the Geneva Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution. In addition, the ERU carries out ongoing research and monitoring on the impacts of acidification, such as is reported in its publication Acid Sensitive Waters (1991) and Water Quality in Ireland (1992).</P>

    <P>Measures are being taken by the ESB to limit growth in demand, and energy conservation is being promoted through education and awareness programmes. There are also the research initiatives such as SAVE for energy efficiency. ALTENER for renewable energy, THERMIE for clean technology and JOPULE which is carried out in universities. While I accept that we need to do more, there has been a considerable level of investment on the research side, for example, approximately £220 million has been invested in afforestation and other measures designed to limit the level of CO 3 in the atmosphere.  The variety of measures have to be consistently reinforced and new financial provisions made.  Eolas, the universities and the other research facilities will work together to the greatest extent possible in bringing about a better approach to this matter.

      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  This Bill is part of the overall long term strategy for tackling the industrial development and employment generation problems with which we are all too familiar.  The agency structures proposed in the Bill will ensure that greater emphasis is placed on catering for the real needs of indigenous firms.  This is one of the most welcome features of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The challenge of developing our indigenous industries will be left in the hands of Forbairt, which will bring together the existing functions of Eolas and the IDA.  I hope this will lead to a change in the perception within industry <Col N="1878" /> and State agencies that grants are the primary way of ensuring industrial development.  The problems of Irish indigenous firms have been well identified for a long time.  For example, too few existing firms have the necessary competences to develop and grow.  We are not developing sufficient new start-up firms to expand our overall indigenous sector to the level required to solve our unemployment problem.  We should not be looking for quick fix solutions in this instance.  I do not think the Bill proposes any such solutions.  Rather it sets out a planned approach for expanding indigenous industry and replacing the piecemeal manner in which the existing structures dealt with the problems in this area.</P>
    <P>One of the functions of Forfás, which will be established under the Bill, will be to advise on the development and co-operation of policy for Forbairt, the IDA, An Bord Tráchtála and such other bodies as the Minister may designate. The co-ordination and development of policy as outlined in the Bill is extremely necessary.  I trust that the Minister will ensure that this takes place, thus avoiding the possibility of agencies being at cross purposes and in competition with each other.  If these agencies do not work together in moving industry in the same direction, they may muddy the waters for the people involved in industry.  This policy function has to be made extremely strong and outlined clearly.  It needs to focus on the sectors in which Ireland as a country has a strategic advantage. However, it must be more than a sectoral policy.  One of the problems with our industrial policy is that it has been mainly sectoral since the changes introduced by the IDA in 1984.  Prior to that the emphasis was placed on regional and local development.  Most people would admit that the policy prior to 1984 was somewhat biased in favour of regional development, with insufficient emphasis placed on the development of the strong sectors in Irish industry.  However, policy has moved in the opposite direction since 1984.  This matter needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>Studies have shown consistently that <Col N="1879" /> regional development contributes to national development.  How ironic it would be for a country that argues so successfully in the European Community for regional policies not to promote it within its own borders.  For that reason I am glad that Forbairt is being set up as an agency specifically to develop indigenous industry.  There is a recognised need for innovation, research and development as well as investment.  We have concentrated too much on meeting the needs of those with a grant mentality without looking at the other needs of indigenous industry.</P>
    <P>The provision in the Bill for investment by Forbairt needs to be spelled out in more detail.  Culliton recommended that the IDA should take equity in companies rather than simply dish out grants while Moriarty on the other hand held that the State should not become a significant shareholder.  The tension between the two approaches needs to be resolved clearly and promptly if the strategy is to be successful.  I am not arguing for the heavy hand of the State that was so unsuccessful in the Soviet bloc to be introduced here at a time when its moment in history has clearly passed, but handing out money to entrepreneurs in the hope of creating jobs, without monitoring seriously the effectiveness of such intervention, is equally objectionable and will be fruitless.</P>
    <P>Culliton argued well for equity rather than grants so that if State agencies work hard to help firms grow, the public will benefit if those firms are successful and are later sold on in the market.  There will be a return on the public's investment if equity stakes are taken and this return should form part of a specific industrial development budget, the return on which would allow firms to be assisted in the future.</P>
    <P>Culliton took a different approach from Moriarty on the role of public enterprise in industrial development.  Culliton stated clearly that commercial public enterprise could make a significant contribution to the economy, whereas Moriarty <Col N="1880" /> stated that subsidies should not be introduced to cover the cost of non-commercial activities carried out for social reasons.  How are commercial public enterprises to be commercial while having to execute social and regional policy objectives without receiving subsidies when so many hidden subsidies are available to the private sector?  There is a definite need for this to be clarified and I trust the Department will do this quickly.  I do not agree with all the Culliton report recommendations but many of them need to be implemented in a stronger way than recommended by Moriarty in his task force report.  The general thrust of the Moriarty task force is in favour of subsidised competition for private industry with little <i>quid pro quo</i> either in jobs or equity.  If we continue with that approach it will mean a very small return on the public investment in terms of jobs.</P>
    <P>Forbairt as an agency to develop indigenous industry will help to meet what has been the key recommendation of all policy reports from the NESC report of 1972 to Telesis and Culliton &mdash; that is to focus on indigenous industry and a look at the different levels of finance for the foreign and indigenous sectors show the clear need for this.  At the time of the Telesis report the division of support was 75 per cent to foreign industries and 25 per cent to indigenous industries.  Telesis urged that this should be 50:50 by 1985 and by 1990 75 per cent of support should be for indigenous industry.  At present 75 per cent of support goes to foreign industry and I believe Forbairt will help to redress this imbalance.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and look forward to hearing the Minister elaborate further on specific policy measures relating to the development of Irish industry, its financing, its strategy, the branding and marketing of Irish products and the factors that will ensure our success in the international and domestic traded sectors. This will be the key to turning us around from our Euro-dole mentality. The bones of the turnaround have been laid before us in this Bill and I look <Col N="1881" /> forward to this being fleshed out in greater detail after the successful passage of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like my colleague, Deputy Gallagher, I very much welcome this Bill which I hope will be a launching pad for a new and more vigorous approach to job creation.  I noted there was some controversy over the name of the supervising body, Forfás, as some civil servants felt that this was a breach of the innate rules of Irish grammar.  It seems that &ldquo;Forfás&rdquo; means a super-growth agency and it is appropriate that we should have such a body.</P>
      <P>A glance at our industrial history shows that we have been competing against countries which do not rely as heavily as we do on exports and imports.  Countries such as Japan have a much more concentrated and dynamic industrial policy. Members are aware of the Ministry of International Trade in Tokyo which has played a dynamic and influential role in co-ordinating indigenous industry, in particular to produce a massive export led growth.  This makes Japan an amazingly prosperous and developed country. It is about time that we began to follow in its footsteps.</P>
      <P>I welcome also the proposals which the Minister and his colleagues have informed us about.  We know that the top civil servants who have left and gone into business have done extremely well and I think it is a tremendous initiative that there will be a constant crossover from the Civil Service to business and industry. Civil servants will be seconded to industry and I hope businessmen will be seconded to the Civil Service.  This will lead to a better understanding of the problems in each others' areas and this in turn should lead to a more dynamic policy for the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Forbairt has a key role to play in rebalancing the thrust of our industrial policy. I disagree profoundly with the thrust of the Moriarty task force and those who are against the State taking, if necessary, a majority shareholding in industrial concerns. It is unfortunate that even with zero inflation and low interest rates <Col N="1882" /> private enterprise has not done the job for us.  I think one of our heroes &mdash; and this transcends party political affiliations &mdash; was Seán Lemass, whose picture is outside this Chamber.  He rightly recognised that the State had to take a role in developing industry in a small open economy.  This created the first industrial base in this country and there is no reason we cannot do that again.  I dissent from the view taken in the Moriarty task force report on that.  When we get away from this grant mentality I believe the State should take an equity holding in various enterprises.  Weak management has been one of the underlying reasons for the failure of many small businesses and under the powers given to Forbairt we will be able to look at all aspects of weak management.  This morning the Minister referred to Professor Michael Enright's comments on competitiveness and this should be taken on board.</P>
    <P>Eolas has been incorporated into Forbairt. In recent years Eolas has been going down the right avenue and I welcome the enormous strides it has made to try to improve the level of technology transfer between the universities and business.  Last year it carried out approximately 145 technology audits, an area in which Irish industry traditionally has been reached, but Forbairt will strengthen and continue the work of Eolas. Likewise, it will continue with its quality management programme, the timber technology programme and the many other programmes it has embarked upon. I note that the national standards authority will become a more or less autonomous agency within the new structure. I believe that is right because it will have access to the best international standards which we need to meet.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland, the external wing of the new organisation has been the subject of a long controversy which was basically fuelled by the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> and by one or two of their economic journalists in recent years to the extent that much of the money we had spent on attracting foreign industry was totally wasted.  On close study it is a view we cannot agree with because the transfer between foreign <Col N="1883" /> and domestic industry &mdash; which has been referred to by Ministers in recent speeches &mdash; is such an important and vital impetus to our economy that you disregard it only at your peril.  As the Minister said this morning, we depend for three-quarters of our industrial exports and for half the total workforce in manufacturing on the achievements of IDA Ireland.  We have kept job losses in manufacturing lower than most other EC countries.  I would like to think the Minister could get a much more vigorous approach for the IDA.</P>
    <P>One of the things which concerns me about IDA Ireland on the north side &mdash; where there are several estates in the vicinity of the airport &mdash; is that we have a lot of hi-tech electronic development but recently we appear to be going more towards pharmaceuticals and low tech. That is a development with which I am not in agreement because we have made a huge investment in education and have brought about an electronically aware technological generation.  Some of that investment will be thrown away if we go back to the old assembly type industries. I support the improvements made in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a few brief remarks about external factors.  No matter how well the three Ministers do in the coming years unless we get the external environment right we will not make progress.  It was astonishing that the Governor of the Central Bank said recently that we had the right external currency exchange rate up to a few months ago, when we were struggling desperately.  Some of my colleagues have said privately that perhaps the Governor of the Central Bank should be sacked on the spot for that type of judgment.  It is shocking that he should have felt in his economic judgment we should have maintained a totally artificial rate which would now put us at £1.10 or £1.15 in terms of sterling and at a decided competitive disadvantage.  If there is a Single European currency that is fine but we should not be expected to pay for the unification of Germany or for whatever <Col N="1884" /> further developments that occur in Eastern Europe.  It is critical that we get the exchange rate right.  We need a serious response from the Governor of the Central Bank and not these silly mantras we heard when I became a Member of the House before Christmas.</P>
    <P>In regard to the whole area of competition and the Single Market, some of us have serious reservations about the performance of the last two Irish Commissioners, namely, Mr. Sutherland, who has gone on to greater things in GATT, and Mr. MacSharry.  Perhaps with the best will in the world Mr. Sutherland pursued a vigorous competition strategy but in our small open economy &mdash; a peripheral economy &mdash; some of the things he worked for were mostly beneficial to the golden triangle but not to the State on the periphery.  I hope the present Commissioner, and any future Commissioners, while they have their duties to Europe, will also look at their homeland and at its particular difficulties. Pressing ahead willy nilly with certain types of deregulation did not serve all the best interests of this country.  I fault Mr. Sutherland very seriously in that regard; in relation to GATT, I fault Mr. MacSharry. Both of them did not pursue the real interests of this country at the Commission table.  If the external factors are not right whatever we try to achieve in our internal re-organisation will not go far enough.</P>
    <P>I was heartened by the Taoiseach's words in Copenhagen on Monday last in relation to the size of the Structural Funds.  While this House is meeting this afternoon, the other assembly of which I am proud to be a member &mdash; Dublin City Council &mdash; is also meeting and is receiving its report on the economy of Dublin.  In that other assembly we are very concerned that Dublin, which has lost 16,000 jobs in the past ten years, has the highest unemployment rate in Ireland.  It is a region which has been gravely discriminated against.  If Dublin is doing badly, Ireland must be doing badly.  That judgment could be applied to other contemporary discussions as well.</P>
    <P>The programmes being submitted by <Col N="1885" /> the four new county councils to Government are of the order of £2.5 billion. Infrastructural development in relation to transport, communications, education and local development is vital for this region.  We have huge unemployment blackspots in Dublin.  Unfortunately, we do not have the quality of life which many areas of the west, the midlands and other areas experience.  We do not have that beautiful scenery, the music, the language&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We just do not have those things.  We live in crowded conglomerations and very often many of us are unemployed.  I represent an area in which the mean unemployment rate is about 55 per cent, rising to 90 per cent in some places.  This Government will succeed if it tackles the unemployment problem.  I realise there are other areas throughout the country which need good regional development.  I note the comments made this morning in relation to SFADCo and Údarás na Gaeltachta and I support them, but we must not forget our capital city.  That is what my colleagues in Dublin City Council would want.  We must have a reinvigoration programme for the capital city during the next couple of years and I am confident the Minister and her colleagues will bring that about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As somebody who has come up through the local small business employment movement I warmly welcome the creation of the county enterprise boards and the co-ordination at local authority level of a range of community and local initiatives in job creation.  During her campaign and since, our President has rightly said that empowering people at local level is the key element of local development.  It could be said that if people felt sufficiently empowered there would be no unemployment in any locality.  In summation, I welcome the Bill and hope it sets the framework for <Col N="1886" /> a vigorous development during the few years which will result, in four years time, in a much lower unemployment rate, because that is what we need.</P>

      <P>This Bill is appallingly bureaucratic.  I suppose it is no accident that it is being sponsored by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment who, as one can see, is a committed and enthusiastic socialist.  The Labour Party have a great ability these days to be totally beside the point, even to the extent that Deputy Bhamjee is favouring us with one of his rare visits to the Chamber at at time when all his colleagues in Clare County Council are busy elsewhere up here lobbying the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, and, I hope, lobbying other people in favour of Shannon.</P>

      <P>I had lengthy conversations with him.  It is interesting to be here listening to Deputy Broughan witnessing the emergence of one of the new economic gurus of the Labour Party who has shown his slip seriously in the remarks he has made here.  Deputy Broughan dislikes the kind of competition policy promoted by Mr. Sutherland when he was a member of the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Deputy Broughan could slow down his mad gallop towards the socialist Nirvana, he would remember that even his own Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs actually said that what Mr. Sutherland tried to bring about in the application of competition to industrial policy in the European Community is what we need to give our agencies the elbow room to help us with our development because competition policy in the <Col N="1887" /> European Community will stop some of the heavier competition in terms of inducements and attractions that encourage foreign firms to by-pass us and invest elsewhere.  Deputy Broughan then made an interesting slip, which may have been deliberate.  He took grave exception to the fact that the Governor of the Central Bank should occasionally give his views to the public.  Deputy Broughan does not like the idea of us having an independent Central Bank.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;expressing a view in public that is inconvenient to the daft doctrine that Deputy Broughan would like to foist on us.  Is there no tolerance in the Labour Party of an independent view on economic issues?  Has Deputy Broughan understood or even read with any attention what the Governnor of the Central Bank actually said?  Deputy Broughan would do well to note this point because he may not have been privy to it.  Before the formation of this Government, I recall talking to a member of Deputy Broughan's party, who is now a member of Government, whose main concern about exchange rate policy was not about what we should do to resolve the problem which existed at the beginning of the year.  He was hoping that the Fianna Fáil party in the outgoing Government would have it resolved before the Labour Party had to take responsibility for it.</P>

      <P>I have never seen a more determinedly bureaucratic approach to industrial structures.  It is interesting to note the timing of the publication of the programme.  The programme was published when the two parties finally decided to consummate the marriage, but at that stage we had not received the Government's response to the Culliton report.  For once Deputy Broughan decided to take the liberty &mdash; I welcome the emergence of independent thinking from that side &mdash; of saying that the Culliton mantra is not everything to him, but the Government has not figured that out yet.  While the Government go around chanting &ldquo;Culliton, Culliton, Culliton&rdquo; every time it refers to a policy position, it is busily doing things that are totally against Culliton's philosophy.  This Bill more than anything shows that the Government has ditched the proposals in the Culliton report.  However, I must give the Government some credit.  I am suspicious of commissions and expert bodies set up by the Government which produce reports claiming that all or none of its proposals must be implemented.  I am not being critical of Mr. Culliton or his colleagues in that respect, but such reports are unrealistic.  While the Government has taken the view it can justify everything, including higher telephone charges, by reference to Culliton&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;at the same time it introduces a Bill which drives a coach and four through the Culliton report.  It also drives a coach and four through the Government review of the Moriarty report on the Culliton report.  The question of the structure of our industrial agencies has been talked to death and it is now about to be strangled, stifled and suffocated by the structures of this Bill.</P>
      <P>This Bill is a monument to Labour Party adherence to bureaucracy and to Fianna Fáil's laziness, who simply do not want to think.  The IDA as we know it is about to be split in two.  A new monster called Forfás is about to be set up.  I have read all the rubbish in the papers recently about whether or not that is a legitimate word; it is not.  It has nothing to do with grammar, but then logos rarely do.  It is a daft name for a daft organisation.  This monster is to be set up to co-ordinate all the other agencies although they are supposed to be autonomous.  It is intended also that Forfás will swallow up the functions of Eolas and distribute them to the other agencies.  It is not clear how that is to be done.  This monster will give policy advice in the area of industrial development generally and co-ordinate Forbairt, the remains of the current IDA and An Bord Tráchtála.  I note a very ominous phrase in the explanatory memorandum which says that Forfás will co-ordinate &ldquo;any other relevant bodies designated by the Minister&rdquo;.  It is obvious that if the Minister finds any type of industrial policy area that has not been locked into this Bill, Forfás will be empowered, without reference to anyone, to co-ordinate its activities.</P>

    <P>Unless the Government is careful in the way it writes the rules for the multiplicity of bodies being set up throughout the country, Forfás could claim to have a role in co-ordinating the activities of the county enterprise development boards, which in turn could stifle many local initiatives that have taken place already and which in counties Clare, Tipperary, Cavan, Mayo and elsewhere are producing results.  Such initiatives are in serious danger of being swallowed up by the new county enterprise development <Col N="1890" /> boards.  That would be a retrograde step and a blow to the type of bottom up economic development that the Labour Party is supposed to favour.  We have all heard the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins, stating that we need a new model of industrial development and the nonsensical mantra from the Labour Party stating that trickle down economics do not work, but the first substantial Bill on industrial policy which it introduces creates a new monster that will stifle that bottom up model of development.</P>
    <P>If Forfás is to have such a co-ordinating role, what will it do that could not be done properly by the Department already in place?  What will it do that could not be done by the Department of Enterprise and Employment, the former Department of Industry and Commerce section of this new monster Department? That Department does not seem to have got its act together yet.  The functions of Forfás are more appropriately the field of activity of the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  Shifting functions from a Department of State is a new development.  It has been done in the past by setting up companies such as Telecom and An Post, but to shift responsibilities to agencies such as Forfás is a new development.  Is it a half way step on the road to State privatisation of some kind? I am concerned that the functions of a State Department are being hived off in such a manner.  It could mean that we in this House will not have the <i>locus standi</i> or right to question the Minister in this House about the activities of that agency. We run the risk of being told that such questions are disallowed on the grounds of there being no ministerial competence. I am concerned that we are about to see here the emergence of a new and superfluous parallel administration which will waste time, effort and money.</P>
    <P>A section of the split IDA will be a body called Forbairt.  Deputy Broughan made philological considerations about Forfás, which he stated gives a sense of supergrowth.  On the other hand, a subsidiary body which is to be co-ordinated <Col N="1891" /> in this way is called Forbairt, which merely means expansion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the Deputy must know what the language means.  Therefore, we are going to have a super monster in Forfás co-ordinating the activities of Forbairt expansion.  The job of Forbairt is to focus on the development of indigenous industry and in doing this it is supposed to exercise the indigenous industry functions currently exercised by the IDA and the technology development functions of Eolas.  If the language sounds somewhat stilted, the people who drafted the Bill and the explanatory memorandum are to blame, because I am using their phrases.  That combination, looking after the development of indigenous industry and the technology development functions of Eolas, is nonsensical. There is no obvious link between them. The technology and development functions of Eolas cannot pretend to be specific to indigenous industry.  Non-indigenous industry also needs technology development.  There is no reason for Eolas not being involved, which is recognised in the explanatory memorandum to the Bill which continues &mdash; awkwardly &mdash;&ldquo;the allocation of responsibility for indigenous industry to Forbairt will not preclude the agency from generating fee income from technology services to overseas industries.&rdquo;  That sentence makes my point precisely.  It is an overt admission of how unreasonable it is to try to combine these two functions in the way proposed.  There is nothing in principle &mdash; there could not be in the Bill but there is nothing in any of the literature or examinations of industrial policy that I have seen &mdash; to indicate that there is any difference in principle between the technology development requirements of indigenous industries and overseas firms.  There is no reason there should be any difference between them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that in a minute.  The Minister should not anticipate too far ahead.  Neither is there anything to show, as far as I can see, that these requirements can be better met by a unit attached to an indigenous industry promotion agency than if they are handled by one involved in overseas firms.  In the logic of this Bill it could be in either place.  I do not see any reason it should be in either, and nothing the Minister said convinces me that there is any reason for it.  There is no convincing case for the merging of Eolas with any other agency, that is the nub of this.  Certainly there is no convincing case for merging Eolas with Forbairt, which is what is proposed, or the IDA.</P>
      <P>To be fair, I suppose one could say there is a case for merging Eolas with a single industrial development agency if we were to retain one.  There could be a case for example &mdash; and I can imagine how it would be made &mdash; for merging Eolas with the IDA as it is today, but there is no case for merging Eolas with either part of a sundered IDA, which is what this Bill proposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other part of this split IDA is to be the new IDA which will have the mission of attracting overseas firms to Ireland and facilitating further expansion of overseas firms here.  Again, we see the incoherence in this Bill.  What is so different about the development needs of overseas firms which justifies the creation of a totally new body?  They fall into two categories.  There are, on the one hand, the multinationals which seem to need assistance here only to the extent that they are looking for grant assistance, to benefit from the tax regimes or various schemes.  They are not looking for assistance or advice here on how to run their operation, in fact most of the activities of Irish branches of multinational corporations are planned by the parent corporation. Their planning and investment programmes &mdash; even their marketing &mdash; is usually done for them by the central planning structure of the firm.  I am delighted that there are many foreign firms here, in spite of the best efforts of some of the gurus on the Left to demonise <Col N="1893" /> foreign industry, who are in exactly the same position when it comes to technology development as any Irish firm. Firms on their own are looking for assistance with programmes to support them in research and development, in the development of their technology, in knowing what is going on in their sector and in deciding how to latch on to the latest bandwagon or even get ahead of it. There is nothing to differentiate them from indigenous firms which would justify the super bureaucratic structure proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 9 of the Bill deals with the allocation of powers and functions to the agencies, it is a masterpiece of vagueness and ambiguity and should not be foisted on unsuspecting entrepreneurs.  We have to look at it from their point of view. They will now be faced with this whole new superstructure.  If they thought it was difficult to deal with the IDA and other bodies they will find it twice as difficult to deal with this proliferation of bodies. There are even more, because in addition to all these agencies, although we have not heard much about it, there is supposed to be an employment protection unit in the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  The Minister of State has told us at various stages what sections of the Department, the IDA and the Employment Protection Unit are doing in various emergencies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>This unit is to provide advisory services to small firms, regardless of whether they are experiencing difficulties or trading well and eager to grow.  I am reading from the Government programme.  This is a kind of polyvalent unit that can do everything for any firm. If we have that kind of unit in the Department why do we need the IDA and Forbairt and two autonomous agencies to be co-ordinated by Forfás.  It is more incoherence and bureaucracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are curious provisions in section 12 of the Bill about how these monsters and the inarticulate outfits to be set up <Col N="1894" /> will deal with grant packages.  Section 12 provides that Government approval will be needed for any grant package exceeding £2.5 million.  It also requires that specific approval will be needed for any further grant to an individual project of £2.5 million or more and that means a single stage project looking for grant assistance of £2.6 million or more needs specific Government approval.  If, on the other hand, a project can be carried out in two stand alone stages in two successive years, and in the first year £2 million is required and another £2 million in the second year, Government approval is not needed because the project falls under the limit of £2 million for the first grant. Therefore, it does not have to go to the Government and, in the second year the project is getting an increment of less than £2.5 million so Government approval is not needed there, whereas if the project cost £.5 million over that one would need the full panoply of Government approval and all the delays that can go with that.</P>

      <P>I am very much afraid that what is happening here is that because the Government does not have a clear policy it is trying to divert attention by having new gimmicks for the sake of having new gimmicks.  There is nothing in this Bill to indicate any shift in the direction of industrial policy or any change in the inspiration of quality of industrial policy. We will get old goods in new packages, but they will be just more packages with more red tape.  The result will be more rather than less incoherence in Government industrial policy, more rather than less difficulty for entrepreneurs and more rather than fewer people unemployed.</P>

      <P>It is important when major changes are taking place in the IDA that there be recognition of the excellent work undertaken by the IDA in the past.  I do not wish to be parochial but I want to pay tribute to the manager and staff in the IDA office in my north east region for the excellent work they have done.  We were fortunate to have a manager who was very good at carrying out his responsibilities but who also has a depth of intellect and a good philosophy in regard to industrial development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in his speech referred to Culliton, pointing out that industrial development comes about through the harmonisation of a broad range of factors.  I wish to refer to that aspect of <Col N="1896" /> his contribution.  I have referred to this previously on Second Stage of the Finance Bill and in the budget debate.  I am concerned about the lack of co-ordination between various public authorities, public Departments, local authorities and agencies.  There is a lack of focus on job creation and on the maintenance of existing jobs.  The Minister referred to a fact, of which the former Government can be proud, that 118,500 jobs were created between 1987 and 1992.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Some 108,000 jobs were lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfortunate that 108,000 jobs were lost during that period. Could more jobs have been created or fewer jobs lost if there had been a more co-ordinated approach and a greater sense of urgency in those agencies to which I referred of the need to create jobs?  The Programme for Government refers to the requirements for industrial development.  One of the points in the programme is that the Government will encourage a dynamic new spirit of enterprise. It is appropriate when this new organisation is being established that all Departments of State, local authorities and agencies should examine their area of activity to see what they can do to assist in creating more jobs and prevent the loss of jobs.  I am concerned about the gap between the theory of job creation and the implementation of various plans to create jobs.  I recognise the excellent work performed by public servants, but I wonder if the lack of co-ordination or a rigid implementation of the law hinders the creation of jobs.  Most Departments of State have a role to play in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill deals with the co-ordination of Forfás and the local authorities.  Local authorities have major responsibilities. For example, one local authority has not processed 55 per cent of planning applications within the statutory two months. Local authorities must also be considered in regard to job creation.  Job creation is not just the responsibility of the Department <Col N="1897" /> of Enterprise and Employment. Co-ordination between various Departments must also be considered.  I am aware of a meat factory which received an order for 20 tonnes of beefburgers, but because a new European Community directive had not been implemented and a decision was not made in this regard by the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Finance, that order was lost.  Those matters should be addressed. There should be more co-operation between Departments and they should focus more on job creation.  Perhaps in that way more jobs could be created and existing jobs secured.</P>
    <P>People come to Ireland to pursue educational studies.  Recently the Taoiseach made a successful visit to Malaysia.  I am sure more people will travel to our country to pursue educational studies, particularly at third level.  The Department of Justice has major responsibility in the provision of visas for those people and that is an area which must be considered to avoid a bureaucratic barrier to people coming to this country to pursue educational studies.</P>
    <P>We must also consider co-ordination between the new bodies being established and other bodies with responsibilities. In my region there is the International Fund for Ireland and the Interreg programme.  How will the activities of the bodies with responsibility for such programmes be co-ordinated?  This raises the question of the central and regional responsibilities of Departments. Deputy Dukes suggested that the Department of Enterprise and Employment should carry out much of the work in regard to job creation.  I would prefer responsibility to be devolved.  For example, should the responsibility FEOGA now has be devolved to the regions because it has an important role to play, particularly in the food industry? It could play its role in association with Forfás, Forbairt and IDA Ireland which will deal with foreign industries.  I would question whether the responsibility FEOGA now has should be devolved to the regions rather than managed centrally.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1898" /> Which body will have responsibility for firms in Northern Ireland, in Belfast for example?  Will responsibility be given to IDA Ireland or Forbairt for such firms? There is a danger of overlap in this regard and this area needs to be teased out carefully.</P>
    <P>I have referred to whether rigid implementation of the law hinders employment creation and the maintenance of existing jobs.  Do local authorities take their responsibility in regard to job creation seriously?  I referred to delays in the planning process in regard to rigid implementation of the law and how this may adversely affect job creation.  I am in favour of laws enacted by the Houses of the Oireachtas being implemented, but I would query whether rigid implementation of law should interfere with job creation or the maintenance of existing jobs.  All Departments of State and their agencies, local authorities, including health boards through the environmental health service, have a major role to play in regard to job creation and the maintenance of existing jobs.  Those bodies should be instructed to focus more on job creation.  There should be a rapid response mechanism when problems arise, like that to which I referred in regard to the Departments of Finance and Agriculture, Food and Forestry no decision was taken in regard to the implementation of a European Community directive.  Where there is evidence of a lack of urgency or a lack of focus on job creation, some sort of penalty should be imposed rather than the issue of a circular letter from the Minister responsible.  All Departments and agencies of State must focus on job creation and act in co-ordination with the new bodies established.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy O'Hanlon, for sharing his time with me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill and to highlight a number of aspects of it.  Before I concentrate on those aspects I would like to address the misconception that the Government are <Col N="1899" /> being complacent about the unacceptably high level of unemployment.</P>
    <P>When the Taoiseach was first elected 17 months ago he stated at his subsequent press conference that creating jobs would be his highest priority.  In the Fianna Fáil six point plan for national progress, the first point was entitled &ldquo;Making Jobs The First Priority&rdquo;&mdash; indeed, a large portion of the recommendations made in that document are contained in this Bill.  Following on from that the Programme for a Partnership Government highlights most of what is contained in this Bill.  This week in Copenhagen, the Taoiseach announced the plans for a new Government scheme to take 30,000 people off the unemployment register over the next 18 months.  The Taoiseach outlined this scheme during the EC Summit.  He stated that the scheme would form a part of the National Plan due to be submitted to Brussels next month.  This surely highlights the fact that Fianna Fáil are committed to creating jobs.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the industrial policy review group chaired by Mr. Jim Culliton and the task force chaired by Dr. Paddy Moriarty.  The effect of Culliton was to widen the whole industrial policy debate.  Culliton built on his new analysis by calling for a different approach in which the requirements of industrial development would become the driving force in many areas of economic and social activity.  The Moriarty task force reinforced and undertook with great commitment the difficult job of translating the need for a more co-ordinated approach to enterprise development.</P>
    <P>I wish to put on record my appreciation of the outstanding work done by the Industrial Development Authority over the past number of years.  People criticise the IDA for occasional mishaps but it is always able to hold its own against any development agency in the world.  It is in competition with agencies from more developed and better off economies and has succeeded in attracting many worthwhile industries to Ireland.</P>
    <P>I appreciate also the work carried out <Col N="1900" /> by our local development agency, the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  SFADCo has done outstanding work in developing large and small firms, indigenous and foreign.  Its success can be seen in the initial financial services centre set up in Shannon which led to the establishment of the centre in Dublin.  The promotion in Dublin and Shannon has led to many outstanding companies coming to Ireland and establishing financial services and other industries.</P>
    <P>North Kerry is now within the remit of SFADCo for industry and tourism purposes. I wish to take this opportunity to thank the local manager, Ogie Moran, for his work in this area.  He has shown tremendous drive and initiative as he did on the football field.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>In the past few years many tourism developments have taken place in Tralee in which Ogie Moran and SFADCo have played a major part.  The importance of this can be seen in the early success of GPA, which we should not now ignore.  GPA was the motivating force behind the aviation park in Shannon. It was also the impetus behind the aerospace project which employs hundreds of young people.  I compliment the Shannon Free Airport Development Company on establishing financial services and high technology industries in the Shannon aviation park.  It was a novel proposition and has made an impact on employment in the mid west. This is why it is important to put on record the vital importance of maintaining the trans-Atlantic stopover at Shannon.  Shannon has been a success story for many years.  It was thought in 1958-59, when SFADCo was established the fall in aviation business meant Shannon as a location would fail.  That has all been turned around.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of the aviation park and the initiative drive and incentives in the region mean Shannon is thriving. While jobs have unfortunately been lost in some industries there, business in <Col N="1901" /> the industrial estate in the mid west are strong.  This is largely due to the efforts of SFADCo, battling against the decline of the trans-Atlantic business, shrinking markets and changes in transport patterns. When one system has become out-moded SFADCo has succeeded in moving quickly into a new area and developing new ideas and trends.  The aviation park is a unique development which will be of great importance in the future.</P>
    <P>The Bill addresses the need for the restructuring of industrial agencies.  It establishes the new State agency structures for industrial development.  The creation of the new bodies represents a major step forward in the development and implementation of industrial policy in Ireland, as highlighted in the &ldquo;Employment Through Enterprise&rdquo; report.</P>
    <P>Three new bodies will be created, Forfás, Forbairt and IDA (Ireland). Each of the agencies will be autonomous and will have its own board.  Each will have its own distinct mission and goals. Forfás will be responsible for overall policy co-ordination and administration. It will also play a proactive role in ensuring co-ordination in those areas of industrial development currently outside the parameters of the Department of Enterprise and Employment, such as food and foreign trade.</P>
    <P>Forbairt will develop indigenous industry by bringing together the existing functions of Eolas and the IDA.  Forbairt will work closely with An Bord Tráchtála and will focus on industrial development from the perspective of competitive advantage at the level of the individual firm.  Its regional and sectoral based approach will build upon this company based approach. This new approach will lead to a more effective response to the needs of the individual enterprise.</P>
    <P>IDA (Ireland) will continue to promote the attraction of overseas industry to Ireland.  It will strengthen its efforts within the single European market.  IDA (Ireland) will demonstrate the attractiveness of Ireland in terms of other factor advantages, such as the quality of the labour force, our clean environment and <Col N="1902" /> other infrastructural assets such as our excellent telecommunications system.</P>
    <P>The creation of these new bodies represents a major step forward in the development and implementation of industrial policy in Ireland.  To put this Bill into context I would like to briefly outline its progress as I see it.  The parameters of the Bill were explored and developed through the work of the Industrial Policy Review Group.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill should not be taken separately.  It should be examined in the broader aspects and we must also examine the provisions in the Finance Act, 1993, which were introduced to encourage the growth of small enterprises and remove the barriers to investment in such businesses.</P>
    <P>As I have already stated, this Bill was outlined in the Programme for a Partnership Government.  The programme states that the Government would strengthen Ireland's industrial, scientific and exporting base; increase the level of directly productive activity; encourage a dynamic spirit of enterprise; put a new emphasis on building up small industry; and broaden industrial strategy to take in all the factors that affect output and productivity.</P>
    <P>The Moriarty task force re-emphasised this programme and undertook the difficult task.</P>
    <P>The Government outlined its proposals in the document <i>Employment Through Enterprise,</i> in the areas of taxation, energy, ports, communications, transport, environment, commercial State enterprises, education and training and competition policy.</P>
    <P>The most far-seeing aspect of this approach is that from this point onwards the formulation and implementation of industrial policy will include all aspects of public policy which have a significant impact on the creation and maintenance of competitive enterprises in the industrial sector.</P>
    <P>So far as the industrial development agencies are concerned, the conclusion of the Culliton report was that their role is an important but limited one.  When reviewing industrial performance there <Col N="1903" /> has been a tendency to date to believe that the agencies are responsible for job creation and also for any failure to meet this country's employment needs, when in fact the situation is that the current agent structures are inhibiting the most efficient and effective development of industry and we must change them.</P>
    <P>In the past we have generated more bureaucracy and red tape than was necessary, and by generating this red tape we inhibited prospective economic growth. The separation of indigenous and overseas functions, with the development of the three new agencies, will lead to a greater understanding of purpose at agency level.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to have had the opportunity to discuss this Bill.  As I have already stated, I welcome this Bill in general terms.  It is a very significant measure in its own right.  It is part of a far-seeing and progressive policy on the part of this Government, a policy that is very much in the Fianna Fáil tradition of promoting growth and enterprise.  It reaffirms Fianna Fáil's commitment to creating jobs and eliminating the red tape that has hindered us in previous efforts to create employment and tackle the high level of unemployment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important legislation, although I am not sure that I welcome the Bill before the House.  I am not convinced that it will have the desired effect.  The starting point at which this debate should begin is the very <i>raison d'etre</i> of agencies such as this.  If one adds to the 300,000 on the live register the number who are on FÁS courses, on social employment schemes and those who, by one foul stroke or another, have been removed from the live register, one realises we have a problem on our hands far in excess of 300,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be recognised that over a number of years the IDA made valiant efforts to attract investment to this country against stiff opposition from abroad.  It also facilitated indigenous industrial <Col N="1904" /> development here.  The economic climate within which the IDA operates is significant and cannot be ignored in a debate such as this.  In that context, the fundamental economic environment for employment creation cannot be divorced from this debate.  In order for a person to avail of a job opportunity the climate must be attractive.  Unfortunately, because of the linkages between our tax and welfare systems very often it is not economically viable for an unemployed person to extract himself from the vice-like grip of the welfare code and enter the marketplace by taking up a job.</P>
    <P>It must also be attractive for investors and people with money to take risks with their capital in job creation.  In both instances the Government is to blame for lack of job creation.  Who would risk their hard earned capital in job creation when they can put it in bank accounts where they get returns for in excess of anything they would receive by risking their money in job creation?  Until such time as the special savings accounts which are available at present are made less attractive the task of the IDA in encouraging indigenous industrial development, in particular, will be more difficult.  We may talk about all sorts of structures but until the fundamental problems are solved the IDA will be burdened with a load which it will find difficult to carry.</P>
    <P>Red tape and bureaucracy are anathema to people endeavouring to set up in business and employ others.  This Bill is a recipe for further bureaucracy and red tape.  It has all the hallmarks of empire building, with a number of State agencies and boards involved in industrial development.  Another hallmark of this Bill is compromise between Government Ministers, namely, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, and the Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy McCreevy.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that in reply to a Dáil question of mine yesterday asking the Minister for Enterprise and Employment about specific targets his Department had set itself in terms of the unemployment crisis, the Minister trotted out what is becoming a very irksome and irritating <Col N="1905" /> response, that the Government has been in office for only X number of months and has not yet had an opportunity to set targets.  That response is trotted out all too often by Ministers in an effort to cover up their shortcomings.  As it is almost nine months since the last general election surely the Minister would have come to terms with his brief and set legitimate targets in terms of resolving the unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>The Bill is largely about cosmetic surgery. In no way does it address the fundamental problems of unemployment. For the Taoiseach and Ministers to announce throughout the country that X number of jobs have been created is no substitute for policy.  About two or three weeks ago the Minister for Enterprise and Employment visited Cork and announced the creation of a series of jobs.  The announcement made headlines in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> that Saturday. Each Saturday I hold a clinic in Millstreet.  On the same day that the Minister announced, at a press conference in the city, the creation of an additional 25 jobs in Alps Electric, which provides valuable employment in the town, 25 people had received their last pay cheque from that company, and an additional 25 people were laid off the following week.  That sort of posturing without substance or policy is an insult to the 300,000 people who are unemployed. No later than yesterday, the Taoiseach on his return from the EC Heads of State Summit spoke about 30,000 jobs. Undoubtedly the funding we will secure &mdash; the exact amount has not been determined yet &mdash; will create additional jobs, but the public is becoming increasingly cynical about announcements when there seems to be very little substance to many of them.  It shows little regard for the feelings of the people who are unemployed.</P>
    <P>Some people have likened the Bill to a rearrangement of the deck chairs on the <i>Titanic</i>, but I would not be as defeatist as that.  However, the Bill is fundamentally flawed in a number of areas, for example, it is very short in outlining policy.  Coming from the Cork North-West <Col N="1906" /> constituency I want to familiarise the Minister with the number of agencies that will be involved in job creation in my constituency.  As the constituency includes the Gaeltacht area, Údarás na Gaeltachta will be involved.  The Gaeltacht has secured Leader funding and therefore that body is involved.  The County Enterprise Board and the IDA, particularly Forbairt, are involved and SFADCo, which operates in a small corner of the constituency.  Where do potential investors, who are not familiar with bureaucracy and for whom bureaucracy and red tape are anathema, begin? Do they go to the Leader programme &mdash; there are three Leader programmes in operation in the constituency &mdash; to Údarás na Gaeltachta, Forbairt, SFADCo or the County Enterprise Board, or do they avoid all of them, as many people tend to do because they get bogged down in bureaucracy?  This is a legitimate question.  Layer upon layer of red tape and bureaucracy stifles initiative. In order to facilitate industrial development we should lift this weight of bureaucracy from the shoulders of people who are prepared to invest their time, money and abilities in job creation.</P>
    <P>There has been much ado in this debate about the Culliton report and undoubtedly there are laudable objectives in that report.  However, rather than interpreting and taking on the Culliton report the Government decided, with the classic kick to touch, to set up the Moriarty task force to review the Culliton report.  It then undertook its own review of the Moriarty recommendations. Because some very thorny and unacceptable disection of responsibilities then occurred we had the Quinn v. McCreevy debacle at the Cabinet table.  This has resulted in a mish-mash report on the Cabinet review of the Government review of the Moriarty review of the Culliton report.  Then we have the six agencies which will now be involved in my constituency in developing and promoting job creation.  Is it any wonder that there is such scepticism and pessimism about the Government's ability to resolve unemployment?  A great many people <Col N="1907" /> take the view that what is really involved is cosmetic surgery to give the appearance of doing something while in reality achieving nothing for the unemployed.</P>
    <P>Figures have been extensively quoted about the number of jobs created by the IDA in recent years.  The figures are credible and 118,000 jobs are not to be sneered at.  Unfortunately, the down side is that the net increase is only 10,000  108,000 jobs have been lost in the intervening period.  That is the critical factor in assessing industrial policy.  We have the ability to compete with the best. The IDA had the ability in terms of creating jobs here despite the strictures placed on it by Government policy and economic circumstances.  They could compete with other international development agencies.</P>
    <P>Too little time and energy have been directed towards the preservation of jobs.  A classic example of that is what is happening in the clothing and footwear industry.  The IDA has striven in recent years in this sector to halt the jobs lost because of the alarming cost differential between manufacturing bases here and in the UK and particularly in the Far East.  Despite all of that, we have built up a reasonable textile and footwear manufacturing industry.  Yet in one fell swoop the Government can undermine all that with an imposition of VAT which every day is causing the loss of jobs. There is no coherent industrial policy emerging from the Government.  Both the Minister and Deputy Dukes referred to the job preservation unit in the Department.  It is an ineffective token.  It achieved nothing since its establishment and will achieve nothing.  We have no job preservation policy.</P>
    <P>With hindsight, I question the wisdom of the decision in this House to abolish Fóir Teoranta.  The Companies (Amendment) Bill was used as the pretext for that.  It is now clear beyond doubt that an agency charged with responsibility for job preservation on a statutory basis is necessary.  We must reconsider the possibility of re-establishing Fóir Teoranta.</P>
    <P>This legislation is short on policy and <Col N="1908" /> on initiatives.  The Culliton report is used as a fig leaf to cover up inadequate legislation. There is little information in this Bill about the Government's view on attracting further multinational investment. Should we move away from intensive capital investment in plant and machinery or should we move-towards equity investment as suggested by Culliton? In that regard, this legislation does not acknowledge the recommendations of Culliton.  Culliton suggested that we should tilt the balance in terms of the moneys available for industrial investment in favour of indigenous industry. We seem to be setting up two State agencies, IDA Ireland and Forbairt, without any indication as to the magnitude of each of these enterprises or the policies which will underpin them.  For all those reasons, this legislation is seriously flawed.  It is the classic compromise highlighting the tensions at the Cabinet table and highlighting the fact that with regard to job creation policies the cupboard is bare.  There is no flair, initiative or backbone and there is no policy-making in this legislation.  It is a fudged compromise which will achieve nothing. It will not contribute to reducing the unacceptably high level of unemployment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputy Michael Ahern.  I see that Deputy Creed is shedding crocodile tears today but he was not a Member of the House and cannot be blamed for some of the things which were done between 1983 and 1987.  Deputy Creed says the Bill is short on substance, but as a result of this Bill we do not want to establish three organisations whose hands are tied, who cannot do the job.  Nine times out of ten legislation introduced here is enabling legislation.  This Bill will deal with future development and future industrial strategy for this country.  It is no harm to reflect on how we have fared.  Over the past number of years the IDA has done a good job but because of the worldwide economic climate in many cases their efforts have been thwarted because of jobs losses.  If it had not been for their <Col N="1909" /> efforts, where would we be today?  On Deputy Creed's figures we would be talking in terms of 400,000 unemployed.  It is in that light that we should consider the entire operation of the IDA over the years.</P>
      <P>In the context of this Bill we should look at our problems with regard to infrastructure and incentives.  Recently two or three major projects have been snapped away from this country by other EC member states who were prepared to present grant packages which were way beyond anything that could be considered here.  When we seek multinationals to set up in Ireland we must look at their track records.  They are the sort of people who will move from country to country and from continent to continent for profits.  They are there for profits and we have to accept that.  In doing so, we should look at where we can out-score other countries.  We can out-score other countries with our education system which produces people of a calibre not found in any of the countries against whom we are competing.</P>
      <P>Our computer industry has been successful, despite the hiccups, and that was as a result of the educational background, the type of graduates and general personnel available to multinationals who come here and create the atmosphere for job creation.  We must remember that if people cannot see something for their efforts they will not create jobs whether in business employing two people or larger concerns.  The multinationals go for the highest net profit on their balance sheets and make no apologies for that.  Their responsibility is to their shareholders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is time we recognised that some areas are more disadvantaged than others.  In this respect Deputy Creed is lucky to have organisations such as Údarás na Gaeltachta operating in his constituency. My area has suffered enormously through loss of its young people and we have the highest rate of third-level pupils <i>per capita</i> in the country.  Where do they go when we have educated them?  They go to Irish cities or abroad.  Those young people are not given an opportunity to <Col N="1910" /> remain in their localities because the industries that could employ them do not exist in their regions.  Many multinationals will not head towards the north-west because of the lack of a proper infrastructure. Our area was the last to have automatic telephone dialling but I accept the digital system now in operation is the best in the country.</P>
    <P>We should sound a word of warning to the new agencies.  Their function will be to create jobs but they will have to be risk-takers with regard to grant-aid and the provision of capital.  We should not criticise people because one decision out of ten may go wrong.  The person who makes six out of ten correct decisions is on the right road.  We have heard too often here the IDA and other grant-aiding agencies being attacked and not being in a position to defend themselves.</P>
    <P>With 300,000 people unemployed we must be risk-takers and create a climate to encourage people who are capable of creating jobs to do so.  They will not do so if their position is jeopradised by lending institutions or others.  In conjunction with the passage of this Bill our lending institutions should be asked to play a more pivotal role, especially in regard to small indigenous companies. We have now very low interest rates but the difference between what is paid to depositors and charged to borrowers is enormous, in the latter case the amount running into double figures.  That cannot be allowed to continue.  Lending institutions should examine the margins.</P>
    <P>We must also examine the system of taxing single people.  People involved in the clothing industry or any labour-intensive operation are being squeezed out of business by the sweat shops of the Far East and so on.  We do not want to see a sweatshop mentality here.  It is important that these labour-intensive industries be examined by the new agencies and given whatever encouragement is necessary to enable them compete on a reasonably level playing field.  The position of cheap EC imports should be examined also.</P>
    <P>Our well educated young people are being sold cheaply, to put it mildly, to other nations to help boost foreign economies. <Col N="1911" /> We must create the economic climate to secure jobs for them at home.  I am sure that at the end of the term of office of this Government the initiatives taken under this Bill will have helped reduce the unemployment figure to something in the region of 200,000. Those who criticise the job creation initiatives taken at national and European level should remember that these are people who want to work.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to be afforded an opportunity to contribute to the debate on this important Bill which will be of special importance for job creation.  The greatest problem confronting this and future Governments will be our enormous unemployment figures. I should like to compliment the Industrial Development Authority on their excellent work over the years which, as has been acknowledged by Deputy Creed, led to the creation of 118,500 jobs between 1987 and 1992 in a most difficult world climate.  That was an excellent result by that industrial promotion agency.</P>

      <P>The Industrial Review Group drew attention to the limited success of existing policies and approaches for the further development of industry, in particular, to the poor results achieved by indigenous industries.  It recommended a change in the structure of the industrial development agencies to give new impetus to indigenous industries and the promotion of investment within the country.  Indeed, the intention of this Bill is to put those recommendations into action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure there is no politician who over the years has not received complaints from Irish industrialists wishing to start up businesses about their experiences when seeking assistance from State agencies.  I hope the provisions of this Bill will constitute a new impetus, aiding those who wish to set up their own industries <Col N="1912" /> with more help from both the IDA and Eolas.</P>
    <P>In recent decades industrial policy has been led by the relative success of the IDA in attracting overseas industries. That has been of tremendous significance, but has tended to distract attention from the failure to develop a strong, leading-edge indigenous industry. Indeed, this leading-edge, indigenous industry is a fundamental requirement of our national advancement. Nonetheless, the task of developing indigenous industry is difficult and demanding, more so than the task of attracting mobile projects here.  To be successful it will necessitate a different focus and commitment.  The new agencies, especially Forfás, will be responsible for this new focus.</P>
    <P>In the past heavy emphasis was placed on the provision of grants to finance projects for the production of goods and services with the object of creating jobs. The allocation of a large amount of Exchequer resources has not achieved the necessary results.  For example, a whole range of analyses &mdash; most recently the Culliton report &mdash; concluded that the relatively poor performance of Irish industry related to factors of scale, such as management, marketing expertise, product development and technology and that those weaknesses were due in part to the encouragement of a dependency culture within Irish business, fostered by the emphasis being placed on grants and incentives by the industrial promotion agencies.  In industrial promotion policies we must now adopt a market-led and enterprise-based approach.  In this Bill the emphasis is being put on that approach.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to amalgamate Eolas and the IDA.  During the years Eolas has provided a great service to industry.  The value of the work it has done for small businessmen and companies has not been recognised.  However, it only provided advice in the area of technology.  The IDA provided expertise in the area of management and company development. In many instances Eolas and the IDA worked from two sides and did not come <Col N="1913" /> together.  Now that they are to be amalgamated in one agency, to be known as Forfás, there will be liaison and one will be able to avail of their expertise in one agency in the areas of technology, management and company development with the result that industry will benefit.</P>
    <P>I note that the NSAI will no longer be associated with Eolas.  Again, this is of importance from the point of view of industry.  The NSAI makes the ISO and other awards.  When Eolas and the NSAI were under the one roof the standing of those awards was questioned, but now that the NSAI will be an independent body those awards will be looked at in a different light.</P>
    <P>It is vitally important that research and development be carried out in industry. During the past few years the funding available for research and development has been greatly increased.  As a result many of our graduates can stay at home to carry out research and development in industry.  There is evidence to suggest that new hi-tech industries are being developed due to the fact that our graduates, instead of moving abroad to work for Philips or Siemens or to Japan, are staying at home to carry out research and development to produce goods and technology which can be developed here rather than abroad when they would have to be imported at great expense.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister stressed in his speech that it is his intention to ensure that funding for research and development projects will continue to be provided because it is his belief that if we fail to increase the funding available for research and development we will not develop indigenous industries.  The steps taken by the Minister and the Government in this Bill are positive, will benefit industry and lead to an increase in employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Two remarkable facts would strike any foreigner immediately on looking at the State of Ireland for the first time from the outside in 1993.  First, Ireland is the only country in the world where a married man with four children earning £8,000 per annum is better off <Col N="1914" /> than a married man with four children earning £15,000 per annum.  Second, one of the great political and diplomatic triumphs of the Government in recent years, of which it regularly boasts, is that it has acquired from the United States the right to an almost unlimited number of emigrant work visas to enable its citizens to settle in that country.</P>
      <P>Ireland is therefore a sick society.  Its economy, so far as employment is concerned, is gravely ill.  One of its Government's principal reactions to that situation, after full consideration by an expert commission, is to reject most of the recommendations of the commission and produce this Bill.  After six months of intensive and very productive work the Culliton Review Group produced an unusually powerful and coherent report. Its messages are clear.  It is equally clear that its messages have been rejected, both in this Bill and this year's budget, each of which equally flies in the face of the Culliton report.</P>
      <P>The explanatory memorandum to this Bill refers to the Culliton report twice &mdash; first, in respect of a trivial recommendation to charge for services under section 7 and, second, to expand the triennial reviews of industrial performance to include a policy under section 13, which again is a minor recommendation. Outside these two points the Department cannot find any specific recommendations of the Culliton report in the Bill to which it can refer.</P>
      <P>From the time the Culliton Review Group reported its report has been the subject of shameless political manoeuverings. The strength and coherence of its recommendations as a unit were such that the Government likes to justify its unpopular actions by referring to it.  It does this even when it is acting in clear defiance of the Culliton report, as in the increase of 400 per cent which it imposed on local telephone charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Government that was in office in January 1992 by and large accepted the Culliton report's recommendations, both in the spirit and the letter, the Government that came into office in February 1992 decided, for no <Col N="1915" /> obvious or compelling reason, to take a different view while continuing to pay nominal lip service to the recommendations. The present Government, which dates from January 1993, has gone even further in this direction.  I find it depressing that arguably one of the best public policy reports every produced is jettisoned in this way.</P>
    <P>While this Bill relates entirely to agencies which are important in themselves as instruments of policy, they are not necessarily the most important part of what the Culliton report suggested needed to be done.  Our requirements as a country with a huge unemployment problem relate to public policy generally, particularly to fiscal policy.  Ireland is the European country with arguably the greatest obstacles to industrial development and expansion.  The Culliton report makes it clear that we need to tackle these obstacles on a broad front cutting across every Department of State.  The report also makes it clear that we need to streamline and rationalise our agencies and the delivery of our support services.</P>
    <P>In the past six months not alone are we not doing any of this but we are actually making the position worse.  The backward movement culminates in this Bill which creates a layer of further institutions and quangos and which fragments further the unity of purpose which we require.  Where once we had one Department dealing with industrial development we now have three.  Instead of fewer agencies we have more, and instead of the famed one-stop-shop, as it used to be called, we now have as many stops as an underground train.</P>
    <P>The biggest joke of all is the proposal for 36 county enterprise boards referred to by the Minister, but which are not mentioned in the Bill.  Needless to say, Culliton never recommended such nonsense. While these boards will apparently come under the aegis of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, their genesis was the Department of the Taoiseach where they were dreamed up in September 1992 apparently as some kind of personal and political counterweight <Col N="1916" /> to me and to Culliton and for the purposes of the then obviously planned election. The Minister appears to have reined back these boards from some of the lunacies proposed for them last September, nonetheless they will serve no useful purpose and only get in Forbairt's way.  If the Government was genuinely committed to these boards it would abolish Údarás na Gaeltachta and SFADCo as, logically, the boards and regional agencies can hardly co-exist.  The fact that SFADCo and Údarás na Gaeltachta are to continue is indicative of how pointless the Minister thinks the county enterprise boards are.  If that is his view, he should not establish them.</P>
    <P>The central institutional prominence in the Bill is given to Forfás.  In my proposals of October last, when I was forced to have a central body against my will and against the recommendations of Culliton, I proposed simply a holding company which would be run by the Secretary of the Department.  It seems from the Bill that Forfás will be a great deal more than a holding company.  Under the Bill it has the possibility of becoming a single super agency with two subsidiary bodies completely under its thumb.  This has nothing to recommend it and, in spite of his efforts in his remarkably visionless and defensive speech this morning, the Minister cannot justify it either.</P>
    <P>A great deal will depend on the appointment of the chief executives to the three bodies referred to in the Bill.  I have seen newspaper reports to the effect that, Mr. Kieran McGowan, the managing director of the IDA, will be the chief executive of Forfás, the central company.  That has not been denied and I assume it is true.  If Mr. McGowan, possibly the best person available to run one of these agencies, is made the chief executive of Forfás it will inevitably mean that the centre of gravity moves there and it will become the dominant agency. Forbairt is the most important of the agencies from the point of view of our national need, and the difficulties experienced in indigenous industries for so long.  I should like to see the best person available appointed to Forbairt and not <Col N="1917" /> to an agency above it in relation to which Forbairt, in effect, will be only a subsidiary.</P>
    <P>The whole thrust of what Culliton recommended, and which I whole-heartedly accepted as I believed he was right, was that our weakness was on the indigenous side, that there was a major difference between the attraction, assistance and promotion of overseas companies and the promotion and development of indigenous companies. Overseas companies do not usually require assistance with marketing and research and development and they do not require hand-holding in the broadest sense of the word.  On the other hand, our indigenous companies need all these things.  Culliton and the numerous groups, people, bodies and institutions who looked at our economic problems identified the two great weaknesses of our manufacturing companies as marketing and research and development. That is why Culliton recommended that Eolas and An Bord Tráchtála should be amalgamated to form one agency with the indigenous side of the present IDA. That is the agency with all the challenges and difficulties which we will have to promote successfully.</P>
    <P>The IDA which is a splendid organisation &mdash; I worked with it for seven or eight years &mdash; was always able to hide the drawbacks and deficiencies on the indigenous side by highlighting its undoubted successes overseas.  Under the present proposals there will not be a distinction between the two sides, which Culliton thought was vital.  In 1977-78 when almost no effort was being made to promote small industry here, I gave that specific task on a pilot basis to Shannon Development.  The company carried out its task quite well but, more importantly than succeeding in its own region, it provoked the IDA into doing something it had never bothered to do before.  The value of that kind of inter-institutional rivalry, when it can be used in a useful and positive way, is frequently under-estimated. Instead we have jurisdictional defence between various agencies.  God knows, enough of that went on in the <Col N="1918" /> lead-up to this Bill.  One of the reasons the Bill is imperfect and removed from Culliton is that the defence was successful.</P>
    <P>It does not seem clear, even to the Minister, where is the centre of gravity. He referred to the incorporation of Eolas with Forfás and later referred to the integration of Eolas with Forbairt.  I do not think these statements are misprints.  He envisages this integration in respect of both institutions.  This should not happen.  Eolas should be integrated with Forbairt, there should be no question about it going anywhere else.</P>
    <P>In that connection, the Minister referred to science and technology which he wants to assure people will not be downgraded.  He paid the usual lip service to science and technology when he said:</P>
    <P>Technology development is a vital part of company development and it is something which Irish firms are showing a growing awareness of.  This was demonstrated by the huge demand for the new Structural Funds supported industry R &amp; D scheme launched by my Department last year.</P>
    <P>Of course, that is nonsense.  There was a huge demand for Structural Funds supported research and development schemes but it nearly all came from the universities, so much so that about a year ago I was forced to set up an informal association of people in indigenous companies interested in research and development to give than a voice and co-ordinate and assist in applications for these funds.  My Department was inundated with applications from universities which are highly skilled in this area and, inevitably, they get the vast bulk of the assistance available.  That is the truth of the matter rather than what the Minister described in his speech.  I hope that things are beginning to change in that respect and that we can interest Irish companies to a greater extent than heretofore.  The central reason that Culliton made the recommendations he did is because of the huge difference, as I have described, between the requirements of indigenous <Col N="1919" /> companies and that of overseas companies.  It seems to be a very great pity that this difference is fudged and that we will have another fudge that will result in a lack of transparency and that we will not have the clear cut division between the two which could have been so useful and, which, in my view, could have produced very fruitful results.</P>
    <P>I have gone carefully through the speech the Minister delivered this morning and it seems to be very similar to the speech he delivered in the Seanad.  I do not see any significant differences between them.  Why that is I really do not know.  What strikes me is that the speech is lacking in any vision of industrial promotional philosophy; it does not reflect the needs we have today and how we might respond to them.  More than three-quarters of the text is spent on defending the institutional proposals in the Bill, in particular, defending the parts, which is most of them, that run counter to the recommendations of the Culliton report.  Frankly, I do not think that is good enough.  Even though I do not agree with this Bill, it is important because it is making major changes, which I believe are in the wrong direction, and is not availing of the opportunities that are there.  This important Bill called for more than what we got. Whether the Minister in his reply will be able to do a bit better remains to be seen, but it is certainly very disappointing.</P>
    <P>There are many other areas of detail that I would like to dwell on, but at this stage I can only express my disappointment at the weakness of the speech and the lack of vision in it.  I extracted a list of the words and phrases that were used in the speech, which goes as follows: &ldquo;linking, co-ordinating, striking a balance, links in a chain, inter-departmental co-ordination and day-to-day interaction&rdquo;.  In my view that is a load of Government-speak to try to paper over the inherent fundamental structural flaws in this crazy agency jigsaw that has now been spawned.  The House should award the Minister a prize for audacity <Col N="1920" /> for the following sentence that appeared in the course of his speech:</P>
    <P>I have been anxious to guard against the creation of additional layers of bureaucracy when establishing the new structures.</P>
    <P>It is hard to believe that he said it, but he did.  I can give a list of how they go on and on.  Even on this very day the Taoiseach launched yet another body at Dublin Castle or Kilmainham, or one of the fashionable places that are used for these purposes, the National Economic and Social Forum.  That is different from the National Economic and Social Council and is also different from the Central Review Committee and different from the 36 county enterprise boards, the regional boards and the additional national boards.  If boards could have solved our problems, if the spending of billions of pounds could have solved our problems, we would not have any problems. We know that type of approach is not the solution; nonetheless the Government brings forward this Bill.  We know, therefore, that this Bill is not the solution.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill. It is a significant one designed to further indigenous industrial growth and encourage further investment in the Irish economy into the next century and beyond. For that reason I welcome its provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rural communities have had to learn the hard lesson that a centralised approach to the creation of employment has failed.  Certain areas of rural Ireland have been fortunate and have experienced employment growth, but in general a top down approach to the creation of employment in rural Ireland has failed. If evidence of this is required one only needs to look at the census of population figures for the various decades and one will see that there has been a flight from rural Ireland, that over the decades there has been a flight from the land.  Very often no replacement industry was put in place to enable people to experience a sense of place and the possibility of working <Col N="1921" /> in their own place.  That is the truth. It is in this context that I welcome the establishment of county enterprise boards, but I do so with certain reservations.</P>
    <P>During the course of the debate several Members outlined their fears of obfuscation, that there are too many boards and too many agencies dealing with the one problem &mdash; in other words, that there are too many chiefs and not enough Indians.  It is difficult to counter that argument because it is a truism that there is indeed a great number of organisations dealing with precisely the same objective. I would like to see what I would describe as a bottom up approach to the creation of employment.  It has been established in local communities throughout the length and breadth of Ireland that the public and private sectors operating separately and independently of one another have failed to halt rural decline.  This serves to indicate that partnerships are required and that partnership is desirable.</P>
    <P>In the context of the county enterprise boards, the area partnership companies and the enterprise trusts, a strong local organisation, where the people concerned have a sense of place and a sense of being in their own place, is without doubt the best way forward.  In this respect, while the Industrial Development Authority has done an excellent job &mdash; and no doubt the new agency Forbairt will do an excellent job also &mdash; it has to be accepted that in the past there has been a natural reluctance to bring new ideas to higher authorities.  Very often this is because there are real issues of disclosure of confidential business information.  The strength of local organisations in the employment creation process is that there is enthusiasm, a sense of place and belonging and a wish to make progress, to which I have already referred.  This in turn creates in the individual and throughout the community a sense of confidence and a spirit of hope which becomes part and parcel of a community's belief in how it should progress.</P>
    <P>It has been accepted both internationally <Col N="1922" /> and in Europe that there are certain guiding principles to the bottom up approach to the creation of employment which must be outlined.  These guiding principles can be ultilised when one speaks of creating employment in response to local demands and needs. The first theory is the concept of subsidiarity whereby decisions are taken at the lowest practical level.  In this way power is devolved through local control of funds.  It would be accepted by everybody that this principle should be adhered to.  In turn this leads to local accountability and reporting procedures which are an essential feature of the concept. It leads also to integrated planning which is so necessary to the concept because it leads to strategically focused plans.  Coherence is another principle which would be enunciated in this respect as would the question of participation involving an entire community in the planning process.  This in turn leads to the support of the community and enhances the status of local community organisations who want to do their best for their own place.</P>
    <P>Crucial to all of this is the concept of management.  In this respect one can look at the recent Leader programme at where it succeeded and failed.  Where management of the Leader programme was good, it succeeded in creating employment directly and indirectly; where management was poor the results were far from satisfactory and, in some few instances were disastrous.  The Leader experience has been extremely good, one that can be developed and spread throughout the country.  It is important that the pilot areas chosen for Leader funding should not be abandoned. There is an urgent need in the pilot areas for funding to continue.  Failure to continue with the Leader programme in the pilot areas concerned would mean that the job which was intended to be done will be less than half done.  This would be a tremendous pity, something which should not be allowed to happen.</P>
    <P>We must ensure so far as we possibly can at local level that the Leader programme and the partnership companies <Col N="1923" /> on the one hand and the county enterprise boards and other more national organisations on the other are not confused and that the concept of bureaucracy coming in the way of the creation of employment is not allowed to evolve.</P>
    <P>In this country many business people who could create employment will say that while some of the agencies and some of the individuals in the agencies concerned are excellent, an unnecessary amount of red tape and bureaucracy ultimately leads them to despair.  They throw their hands in the air and say: &ldquo;Let us forget about it because there is too much red tape and bureaucracy and there is no point in continuing with the effort&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is little doubt, therefore, that there is a great necessity for the compartmentalisation of the objectives of each of the organisations concerned.  If there is a failure in this respect I have little doubt, to use an old cliché, that we will be unable to see the wood for the trees.  The problem of unemployment facing this country today is an enormous one.  It is the most serious difficulty facing the Irish people for many years.  Clearly, it is the bounden duty of Government, whichever Government is in power, to ensure that the problem is tackled in a coherent, transparent and open manner in a way that individuals, companies and businesses clearly understand.  Our failure to do that will lead to the problem becoming much greater than it is today. It is not an easy problem to tackle and, indeed, very few would envy the job of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment in the task which faces him.  Nonetheless, pessimism will almost certainly lead to further unemployment.  The only way forward is through optimism, the creation of an air of confidence in the business community and in the workplace and a sense of optimism among those who feel there is no future for them in Ireland.</P>
    <P>A considerable number of young people who left second level school this summer genuinely believe they will never have the opportunity of working in this country.  There are many young people <Col N="1924" /> who feel there is little point in their proceeding to third level education because they will be left without any hope of employment in this country.  In this context it is extremely important that it be stressed again and again to the younger generation, those leaving second level, that there is no substitute for education and that education is crucial for an individual to obtain employment.</P>
    <P>One of the saddest features of the unemployment record in this country over the years has been the fact that people feel a sense of despair and hopelessness which leads them to believe it is not worth pursuing the objective of securing employment.  That kind of pessimism exists in parts of the unemployed sector.  We have to eradicate that pessimism and try to give people a sense of hope and optimism about the future and a belief that the day will come when this country will be able to adequately cater for those in search of jobs.</P>

      <P>Sar a ndéanaim plé faoin ábhar seo go ginearálta ba mhaith liom pointe a ardú faoi theideal na heagr-aíochta nua atá á bunú.  I would ask the Minister to consider the title of the new agency, which is shown as Forfás.  I understand that the &ldquo;fás&rdquo; part comes from the old Irish word &ldquo;ás&rdquo; without an f.  It is common in languages to either drop a letter or add a letter; in this case one was added.  In modern usage one would be talking about forás.  One could argue that there is an inconsistency here because we are talking about &ldquo;forbairt&rdquo;, not &ldquo;forbhairt&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;forbairt&rdquo; is old Irish.  Because of the inconsistency in the use of old and new forms in the Title, the new agency should be called Forás. That may sound a nit-picking point, but the word would be easier to pronounce if it was spelt in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of whether setting up agencies is the solution to our industrial problems needs grave consideration.  We are talking about the amalgamation of two agencies and their replacement by <Col N="1925" /> three.  There is no point in going down that path unless we give freedom to such agencies to develop indigenous policies. For example, the IDA appeared to implement the same set of policies for high technology mobile industry as applied to indigenous industries.  Its policies were geared towards attracting mobile foreign industries, but it did not develop specific policies for three other sectors, namely, the food sector, the indigenous traditional footwear and clothing industries and local industry. The county development teams were too small and the IDA was too big.  I hope the county enterprise boards fit the bill, but if they do they cannot operate the old mix of grants and subsidies.</P>
    <P>We must develop policies that tackle the problems with which people are faced.  In general, our policy in regard to mobile industry was effective.  However, we did not protect or develop policies geared towards our high labour manufacturing and low sales cost industries, such as clothing and footwear.  We did not develop policies in respect of small indigenous industries or solve the problem of a person who has great ability and good ideas but no seed capital.  From my experience, a person with £1 million wishing to set up a business could probably get a further £2 million from banks and agencies, thus starting off with a total of £3 million.  In contrast, a person who has £10,000 would probably get £20,000 to match it but, from my experience, nobody can start a business with £30,000.</P>
    <P>I tried to do that once and by twisting and turning and with a certain degree of luck I succeeded but I would not like to have to repeat the exercise.  The question of providing seed capital in a user-friendly manner must be considered seriously.  In most cases, particularly in rural communities, there is money available in the community, but we must examine how we can channel money back into developing the community.</P>
    <P>I accept that Forbairt is geared towards the manufacturing industry.  However, I would ask the Minister to ensure that, like SFADCo and Údarás na Gaeltachta, it would not take a narrow approach <Col N="1926" /> within regions, but instead co-ordinate its efforts to create total development of an area rather than dealing with issues as if it existed in a totally isolated world.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>It is timely that we should be addressing this Bill because one of the greatest cancers in our society at present is unemployment.  We must redeploy all our energies in an effort to do something about it.  The Minister referred to the county enterprise boards and after a long gestation process it appears those boards will come on-stream. While I was critical of them at the start I now accept that we should give them a chance.  I could visualise a vacuum in many counties, particularly in relation to small industry and community enterprises in regard to these structures.  I hope the county enterprise boards fill that vacuum and give a certain amount of scope in each county to community initiatives.  I hope also that they will be afforded sufficient funding so that they can use it in local economies for justifiable ventures within the county enterprise board parameters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Ó Cuív's point in regard to seed capital for start-up businesses. Although banks may state that they are more sympathetic towards small businesses, from my experience they could be much more sympathetic because in most cases they seek high collateral for loans.  The mid-west region has featured in the news a great deal recently and the greatest capitalist employment region of that area is frequently classified as the golden circle in regard to industrial employment, on the Limerick, Shannon, Nenagh and Ennis axis.  Within that area, Shannon is the fulcrum.  As a result of setting up Shannon originally as a trans-atlantic airport, many industries located there and various attractions and inducements <Col N="1927" /> were offered to industralists to set up in the area.  In recent times there has been a proposal to set up an aviation park in Shannon.  This has helped to create much needed jobs in the area.  Successful companies, such as Shannon Aerospace, GPA and Shannon Turbines are located in the area.</P>
    <P>I want to read something into the record which was quoted in this House on 27 October last when we all enthusiastically greeted the announcement by the Minister, Deputy Maire Geoghegan-Quinn, that the Shannon stop-over was to remain the transatlantic gateway for scheduled flights.  At that time no less a man than the Tánaiste stated:</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's announcement about the Shannon stop-over.  I now believe that a Government decision to desert Shannon would help Aer Lingus and I have always argued that the Shannon issue should be treated as an issue of regional rather than aviation policy.</P>
    <P>I have not selected those words in isolation because the brief reference he made to Shannon was encapsulated in his remarks.  Those words ring hollow at this stage in respect of what I suspect is likely to be the status of Shannon in the future.  I would not like to think that the industrial advances in regard to employment in the Shannon area would be stifled due to retrograde policy that may emanate from the Government.  I hope the Tánaiste will reflect on his words that a Government decision to desert Shannon would help Aer Lingus.  He always argued that Shannon should come into the category of regional rather than aviation policy.  I fully agree with that because Shannon is a classic example of regional development in action.  We hear much talk in Dáil Éireann and from the EC about the principle of subsidiarity.  Here is a model, a model that should be used but instead we see the present situation developing.</P>
    <P>For many years the Shannon Estuary has been described as the jewel of the western world.  On assuming the mantle of Taoiseach, the Leader of Fianna Fáil announced at an IMI conference in Killarney <Col N="1928" /> that the Shannon Estuary would be available for trans-shipment and that there would be a new dawn for the estuary. In recent times there is talk not of trans-shipment but of a trading bridge-head. Much energy has been put into sussing out potential industrialists by Dr. Con Power, SFADCo and the IDA.  So far there is no evidence of increased industrial activity.  However, we wait in hope.</P>
    <P>If the Government and the agencies are serious, they have a great chance now to set up a project in Foynes which is on the estuary and has all the infrastructural requirements.  I refer to a project which has received a lot of media attention in the last few weeks, the Louisiana-Pacific project, a joint venture with Coillte Teo which would provide 150 jobs and, potentially, another 350 jobs in the forests around the country.  That type of project would prove that the Government is serious about industries along the estuary.  This is a project that would involve shipping and exports to the EC markets.  It would be a lifeline in an area that has a heavy dependency on casual labour at present.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed when the regional office of the IDA was moved out of Limerick.  With the IDA structure in Dublin liaising with SFADCo to work out the best possible stategy, I have always felt that this was industry by remote control.  If we had an IDA office in the area there would be more continuous contact with local representatives but because these agencies are in Dublin they are fairly remote.</P>
    <P>Much emphasis has been put on Leader funding.  The Leader programme has been a success in aiding worthwhile projects into rural areas.  We have a very successful Leader project in our area in Ballyhoura Fáilte.  I certainly hope that other projects such as the West Limerick Rural Resources Group will get sanction. There are people involved in these projects at community level who are working very hard to try to get things moving and they need the fullest encouragement we can give.</P>
    <P>I welcome the reference to FÁS in the <Col N="1929" /> report.  As a person who worked for FÁS for over ten years many years ago, I often wonder if a serious look is being taken at FÁS.  Has FÁS kept pace with the industrial advances that have been made in our economy in recent times?  Are they running training courses which relate to what industry is looking for in the context of technology, etc?  It is necessary for the Government to give grants to FÁS to enable them to update their equipment and machinery in order to meet industrial requirements.  I welcome the fact that FÁS is to be looked at.  I know many people in FÁS.  They have a great commitment to the organisation and I have a lot of praise for them, and some of their courses bear a strong relationship to what is required outside.  I would like to think that people who go on training courses to FÁS come out with the expertise that allows them to tap into what is required by industry.  We all want skills to be transferred to the workplace because if a period of unemployment follows a FÁS course the skills, the discipline and the motivation may be lost.</P>
    <P>There is a reference to training for industry.  There was a classic example in Shannon Aerospaace where FÁS were involved at the very start with the trainees and they dovetailed with industrial requirements.  That is extremely important when new industry is coming into the country and is something I would very much encourage.</P>
    <P>Another area of concern are the ports. We all know the importance of the harbour ports around this country.  Foynes and Limerick are very successful ports. Lest the Minister be surprised that I raise this matter, there is a reference to ports in the Bill.  I am concerned about the harbour ports Bill which will be coming up, possibly not in this session but in the next session.  At the moment councillors are represented on the harbour boards. In Foynes there is a compact board of nine people on which the councils are represented.  The only interest of councillors is in relation to the development of that port and doing something meaningful for the local community.  I am concerned that under the new Bill all those <Col N="1930" /> councillors will be kicked out to make way for Government appointees.  This Bill will have to be looked at.  It is not right to say that we want to strengthen the powers of local authorities and at the same time remove something concrete that we can do.  That is the intention of this Bill.  It is all very well to tell councillors that they will get new powers. Many of those new powers have to do with animal health, health and safety, looking after courthouses, etc.  That sort of thing only heaps more responsibility on to councillors and involves them in more costs.  The Government is hiving off responsibilities to the councils around the country but are not giving them the finances to take on those responsibilities.</P>
    <P>I will certainly speak on the ports Bill when it is introduced because the ports are vital to industry.  I will be very concerned if councillors' input into the 12 commercial ports being set up around the country is done away with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously I will not have enough time to respond in detail to many of the points that were made.  I trust that things I cannot refer to now can be picked up on Committee Stage tomorrow.  Let me say at the outset that this Bill is an enabling piece of legislation. It does not purport to rewrite policy.  It consists of 21 sections and two Schedules. Time is very much of the essence because we have to get the structures in place before the summer recess so that we can begin to restructure the agencies in a flexible and open manner as we start to develop and formulate policy.</P>
      <P>I do not apologise for introducing enabling legislation which is flexible in respect of how Forfás will be able to assign to Forbairt or IDA Ireland various functions and types of co-ordination.  I will go into this matter in greater detail on Committee Stage or, if time permits, I will return to it later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will refer briefly to the range of issues on which Deputies reflected today.  The genesis of this Bill is the Culliton report. A fulsome tribute was paid by Deputy Cullen to Deputy O'Malley, the former <Col N="1931" /> Minister for Industry and Commerce in relation to his contributions to that Department.  Deputy O'Malley commissioned the Culliton report and when it published its recommendations after six months he referred them to the Moriarty task force.  Nothing happened for 18 months in the Department at political or ministerial level in regard to the two reports.  When I came into Government on 12 January the Culliton report had been digested by the Moriarty task force and the third and final report of the Moriarty task force, which had digested the 61 recommendations which Culliton had analysed and proposed, was ready for implementation.  Within a short time we were able to get most of those decisions, including some of the difficult ones, through the Department and the semi-State agency system.  A document entitled &ldquo;Employment Through Enterprise&rdquo; was published on 4 May recommending setting up this new structural system.</P>
    <P>There is an additional genesis to the structure of legislation and agencies we are discussing.  In addition, the Culliton and Moriarty reports recommended major restructuring of the IDA, Eolas and An Bord Tráchtála.  The Programme for Government proposed the establishment of Forfás, Forbairt, the IDA as set out and the Department of Tourism and Trade.  Consideration must be given to the response of this administration to the implementation of legislation before this House in the context of those decisions.</P>
    <P>I refer Deputies to the erudite contribution by Senator Lee in the Seanad when he said that Culliton was particularly effective and to the point when its members spoke about matters of which they had immediate experience.  They were less wise and less penetrating in their recommendations when they spoke of matters with which they were not familiar. The members of that erudite group of people, chaired by Jim Culliton had many attributes, they had a knowledge of Governmental and Civil Service operational structures but did not have <Col N="1932" /> a knowledge of semi-State agency structures.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the Culliton report itself apart from the recommendations of agency structures.  There was a debate in regard to recommendation of agency structures in respect of the quotations to which Deputy Bruton referred.  Deputy Rabbitte made the point that the Culliton group said there was no quick fix solution. They said that if Culliton's 61 recommendations were implemented it would not create a major impact in respect of industrial jobs created.  I personally regard the body of the Culliton recommendations as essential and necessary and they should be implemented. However, the task is akin to rebuilding and modernising a football stadium without any guarantee that the quality of the game that will be played in it will be automatically improved.  One will not be possible without the other.  Culliton falls far short of specific interventionist measures in relation to industrial policy other than major tax broadening and widening, which I endorsed.  The Government and I will return to this House with specific policy initiatives.  The reason the Bill is before the House is that we are unashamedly putting new sets of structures in place around which we will construct new policies.  It would not be possible to do it the other way around.  If I did not do this between now and the end of the session it would not be discussed until Christmas.  I ask for Deputies' indulgence in this regard because we cannot construct new policies which are clearly needed if the old, inadequate industrial agency structures are in place.  On Committee Stage I will explain the structure of Forfás, Forbairt and IDA Ireland in the Bill.</P>
    <P>There was a common conclusion that a critical factor for indigenous industry was the lack of adequate finance in the form of equity, grant aid, soft loans, IDA repayable grants, venture capital or whatever. I agree with the analysis that Forbairt will have to play a major role in developing in different categories and sectors the matters to which the Deputies referred.  Perhaps a venture capital unit <Col N="1933" /> may be established.  The county enterprise board at local level will have in effect a seed capital-venture capital role in the order of approximately £18 million that will be available for small industries. There was a reference to running down the science and technology side of Eolas by virtue of its incorporation into Forbairt. Some other references were made in relation to the money available and the downgrading of the amount of State money, as distinct from EC money, which was made available.  It is a reasonable debating point to which I will refer later. Apart from the consultancy, certification and measurement services undertaken by Eolas, the separation of technology from the cutting face of industry, which is the current position, will be immeasurably improved by the integration of Eolas and its science and technology functions into the mainstream of Forbairt.  The focus of the Department of Enterprise and Employment is not to indulge &mdash; I use the word advisedly &mdash; in pure research in the halls of academia.  It is to have a direct link with industry and to ask those engaged in industry what type of new technology and resources they need. Those engaged in industry should be sent in the direction of academic infrastructure and those engaged in industry should commission the type of applied technology, research appropriate for their perceived needs in the market place.  That is something we have not been doing.  Many industrialists will say that there is a mismatch between the research carried out on one level and the needs of industrialists on the other.  This enabling legislation merges the science and technology wing with the indigenous industry wing, which will be Forbairt, to fill the gap.</P>
    <P>Deputies Rabbitte, Cullen and Bruton referred to the focus on indigenous industry. I share Deputy Rabbitte's analysis that Telesis got it right.  Regardless of the IDA's manifest success in attracting mobile investment in comparative terms against the other competing agencies on the indigenous side, the perception by the industrial customer is that the IDA was not user friendly.  We are in the business <Col N="1934" /> of politics.  We must recognise that whatever we may think of our policy or our political persona, if the electorate or the market form a view at variance with ours, we will have two choices.  We will either insist that we stay the way we are or respond to the way the market perceives us.  This is what we are trying to do in this instance.  Forbairt will have to overcome the very real prejudices in certain sections of the indigenous industrial market which regards the IDA as not being user friendly.  I believe we will be able to do that and one of the ways we will do it is by providing for a much greater degree of clarity and uniformity in what is required by the various agencies of an applicant firm seeking help and assistance.  The frequent complaint to Culliton &mdash; I spoke to Jim Culliton directly about this matter &mdash; from people who felt they were not getting sufficient help or who were getting confusing information from the State agencies was that they had different sets of requirements imposed on them in relation to forms, economic profile and data from An Bord Tráchtála, Eolas, IDA (Ireland) or from the indigenous sector.  From the Department of Enterprise and Employment, through Forfás, down to Forbairt and right on through to the county enterprise board, it is essential that the profile of data and information that would be required of any individual applicant for assistance would be integrated and harmonised, so that people would not be required to duplicate, replicate and in some cases extend and subtract the kind of data which can only come from availing of the services of expensive consultants. That is where the need for co-ordination, linkage, and all the things Deputy O'Malley castigated me for, is so important.  This was one of the matters identified as being negative in terms of perception.</P>
    <P>In that area one of the problems we must address &mdash; I am glad Deputy Cullen raised it &mdash; refers to the phenomenon in the business sector known as lifestyle companies.  Many Irish companies reach a certain level of growth.  The Deputy referred to the antipathy towards equity, <Col N="1935" /> the need for grants of a certain kind and the need for flexibility.  However, certain sectors of Irish industry are not prepared to share equity or ownership.  Some family firms are incapable of planning for succession.  Ireland is littered with a three generational cycle of growth and decline &mdash; and J.B. Keane has probably written about this better than most &mdash; where we must encourage people to change the culture in indigenous industry to allow them get over that critical second generation stage where succession is blocked or is not planned.</P>
    <P>To this extent I recognise that our taxation system, particularly in the area of capital acquisitions tax within family firms and to a certain extent within farms, is an impediment rather than an incentive. That problem must be identified, analysed and resolved.  Where there is a blockage of internal capital and a need to secure additional capital, we must help.  We are moving away, as I believe we should, from a policy of grants to equity or even preference shares, but there must be a change in attitude.</P>

      <P>Many traditional industries that have now gone out of business could still be in operation if they had been allowed to expand and attract outside investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point &mdash; and I acknowledge the Deputy's intervention &mdash; the skills and focus that Forbairt will be required to have to address that problem are manifestly different from the skills needed to identify companies in Silicone Valley which have the technology that will last a product lifecycle of between ten and 15 years.  It is for that <Col N="1936" /> reason that we are separating the agencies in the way we are.  However, they cannot be separated into two totally stand alone agencies, which was the thrust of earlier arguments put forward, because they have so many things in common. One is starting from a single agency and I wish to give an example of this.  If one had to chose between a super agency attracting inward investment on the one hand and a domestic agency trying to build up indigenous industry on the other, how would one decide on, for example, the land bank, the pension funds, personnel who wished to move from one agency to another for a certain period of time?  From a personnel and infrastructural point of view, the existence of Forfás gives us much flexibility, which, quite frankly, we need.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the constructive contributions that have been made by the parties represented in this House.  This Bill is part of a process.  I would not like anybody to think that this fairly modest Bill, despite the difficulty in getting out of the system of legislative generations that we continue to have here, is not the last word on industrial policy from my Department.  It is not.  It is an enabling legislative measure and represents a step on the right road.  On 12 January we inherited the Moriarty task force, on 4 May we published the document <i>Employment Through Enterprise</i> and, having been in the Seanad, here we are on 23 June with the Bill, which hopefully will be enacted by the end of this month &mdash; less than six months after our coming into office.  On that basis I recommend the Second Stage of the Bill to the House and thank the Deputies for their contributions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not repeat what I said last night.  I will make a few brief points about the way coursing is and should be run.  To be properly run a coursing meeting requires a considerable amount of preparation.  First of all the hares should be caught some weeks in advance of the course and brought to the venue to be kept there so that they can become familiar with the ground and of course they should be fed there during that period.  In the vast majority of cases that is what is done.  They are then trained at the venue in that they are made to run over the course in the direction they will take on the day of the course, in the case of closed park meetings, towards the place where the escape is provided for them.  From that point of view the hares are familiar with the ground before the coursing takes place.</P>
      <P>Since it has been a matter of some contention, I will quote a little more from the evidence of the committee of the House of Commons which I mentioned last night about what happens and the behaviour of the hare during the coursing. This part of the report deals with what they called &ldquo;jinking&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>13.  This stage begins when the dogs <Col N="1940" /> overtake the hare.  The hare then uses its second means of defence, dodging to one side or &ldquo;jinking&rdquo;.  The dogs then overshoot and the hare gains a yard or two, until the dogs' superior speed brings them up again, when the hare will dodge again.  The dodgings of the hare are not automatic defence reactions (although the first two or three may be): the hare can soon be seen to be working its way with each turn towards an escape hole, sought or other cover.</P>
    <P>I make that point because it was alleged that hares are made to run in a straight line, a conduct which is alleged to be unnatural for the hare, and that they are not allowed to run or cannot run in a straight line when the course takes place. The evidence and my observation suggest that a hare which is not being pursued on its own in open country will on the whole run in a straight line and that the &ldquo;jink-ing&rdquo; is not the normal method of locomotion of the hare but a reaction of a prey species to a situation which is one that is peculiar and indeed even natural to its location in nature and the food chain.  To allege that hares are in some way unnaturally made to run in one way or another during the course of a coursing meeting is wrong and it is not true.  When meetings are organised in the way laid down in these standards we can be properly content that they are being properly organised and that no particular violence is being done to any of the orders of nature, given the nature of the animals involved.  It is true that not all meetings are organised in that way and that is the centre of our concern.  It is why we have made the proposals which I set out last evening in order to make sure that meetings when they take place are organised properly, that the scales are not overly balanced one way or the other and that the animals are properly treated before, during and after the course.</P>
    <P>There are a number of practices which are reprehensible, some of which Deputy Gregory mentioned last night.  There have been cases where meetings have been cancelled and licences have been <Col N="1941" /> withdrawn from venues by the Coursing Club because meetings were not organised as they should be.  There are cases of informal coursing that take place around the country, happily not too frequently, where none of the standards I have been talking about are observed.  Events of that kind and events that include the kind of blooding that Deputy Gregory mentioned last night are clearly illegal and should be visited with the utmost severity of the law.  Even if Deputy Gregory's Bill were passed, those kinds of activities would still remain a problem. The passage of this Bill will not do anything to combat the kinds of practices which Deputy Gregory rightly deplores.</P>
    <P>A great deal more could be said on this issue, but I will come back to the point from which I started.  I do not agree with statements made this evening to the effect that this debate is irrelevant.  I am a defender of the right of this House to examine any issue and, even though I disagree with Deputy Gregory, I defend his right to bring the matter before the House and have it properly debated. People who say that a debate here is irrelevant are not doing their own cause any good.</P>
    <P>Those who look at the world with the mind of a human through the eyes of an animal are making a very big mistake. That is the basic flaw in the way Deputy Gregory and those who agree with him go about the basis of this Bill.  It would be absolutely wrong &mdash; and Deputy Gregory has avoided doing this &mdash; to try to categorise all those people who are involved in coursing as being bloodthirsty barbarians, which they patently are not, any more than the people who are against blood sports can be categorised universally as saints.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Over 20 years ago I was a founder member of a gun club in my area.  It was set up principally to regulate the traffic of foreign visitors coming there, whose game shooting exploits included shooting hares, rabbits, game of all description and song birds.  Following activities in that area for a number of years, the proliferation of guns in the <Col N="1942" /> area and a decline in the wild game stock, my interest in the club declined.  I have never attended a coursing meeting but I met coursing people from my county. They were the first people to suggest that regulations should be introduced into coursing.  I would like to see regulations implemented if this Bill goes to Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>It is important to realise that what happened in Limerick was a disgrace and that it is our own fault that something like this can happen.  There are passionate arguments on both sides of the fence. Those against coursing would also oppose the vivisection of animals, the keeping of battery hens, cruelty to donkeys, which takes place daily in some parts of the country, and the lighting of fires on the backs of horses, which occurred in this city.  One does not complain about the poisoning of grey crows, magpies, rats or vermin of any description. I accept that the humble hare has natural agility and ability to escape in open ground.</P>
      <P>The regulations to which Deputy Dukes referred yesterday certainly would go a long way to eliminating, if not completely abolishing, the element of cruelty, the one aspect people want removed from coursing.  Nobody wants to see hares die or being killed.  In my travels throughout my rural constituency I have on occasion, late at night, killed hares that spring in front of my car.  I do not like doing that.  I do everything to avoid it.  Life is cruel and nature has its balance, its element of cruelty so that the strong survive.  I am not saying that is the way we should regulate confined coursing. Regulations such as licensing, the presence of wildlife rangers, the banning of coursing meetings where licences were not required and the muzzling of dogs &mdash; if that can be implemented &mdash; would eliminate the cruelty element from coursing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Second Stage of the Bill is passed I should like to see adopted the regulations to which Deputy Dukes referred, and which were the subject of an amendment tabled by the Fine Gael Party yesterday <Col N="1943" /> but which was ruled out of order for technical reasons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>The function of my office is to develop the greyhound industry here.  Of necessity, I am bound to take the wider view on most issues concerning that industry, to weigh each issue carefully and decide how best each issue should be dealt with for the betterment of the greyhound industry as a whole.</P>
      <P>The coursing issue is linked inextricably to the greyhound industry and its development.  The Irish Coursing Club is the embodiment of coursing in Ireland and has been since 1916.  It has also been a regulatory authority in the industry since that time and was the only authority up to the time of establishment of Bord na gCon in 1958.  The Irish Coursing Club compiled and published the first Irish Greyhound Stud Book in 1923 and has been compiling and publishing the stud book annually since then.  In addition, the Irish Coursing Club is the controlling authority for the breeding and registering of greyhounds in the 32 counties.  While it is primarily a coursing body, most objective observers would agree that the Irish Coursing Club played a substantial role in the organisation and development of our greyhound industry.  This is something of which I must be aware in advancing proposals for the development of that industry.</P>
      <P>I consider the timing of the introduction of this Bill rather unfortunate, in that Deputy Gregory has introduced it at a time when the issue is very divisive.  In an interview on radio yesterday I said the proposed Bill from my Department will not be seen by us as being cast in stone. I would prefer that the House could move towards a resolution of this issue by way of a consensus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose now to outline what my Department has been doing, proposes to do.  It would be my hope that we could reach a degree of consensus on this issue of coursing within the context of developing our greyhound industry.  As has been <Col N="1944" /> rightly pointed out by virtually all contributors, strong views on this issue are held by both sides of the House.</P>
    <P>Following examination we have devised a formula worthy at least of the full support of this House in the context of its trial leading to the introduction of legislation.  The Minister, Deputy Walsh, and I have made it clear on a number of occasions that a thorough review of the greyhound industry, including hare coursing, is at present taking place and that a comprehensive examination not only of the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958 but of all legislation relating to hare coursing will form part of that review. Last July the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, appointed a task force comprised of representatives of Bord na gCon and officials of his Department.  As Members will be aware, this task force followed on the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee which had examined the greyhound industry.</P>
    <P>The greyhound industry is a many-faceted one.  On my appointment as Minister of State I was rather surprised to discover that Bord na gCon had been assigned to me.  I had experience of the greyhound industry as a young person and I particularly enjoy track racing.  I look forward to dealing with the challenge facing that industry and of playing my part in helping that industry recover and develop.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks the task force established by the Minister in July last presented a position paper to the Minister and me.  I had been aware of their work since assuming office.  I engaged in an exhaustive round of consultations with the representative elements in the industry.  At all times I was anxious to hear the views of all those involved in the industry, including views on coursing.</P>
    <P>The question of hare coursing must be handled sensibly if it is not to become a significant source of conflict and division in our society.  There are many lines of division on this issue.  It is not a simple division between town and country, although there were traces of that in the debate so far.  There is a strong lobby in rural areas in favour of coursing.  It is <Col N="1945" /> not &mdash; I stress this &mdash; a conflict between animal lovers and animal haters.  Coursing people take good care of both hares and dogs at great expense to themselves. It is not a socio-economic divide either because, as far as I can determine, professional people and unskilled labourers alike are involved in the sport.  The divide seems to be more accurately between the extreme views of both sides on this issue. Both sides appear to be attempting to attract the middle ground on this issue through intensive lobbying and media attention.</P>
    <P>Coursing is at the heart of an important indigenous industry which gives much needed employment in rural areas.  A Bord na gCon survey estimates that approximately 8,000 people are involved in the industry as breeders, owners and trainers.  Taking those employed at racing tracks and in the supply of ancillary services, it is estimated that approximately 10,000 people derive their livelihoods, directly or indirectly, from the industry. Approximately 20,000 greyhounds are bred annually, about half of that number being exported, mainly to the United Kingdom.  Total annual receipts from the sale of greyhounds is approximately £40 million, of which approximately half is derived from exports.  Other receipts to breeders include prize money amounting to £2.1 million.</P>
    <P>This level of employment and exports is of significant benefit to some communities and can be developed further if proper consideration is given to the industry in all its aspects.  There are areas I should allude to in considering the value in economic terms of the coursing and greyhound industry.  For instance, people living in the United Kingdom make trips to Ireland so that their dogs can mate with a female greyhound here, while others, as part of their holiday, visit the pups or saplings they have purchased.  Therefore, incidental tourism earnings accrue from this sport.  It is a very important industry.</P>
    <P>From my discussions with the industry it appears that most people are not against coursing.  Many will claim that the coursing bloodlines in the pedigrees of Irish greyhound track racing dogs give <Col N="1946" /> them their speed and contribute significantly to the quality of their performance, for which they have an international reputation.  The fear is that if coursing is phased out or banned, the quality of the Irish track dog will over a period of years suffer badly and our exports will also suffer accordingly.</P>
    <P>Comments and publicity material from some quarters give the impression that practically every individual course ends up with the destruction of the hare; but, as we all know, that is not the case and is far from the truth.  Last night Deputy Ahern stated that he had attended two coursing meetings at which hares were not killed.  I wish this was the case at every coursing meeting, but unfortunately that is not the reality.  Deputy Gregory was quite right to point out that a large number of hares were killed at Clounanna this year during the running of the Irish Cup meeting.  I do not condone what happened at that meeting in any way.</P>
    <P>On average about one course in ten ends in the death of the hare.  In making this point I am not condoning or arguing for a continuation of the current situation, rather I am making the point that the kill is not the purpose of coursing.  This point was made strongly and eloquently in the House last night by my colleague, Deputy Brian Fitzgerald, who singled out coursing as the only sport of this type where the killing of the quarry is not the objective. The coursing fraternity claim that coursing provides information that is essential if the best greyhound breeding material is to continue to be identified.</P>
    <P>Apart from the considerations I have just outlined, there is a number of technical flaws in Deputy Gregory's Bill.  In pointing out these technical flaws I do not wish to be confrontational.  Indeed, those who take part in the debate in this House and outside on coursing should not seek to be confrontational either.  I am pointing out these technical flaws in the Deputy's Bill to underline the fact that consensus on this matter would lead to a much better solution to the problem of coursing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear from the Long Title of the Wildlife Act, 1976, that its purpose is the conservation of wildlife.  If the purpose of the Bill before the House is to prohibit hare coursing on the grounds of cruelty to hares, then the Wildlife Act is not the appropriate vehicle to achieve this end.  If coursing to kill live hares is to be prohibited or restricted for cruelty reasons, then that should be done by an amendment to the Protection of Animals Acts, 1911 and 1965.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Wildlife Act, 1976, hares are a protected species for conservation purposes and they cannot be hunted unless there is a specific exemption or licence under the Act.  Section 23 (7) (i) of that Act provides an exemption for coursing at regulated coursing matches under Hares Orders.  Section 26 (3) allows the Minister to grant licences for clubs affiliated to the ICC to hold regulated coursing matches outside the open season specified in a Hares Order.  By <Col N="1948" /> removing these two provisions as is envisaged in this Bill the coursing exemption is taken away from the protection given to hares for conservation reasons. However, the Minister's power under section 25 to make a Hares Order, allowing an open season in hares to exist at specified times of the year when hares could be hunted or coursed, is not taken away.  Therefore the Bill is taking away the regulation of coursing but still allows a Minister to provide for coursing without any regulation whatsoever.  In my view this is a major flaw in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Another point to be made in this context is that since the Wildlife Act is a conservation of stocks measure only, orders under section 25 are not an appropriate means to distinguish between different types of hunting on grounds of cruelty and an order made under section 25 for that purpose might be <i>ultra vires.</i> Effectively, what this means is that a Hares Order made for the purposes of allowing the hunting of hares, for example, by shooting could not in all probability exclude hunting by means of coursing.</P>
    <P>A further difficulty I have with Deputy Gregory's Bill is that it is indiscriminate in its attempt to outlaw hare coursing and fails to home in on the cruelty aspects, particularly the kill.  Any discretion to the authorities to allow a limited form of coursing would be removed.  If the Bill were successful it would, for example, outlaw the muzzling of greyhounds for coursing purposes.</P>
    <P>Another aspect is that the provisions regarding the capture of hares contained in section 34 (3) (b) and 45 (3) (b) of the Wildlife Act, 1976, would remain.  If hare coursing were prohibited then these provisions could be described only as anomalous and might facilitate the holding of clandestine coursing meetings without any supervision.</P>
    <P>With regard to the amendments proposed to the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958, section 5 (1) of the Bill would turn the ICC from a coursing organisation into a greyhound breeding organisation without following through the consequences of this change elsewhere.  It would cause <Col N="1949" /> a fundamental change to the greyhound industry and in particular to the relationship between the ICC and Bord na gCon. One effect of this amendment would be to deprive the ICC of its supervisory role over such varieties of coursing, not involving live hares, as might survive the Bill.</P>
    <P>To sum up, I believe that a clearer approach to the problem would be to identify the specific element of the activity which it is sought to prohibit and then to proceed by legislation to prohibit that activity.  Otherwise there is a serious risk of the measure resulting in unforeseen and unintended effects.</P>
    <P>At this stage I would like to turn to the options for dealing with this issue.  These are primarily to ban coursing or to make provision in a new Greyhound Act for better control measures which would eventually eliminate the &ldquo;kill&rdquo; from the sport.</P>
    <P>I do not agree that the sport should be banned however.  I have always believed that there is a large measure of support for the latter option of eliminating the kill.  My position on this is well known at this stage.  I believe that the killing of hares is the most unacceptable part of this sport and one which most people would be glad to see removed.  In this way the essence of sport can be maintained as it has been for many years.  With this in mind I have reached agreement with the ICC that controls aimed at achieving this goal would be put in place beginning with the coming season.  The club has indicated that it has already proposed changes in the rules which will reduce the number of courses, improve veterinary supervision and provide for better conservation of hare stocks.  Work on the design of a suitable muzzle and field trials are well advanced.  The club will complete its research programme on developing a muzzle which, having regard to the welfare of both the hare and dog, will lead to all dogs participating in live coursing being muzzled.  The club agreed that during the coming season a significant number of courses could be used as trials to allow for the complete introduction of muzzling at a very early stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1950" /> Reports on the use of muzzles on dogs have been circulated in recent days. Recent statements by Deputy Gregory seem to indicate that this is a cobbled together solution.  Obviously this is not the case.  I have been working towards achieving a solution in this area for some time and it has formed part of my discussions with the various interest groups in the industry.  It appears that Deputy Gregory's position on muzzling has changed considerably in recent days.  I am not making this point to be confrontational, but this change underlines the need to proceed by way of consensus to eliminate the kill from coursing along the lines proposed by me.  I note that Deputy Gregory initially welcomed the introduction of muzzling in last Friday's <i>The Irish Times</i>.  However, he ruled out this solution as unacceptable in yesterday's edition of the same paper.</P>

      <P>Having regard to his contribution last night, the Deputy would seem to be the expert on <i>The Irish Times</i> in this House.  The examination I am carrying out, together with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, is at an advanced stage and proposals have been presented to Cabinet.  I am very pleased to say that these proposals were endorsed by the Cabinet today.  The Minister has been charged with the responsibility of preparing legislation which will enact into law the proposed measures relating to the industry.  The areas to which we are paying special attention are (1) the declining attendances at greyhound tracks, (2) the control of the industry and (3) coursing.  Like many other issues, this issue does not benefit from the taking-up of extreme position, intransigence or fundamentalism. This issue can and will be resolved through consensus and identifying an acceptable middle ground which will best serve the interests of the industry and meet the legitimate concerns <Col N="1951" /> expressed by a great number of people in the community.</P>
      <P>Both the Minister and I are determined to eliminate the kill from coursing.  We are very committed to minimising to the greatest possible extent the suffering endured by the animals.  Deputy Dukes made a very valuable, measured and balanced contribution to the debate.  He adopted a human perspective on problems which essentially relate to animals. Nobody on this side of the House wants to see animals suffering; we would always seek to eliminate such suffering.  I believe there is consensus on this point.  We must follow the road outlined by me, starting with the new coursing season.  I ask Deputies to reflect on the position which has been agreed with the Irish Coursing Club.  It is very difficult to introduce changes to a sport which has existed for many years and from which many people have derived enjoyment.  No one in coursing condones what happened at Clounanna this year.</P>

      <P>There are rules in this House which should be observed, just as there are rules in coursing which should be observed.  Last night Deputy Gregory referred to coursing meetings which did not comply with the rules.  The Irish Coursing Club is determined to solve this problem with the co-operation of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry which is intent on ensuring that all the coursing rules are observed.  As Deputy Ahern said last night in reply to Deputy Gregory, incidents involving coursing clubs which have not observed the rules have come to notice and are being dealt with.  This is the point which can easily be overlooked.  Coursing clubs which do not run their meetings according to the rules have been dealt with harshly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1952" /> Deputy Gregory was quoted in today's <i>Irish Times</i> as saying that muzzling could lead to all kinds of unacceptable activities. We must home in on this issue. Having regard to the agreement it has reached with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, I believe the Irish Coursing Club is determined to eliminate unacceptable and illegal practices from coursing.  I am new in this office, but following the publication of the report by the Oireachtas joint committee the Minister set up a task force to report to him, which it has now done. Both the Minister and I have dealt expeditiously with the decline in the greyhound industry.  We are determined that from here on in coursing will be widely accepted by people, the kill will be eliminated and any suffering by the animals will be eliminated to the greatest possible extent.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the contributions from both sides of the House, I believe all Deputies are anxious to reach a common ground on the way to eliminate the kill from coursing.  I have outlined the reasons the Government does not believe this to be an appropriate Bill in the present circumstances.  As I said, the Department will shortly begin work on the preparation of comprehensive legislation in this area.  I am prepared to co-operate with people and if superior arguments are advanced between now and the introduction of the legislation Deputies will not find me inflexible.  We should not deal with this issue in a way which will be divisive within the community at large.  The Government has faced up to this difficult issue; as I said, the Cabinet endorsed the proposals presented to it.</P>
    <P>The Minister will deal in more detail in his contribution with issues such as the conduct of coursing meetings, etc.  He has delegated to me responsibility for an area that he and Deputy Browne <i>(Wexford),</i> who has now gone to the Department of the Environment, had been dealing with.  Let me reiterate that we intend to eliminate the kill from coursing and to minimise suffering.  Members should give their support to that line of <Col N="1953" /> action so that we achieve the best option for the development of the greyhound industry.  A great many people have problems with coursing but we are now presenting the prospect of a very large step forward and I hope everybody will give us support to do that.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Invariably people hold very strong views on coursing, some are for it and others are against it.  Those who support coursing see it as a test of the greyhound's speed, tenacity and stamina in being able to race three times before they win or lose.  Those who are against coursing see it as the killing of a hare and the suffering that the hare has to endure during the chase.  It is very difficult to reconcile those two extreme positions.  Unfortunately, coursing is portrayed on television as the killing whereas coursing people see it as racing greyhounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister explained, the kill is of no advantage to the greyhounds because nine times out of ten whichever is leading when the hare is turned is the winner, unless the dog stops chasing.  Some people see coursing as being a part of what we are and perhaps city people, who are not used to rural life, may see it as a practice that is completely out of order. Not everyone in the country supports coursing or, indeed, not everyone in the city is against it but usually it is a matter of whether one is used to it or not.  From my early childhood right through my teens I attended coursing meetings in south Clare on every St. Stephen's Day. I must admit I never enjoyed seeing a hare being killed, there is no enjoyment in that, but the discussion was about the neighbours' greyhounds: who had the best one and who was going to win?  Some greyhounds could be let loose all day because they are not fast enough to kill anything.  In coursing circles they discuss <Col N="1954" /> the skills and abilities of the dogs.  In the course of the debate last night Deputy Gregory read a description of a coursing meeting written by a journalist, whose name escapes me, and he read it because of what he called its prosaic style.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> That is true.  My ten minutes will be up if I am not careful.  My colleague, Deputy Dukes, gave a very balanced and simple explanation of life in the wilds last night. It has to be accepted that life in the wilds is tough for animals of all sorts.  Those who heard him will know what I am talking about.  It is the natural talent and agility of the wild animals that helps them to survive and live longer than others do.  There is an idea that if coursing was banned all hares would be saved.  Anyone with any idea of life in rural Ireland will know that if people go out in the wilds &mdash; and that seems to be the natural thing <Col N="1955" /> to do &mdash; the hares will have no chance because the dogs will be released within 20 yards of a hare in an open field.  People seem to believe that the hare is safe in the wilds but I think the hare has a better chance on the coursing field.  The hare usually gets a start of 150 yards and he has to run about 50 yards before the dogs catch up but its natural speed and skill allows it to escape to safety.  In the open countryside it might have to run for half a mile and unless it can outrun the dogs on speed, or the dogs simply give up, it has very little hope of survival.  It also has to face its own enemies, like foxes.</P>
      <P>In general, coursing people cannot tolerate killings at coursing meetings &mdash; it is described as bad coursing when hares are killed: good coursing is where the hares lead the dogs a merry dance.  It is important that these people are not labelled as barbarians or savages, as some have referred to them.  They believe in what they are doing.  It is part of Irish tradition.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that the sooner the kill is eliminated &mdash; no matter how seldom a hare is killed, it is one too many &mdash; the more ideal the situation will be.  It would be ideal if coursing can continue without kills.  The distance hares are given to escape is very important, indeed at some meetings the hare has gone into the escape before the hounds get near it.  I know dog owners do not like that because they believe their dogs are not racing at their best if they lose sight of the hare.  It could be easily organised that the hare would escape before the hounds catch up with it.  This would eliminate the horror that some people have of coursing.</P>
      <P>I have to respond to one or two points raised by Deputy Gregory.  The Deputy read from a letter from a County Wexford farmer in which he described how he found injured hares in nets that had been left by coursing people.  Obviously, the Deputy does not know anything about the way people go out to catch the hares &mdash; and I will say no more.  That was somebody selling him a pup or else an account by a fiction writer.</P>

      <P>I take an entirely different view from that of my colleague, Deputy Browne, <i>Carlow-Kilkenny</i>.  I commend Deputy Gregory on his initiative in bringing in a much overdue Bill, one that has been carefully avoided over the years by all the major parties, with the honourable exception of Deputy Shatter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I speak with a fair degree of knowledge of this barbaric sport because in the days of my youth when I was needy and greedy &mdash; I am still needy &mdash; I indulged in this &ldquo;sport&rdquo; for a short period.  I was utterly sickened by the scenes of gore I witnessed on the coursing fields.  With due respect to the Minister, who is a nice quiet, inoffensive man, as a political cynic I never heard such a load of codswallop as delivered here tonight or handed to him by <Col N="1957" /> a script writer.  This &ldquo;sport&rdquo; is a stain on Ireland and Ireland's character and is an appalling sport.  We are one of the last bastions of this sport in Europe and, indeed, in the world.</P>
    <P>The cruelty associated with this sport does not always stop at the coursing door. I know what happens in the greyhound industry.  I know that on many occasions hares &mdash; and sometimes rabbits if hares are not available &mdash; are fed to dogs to give them the taste of blood to improve their performance.  That does happen, but it will be denied by the coursing enthusiasts.  I have seen that happen and I turned a blind eye to it in the days of my youth.  This is a sport that cannot continue in a civilised society.  The little hare is a gentle, inoffensive creature and in many cases it dies of fright, hotly pursued by two hyped up dogs &mdash; and hyped up is the operative word.  Many die in flight; they drop dead from heart attacks; so too would the Minister if he were coursed and hotly pursued by two Rothweilers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny) Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>A little hare is a flesh and blood animal and feels pain in the same fashion as the Minister or I would if gripped by a Rothweiler.  The agonised death shrill of a hare is the most painful thing you ever heard in your life.  It is a pity we do not have a recording of it here today.  If you have any sensitivity it would bring you near to tears; it is like the cry of a child.  A hare is literally torn asunder in the jaws of two dogs, hyped up for the occasion.  One of the dogs will grab the little head in its mouth; the other will grab the two back legs and rend the animal asunder, screeching like a banshee.  It is an awful sight.  When I was young I used to turn my back to it, close my eyes and put my fingers in my ears to dull out the sound of that agonising screech.  I could not stick it and I sold my dogs.  I accept that the track greyhound industry is a nice little earner, contributes in a small way to exports and that it gives employment. But I do not believe it justifies the <Col N="1958" /> killing of hares in coursing, particularly when the dog that turns the hare wins the buckle irrespective of the amount of coursing work the other dog does.  For the life of me I cannot understand why in this day of automation a mechanical hare that twists cannot be produced. With respect, some of the Minister's responses were nonsense.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gregory had the initiative to bring in this Bill and the Minister has responded in a bureaucratic way as a kneejerk reaction.  Begrudgingly, he conceded some points and was fault finding on others.  He shed crocodile tears and said he does not want to see hares dying, and I have no doubt he does not wish to see that happen.  The Minister will not see them die, so he will turn a blind eye to it.  Can the Minister not have the courage to accept that, despite the lobby of the Irish Coursing Club and the greyhound enthusiasts, that Deputy Gregory's Bill is basically correct and should be accepted?  That is the practical commonsense thing to do.  To try to tell us that he will bring in a Fianna Fáil-Labour version of the Bill and that it will be the correct one is nonsense.  It is part of the nonsense in which we all indulge on a daily basis in this House of entertainment.</P>
      <P>No civilised society can accept such a barbaric sport.  It is well documented that it is a blemish, and seen as a blemish by people on the Continent, who in many cases have refused to come here.  I would ask the Minister to prevent the suffering of these gentle inoffensive animals now and to accept the reality of this Bill which Deputy Gregory had the initiative and courage to introduce.  The vast majority of Irish people are sickened by this &ldquo;sport&rdquo;.  The very large number of clerics who attend coursing meetings certainly do not represent St. Francis of Assisi.  I would ask the Minister to take the commonsense approach and accept Deputy Gregory's Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no wish to curtail the sporting activities of any group in the country.  I am as good a sports person as anybody else, having hunted, shot and <Col N="1959" /> fished for a large part of my life.  As time goes on society develops, new standards are set, changes take place and so on.  I recognise what the Minister of State has said, but I am not sure that he intends to go along the road suggested by Deputy Gregory's Bill.  In this context I congratulate Deputy Gregory and my colleague, Deputy Alan Shatter, for his pursuit of the broad objectives set out in the Bill.  I was born and raised in the country and have lived in a rural area most of my life.  People therefore might expect me to hold a different view.</P>
      <P>Much has been said concerning the cruelty aspect and all that surrounds it and possibly the emphasis has been misplaced.  As has been said on the opposite side of the House, it is natural for a dog to chase a hare in the natural terrain without any restrictions whatsoever.  In that scenario the hare has a 50-50 chance. However, when the situation is changed and the animal is placed in an enclosed surrounding in front of a large group of people, in a totally alien territory, then the hare no longer has an even chance. In the natural law of the wild the strong survive and the weak do not.  We are progressing a little.  After all, many of the pasttimes of pre-historic man have been found to be repulsive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have progressed considerably in some areas, but in others have not progressed at all.  In general, society has developed and evolved and more humane attitudes now prevail.  Despite all the protestations about the elimination of cruelty and fair play in regard to this sport, I do not agree with hare coursing.  I have never attended a coursing meeting, but I have no objection to greyhound meetings.  In fact, that is a growing sport in my constituency.  I do not accept either the necessity of live hare coursing for the greyhound industry.  In other countries it has been possible to continue the sport of greyhound racing without the necessity to continue live hare coursing, but because of time constraints it is impossible to deal with that matter today.  I do not accept the arguments <Col N="1960" /> put forward by those who believe that live hare coursing should continue.</P>
    <P>Speakers from both sides of the House referred to our history and traditions.  I take their point, but many practices which were pursued 500, 700 or 1,000 years ago are not acceptable today. Society and time have progressed.  New standards, goals, ideals and objectives have been set and because society is evolving it has become necessary to curtail some of the activities which were acceptable 500 or 1,000 years ago.  It is laudable to claim that we should retain our traditions.  However, boar hunting was once a tradition in this country but there are very few boars here today.</P>

      <P>Boar hunting is still practised in Austria.  I see no merit in bull fighting but people in at least one EC country engage in that sport.  Some people might believe that what I am saying is hypocritical because I eat meat. It is true that I eat meat and have no wish, laudable though it may be, to become a vegetarian but one should not have to course an animal before killing it.  There are humane methods of killing animals today.  A sporting activity should not be linked to the killing of animals which has become a necessity in order to eat meat. Society has progressed somewhat in this area, and I hope will progress further in the years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The greyhound industry and greyhound racing in general, should be well able to prosper and expand without resorting to the activities of hare coursing. It should be able to continue its pivotal role in that area without the necessity to engage in hare coursing.  We should bear in mind that the main reason this Bill is being introduced is the number of coursing meetings which took place this year at which, without doubt, the normal rules and regulations which pertain to coursing were not applied.  If they were, many of the present concerns might not have arisen.  In reply to a Dáil Question, the Minister for Agriculture, <Col N="1961" /> Food and Forestry, Deputy Walsh, stated that he recognised immediately following the meetings in Munster that something was amiss and that action was required.  Many of my constituents, and many Members of this House also, may expect that, because of my rural background, my views on this issue would be different, but I have as much right to my views as have those who hold directly opposing views.  As parliamentarians and democrats, I hope we have developed sufficiently to accept that where views differ only one can pervail.</P>
    <P>By virtue of the numbers on the Government side it is impossible for the Opposition to influence legislation. Given those circumstances, I hope that if the Government vote against this Bill it will see fit to introduce a similar one as soon as possible and not adopt an attitude similar to that adopted in regard to legislation we have been promised in the past three or four months.  The Government has not met its commitments in regard to almost all proposed legislation, all we are told is it will be dealt with in the next session.  I hope the Government will take on board the fact that society is progressing and that the standards and norms which were acceptable even ten years ago are not necessarily acceptable today.  For that reason this House as a democratic institution, should take on board the sentiments expressed in this legislation and the greyhound industry should do its utmost to ensure the legislation is adhered to.</P>

      <P>I doubt if there is a Member of this House who does not know my feelings on hare coursing.  It has been stated that my party has never allowed a free vote.  However, I sought a free vote in regard to this matter but, unfortunately, the tradition in regard to &ldquo;no free votes&rdquo; prevailed.  I argued that every issue should stand on its merit. <Col N="1962" /> that this is not a political issue but a humanitarian one and that people in all parties hold differing views on the subject.</P>
      <P>Coursing has been referred to as a sport.  It is not a sport, it is a business and we should realise that.  It is some consolation that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Walsh, who is opposed to coursing in its present form will introduce legislation forbidding the killing of hares and providing for dogs to be muzzled.  The whole question of hare coursing must be examined. We are told that the export of greyhounds depends on coursing and that unless our greyhounds are blooded they will not make the grade.  It appears that those who favour hare coursing believe that our greyhounds are better than others because no other country allows coursing in the manner in which it operates here.  Deputy Gregory knows my views in this regard.  I do not wish to appear too emotional on the matter, but I am despondent because we are not allowed to articulate our views, and I know many other Members are of the same opinion.</P>
      <P>There is virtually total opposition to coursing in Dublin and such views are not held merely by people from Dublin, but by country people who live here.  I have received letters, too, from people in Galway, Kerry and elsewhere protesting about hare coursing.  I would say without doubt that the figure quoted by Deputy Gregory last night in relation to the poll, which showed 80 per cent of the people of this country were opposed to coursing, is an accurate one.  The numbers may be greater now because more is known about it.  When one knows that something is intrinsically wrong one should set about putting it right.  Coursing belongs to the last century and by the next century, which is only six and a half years away, I have little doubt that coursing will be forbidden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are constantly appalled by the atro-cities committed throughout the world where humans have very little respect for each other.  Ireland is to the fore in condemning acts of inhumanity.  Coursing <Col N="1963" /> is inhuman and inflicts unnecessary cruelty.  Hare coursing demeans the people who participate in it and takes from their dignity.  What some of the people who support coursing should try to understand is that there is a general revulsion against coursing by most other people.  Some people tend to mock that revulsion.  It is a mistake for anyone to think that people who do not have the stomach for coursing are wimps.  Nobody has yet said it, but I have the feeling that we in this lobby are a bunch of wimps in the estimation of some of the people I have spoken to.  I know the majority of Deputies are against coursing.  There is nothing whatsoever to commend this so-called sport.  I was at least encouraged when one Member of my party who has always been a keen greyhound person declared himself totally against the killing of hares and in favour of muzzling the dogs.  I refer to Deputy Gerry Collins.  I got his permission to mention his name.</P>
    <P>I agree that drag coursing, the kind that takes place in Australia should be encouraged.  If some people embarked on that procedure on a voluntary basis we would be making progress.  Those of us in the party who were interested in this question had a special meeting with the Minister for Agriculture Food and Forestry at which there was expressed a general revulsion of what is going on. The Irish Coursing Club have been told time and again to clean up their act but have refused to do so.  Some of the people at the meeting and I will not quote names here &mdash; said that the Irish Coursing Club were arrogant.  The club ought to be made aware that that is how they are regarded by people they think may be sympathetic towards them.  The sooner we can tame this evil sport, the better.</P>
    <P>I was horrified when I heard about the hares being kept in small pens for God knows how long before a coursing meeting. I have said all I can say about the suffering of these animals.  No other country has coursing which involves the killing of the hares.  If a hare dies of fright, that is also a form of killing.  That <Col N="1964" /> is why I feel that muzzling is not enough. It is time to ban this sport.  I understand there is involved a greyhound export business worth between £4 million and £10 million.  In the overall picture it is not that much but our reputation as a civilised country is on the line here.  Somebody once asked how they were going to live if the business they practised was taken from them and the answer given was that they should find some other means of livelihood.</P>
    <P>It is time to call a halt.  I know the Minister is concerned and we are concerned as a party.  I am very happy about it.  I do not think I have been more happy about anything else that has come before this House.  I am delighted that Deputy Gregory has introduced this Bill because at least we are discussing the issue.  If the Bill does not go through, we will still have discussed it, created greater awareness and greater alertness.  I hope, too that the public will make known their feelings about the issue.  I hope the ICC will start to put their house in order before legislation has to be introduced.  They could introduce drag coursing on an experimental basis.  I hate it when we have to force people to do something, because we usually end up throwing the baby out with the bath water.  That should be remembered.</P>

      <P>The sport of coursing has been long established as an integral part of Irish rural life.  The Irish Coursing Club controls the sport in the 32 counties of Ireland.  It has laid down very strict rules and guidelines for all coursing clubs under its control.  These rules and guidelines are strongly enforced by Irish Coursing Club officials and control stewards, who attend all coursing meetings, and are reviewed and updated by the club on a regular basis as circumstances require.  For the forthcoming season the maximum number of courses allowed on <Col N="1965" /> any one day will be reduced to 72 from the present maximum of 88 and a formal veterinary involvement in the husbandry of hares before and during coursing will also be mandatory.  All supervisory officials such as judges and control stewards are licensed by the club.</P>
      <P>The Irish Coursing Club is a member of the Federation of Field Sports of Ireland, FACE.  FACE Ireland represents all the field sports organisations in the country and over 350,000 people who are actively engaged in field sports throughout Ireland.  When immediate family members are included this figure rises to in excess of 500,000.  In a small country such as Ireland this is a significant segment of the population.  It constitutes a body of opinion which cannot be ignored. The chief aim of the federation is to harness the widespread support into one body which has the authority, courage and confidence to speak out on matters of concern and which has the political weight to make its pressure felt and acknowledged.</P>
      <P>Coursing may take place only between the months of September and February inclusive.  This is to ensure that the hare is protected during the breeding season. Clubs must have a minimum number of hares before running a meeting.  The minimum number is one hare for every course to be run plus a surplus of ten. All hares must be released back to the countryside after each coursing meeting under the supervision of a control steward who may be accompanied by an officer of the Wildlife Service.</P>
      <P>It is not the object of a course to kill the hare.  Indeed, coursing is one of those field sports where those engaged in it do not set out to kill what they hunt.  Despite media reports, there are very few hares killed at coursing meetings.  The average number of hares killed in a day's coursing is 5.69 hares.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, I am anxious not to interrupt the Deputy because I am conscious that he has a limited amount of time but in the context of that statistic, 5.69 perhaps he might clarify whether the 0.69 was the hare that <Col N="1966" /> got torn to pieces and the remaining 0.31 could not be found.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>Greyhound exports, which is a multi-million pound industry, benefit from coursing-breeding, because the element of coursing-breeding in Irish track dogs instills in them a greater instinct to hunt the artificial track.  This is the principal reason that Irish bred greyhounds are in such demand in Great Britain.  It is significant that in recent times breeders in the United States and Australia are importing Irish greyhounds with coursing bloodlines to rejuvenate the chasing instincts in the bloodlines of their greyhounds which has been lacking since the banning of coursing in those countries. Coursing bloodlines are present in the pedigree of 77 per cent of winners of major track events in England and Ireland in the past ten years.</P>
      <P>Apart from its sporting and social attributes, coursing also plays an important part in the commercial life of the country. A study of the economic significance of coursing in Ireland was carried out in 1990-91 by three economists of the Department of Agricultural Economics of University College, Dublin.  It concluded that the value of coursing to the Irish economy is in excess of £14 million per year.  The industry provides employment for greyhound trainers, their assistants and for veterinary surgeons and their assistants.  Spin off employment is created by manufacturers of specialised dog food, medications, tonics, collars, leads, greyhound covers, car trailers and so on.</P>
      <P>Hotels, guesthouses, bars and restaurants benefit from the influx of people to an area where coursing meetings are held.  The Irish Coursing Club is a large employer and has a full-time permanent staff of 41 and a significant number of part-time staff.  The majority of people who have not attended a coursing meeting have a distorted view of what coursing is all about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Ireland there are two forms of coursing, park enclosed coursing and open coursing.  In open coursing club member go searching for the hare in the country <Col N="1967" /> side on an organised basis and on finding it, they course it until it escapes from the dog and then give up the chase.  In park enclosed coursing the hares are gathered in an enclosure for some weeks prior to the coursing meeting.  There the hares have food and shelter and are enclosed in a habitat as close to their natural habitat as possible.  Hares have time to settle down, become familiar with their surroundings and discover the location of the important exists.  Hares can escape into an enclosure through an opening large enough for a hare but not for a dog to get through.</P>
    <P>On the day of coursing hares are collected at the opposite end of the field to the escape enclosure where they are examined by experienced officials.  If those officials consider the hare to be unsuitable, either because of its size or condition or for any other reason, they put it to one side and it is not coursed. When a suitable hare is selected the slipper, licensed by the governing body, the Irish Coursing Club makes a judgment in regard to the suitability of the hare for coursing.  If he is not satisfied, he will not release the dogs.  When he is satisfied, he decides how far to allow the dog up the field before he releases the hare.</P>
    <P>An average coursing field would be 350 to 400 yards long.  A slipper normally allows the hare about 50 yards leeway before releasing the dogs, thus the hare is usually a mere 50 yards from the escape when the greyhounds come close to it. The hare then jinks and turns at sharp angles to elude the greyhounds at each turn.  The hare gains much ground on the greyhounds who, because of their size, cannot turn as quickly.  When the hare goes through to the escape, usually after four to six turns, the course ends.  That hare is not coursed again.  When that coursing meeting concludes all the hares are released into the open country under the supervision of the Forestry and Wildlife Service, and always under the supervision of an ICC official.</P>
    <P>Recent correspondence I received from an anti-blood sport campaigner indicated that hares were transferred <Col N="1968" /> from one club to another.  This is one of the myths or deliberate lies fostered by the anti-coursing group and is not true. Under no circumstances is a club allowed to transfer hares to another club.  It is expressely forbidden by the rules of the ICC.  Each time this claim has been made the ICC has asked those making the claim to substantiate it and they have never done so.</P>
    <P>A full report is made after each coursing meeting by an official of the ICC which is then forwarded to the secretary of the ICC.  This report details, among other things, the number of courses run, the number of hares killed and the number of hares released.  The secretary also reports on the quality of the hares and the standard of the coursing.  If the secretary reports that the number of kills were above average the governing body would question the club concerned on its ability to hold a meeting and may decide to withdraw the club's licence as it has done in the past.</P>
    <P>Coursing, in its present form, is a tradition in the kingdom of Kerry and older forms of it were practised in the ancient kingdoms of Ireland.  The coursing folk of Kerry, men and women, are proud of their sport where they test the ability of their greyhounds and their talents of breeding, rearing and training.  It is a sport which the ordinary people can afford.  People can dream of owning a dog which might bring them glory and honour.  Those who can afford to breed racehorses for glory should be mindful of what is being waged against coursing because their sport is also on a hitlist as well as many other field sports.</P>
    <P>Coursing generates economic activity in many small villages and parishes in Kerry.  It is a source of income for many. It is a test of a small community's ability to come together and organise a successful coursing meeting.  The co-operation and organisational skills developed by people during the running of a coursing meeting has often led that community to become involved in further activity for the benefit of that locality.</P>
    <P>The primary motive of the seven clubs in Kerry is to hold meetings at which <Col N="1969" /> the best dog wins, having been tested by strong straight running hares all of whom are well trained and survive.  To this end the Kerry clubs have taken hare husbandry very seriously.  They strive to minimise any hare kills.  They know that hares die during coursing meetings.  They do not take any pleasure out of this and are willing to listen to any suggestion which will help eliminate kills.  They recognise that any hare kill is objectionable to the anti blood sports people and wonder if anything other than the complete abolition of their sport will satisfy some people.  They wonder why coursing has been singled out as it is the only field sport where the primary objective is not the killing of the hare. What about shooting and fishing?</P>
    <P>Much of the media is loud in its opposition to coursing and proudly publishes photographs of the first salmon of the season taken on the Liffey.  When will people see the hidden agenda when the killing of any animal or fish for any purpose will be outlawed?</P>
    <P>Kerry was beaten by the red and white of Cork on Sunday, but Kerry people have no objection to the sight of the red and white colours of two greyhounds going up a field behind a well fed and well trained hare waiting in anticipation for the judge to wave the winning colour, a decision which is accepted.</P>
    <P>We in Kerry are proud of the continuation of a tradition of hunting which is not an imported custom, but one as old as Ireland itself.  We in Kerry stand for an Ireland proud and secure in its own ways and we will not bow to the wind generated by people with an agenda of dictating the entire behaviour of the Irish people according to a code alien to their nature.</P>
    <P>I know few pleasures to equal the tremendous sense of achievement that one feels on the final evening of a well-run local coursing meeting.  A successful meeting is one where few, if any, hares are killed.  I must emphasise that the killing of hares is not a central part of coursing and, indeed, the hare is more loved and looked after by coursing people than by any other group.</P>

      <P>I have been attending a meeting with the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications Deputy Cowen, but I considered it incumbent on me to take part in this debate because I have strong views on this issue.  It is important that public representatives should not act like parrots.  When public representatives receive documentation from anti or pro hare coursing groups they must use their intelligence and draw on their experiences.  Public representatives should not be fooled by propaganda in which there are references to well-fed hares and so on.  Deputy Foley's speech reminded me of Mr. de Valera's speech about comely maidens, but it relates to the fantasy world of Goldsmith's &ldquo;Deserted Village&rdquo;.  That idealistic picture does not relate to the real world.  Public representatives must rely on their experiences.  Their role is to give their views as lay people on matters of State and legislation.  The delegates at the Labour Party's annual conference voted to oppose live hare coursing.  Delegates at our conferences decide policy in a broad manner and, generally, guide party members.</P>
      <P>Man's inhumanity to man does not end with man or women.  Such inhumanity also extends, unfortunately, to animals. Deputy Foley referred to well fed hares and so on but whether a hare is well fed or badly fed is irrelevant to this issue.  A third of my constituency takes in County Limerick and I know a great deal about the activities in my constituency and in Tipperary.</P>
      <P>It has been stated that hare coursing is part of our culture.  It is part of our rural culture and is followed by a minority of people.  However, because something is part of one's culture does not necessarily make it good or bad.  We must examine our culture and consider whether activities associated with it are relevant, lawful or civilised.  We cannot put our culture in a box to view it.  It is a changing and evolving concept.  Our understanding of culture also changes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move, &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of this Bill, which forms part of a comprehensive programme of reform of the criminal law which I have under way at present, is to decriminalise sexual activity between consenting mature males.  The Bill also contains a series of measures designed to protect the vulnerable; and to review and update the law on prostitution and related offences with particular emphasis on sanctions in relation to the clients of prostitutes and those who organise prostitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it is the case that the main sections of the Bill arise against a background of the European Court decision in the Norris case, it would be a pity to use that judgment as the sole pretext for the action we are now taking so as to avoid facing up to the issues themselves. What we are concerned with fundamentally in this Bill is a necessary development of human rights.  We are seeking to end that form of discrimination which says that those whose nature is to express themselves sexually in their personal relationships, as consenting adults, in a way which others disapprove of or feel uneasy about, must suffer the sanctions of the criminal law.  We are saying in 1993, over 130 years since that section of criminal law was enacted, that it is time we brought this form of human rights limitation to an end.  We are recognising that we are in an era in which values are being examined and <Col N="1972" /> questioned and that it is no more than our duty as legislators to show that we appreciate what is happening by dismantling a law which reflects the values of another time.</P>
    <P>That process of change is not easy and, understandably, many people worry that the traditional values which they hold so dear, and many of which are fundamentally sound, are under siege from emerging modern realities.  But, of course, it is not a matter of laying siege to all the old certainties, nor is it a matter of jettisoning sound values simply to run with a current tide of demand, which may or may not be a majority demand.  It is, rather, a matter of closely looking at values and asking ourselves whether it is necessary, or right, that they be propped up for the comfort of the majority by applying discriminatory and unnecessary laws to a minority, any minority.</P>
    <P>As a people we have proved our ability to adopt a balanced and mature approach in dealing with complex social issues.  In this context I am particularly pleased to note that, by and large, the public debate which has taken place in relation to the area covered by the Bill has been marked by a lack of stridency and by a respect for the sincerity of the views held by others.</P>
    <P>Because some of the issues raised by this Bill are ones on which many people have deeply and sincerely held opposing views, it is perhaps inevitable that in the public debate the reality of what the Bill actually proposes to do can sometimes be lost sight of in the context of wider issues which tend to be raised.  For this reason it is important to emphasise that the House is not being asked to take a view as to whether sexual behaviour of the kind dealt with in the main sections of the Bill should be regarded as morally or socially acceptable.  Instead, what is simply at issue is whether it is right in this day and age that the full force and sanctions of the criminal law should be available in relation to such forms of sexual behaviour.</P>
    <P>Majority values do not require that kind of support and I believe this is something that each of us knows instinctively. <Col N="1973" /> We know in ourselves also that values which are truly worthwhile in themselves are strengthened &mdash; not weakened &mdash; when we remove forms of apparent support which ignore the rights of others.  In other areas of public concern and debate in this country we have come to appreciate the need to recognise, respect and value difference.  This House needs no reminding of the tragedy which ensues when difference is deprived the right of expression and suppressed.</P>
    <P>Returning specifically to the theme of the Bill, does anybody believe that if the laws from the last century which we are now seeking to repeal did not in fact exist, we would now be seriously suggesting that they would be enacted?  How can we reconcile criminal sanctions in this area with the fact that there is a whole range of other private, consenting behaviour between adults which may be regarded by many as wrong but in which the criminal law has no part to play?</P>
    <P>Some parents, in particular, may be uncomfortable about what is being proposed and I fully understand what gives rise to that discomfort.  That is why it is so important that we understand precisely what is being proposed.  It is the removal of discrimination in the case of consenting adults in respect of their sexuality, not the removal of protection in the case of children and other vulnerable members of society.  In fact, the Bill seeks to protect the vulnerable where protection did not exist heretofore.</P>
    <P>I know too that there are parents who will know what it means in practice to have a child whose very nature it is to be homosexual.  Very few of them would, I believe, be likely to regard it as helpful if in later life one of their own children was an active homosexual, liable to imprisonment &mdash; under the present law up to life imprisonment &mdash; for giving expression to his sexual orientation.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that it is any answer to say that in practice these laws are rarely if ever implemented and we would be best to leave well enough alone.  Such an approach would be dishonest, could bring the law generally into disrepute and, it seems to me, would be grossly <Col N="1974" /> and gratuitously offensive to those who happen to be homosexual.  Genuine tolerance is not achieved by the turning of a blind eye.  The social acceptability of homosexuality is not something which by our laws we can decree; the hurt which homosexuals feel at their treatment as outcasts by some members of the community is not something which we can dispel by the use of some legislative magic wand.  What we can do under the terms of this Bill is leave those of homosexual orientation free to come to terms with their lives and express themselves in personal relationships without the fear of being branded and being punished as criminals.</P>
    <P>There is also, of course, the concern expressed by those who feel that removal of the criminal sanction in effect may be seen as a form of encouragement to engage in homosexual activity, that removal will in practice have this result and that this, in turn, will lead to the spread of disease.  There is nothing to support the proposition that removal of the criminal sanction in the case of consenting adults &mdash; I repeat that what we are talking about are consenting adults &mdash; will lead to an increase in promiscuity. Nor is there any evidence that it inevitably follows that removal of the criminal sanctions will foster the spread of disease.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the disease issue, specifically the question of AIDS, will be raised in the course of the debate on the Bill.  For now, I will confine myself to two comments.  First of all, the right course in dealing with the possible spread of disease through sexual intercourse is to encourage safe sexual practices, not criminalise one form of sexual activity. Secondly, there is no doubt that disease can be, and is, spread by unsafe heterosexual activity but nobody seriously suggests that the right course, therefore, is to criminalise heterosexuality.  I am not being dismissive of the AIDS issue &mdash; the subject is far too serious for a dismissive approach &mdash; what I am saying is that the solution is not a ban on homosexual activity.</P>
    <P>I hope that in stating the case in these terms I will have been able to go some <Col N="1975" /> way towards allaying the concerns of those who feel uneasy about what is being proposed.  Our social fabric is not going to be eroded as a result of these measures. People will remain entitled to retain their moral beliefs in relation to homosexual behaviour and to seek to convince others of the correctness of those beliefs.  All that will change is that the criminal law will have no part in attempting to enforce those beliefs.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, the wider European dimension which I have already mentioned.  Every Deputy will be aware that in October 1988 the European Court of Human Rights found in an application to it from Senator David Norris that our laws on homosexuality were in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights.  The Court found that the impugned legislation interfered with Senator Norris's right to respect for his private life under Article 8.1 of the European Convention.  The argument has been put forward that Ireland should seek a derogation from our obligations under the convention in respect of the Norris judgment.  In answer to that I would refer not only to the terms of the judgment itself but also to the terms of the European Convention on Human Rights which Ireland ratified in 1953 &mdash; we were, in fact, one of the first signatories.</P>
    <P>Article 53 of the convention provides that: &ldquo;the High Contracting Parties undertake to abide by the decisions of the Court in any case to which they are parties&rdquo;.  Under Article 54 of the Convention judgments of the Court are transmitted to the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe which supervises their execution.  It is for the party concerned, and in the case under discussion the party is the Government of Ireland, to give effect to the judgment and, should it fail to do so, it would be for the Committee of Ministers to decide what action should be taken.  The Committee does not have power to force states into compliance but it would, if the need arose, have strong persuasive authority backed, in the last resort, by the power of suspension from the Council of Europe.  We <Col N="1976" /> in this country have always played a very full and active role in the Council and I am sure most Deputies will agree that it would be wrong if we now put our continued membership of the Council in jeopardy.</P>
    <P>The terms of the decision of the court put the possibility of a derogation from our obligations under the Convention out of the question.  The Court found that the reasons put forward as justifying the interference in respect of Senator Norris's private life were not sufficient to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (2) of Article 8 of the Convention.  That is the paragraph that deals with such matters as the interests of national security, public safety or the economic wellbeing of the country, prevention of disorder or crime, protection of health or morals or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.</P>
    <P>Proceeding now to the details of the legislation, the first question, having made the decision to introduce legislation, was what should be the age of consent?  Different possibilities were considered but in the end the Government could find no compelling reason for a different age of consent applying to homosexual acts and to heterosexual acts.  Accordingly, the age of consent for homosexual acts will be 17 years.  This common age of consent is quite high by European standards but I am satisfied that, both for heterosexual acts and homosexual acts, it is right for Ireland.</P>
    <P>Section 11 of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1885, was one of the sections found to be in breach of Article 8 of the Convention on Human Rights. It proscribes acts of gross indecency between men, either in public or in private.  Section 4 of the Bill will replace section 11 of the 1885 Act.  In future, it will be an offence for a male to commit an act of gross indecency with another male under 17 years of age. There is not, and never has been, an equivalent offence for females and I do not intend to introduce one.  Gross indecency is a term that is well understood by the courts and by the prosecuting authorities.  For that reason I am <Col N="1977" /> retaining the concept of gross indecency in the law.  If the offence of gross indecency was abolished, boys between 15 and 17 years of age would have no protection against the commission of homosexual acts involving them.  The indecent or sexual assault provisions of the law would offer protection only to boys in that age group where an actual assault took place, whereas gross indecency does not require an assault to have taken place.  Boys and girls under 15 years of age will continue to have the protection of the 1935 Act provisions whereby the consent of such a young person is not a defence to a charge of sexual assault.</P>
    <P>The Bill also protects mentally impaired persons against certain sexual offences.  I have taken the opportunity afforded by this Bill to repeal section 4 of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1935.  That is the section that protects women who are described in it as &ldquo;imbeciles, idiots and feeble minded&rdquo; from being unlawfully carnally known.  I would regard these words as insulting and unacceptable and they have no place in legislation in this country at the end of the 20th century.  Therefore, section 5 protects mentally impaired persons against both heterosexual and homosexual intercourse and mentally impaired males against gross indecency by a male.</P>
    <P>The penalties for offences under section 5 are the same for both offences. The penalty in section 4 of the 1935 Act is a maximum of two years imprisonment, although this is increased to a maximum of five years by section 254 of the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, where the perpetrator has the care or charge of the victim. I regard that penalty of two years as too low and accordingly, I have taken the opportunity to substantially increase the penalty for having sexual intercourse or attempting to have sexual intercourse with a mentally impaired person.</P>
    <P>Mental impairment is sometimes, particularly in a case of mild mental impairment, a difficult concept to quantify in the context of offences being committed against such persons.  A very <Col N="1978" /> mildly mentally handicapped person may be able to give consent to sexual intercourse and I do not wish in this Bill to do anything that might be seen as unduly restrictive in relation to such persons. The definition of &ldquo;mentally impaired&rdquo; contains within it the objective concept of whether a person is capable of living an independent life.  Also, as at present, the accused will have a defence; in section 5 (3) the accused will have the opportunity to show that at the time of the alleged commission of an offence he did not know and had no reason to suspect that the person in respect of whom he is charged was mentally impaired.  In addition, proceedings against a person charged with an offence against a mentally impaired person shall not be taken except by or with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  This will ensure consistency in prosecuting policy and will obviate inappropriate prosecutions being taken.  The proposals in relation to the mentally impaired are generally in line with the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in their report on sexual offences against the mentally handicapped.</P>
    <P>Finally, on the aspects of the Bill I have been speaking about I would like to make the point that the proposals on homosexual offences are broadly in line with the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in their report on child sexual abuse.  The Second Commission on the Status of Women also recommended legislation to decriminalise homosexual acts between consenting adults.</P>
    <P>I have also taken the opportunity in the Bill to revise and update the law in relation to prostitution and related offences.  Section 6 creates a new offence of soliciting or importuning for purposes of the commission of a sexual offence. The offences comprehended by the section are those under section 3, 4 or 5 of this Bill and sections 1 or 2 of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act 1935. This section will replace section 1 (1) of the Vagrancy Act, 1898, under which it was an offence for a male person in any <Col N="1979" /> public place to persistently solicit or importune for immoral purposes.</P>
    <P>Section 6 will protect young persons and mentally impaired persons from being solicited or importuned for sexual purposes, whether heterosexual or homosexual, and whether the person soliciting or importuning is a male or female. It does not matter whether the soliciting or importuning takes place in a public place or not as the type of offence that could be committed could well be committed in a private residence.  We are all aware that some child sexual abuse is committed by neighbours or friends of the parents of children who are abused and quite often the potential abuser will solicit or importune the child in his own home or even in the child's home.</P>
    <P>In dealing with prostitution in this Bill I am concerned only with updating and strengthening certain aspects of the present laws.  It was not my intention to review in any comprehensive manner all the offences relating to prostitution.  As the basis for what I propose to do in this Bill in relation to prostitution I have considered the relevant chapters of the Law Reform Commission's Report on Vagrancy and Related Offences which was published in 1985 and which recommended the repeal of a number of 19th century provisions as well as some provisions enacted in 1912 and in 1935. Sections 7 and 8 of the Bill replace the repealed provisions.  Section 7 simply makes it an offence to solicit or importune another person in a street or public place for the purposes of prostitution.</P>
    <P>I have decided not to make loitering for the purposes of prostitution an offence. Although it is an offence at present, in practice it is ignored because of the judgment of the Supreme Court in 1981 in King <i>v.</i> AG and DPP.  I would regard the approach in section 8 as the proper approach.  Under section 8 even though the person has not been seen to solicit or importune another person for the purposes of prostitution, if a garda suspects that the person is loitering for that purpose he or she can direct the person to immediately leave the street or public <Col N="1980" /> place.  An offence will only be committed if the person without reasonable cause fails to comply with the direction by a garda under section 8 (1).</P>
    <P>For the first time, a person who solicits or importunes from a motor vehicle for the purposes of prostitution will be committing an offence.  The loitering provisions also extend to loitering in a motor vehicle.  Thus, the garda will now be able to deal with kerb-crawlers.  These new offences cover solicitation or importuning of either a male or a female person by a male or female person for the purposes of prostitution, whether it is male prostitution or female prostitution and are in line with a recommendation of the Second Commission on the Status of Women.  They are generally in line also with the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in the vagrancy report.</P>
    <P>Section 9 and 10 which deal with exploitation of prostitutes are also based on recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in their report on vagrancy and related matters.  Section 9 covers the situation where active &ldquo;management&rdquo; of prostitution is engaged in.  It also gets over any difficulties there might be about showing that money received by a person controlling a prostitute or organising prostitution constituted &ldquo;earnings of prostitutes&rdquo; in cases where the pimp did not receive payment from the prostitute herself but from the client, for example.</P>
    <P>Section 10, living on the earnings of prostitution, is aimed at the person who lives parasitically on a prostitute's earnings but without actively managing or controlling her activities.  However, so that children or other dependent relatives of a prostitute could not be considered to be living on the earnings of prostitution the revised offence contained in section 10 can be committed only where the person living on the earnings of prostitution also aids and abets that prostitution.</P>
    <P>Most of the legislation which it is proposed to repeal in this Bill is, by any standards, ancient.  One glance at the Schedule of repeals will reveal references to Acts of 1842, 1847, 1861 and so on.  Of <Col N="1981" /> course, just because legislation is old is not in itself a valid reason for repealing it.  However, where it is outdated, or inoperable, or simply unacceptable because of the language used, being language of another age, we have a valid reason for repealing.</P>
    <P>While inevitably much of the public attention which has been given to this Bill has concentrated on the issue of homosexuality, the other provisions which I have outlined &mdash; particularly in relation to the protection of the vulnerable and the emphasis on sanctions against clients of prostitutes and those who organise prostitution &mdash; will also be seen as worthwhile and substantial changes to our law.  Overall the Bill is a balanced, measured and enlightened approach to the sensitive and difficult issues with which it deals.  It is right that we should take the opportunity, now, of rolling back over 130 years of legislative prohibition which is discriminatory, which reflects an inadequate understanding of the human condition and which we should, rightly, see as an impediment, not a prop, to the maintenance and development of sound social values and norms.  I am pleased, therefore, to commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputy McGrath.  The Minister's speech and the contents of the Bill cannot be reconciled.  The Minister has made a very liberal sounding speech and there are certainly some liberal provisions in the Bill but why are draconian measures included in the Bill?  The Minister is using draconian measures as a smokescreen to hide what needs to be addressed while putting at risk male and female prostitutes.  The measures are included in a cosmetic exercise to satisfy some of her own backbenchers.  This legislation is not the place for them.  I wonder if there is any place for the extended penalties the Minister is introducing here.  Those issues should be considered separately in detail by the House in other legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While private morality among consenting adults is not a matter which <Col N="1982" /> should require legislation, the Legislature had a duty to encourage responsible behaviour particularly where lives can be ruined and diseases can be spread. In the explanatory memorandum, this Bill purports to have as its primary purpose the objective of decriminalising buggery between adults.  The Bill proposes to do this by repealing the existing law prohibiting buggery between persons and proposing new provisions prohibiting that conduct with mentally impaired persons and with persons under the age of 17 years.</P>
    <P>The 1960s saw a vigorous intellectual debate in Britain, sometimes known as the Hart/Devlan controversy, about the proper scope of criminal law and the extent to which it is the function of criminal law to seek to enforce morality.  This had an obvious particular relevance to sexual matters and gave rise to a commission of inquiry known as the Woofington Commission which investigated a number of sexual offences, including prostitution and homosexuality. The consequence of this was that in 1967 the British Parliament on a free vote passed the Sexual Offences Act which decriminalised homosexual acts of a consensual nature committed in private between adults &mdash; over 21 years.  The legislation was introduced by the Home Secretary, Mr. Roy Jenkins, and formed part of his civilised society campaign.  It was quite restrictive in that the definition of &ldquo;in private&rdquo; excluded a situation where anyone else was present and also specifically was defined to exclude public toilets.  Also excluded from the provisions of the Act were members of the armed forces.</P>
    <P>The fact that the law has not changed in Ireland, North or South, has given rise to a degree of agitation.  This resulted in a Northern Ireland gay activist bringing a case before the European Court of Human Rights.  In the case of <i>Dudgeon v. the United Kingdom,</i> the European Court of Human Rights declared United Kingdom law to be inconsistent with Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, similar legislation to that applied in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1983" /> No doubt encouraged by the success of Mr. Dudgeon in Europe, Senator David Norris, then a Trinity College English Lecturer, launched a challenge to the constitutionality of the 1861 Act, as amended.  The Supreme Court, by a three to two majority, rejected contentions on behalf of Senator Norris that to render criminal homosexual acts between men which were not similarly treated if committed by women amounted to invidious discrimination, that the plaintiff's right to privacy had been subjected to unwarranted interference not justified by public good and that prohibition on homosexual acts inhibited his right to the freedom of expression in an association enjoyed by heterosexuals.  It is of some interest to note that one prominent judge, who delivered a vigorous judgment as part of the majority rejecting the challenge to the constitutionality of the legislation, has been quoted as stating, extra judicially, that he would favour reform of the law.</P>
    <P>Inevitably, Senator Norris appealed to Europe and, almost inevitably, succeeded. It is Europe that is making us address this question here this evening; it is not the Department of Justice, the Government or this House.  We are being compelled to address this question.  That is regrettable in itself.  We should make our laws as we see fit and not have to be dragged into making these laws by external bodies.</P>
    <P>Following on the success of the Norris case the State had no choice but to amend its legislation or witness its continued membership of the Council of Europe being called into question.  In general, two alternative approaches to reforming legislation have been canvassed.  These are, first, what might be loosely termed a minimalist approach which would be essentially to enact the British legislation, or legislation broadly based thereon and, second, a more fundamental approach which would seem to approximate the legal treatment of homosexual and heterosexual acts.</P>
    <P>The recommendations of the Law Reform Commission are to be found at paragraph 429 of their report on Child <Col N="1984" /> Sexual Abuse, at page 48.  There they recommend firmly that sections 61 and 62 of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, and section 11 of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1885, rendering acts of buggery and gross indecency between male persons, criminal, be repealed and that there should be the same protection against homosexual and heterosexual exploitation of the young.</P>
    <P>The effect of this recommendation in the past would have been that 17 would have been a common age of consent for both homosexual and heterosexual activity.  It should be of interest to note that for the future the Law Reform Commission has recommended that heterosexual intercourse on the part of persons between the ages of 15 and 17 should not be an offence except where the male is more than five years older than the female or is a person of authority. In the event of this recommendation being accepted, the Law Reform Commission has not recommended a similar reduction in age in respect of homosexual offences.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael will support those sections of the Bill dealing with this area but will table an amendment on Committee Stage to increase the age from 17 years, as proposed in the Bill, to 18 years.  It is the view of my party that 18 years, being the age of majority, is the appropriate age that should apply in this case.  My party is conscious that teenage years can be tender ones and is anxious to strike the correct balance between removing unnecessary criminal tabbos and protecting vulnerable people under the law. There is a case for making the age of heterosexual and homosexual offences equal, but on balance my party feels that a case has been made already by the Law Reform Commission for differenting in certain circumstances.  My party feels that such differentation would be justified in this case.</P>
    <P>In this regard it is not my wish to reflect in any way on the sexuality of anybody, homosexual or heterosexual. It is about time that this legislaltion was brought up to date.  But it is the opinion of the Fine Gael Party, having considered <Col N="1985" /> the matter, that 18 should be the appropriate age in relation to this particular offence.</P>
    <P>In relation to the remainder of the Bill, we would say it is disingenuous to include in this Bill reactionary legislation dressed up as liberal legislation.  For example, there is no attempt made to protect prostitutes in any real way.  Sections 7 and 8 of the Bill prohibit males or females from soliciting or importuning, with severe penalties &mdash; an increase from £2 to a maximum of £1,000 or three months imprisonment, or both.  By any standard that is draconian.  Indeed, the provisions of the Bill do nothing to assist prostitutes, male or female, or to discourage them from their activities.  I contend that this level of fine may well give rise to blackmail and extortion in the case of people who would be frightened not to pay their blackmailer for fear that they might end up on one or two occasions before the courts, being meted out huge fines they simply could not pay.  Indeed, the reason many of these men and women are on the streets in the first place is that they do not have a sufficient income; they are there for economic reasons.  To impose penalties of this magnitude on people in this category seems to me to be draconian and leaves them open to blackmail and extortion because they would be fearful of being caught or so to speak, ratted on.  Therefore, I would suggest that that penalty be reduced to £500 and, on indictment on first offence, there should be no question of imprisonment.</P>
    <P>It is my belief that the manner in which the Bill approaches this overall question of prostitutes, male or female, pushes the problem further underground, leading to the further spread of disease and rendering prostitutes more vulnerable than they are already.  It could lead to our prisons being filled with sexual offenders instead of violent criminals, the people who should be imprisoned.  In addition, it opens up the possibility of financial corruption, blackmail and extortion of prostitutes, who might prefer to pay cash to others for fear of being reported and being made liable to a £1,000 fine.  It takes no account of the primary need to <Col N="1986" /> protect all of those involved against life-threatening disease.  We ban the brothels; we fine the prostitute; I believe we should do something to endeavour to protect prostitutes from the spread of disease.</P>
    <P>For example, under section 11 of the Bill would it be unthinkable to make it a further offence, carrying the same penalties &mdash; even though one would be breaking the law in keeping a brothel &mdash; not to display health warnings in such premises?  Would it be possible to do that?  I do not believe it would.  We are already making provision for prostitutes to be prosecuted and a further prosecution to take place where their earnings have been &ldquo;immorally earned&rdquo;; and if passed on to a person living off them, that person can be further prosecuted. There is no provision in the Bill to be proactive in protecting the health of those involved, in particular prostitutes.  Nor does it take account of the fact, as some reports suggest, that up to 75 per cent of prostitutes are people who suffered sexual abuse at some time in their childhood. For that reason I believe these are reactionary measures which should be the subject of detailed consideration by this House in proper committee.</P>
    <P>I want to make one further point.  I believe there is a need for a proactive role to be undertaken by this House, the Government and Government agencies &mdash; for example, health boards &mdash; to engage in a campaign promoting responsible attitudes to sexual behaviour, whether it be homosexual or heterosexual. I am not singling out any particular group.  For those who are young and vulnerable the fact that we pass legislation here allowing for contraception, allowing the sale of condoms from vending machines, may be necessary and even welcome, particularly in the case of homosexuals who have suffered enough. We do not adopt a proactive approach to try to convince people that they should behave in a responsible manner, that is, that they should not pass on disease, particularly life threatening diseases, or have unwanted pregnancies.  In the Eastern Health Board they use the term &ldquo;casual father&rdquo; where a man has made <Col N="1987" /> two or three women pregnant at the same time and has not accepted responsibility, not to mention the diseases that may have been passed on.  While it may be necessary to pass this liberal legislation our role and responsibility do not end there.  If we are truly committed to taking steps to promote responsible sexual behaviour we should adopt a pro-active approach and not be afraid to take the campaign to the people.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael will not oppose the Bill on Second Stage but will introduce amendments on Committee Stage to take account of the reservations expressed.</P>
    <P>In her speech, in referring to section 4 of the 1935 Act, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>I regard that penalty of two years as too low and accordingly I have taken the opportunity to substantially increase the penalty for having sexual intercourse or attempting to have sexual intercourse with a mentally impaired person.</P>
    <P>I welcome that provision but do not know if it has come too late to be applied in the case of whoever was responsible for carrying out the attack in Grafton Street earlier today.  I never heard of anything more sickening or frightening. I hope it will apply but, if not, it will apply in other cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Mitchell, for sharing his time with me.  The Bill aims to decriminalise sexual activity between consenting males over the age of 17 years and repeals the relevant sections of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The incidence of homosexuality is estimated to be in the region of 1 per cent of the population.  It was previously thought that the figure was much higher but recent studies confirm this lower figure, which means that homosexuals are a marginal group in society.  There is some difference of opinion in relation to sexual orientation, whether homosexuals are the product of their environment or born with this condition which may manifest itself at some stage in their adult life. <Col N="1988" /> Experts differ on this point and there will probably never be a definitive answer one way or the other.</P>
    <P>Homosexuality is also seen as a relatively modern phenomenon as references to it in history are scarce or non-existent. However, there are references to it in literature in recent centuries.  Of course, one's sexual orientation is not morally wrong; it is not one's fault that one is attracted to somebody of the same sex. Homosexuals should not be looked down on or victimised and it is wrong to encourage or condone attacks on gay people.</P>
    <P>How adults behave in the privacy of their own homes is their own business and I have sympathy for homosexuals who are now deemed to be committing crimes by homosexual acts.  Such activities are criminalised under the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861.  However, we must realise that, to my knowledge, there have not been prosecutions against any such persons for at least 40 years. Therefore, even though the law exists, in effect it has not been used in latter years and homosexuals can rest assured that their activities will not bring them before the courts.</P>
    <P>If this Bill is passed, I am concerned about the possible effect on Irish society. Will we now see exhibitions in public by homosexuals holding hands, kissing, cuddling, etc?  Is homosexual behaviour to be put on a par with heterosexual behaviour?  We should reflect on the fact that the majority of people do not favour such a move.  What effect will this have on our children who may be influenced by it?  How does it fit in with the perception of the family which holds pride of place in our Constitution?  Will we be faced with requests that homosexuals should be allowed to marry and perhaps adopt children?  This has already happened in other countries where such requests have been made.  Will Ireland follow the lead of Denmark and similar societies in Europe and experience the breakdown of society that has occurred in some of these countries?</P>
    <P>This Bill has designated the age of 17 <Col N="1989" /> years as the age of consent for homosexual activity.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>It is the removal of discrimination in the case of consenting adults in respect of their sexuality, not the removal of protection in the case of children and other vulnerable members of society. In fact the Bill seeks to protect the vulnerable where protection did not exist heretofore.</P>
    <P>I strongly question the designated age.  A person of 17 years is not an adult.  It is worth noting that the legal age for homosexual behaviour in Britain is 21 years.  The Bill implies that the age of adulthood in Ireland is 17 years.  I strongly disagree with this.</P>
    <P>Young people of this age are probably still attending secondary school.  Typically, they are preparing for the leaving certificate or may have left school and doing an apprenticeship course.  It is generally agreed that girls at this age are more mature than their male counterparts and many of us who have teenage children would vouch for this.</P>
    <P>Young lads at this age are still in their formative years where peer group pressure is important.  This Bill will allow these vulnerable young men to enter into homosexual relationships.  They will be very vulnerable to homosexual adults who might even be their teachers.  Sadly, this Bill condones and legalises such a situation.  Yet, in Ireland young people cannot vote until they reach 18 years.  It is also worth noting that our young people cannot marry under the age of 21 without the written consent of both parents.</P>
    <P>The exploitation of young people is sometimes a factor in homosexual behaviour. Recently a Columban priest, Father Shay Cullen, who is at present ministering in the Philippines, was lucky to escape with his life when he exposed the exploitation of young people in that country by organised gay tours from developed countries.  It is also interesting to note that recently some gay people in Britain claimed that attacks on their members have increased since the laws were changed there.</P>
    <P>Even though the gay community <Col N="1990" /> account for just 1 per cent of the population, about 30 per cent are AIDS victims. International surveys also indicate that gays have a much shorter life expectancy than their heterosexual counterparts, while a survey in the United States found that gay people are probably 87 times more likely to be murdered and 25 times more likely to commit suicide than their heterosexual counterparts.</P>

      <P>The Bill, in so far as it finally delivers on Ireland's duty to comply with its obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights, is welcome but the circumstances in which it has been introduced in the House reflect considerable discredit and shame, especially on the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
      <P>In 1988 when the Strasbourg Court handed down its decision, at the behest of Senator Norris &mdash; I would like to salute his courage in standing up for his rights as an individual; something which has not been done so far in the debate &mdash; the Fianna Fáil Party was in office.  In 1989, it formed a coalition with the Progressive Democrats and, as part of their Programme for Government, the two parties agreed to implement laws to deal with the situation created by the Norris judgment in Strasbourg.  Unfortunately, the Fianna Fáil Party reneged on that commitment.  Even in 1991 when the commitment was again renewed on paper the Taoiseach told the public that reform of the law in relation to homosexuality was at the bottom of his list of priorities. That was shameful double talk on his part.  For the purpose of getting into office his party agreed to do one thing but for the purpose of trying to maintain support among a certain element of the population it was unwilling to deliver honourably on the deal it had made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has changed in the meantime? Fianna Fáil has gone into coalition with <Col N="1991" /> the Labour Party, which, it must be conceded, has more leverage on it.  Finally, it has admitted that the commitment it made to this party in 1989 will be delivered on.  It is clear from the Minister's speech that this commitment would never have been delivered on if it had not been for the decision of the European Court of Human Rights.  Ireland was great for going to that court during the early seventies and pointing out that Irish citizens were being tortured and invoking international standards of human behaviour in our interests when it suited us.  It is also clear that the Fianna Fáil Party in particular sought to abandon the moral duty imposed by the 1988 decision when it suited it electorally and politically.</P>
    <P>The 1983 decision of the Supreme Court in the Norris case was unfortunate. However, times have changed and we have moved on a bit since then.  In so far as it purports to take away the stigma attached to homosexuals in our law, I very much welcome this Bill on behalf of the Progressive Democrats.  This Bill proposes to change our criminal law. I note in particular the remarks made by some members of the Hierarchy about the criminal law and its function.  It was suggested that laws in some sense should reflect models of behaviour.  Are the people who put forward that view of the criminal law really aware of the facts?  I have probably practised criminal law more than any other Member of the House.  During my 19 years as a practising barrister I have never come across an occasion on which someone was prosecuted for gross indecency and I have seen cases of buggery charged in the courts on infrequent occasions only.  The stigma of criminality prevented many people from playing an active role in this community, prevented people from being appointed to the bench, prevented people from pursuing a life in politics and prevented people from playing a role in both professional organisations and their communities.  That stigma of criminality existed as a potential blackmailer's charter on those individuals.  It was deeply hypocritical of the Irish State to effectively <Col N="1992" /> suspend the prosecution of homosexual offences while at the same time leave the crime on our Statute Book. It was deeply hypocritical of this State to leave on our Statute Book laws which we had neither the will nor intention to apply, as they stigmatised a section of our community whom we no longer believed deserved such a stigma.</P>
    <P>The Hierarchy is entitled to make moral judgments and give moral teaching to its flock.  Does the Hierarchy really believe that it is appropriate, or ever was appropriate, to put a man in jail because he had consented to engage in a sexual act with another man in private?  Did it believe that that should have been the law?  Did anyone believe that two men who behaved in that way and who were somehow discovered by a third party should spend time in Mountjoy Prison? Does any member of the Hierarchy think that that was a Christian or proper thing to do in such cases?  Was there any moral justification in our society for handing down such sentences?  If there was no justification for this, the sooner that offence is cleared off the Statute Book the better.</P>
    <P>There are other areas where the criminal law is discordant with practice.  One has only to look at the law on bigamy where, unfortunately, because of the discordancy between the civil and canon laws, marriages carried out in good faith by Catholic priests under canon law are under our civil criminal law bigamist marriages. This leaves these priests open to criminal sanctions.  If a priest who in good faith carried out a marriage ceremony which was technically bigamous was threatened with prison, I have no doubt that we would not have to wait long for a message from the hierarchy asking for the criminal law to be brought into line with reality.  We cannot have different standards in different areas.  If we do not propose to punish homosexual males for acts in which they engage in private, then it should not be an offence on our Statute Book.  If we do not propose to send them to prison we should not have the power to send them to prison on our Statute Book.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1993" /> The explanatory memorandum states that the primary purpose of the Bill is to decriminalise buggery between adult persons.  That is an outrageous proposition. That is not what the people of Ireland asked for, and it is not the primary purpose of the Bill.  The primary purpose of the Bill is not connected with the crime of buggery; it is connected with the homosexual orientation of certain people.  With the greatest of respect, buggery is a minor incident in that.  The issue is whether people with a male homosexual orientation are committing crimes when they engage in sexual activities. This Bill is welcome in so far as it finally puts an end to that stigma.  However, I am afraid that that is where my praise for this Bill must end.</P>
    <P>A number of the provisions in the Bill are entirely draconian.  I draw the attention of the House to section 6, which states:</P>
    <P>A person who solicits or importunes another person for the purposes of the commission of an act which would constitute an offence under section 3, 4 or 5 of this Act or section 1 or 2 of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1935, shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £1,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both.</P>
    <P>The Minister rightly pointed out that this does not require the importuning or soliciting to be done in a public place.  I want to give an example of what this means.  I give this example for the House's consideration. A schoolmaster in a boarding school who is accused by a boy under his care of importuning him to commit an act which would amount to gross indecency would not even be entitled to a jury trial under this section; he would be brought before a district justice.  This provision makes this a summary offence for which he can be sent to prison for 12 months.  I should like to know which Members of the House believe that is a fair way to treat people.  It is an outrageous proposal.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to dwell at length on the question of prostitution as my colleagues <Col N="1994" /> have some points to make on this issue. However, section 7 proposes to send to prison for three months people who either ask for the services of a prostitute or agree to deliver the services of a prostitute in a public place.  Does the Minister not know that there is no room in our jails at present?  Today I heard about a person who has been charged with a very serious offence and who was recently let out of prison having served one year of a three year sentence for an equally serious offence.  Does the Minister not know that jailing prostitutes and their clients is a draconian and totally outrageous penalty to apply to individuals?  Why should a man who, for whatever reason, asks for the services of a prostitute on the street be sent to jail for three months?  I should like the Minister to explain that to me. Why should a prostitute, who is at the lowest end of the pecking order in society, be jailed for three months for agreeing to give her services to this man? What is fair about that?  Why should these people be sent to prison?  Surely a different solution is required?  It is outrageous to suggest that these people should be jailed in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that people consorting with prostitutes would be treated differently under this law.  However, section 10 (2) provides that:</P>
    <P>In any proceedings for an offence under subsection (1) [which is living in whole or in part on the earnings of a prostitute and aiding and abetting prostitution] it shall be presumed unless the contrary is shown, that a person who lives with or is habitually in the company of a prostitute was at the time of the alleged offence living on the earnings of that prostitute from prostitution and was aiding and abetting such prostitution.</P>
    <P>Does this mean a prostitute is not allowed to have a boyfriend any more because there is a presumption in law that he lives on her earnings and aids and abets the commission by her of offences?  Where did the Minister get this law?  Where did she get such a draconian suggestion?  I suggest that it was tacked on to the end <Col N="1995" /> of the Bill in order to make it acceptable to some moral majority that should be in the back benches behind the Minister but is not.  The only view one can draw is that a concession was made to liberalism on the one hand&mdash; it was reluctantly dragged out of Fianna Fáil by circumstances, by political pressure, by the Council of Europe and the Court in Strasbourg.  In order to keep everybody happy the Minister had to put in something that would show that the old values still apply and she picked out a weak sector, prostitutes and their clients and threatens to send them to jail.  This is a shameful suggestion and should not be countenanced any further.</P>
    <P>Let me reiterate that prostitution, of itself is not illegal, only importuning a prostitute's services in public is illegal. If the Minister is really serious about clamping down on brothels will she address a deficiency in the Bill in regard to this?  I read in today's edition of <i>In Dublin,</i> which I purchased today, on pages 86 to 89&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>In Dublin</i> volume 18, No. 13: June 23-July 6.  There are three pages of advertisements for what are clearly brothels and nobody but a fool would mistake them for anything else. They are quite elaborate, no address is given just a contact point, through a mobile telephone.  If the Minister is really serious about stamping out brothels, perhaps the first thing she should do is tell the management of that magazine &mdash; which I believe is not totally strange to her political party &mdash; to stop printing advertisements for brothels and I suggest she fine them when they take in what must be very large sums of money for assisting the running of brothels.  It is about time we faced up to reality.  That magazine has been printed in that format for a very long time, those advertisements have been appearing, although with less sophistication, and have been printed in that format for a long time and <Col N="1996" /> nothing has really happened except on a few occasions there have been a few show trials with video evidence of particular premises in the city.  The time has come to level with ourselves.  If the Minister wants the vice squad to go around the squares and streets of inner city Dublin and close down massage parlours, by all means let her tell us, but if she does not intend to do that stop codding us by tacking on to a liberal Bill this draconian, totally unwarranted measure that is over the top in order to satisfy the phantoms who should be occupying the empty benches behind her.</P>

      <P>This Bill is about human rights, but in that regard it is schizophrenic. It adopts a very positive and liberal approach to homosexuality.  I support the provisions in this Bill in relation to homosexuality.  It is about freedom, tolerating difference and respecting the rights of other consenting adults &mdash; I think 17 is the appropriate age for young people to fulfil their sexual orientation and not to be declared criminal in the process.  As Daniel O'Connell once said: &ldquo;By extending freedoms to others you enhance and not diminish your own&rdquo;.  Deputy McGrath, in particular, spoke about homosexuals being murdered and attacked and the high incidence of suicide in this group.  That is probably the case and results from the indifference, intolerance and prejudice with which they have to live.  I believe it would be inappropriate to change the age of consent from 17 to 18 for this reason: I do not think young men should have to begin their adult life as criminals.  We should have gender-neutral legislation and the age of consent that applies to heterosexuals should apply to homosexuals. I see no grounds &mdash; as the law reform commission did not &mdash; for changing the age of consent.  I believe that in matters to do with private morality the law does not affect how people behave.  We have no legislation for divorce, we did not have legislation in relation to contraception and so on, yet we have a huge problem of marital breakdown which is higher than the incidence <Col N="1997" /> in some countries where they have divorce legislation.</P>
      <P>Homosexuality has been a criminal offence under the law of this country and that has not prevented us from having tens of thousands of homosexuals in our society.  What this law does is facilitate behaviour: it respects behaviour and protects the common good and allows consenting adults in the freedom of their own home to exercise choice in pursuing their sexuality.  It would be wrong if we were in any sense to seek to alter the age of consent and I am disappointed that an effort will be made to do that.  Young homosexual men have a great many things to come to terms with as the majority in our society are heterosexual and for them it is often difficult to come to terms with the fact that they are different. To try to make that more difficult would be wrong.  As Deputy McDowell said, I will concentrate on the other provisions of the Bill because he dealt very well with the matters relating to homosexuality.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to this Minister because unlike her predecessors, who in some instances agreed to change the law, she has been uncompromising and has not dithered in relation to homosexuality. She has also been very clear about her own personal views &mdash; I heard her give a radio interview some weeks ago which I thought was remarkably courageous and brave.  That is the way it should be.  That is appropriate for a Minister in a reforming Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the law is liberal, progressive and realistic in relation to homosexuality it is draconian in the extreme in relation to prostitution.  Prostitutes are perhaps the most vulnerable and marginalised group in our society.  This afternoon I read a report by J. Finucane of the lives of girls on the streets of Dublin.  It makes frightening reading.  It summarises the lives of a number of prostitutes in Dublin and one sees that they all come from difficult homes where physical or sexual violence was often the norm &mdash; in some cases they were abandoned.  They are poor, they have a low standard of education and low self-esteem.  Instead of this group being criminalised and sent to jail they need a <Col N="1998" /> caring approach if we are to prevent them from continuing with their lives of prostitution. They need the help of the social services and not the heavy arm of the law.  There certainly is no need to send them to jail.  As Deputy McDowell rightly said, we do not have room at present in our prisons for the real criminals in our society: those who are beating and robbing others and terrorising tourists and the ordinary people on the streets in this city.  We do not have enough prison space for them, and if they are sent to jail they are out after a few days.  What we propose to do in this Bill is to send unfortunate vulnerable people, the prostitutes, to fill our prison spaces.  That is a wholly inappropriate response to a huge social problem.</P>
    <P>I know what I am saying will not be popular but I believe it is right.  I am delighted that politics generally has improved so much in the past four to five years that a least we can speak freely about issues like homosexuality, contraception, divorce and so on.  I have seen a great maturing in the attitudes of politicians of all parties on these issues and it has been difficult for many to come to terms with the reality of life in Ireland today.  However, in relation to the provisions in this Bill on prostitution, I see an effort to sweep the problem under the carpet, to pretend it does not exist and let it go into the seedy underworld where there is no protection for a prostitute when she is beaten or physically attacked. She will not have recourse to the law because she is a criminal and she will not be able to go and report her story to the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>We will not be able to implement the very fine provisions of the recent Bill to provide condoms.  The spread of AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases is a major problem in our society.  We have to make sure that those who engage in casual sex, of whatever kind, take precautions. We will not be able to gear any health programmes towards prostitutes or their clients if we continue to drive them into the seedy underground.  The law is not capable of solving the problem. On the contrary, what we need is an <Col N="1999" /> integrated approach from the Departments of Health, Education, Social Welfare and Justice.  I notice that some of the prostitutes asked how they would get out of prostitution.  They need shelter, welfare, education and to be shown an alternative way.  This Bill does not do that.</P>
    <P>We need to distinguish between the prostitute and those who organise prostitution &mdash; those know as pimps &mdash; who make huge sums of money out of exploiting the most vulnerable and marginal group in our society.  Deputy Michael McDowell referred to the <i>In Dublin</i> magazine, the current edition of which has 21 advertisements advertising brothels and various facilities in this city. It is obviously a major problem.  The people running these 21 establishments are obviously making a handsome living out of exploiting a group of unfortunate and desperate women.  No woman who engages in prostitution can feel happy about what she does; it is a sordid, horrible, degrading pursuit.  No woman who engages in such activity could hold her head high.  What she needs is help and encouragement and not a life going before the courts, going on to jail and back onto the streets again.</P>
    <P>I feel very strongly about this issue even though many people consider that criminalising something gets rid of it.  I do not accept that approach.  It certainly has not worked with any of the other social issues we have tried to deal with. If we decided to decriminalise poverty it would not mean there would be no more poor or if we criminalised slavery that we would get rid of the slave.  It does not make sense, it does not get to the root cause of the problem and does not deal with the social issue before us.</P>
    <P>I regret very much that this is such a short debate because many Deputies have different views from those expressed by me in relation to both these issues.  It is a pity we have not allowed sufficient time for debate on Second Stage or tomorrow when we propose to deal with Committee and Final Stages in an hour and a half.  The real debate will <Col N="2000" /> take place outside this House and will continue to make this House irrelevant.</P>
    <P>In relation to comments made by the Catholic Bishops, I do not believe that the law in any sense influences how people behave in matters to do with private morality.  It is a much larger question and has to do with their value system, their education, their upbringing and so on.  It is interesting to note, for example, that virtually all the women engaged in prostitution in Dublin come from poor working class families with low standards of education and so on.  The Churches have a role, through their spirituality and their particular Church, to build on the value system of their congregation.  I do not believe their role is to tell politicians what to do or to frighten people into thinking that if something is legislated for or is decriminalised that there will be a massive outbreak and that suddenly the whole value system in our society will change completely.</P>
    <P>Irish people live in many parts of the world where many of these issues have been legislated for many years ago.  Irish people who live abroad do not behave differently from those who live here.  In the diocese of Armagh, which straddles the Border, some of these matters have been legal on one side of the Border for a considerable period of time and a different approach is adopted on the other side of the Border.  I do not believe Catholics in one part of the diocese are any less Caholic than those in the other part of the diocese.</P>
    <P>We have to realise that throughout society &mdash; whether in the Church, politics or whatever profession &mdash; homosexaul behaviour is not limited to a particular group, class or profession.  It would be narrow-minded to take that view.  Rather than make it more difficult for those whose professions may have suffered, whose chances of promotion and family life may have suffered, we should all put ourselves in the position of a sister, a parent or colleague of a homosexual person and ask whether we would want them to be declared criminals and put in jail.  Either we want to have laws that operate and are effective or we want the <Col N="2001" /> law to recognise reality.  For many years the law in relation to these matters has not been put into effect.  On the contrary, we have turned a blind eye to the law and laws that are not enforced are not respected.  I hope this debate, short and all as it is, will be a further maturing of the legislative process.  Hopefully it will allow us to be more tolerant because legislation in itself will not change social attitudes, that is a much longer and more difficult process.  It can be done in a number of ways and obviously the legislation plays a part in that it removes prejudice but certainly is not the end of the story.</P>
    <P>In the Unfair Dismissals (Amendment) Bill, 1993 and in the incitement to hatred legislation we include a provision in relation to sexual orientation whereby people would not suffer, would not be discriminated against and would not lose their jobs because of their sexual orientation. That is appropriate.  If we are honest and fair in relation to these matters we have to follow suit in regard to the law.</P>
    <P>I will conclude because I wish to share my time with Deputy Cullen.  Prior to the commencement of Committee Stage tomorrow I would ask the Minister to rethink her attitude to the provisions in relation to prostitution.  If she continues to pursue the provisions of this Bill I ask that they would not come into effect until such time as we have a proper health, education and welfare programme &mdash; the type of approach recommended by the Commission on the Status of Women &mdash; and until such time as we provide support services and a way out for those engaged in prostitution.  Bringing them before the courts, fining them heavily and sending them to jail is not the solution.  On the contrary, that would only further increase the problem and would not act in a human rights way which this legislation seeks in regard to homosexuality.</P>

      <P>When one has to follow Deputies Michael McDowell and Harney it is difficult to get a word in.  It is right and proper that we decriminalise homosexual activity by means of this Bill. I welcome that move by the House.  The Bill is long overdue and it is time we dealt with the issue.</P>
      <P>I regret that the second half of the Bill deals with the whole question of prostitution. The Minister is right in saying that this question needs to be dealt with. There are many and wide ranging views on the subject but the draconian way in which it has been dealt with is a major backward step and is one she should not have taken.  I am confused as to whom the Minister was appeasing to in bringing prostitution into the Bill before the House.  It was totally unnecessary and appears to be a means of balancing the liberal and right approach she was taking in dealing with homosexuals.  She saw a need to balance the homosexual laws by bringing in draconian laws for dealing with prostitution.  As my colleagues have pointed out, this area needs a caring approach.  It needs to be looked at in terms of health care and all the other areas that one would expect a civilised society to deal with in the more liberal country in which we now live.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I appeal to the Minister to withdraw the aspects dealing with prostitution and allow for a reasoned and sensible debate.  This side of the House would welcome an indication from the Minister that this matter should be dealt with in a debate in which we could examine all the issues involved and come up with a formula that would bring about a more caring approach that is vital in regard to prostitution.  In such a debate we could consider the possibility of introducing legislation to deal with the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is in two parts. <Col N="2003" /> First, it seeks to decriminalise homosexual activities between consenting adults and, second, reforms and extends the law in regard to prostitution and related offences.  The provisions for homosexual law reform are simple and straightforward in the legislative sense, one is either for or against the decriminalisation of homosexual acts.  That matter is dealt with in three sections of the Bill.</P>
      <P>From a legislative point of view, the other provisions are far more complex as they create a range of new offences and greatly increase existing penalties.  Those provisions merit much closer scrutiny than they will receive in the time allocated to this Bill.  The provision of approximately 50 minutes tomorrow for Committee and remaining Stages is totally inadequate for such important legislation. The Government made a great mistake in opting for a debate on this Bill which allows three and a half or four hours for Second Stage &mdash; giving Government backbenchers an opportunity to sound off their opposition to its provisions while having the luxury of not having to vote against it &mdash; and only 50 minutes tomorrow to tease out the important detail of the Bill.  From our experience in this House in the past, Bills which are rushed through the House without receiving proper consideration, particularly on Committee Stage, are frequently found to be flawed.  I am concerned that some of the provisions of this Bill may encounter similar difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, dealing with homosexual activities are a relic of the Victorian era and should have no place in a modern society.  The sexual activities of consenting adults in the privacy of their home are a matter for the people concerned and should not be the business of the Dáil, the Garda or anybody else, including the peeping Toms of the self-appointed moral police from whom we hear a great deal nowadays.  Whether one approves or disapproves of the particular sexual practices of people is not the issue.  Disapproval is not a sufficient <Col N="2004" /> reason for criminalising those whose sexual orientation differs from that of the majority.</P>
    <P>It is now almost five years since the European Court of Human Rights found our laws in this area in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights and the delay in living up to our obligations as signatories to that Convention is regrettable.  Commitments given by successive Ministers for Justice to amend the law were reneged on and as recently as September last the present Taoiseach contemptuously dismissed the matter stating that it was at the bottom of his list of priorities.</P>
    <P>It is significant that this Minister for Justice has shown the courage to confront this issue head on and do what should have been done many years ago.  As someone who has had cause to criticise her in other areas, I am pleased to offer her my congratulations on the way in which she faced this issue.  This Bill has been introduced relatively early in her term of office.  She has refused to be intimidated by the clamour of a number of organisations whose by-word seems to be &ldquo;intolerance&rdquo;.  She has stood up to the threats of her own backbenchers, including a colleague in her constituency who has shown no shame in politically exploiting any difficulties which the Bill may cause for her.  Too often in this House we are tempted to score political points.  On this occasion the Minister has shown courage and deserves our support in a wholehearted rather than a grudging manner.</P>

      <P>The proposals in this Bill are simple, yet they meet the requirements of the European Commission on Human Rights and the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission.  The Minister resisted the temptation to adopt another Irish solution to an Irish problem, the sort of fudge that has been the hallmark of many social reform attempts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislative position of homosexuals here will now be far more acceptable than in the United Kingdom.  The <Col N="2005" /> question in regard to the age of consent will always be difficult, but the Minister was correct in deciding that the proper approach was not to differentiate between the homosexual and the heterosexual and to set the age limit at 17, as recommended by the Law Reform Commission.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that Fine Gael propose to introduce an amendment to increase the age limit to 18 years.  Indeed, no case was made for that so far in this debate. The enactment of this Bill will mean that the age of consent here will be the highest in Europe.  In France, Italy, Denmark, Greece, Poland and Spain the age limit is 15 years and in Portugal, Belgium, the Netherlands and Norway it is 16 years. No case has been made here for increasing the age limit to 18 years.  Fine Gael is attempting to pander to opposition to the provisions of this Bill in an effort to score a cheap political point by embarrassing the Government.  I am disappointed with Deputies Gay Mitchell, Frances Fitzgerald, Shatter and others whom I thought would have shared my views.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes adequate provisions for the protection of young people and I support the concept of tiered penalties with more severe penalties being imposed for offences against the very young.  Society has an obligation to protect young people against sexual exploitation by adults, whether homosexual or heterosexual.  The passing of this Bill &mdash; and I believe it will pass &mdash; will be a reflection of our growing maturity as a society.  Last month, following almost two months of shadow boxing, the Dáil disposed of the condom issue without undue political pain.  We are now introducing significant homosexual law reform with only a minimum of controversy.  It is significant and a hopeful pointer for the future that, while the Catholic Bishops have set out their views on the issues, as they are entitled to do, they have not attempted to come the heavy with the legislators.  They have stated that homosexuality itself is not sinful and they can scarcely argue that the Oireachtas should make a crime of something which they <Col N="2006" /> do not consider to be sinful.  The enactment of this Bill will bring a great sense of relief to members of the gay and lesbian community who will no longer be regarded under our law as criminals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">

      <P>The passage of this Bill through the House will be a tribute to those members of the gay and lesbian community who have courageously campaigned for reforms in this area over many years and none more so than our fellow Oireachtas Member, Senator Norris.</P>
      <P>As I said at the outset, the proposals in regard to homosexual law reform are straightforward.  The proposals in regard to prostitution are much more complex and raise important questions.  The eight sections dealing with prostitution introduce a new range of offences, give exceptional powers to the Garda and provide for greatly increased penalties which in some cases may be as high as five years in jail.</P>
      <P>Prostitution is a phenomenon which has been with us for as long as society has existed.  It is not for nothing that it is known as the oldest profession.  As far as I am aware, no society, even those with the most draconian laws, has succeeded in eliminating it and I doubt if this Bill will significantly reduce the level of prostitution here.  I do not believe that prostitution should be legalised.  It is a social evil which allows for the sexual and economic exploitation of women and such exploitation should not be legitimised. Our society would be better off without prostitution.  Nevertheless, what we need is a far more comprehensive and sophisticated approach to the problem than we are getting from this Bill and I agree that prison is not the way to deal with it.  I am somewhat surprised that if penalties are to be imposed the community service orders mechanism was not availed of as a more appropriate way of deling with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Few women set out to be prostitutes. The majority are forced into it by economic <Col N="2007" /> or social circumstances.  They face appalling risks, not just from sexually transmitted diseases but also from violence from clients and pimps.  From what we know from research, most women would get off the game if they could. There is an element of hypocrisy in regard to society's attitude to the payment of money for sexual services.  If a businessman has money to set up a woman in a luxury flat and pay her money each week in return for sexual favours, neither party commits an offence.  If, on the other hand, a woman approaches a man in the street and offers him sex in her flat or in the back of a car, both parties are guilty of an offence and under this Bill would be liable to penalties of up to 12 months in prison.  There is a number of welcome reforms in the sections dealing with prostitution.  At least we are ending the hypocritical situation whereby the woman was the only guilty party.  Under this Bill both parties will be equally guilty and liable to the same penalties.  The hypocrisy of our approach was highlighted in the courts in Dublin some months ago when a woman was charged with running a brothel.  The woman charged was named and the women working in the brothel who gave evidence were named, but the customers who gave evidence were not named.</P>
    <P>Steps are being taken in the Bill to deal with kerb crawling, which has been a scourge in some areas and which has caused great annoyance and embarrassment to women and girls who have been propositioned from cars.  I particularly welcome the new sections dealing with those who control, direct or organise prostitutes, the pimps who are the real evil force in this business.</P>
    <P>Some of the powers for the Garda are quite sweeping.  Under section 8, for instance, a garda who has reason to suspect that a person is loitering on a street or public place for soliciting or importuning may direct that person to leave that street or public place.  A person who fails to comply will be liable to a fine of up to £1,000 or a term of imprisonment of up to three months.  The requirement <Col N="2008" /> is only that the garda has to suspect, which is a very vague and imprecise term. He does not even have to have reasonable grounds for believing.  What is of even more concern is that the definition of &ldquo;street&rdquo; is so wide as to constitute virtually every place it is possible to be once one goes through one's front door.  It is not too difficult to envisage abuses of this section arising.</P>
    <P>I can understand what is intended by the section.  However, we do know that unfortunately there are occasions when gardaí exceed the powers intended for them in legislation.  I would be concerned that a situation might arise where a woman standing on her own waiting for a lift, going about her business, might become involved in an exchange with a garda who suspects that she is importuning or soliciting and tells her to move along.  If, for example, a mature woman tells a young garda recently out of Templemore where to go with himself and he decides to prosecute, things could get out of hand.  That section needs to be addressed because I do not believe that gardaí are going to approach six foot men with tattoos on their arms and tell them to move along.  This is a section that is primarily directed at women.  While I appreciate what the section is attempting to get at, I believe that it could lead to abuse in the future.  It is precisely the kind of section that needs a bit longer than 50 minutes to tease out in Committee.</P>
    <P>The application of the law on prostitution has always focused on the prostitute, who is still, most usually, a woman.  It will require more than a change in the law to alter that.  I feel that it would be far easier for the Garda to pick up a woman and proceed against her than to pursue the clients or the brothel keepers.  I am not sure that we will achieve anything by putting more prostitutes in prison.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to outline in her reply what social and medical services will be available to prostitutes jailed under this Bill.  The health dimensions of prostitution have taken on a new urgency with the spread of AIDS.  Will proper <Col N="2009" /> health checks be available, or will it be simply a case of locking them up for a few months, as is the case at present, and then letting them back on the street?</P>
    <P>The Bill before us has given rise to a certain amount of controversy and most of that has been orchestrated by groups who have set themselves up as the guardians of morality in our society.  A number of issues now need to be addressed in that wider debate.  The first relates to why it is that in the debate on this Bill the entire concentration has been on the decriminalisation of homosexuality.  I, and I am sure other Members of the House, have received letters and telephone calls warning that the decriminalisation of homosexuality would lead to the corruption of our youth, the spread of disease and the undermining of society.  I have not received a single comment, objection or proposal in relation to the provisions in this Bill which deals with prostitution.  I have to wonder why it is that the private sexual activity of homosexual adults holds such a fascination for the so-called guardians of our morality while the exploitation of women, which takes place night after night on the streets in this city and other cities, gets barely a mention.</P>
    <P>I also believe that there has been a certain amount of distortion of what this Bill is about.  It is insinuated that by passing this Bill the Oireachtas is giving free rein to the encouragement of particular forms of sexual activity.  The fact is that what the Bill is doing is simply decriminalising it.  There has been a great deal of talk about the family.  Let us take the case of a family.  If a member of a family, even the family of somebody who is active in organisations that describe themselves as pro family, returns to their family and announces to them that they are gay, what are they suggesting?  Are they suggsting that that member of the family should be hauled before the courts and perhaps put in jail?  We are told that it does not happen in practice, but that is what the law provides.  What I understand the legislation is about is simply decriminalising that.</P>
    <P>We hear that nobody is brought before <Col N="2010" /> the courts, therefore there is no need to decriminalise it.  What does that mean? Are we saying that we have legislation which is inoperable but because it is on the Statute Book we can continue to give the lie publicly and pretend that since homosexual activity is criminalised and no prosecutions take place there are no homosexuals in Ireland?  Every child in this country has been familiarised with <i>The Ballad of Reading Gaol</i> and the sorry story, almost 100 years ago, of one of this country's finest literary talents who was jailed for homosexual activity.  That story is told to children pursuing leaving certificate courses year in, year out in this country.  I do not recall that it has ever been suggested that the authorities 100 years ago were right to jail Oscar Wilde for homosexual activities.  I am not aware either that very many school children are made aware that it would still, at least in theory, be possible for the same thing to happen all over again.  I believe that this Bill is about repealing the Victorian legislation which put Oscar Wilde in jail.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the wider debate which has taken place in relation to this issue.  It is important that that be addressed.  We would be taking a great risk to conclude that this issue is being debated solely in this House.  There is a climate of intolerance which is continuously encouraged by some people in our society.  For example, last week a poll appeared in <i>The Sunday Press</i> which showed that 50 per cent of the public here were opposed to this legislation and most of us were circulated with an IMS poll conducted for one of the lobby organisations which showed something similar. The point that has to be made about that is that it all depends on the question the pollster asks.  In the case of <i>The Sunday Press</i> poll, for example, the question put was whether one personally approved or disapproved of the Government's plan to legalise homosexual acts between people aged 17 or over.  One gets one type of answer to a poll that asks that type of question.  Quite a different answer would be given if one is asked if one believes that somebody engaging in homosexual activity should be brought before the <Col N="2011" /> courts, charged and, if necessary, put in jail.  There may be a distortion in the way that is represented.</P>
    <P>I do not believe we can ignore some of the fundamentalist rumblings we are beginning to hear in relation to this and other issues and we have to look at that.  The conditions that exist in our society in respect of the level of unemployment, poverty and the size of the housing problem are ripe for a growth in intolerant thinking.  It is possible to generate antipathy towards single parents, travellers, homosexuals and any marginalised group in circumstances where there is a shortage of jobs and of houses.  When people are poor they may observe the condition in which their neighbours live.  It is regrettable that there are people who seem intent on generating that intolerance.  This legislation in relation to homosexuality is attempting to create the legislative framework for a tolerant society. However, we will ignore at our peril the fundamentalist rumblings taking place in some quarters of our society and will ignore at our peril the social and economic climate allowing that growth in intolerant thinking.  We know from historical experience, and from what is taking place in other countries at this time, where such intolerant thinking can lead. I hope we will be able to deal with that problem before it gets out of hand.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Gilmore for sharing his time.  I wish to make a few points in relation to this Bill. I do not want to let this debate pass without putting these point on the record. I have pressed for the decriminalisation of homosexual acts for some considerable time in this House.  I agree with what the Minister proposes in relation to that matter in this Bill.  As other Deputies have said, I welcome the fact that the Minister has shown the courage to do that.  It should not be forgotten that the Labour Party has had a role in regard to this matter.  I have been one of its most strident critics since it went into Government, <Col N="2012" /> but it deserves credit for ensuring that this matter is on the agenda, and other Members in the Fianna Fáil Party have ensured it is on the agenda.  The Bill demonstrates that we are a maturing democracy.  However, we have a considerable distance to go and this Bill is a sign of hope for the future.</P>
      <P>It should be borne in mind that Deputies and Senators who abhor the idea of homosexual acts are not being asked to approve of it.  They should not feel in any way compromised by either opposing or supporting the Bill.  They are here as legislators.  They are not here as theologians or as moral guardians.  They are here as legislators elected to represent the people of this country.  I am an atheist.  I have no religious belief, but I have a great deal of respect for those who have strong religious beliefs.  I am aware of a number of Senators and Deputies who have strong religious beliefs and they are entitled to their views.  They are entitled to argue their position in the public domain.  However, I would appeal that they would act as democrats, as public representatives elected to represent all of the people, not just some of the people, not just those who agree with their religious view and oppose legislation which opposes their particular religious view.</P>
      <P>As democrats we must ensure that every citizen feels part of our society and does not feel excluded because of their colour, gender, sexuality or because they are poor or have a mental or physical handicap.  We have an obligation to ensure that every citizen feels part of our society and is not discriminated against. Democracy cannot simply be defined as the rule of the majority.  It must have other facets.  A genuine democracy has many other facets, not least of which is tolerance, tolerance of different points of view and tolerance of difference.  It must also specifically ensure that we defend the human and civil rights of minorities; otherwise it is not democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is in that context that this Bill must be viewed.  There has been much debate in this House with regard to conscience. I would argue that conscience should be <Col N="2013" /> left outside the door of this House or outside the door of business or trade unions.  Conscience is an important part of our society and without it society would be ungovernable.  However, one's conscience must be informed by a democratic principle when one is a legislator. In my 11 years in this House I have rarely heard conscience brought forward here except in relation to sexuality and issues relating to sexual matters.  There are people who have opposed this Bill on the grounds of conscience and morality, at least one of whom has actively promoted the idea of an amnesty for tax cheats.  I am one of those people who regard that as a totally immoral act.  We are supposed to grant an amnesty to people who, we are told, have taken £2,000 million out of this country.  In the process those people have deprived our children of education, our elderly of care, and the public of hospital care.  Wards have closed down in our hospitals and mentally handicapped people have been deprived of services and places to work.  Many other areas have been affected by those who, we are told, have taken £2,000 million out of the State and on which tax should have been paid.  Yet this House is proposing to give an amnesty to those people.  That is immoral.  People who would claim to have a conscience must have a broader concept of morality than simply sexual morality.  I would argue that case strongly.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to extend the time available for Committee Stage.  I appreciate fully the political necessity in the minds of some people to have a shortened debate.  But there are aspects which have been raised by Deputy Gilmore and other Deputies in this debate in relation to prostitution which need careful consideration. I do not believe it will be possible to give those issues that careful consideration in the time available.  Less than 50 minutes will be provided tomorrow to deal with Committee Stage of the Bill.  I am sure some formula can be found to ensure that the time will be provided to allow for a debate which will allow for a full teasing out of the implications of what has been raised here tonight.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2014" /> Because a debate takes place outside this House, that does not necessarily make this House irrelevant, provided we also engage in debate and respond to it in the public arena.  It is part of the interplay of democratic politics.  It is essential that debate on these issues takes place outside this House.  I consider that debate has taken place on the issue of homosexuality and the decriminalisation of homosexual acts.</P>
    <P>Those of us who welcome this Bill tonight do so on the basis of the progress that is being made.  However, I do not believe there is any cause for complacency in regard to issues such as this. We must deal in this House with the questions of divorce, abortion and information on abortion.  One of the reasons I make these points tonight is to appeal for those issues to be argued in a democratic debate, not as a debate on sexual morality or personal or private morality but on what are the democratic rights of the citizens of this State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Tonight's debate engages this House in a decision of far reaching importance.  In its decision on this Bill, the House faces the challenge of meeting Ireland's international human rights commitments, and of giving effect to the principle of the equality of every citizen, while at the same time recognising, and hopefully answering, the genuinely held difficulties which have been expressed by some people about this important law reform measure.</P>
      <P>This Bill, which has been carefully prepared by my colleague, the Minister for Justice, represents a sincere and heartfelt expression by the Government of its commitment to the principle of equality, and to the right of each individual to participate fully in society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is appropriate to recall also that of course, this Bill will enable Ireland to <Col N="2015" /> meet its international obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights.  Ireland has an excellent record in its participation in international and regional human rights mechanisms.  We were founder members of the Council of Europe in 1949, and were one of the first states to sign and ratify the European Convention on Human Rights when it was drawn up the following year.</P>
    <P>At the United Nations level Ireland is a party to a number of major conventions, including the international convenants on economic, social and cultural rights, and on civil and political rights, together with the first optional Protocol to that covenant. The House will be aware that the Tánaiste recently announced at the world conference on human rights in Vienna that Ireland would also be acceding to the second optional Protocol.</P>
    <P>However, it is important to remain vigilant and active in the defence and promotion of human rights, and to continue to review and improve the position regarding adherence to and implementation of international human rights instruments.  At European level, one of the outstanding matters for the past number of years has been the need to give effect to the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in October 1988 in the case of <i>Norris v. Ireland</i>.  This Bill will enable this particular case to be closed in a way which satisfies the right to a private life guaranteed by Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.</P>
    <P>It would be appropriate on this occasion to pay tribute briefly to the outstanding courage and dedication of Senator Norris, who was responsible for initiating the litigation which, in a sense, gave rise to this Bill, and for seeing the issue through to its conclusion.  It is important that we recognise the sense of passion and justice which enabled him to pursue what was often a very lonely campaign for most of the past 20 years.</P>
    <P>However, the most important aspect of this Bill is not that it will satisfy the <Col N="2016" /> judgment of the European Court of Human Rights.  The Government could have chosen to produce a narrow, minimalist Bill, to do the bare minimum necessary to fulfil the judgment, as the British Government chose to do when the European Court of Human Rights ruled against them in the <i>Dudgeon</i> case.</P>
    <P>Instead, the Government has chosen to give full effect to the principle of the equal right of every citizen, regardless of sexual orientation, to express their sexuality and to pursue loving relationships. With its common age of consent and its refusal to discriminate above that age on grounds of sex or marital status, this Bill is a truly modern, liberating and decisive proposal to reform the law in a spirit of equality.</P>
    <P>For those who have genuine difficulties with the principle of the Bill, it is important to recall that what is proposed is the enabling of persons in the gay community to pursue loving relationships.  What could be more important, for us as legislators, than to create a climate and a space in which two people who have chosen each other can express and share their love?</P>
    <P>For many people, of course, the idea of recognition by the State of gay and lesbian relationships is unorthodox, surprising, even shocking perhaps.  Some people will approach these questions from a traditional religious or moral standpoint and it is important to recognise the sensitivities involved and not to cause unnecessary offence to people who hold a different view from that of the Government.</P>
    <P>However, a recognition of the wide spectrum of opinions that can exist around these difficult issues of personal and private behaviour must not dilute the overriding responsibility to promote and protect the dignity and freedom of the individual.  As my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, said in a different but related context in this House on 26 March 1993:</P>
    <P>Our legal provisions must never simply seek to mop up what goes wrong; they must seek to empower and <Col N="2017" /> enable.  Law should control criminal activity.  It should never be used to constrain potential or put a limit to human happiness.</P>
    <P>For too long, since 1861, the criminal law has unfortunately sought to constrain the potential of members of the gay community and put a limit to their human happiness.  As we throw off the outdated legislation of another age tonight, this House is taking an important and decisive step towards an Ireland where every citizen is entitled to the equal protection of the laws in the fullest sense of that expression.  We are taking another important step towards a society where individuals have an equal liberty to pursue their loving relationships and personal emotional projects and commitments, in a quiet, private space, free from the hostile scrutiny of the law. Tonight's work is as important as that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill deals with an issue that has engendered much debate over the past few years.  Indeed, many people will feel a certain amount of relief that the issue will shortly be removed from the agenda.  The very word homosexual is one that people are embarrassed to use but if we could only accept that homosexuals are ordinary people living among us, a more purposeful and meaningful debate would have taken place over recent years.</P>
      <P>Homosexuals are real human beings and not just people who live elsewhere. They live in every village and town in Ireland and, regretfully, such has been the hostility and contempt shown to them that they have been very reluctant to reveal their homosexuality.</P>
      <P>I attended my first disco as a teenager and, like thousands of other young men throughout the country, I went in the hope of meeting some understanding female.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Nevertheless, I enjoyed my teenage years, the parties, discos and dances.  Female company is a wonderful thing.  I enjoyed the craic and all that goes with being single.  In 1986 I married Deirdre Malone and during the past seven years I enjoyed a very fulfilling relationship with her.  It has made me a more complete person and, indeed, a much happier one.</P>
      <P>I make this point to demonstrate that we are in the same position as thousands of other couples throughout the country and this is accepted as being normal.  By definition homosexuals are people who are sexually attracted to members of the same sex.  For some reason they do not feel the same urge to form a relationship with someone of the opposite sex.  We all need to love and to be loved.  I pity homosexuals because they cannot share the same type of relationship as the one I enjoy.  In most cases their relationships have to be conducted in a very secretive fashion.  If found out, they face rejection by society and in some cases by their families.  For too long we have made jokes about homosexuals instead of trying to understand them.  The time has come for people to show tolerance, compassion and understanding to all our people.  It is vital for a Government to lead its people and the introduction of this Bill is welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill makes it an offence to solicit or importune another person or persons for the purposes of prostitution.  The penalty on summary conviction will be a fine of up to £1,000 or three months' imprisonment, or both.  It has been argued that the present laws in relation to prostitution have been rendered inoperable by the courts and, therefore, changes are necessary.  If these new laws are to work properly there will have to be a number of significant changes.  If we were to jail all the ladies who provide sex to men for money in this city there would be no room in our prisons for the real criminals. <Col N="2019" /> Full sex is provided in many health clubs and massage parlours throughout our capital city, a fact we have chosen to ignore.</P>
    <P>A few weeks ago I supported the Minister for Health when he successfully brought a Bill before this House to make condoms more freely available.  The Minister laid great emphasis on the fact that he was bringing forward his proposals in an effort to prevent the spread of AIDS.  Surely we must be consistent. If we are serious about fighting this dreadful disease action must be taken now.  I know that a number of people outside this House today vented their anger and disgust at the introduction of this Bill, but I ask them if they really believe that people who engage in homosexual acts are criminals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and congratulate the Minister on bringing it forward.  It is long overdue, but one cannot say she ignored it for long.  It is to her credit that she brought it into the House in such a short time.  There is legislation on the Statute Book which is more in keeping with the middle ages.  I recognise that homosexuals are entitled to equal respect and treatment as human beings, but current law does not permit such equality and is in need of reform. Much of what has been written of a derogatory nature about this minority group in the past numbers of months has come from the same people who oppose all social change, people who fail to recognise the scale of the social revolution in Ireland in the past 30 years.</P>
      <P>Social legislation will always rekindle some deep-seated prejudices within society towards certain groups &mdash; in this instance towards homosexuals, prostitutes and drug abusers.  This has led to widespread discrimination against individuals belonging to these groups.  Some people go so far as to say that if AIDS limits itself to these groups then it is a disease of public service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Discrimination further arises from the phenomenon of society's constant search for scapegoats, people who are blamed <Col N="2020" /> for inexplicable events or for problems that cannot be solved.  In the middle ages witches were held responsible and burned at the stake.  In Hitler's Germany it was the Jews.  Today it is homosexuals, prostitutes and drug users.</P>
    <P>Our law provides for savage sentences on people who are branded as criminals because they were born with a sexuality different from that of most of their neighbours. They were born with a natural tendency towards having homosexual rather than heterosexual relationships with others.  Many so-called normal people regard this as distasteful, something which could never be visited on their own families.  Is this a justification for singling out certain people for abuse to the extent that they must be regarded as outcasts in society?</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why so many people regard this Bill as a retrograde step.  The present law is never enforced, nor is it ever likely to be, even if this Bill was withdrawn or defeated.  However, some people feel comfortable in the knowledge that a law exists which places a cruel stigma on people who are certainly not criminals in any sense of the word simply because they happen to be homosexual.</P>
    <P>There was a time not too long ago when parents and teachers punished children because they were naturally left-handed and forced them to reverse what nature had bestowed on them.  This often led to serious psychological problems.  Similarly, homosexuals have been branded because of a tendency for which they are not responsible.  Why should these people be singled out for persecution?</P>
    <P>A criminal is someone who deliberately sets out to injure or harm someone else or who engages in activity which is a serious threat to society.  In sexual matters overall, it is quite clear that the vast majority of cases of criminal abuse of children or adults alike are carried out by heterosexuals.  The most heinous crimes of a sexual nature in recent times were committed by heterosexuals, by males who purport to be normal &mdash; so much for normality.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, there is no law which <Col N="2021" /> makes promiscuity a criminal act provided it is carried out by consenting adults.  However, two homosexuals who are in a committed and life-long relationship are criminals in the eyes of the law. Are they to be regarded as more dangerous than so-called &ldquo;normal&rdquo; people who leap from partner to partner on almost a daily basis, spreading sexually transmitted diseases as well as threatening the fundamentals of family life?  I think not. If any Member of this House finds that he or she has a homosexual son or daughter would that Member be happy in the knowledge that this child is branded a criminal?  I am aware of recent opinion polls in this regard, but what the people who support this Bill have to do here is extremely difficult, namely, to separate deeply irrational and unfounded fears from scientific understanding.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Bill seriously addresses the question of prostitution.  However, I understand the reservations of people in regard to those forced into prostitution. I have no sympathy for those who make profit from these people.  Some work remains to be done in this area.  The Bill deals with unlawful sexual relationships with young people below a certain age, regardless of sexual orientation.  At last it is acknowledged that criminals exist in both cases but not simply on the basis of how nature has dealt with them.  I warmly commend this Bill to the House and once again congratulate the Minister on bringing it forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill is extremely important and is most welcome.  I am delighted it has been introduced at such an early stage in the life of the new Government.  The Bill should have been introduced at least five years ago when the European decision was handed down in the Norris case.  I regret the decision was not made at that time to introduce it and to regularise the position in relation to homosexuality.  The Bill meets the requirement of the European Court on Human Rights to decriminalise sexual intercourse and other sexual acts between consenting male persons.  It <Col N="2022" /> reflects the commitment of the Labour Party to bring Irish law into conformity with the European Convention on Human Rights and is one part of a major programme of law reform and equality incorporated in the Programme for Government.  It also reflects the interest and priority we are giving to this area by the appintment of a Minister for Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to Senator David Norris, who has been here for most of this debate, for taking this case and for his courage in pursuing successive Governments to have it implemented in law.  I remember his contribution in the Seanad and the number of occasions on which he rose to press successive Ministers and Governments to take action in this regard.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the Gay and Lesbian Organisation for the well structured and carefully and calmly reasoned arguments they have made in recent years to promote education and awareness of the normalcy of homosexual orientation and particularly education in the context of the AIDS virus, which was spreading widely and about which there was an enormous amount of prejudice and bias. Some sectors tried to term it a homosexual disease.  I regret that in the prison system there is still segregation and a stigma in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new provisions on prostitution and soliciting have merits and demerits.  They put sanctions in place which apply to men and women, whereas in the past only women were prosecuted, sentenced and imprisoned.  Thus the Bill takes into account the recommendations included in the report of the Commission on the Status of Women in relation to prostitution. The report suggested that clients of prostitutes should also be held responsible. The law on prostitution has been rendered inoperable by the courts. However, a case can be made for dealing with prostitution in separate legislation. This Bill reflects a harsh, punitive and unenlightened approach to prostitution and prostitutes.  It takes no cognisance of the personal tragedies and health <Col N="2023" /> implications for those involved in prostitution.</P>

      <P>The Bill fails to distinguish between the individual activities of the prostitute, loitering or offering sexual sevices, and that of the pimp, the parasite who organises prostitution and lives off the earnings of the prostitute. The latter is where the dark, predatory and criminal world begins.</P>
      <P>Sections 6, 7 and 10 need further examination before enactment.  I trust that we will have the opportunity to tease them out on Committee Stage tomorrow.  I take particular exception to the reference to prison sentences.  The whole area of criminalisation in relation to prostitution needs to be re-examined.  I commend the Minister on her straightforward courageous approach to the question of decriminalising homosexuality.  I commend the initial approach in allowing options to be publicised.  This created a sensible debate so that the Government deliberations were not carried out in isolation. It is unfortunate that the same approach has not been taken to prostitution.</P>

      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputies Flaherty and McGahon.</P>
      <P>My support for this legislation and the discussion is marred only by the small amount of time allocated tonight.  The decriminalisation of homosexuality which will result from the passage of this legislation is long overdue.  The concept of male homosexuality as a criminal act has done its share in upholding prejudice and in creating and sustaining a climate in which some of our citizens have been marginalised and ostracised.  Individuals and families have suffered greatly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on introducing this important legislation.  I agree with Deputies who have said that it respects human rights and shows tolerance.  This is extremely important in <Col N="2024" /> our maturing democracy.  This Bill will at least put one building block in place as we construct a society based on tolerance and respect.  There are many difficulties on this island in moving towards tolerance and respect for different viewpoints, but we should try to develop tolerance and respect.  The lack of time for this evening's debate does not help that process.  Unless we debate the issues and listen with respect to each other, the prejudice will continue even if it has no basis in law.</P>
    <P>I have spent much time lobbying for change on issues of discrimination.  I understand the importance of change at different levels.  The law is one important level and attitudes are another.  The behaviour caused by prejudice will not change easily and will definitely not change if discussion is swept under the carpet.  That is why I regret that we do not have more time.</P>
    <P>I have worked with women and women's groups looking at the issue of homophobia and invariably that opportunity has resulted in breaking down barriers and the sweeping away of many of the myths and misunderstandings.  We need to share information and attitudes in relation to homosexuality more than we have done.  I understand that for some colleagues this legislation is problematic. I respect their views; but as legislators we are here to lead, to make just laws and to ensure that fundamental human rights are respected.  We have already been found guilty of infringing human rights because of our laws on homosexuality. What we are doing today simply brings Ireland into line internationally.  As a modern democracy we need to face up to the meaning of tolerance, to the importance of having confidence in our citizens.</P>
    <P>We hear much about our excellent education system and about the credit which Irish people bring to our country when working abroad.  It does not make any sense that we have outdated laws, designed in a much more paternalistic time, a time when scant regard was had for individual rights.  The Minister in her opening address referred to the age of much of the legislation we are <Col N="2025" /> discussing this evening.  Certainly, much work has to be done in preparing young people for adult life.  The emphasis must be on education of people to be responsible and tolerant.  People need love and support and access to knowledge, education and information which can help them throughout their lives and help them to make informed choices about how they will live.</P>
    <P>This Bill is the kind of legislation which a tolerant and competent community would want to have.  The next stage on this issue must be focused on understanding and breaking down the barriers, understanding the fears and moving ahead.  I agree with what Deputy Mitchell said in his opening speech in relation to the role of the education system and in relation to our duties as Deputies, that we must play a pro-active part in ensuring that in our schools we have discussion on these issues.  We should ensure that programmes on sexual education, on parenting and on loving relationships are carefully included in our school curriculum.</P>
    <P>I, like others in the House, pay tribute to Senator Norris and his many colleagues and those involved in many of the organisations who worked hard and often trod a lonely path in ensuring that this legislation would be produced and that we would be true to our commitment under the European Courts.  Fine Gael has consistently said that it will ensure that legislation is enacted here to see to it that we meet our obligations under the European Court.  I am pleased that that is the position of this party on this issue.</P>
    <P>I share the concerns of my colleagues in relation to the sections on prostitution. I note that the Minister has taken on board some of the recommendations in the report of the Commission on the Status of Women.  I would urge the Minister to examine some of their more detailed recommendations in relation to the health and welfare issues affecting prostitutes and the steps that could be initiated to help women make choices about how they wish to continue their lives.  Certainly we know that many prostitutes <Col N="2026" /> have very little choice in regard to how they live their lives.</P>
    <P>I welcome the thrust of the Bill in relation to decriminalising homosexuality. Nevertheless, I believe that the sections on prostitution need to be rethought and re-examined.</P>

      <P>The debate here this evening has shown just how little we have had to fear from allowing this House to debate this issue with a certain openness and freedom.  Indeed, it has enriched many of the Members present and, hopefully, will have done something to prove that all of us, without any great fear or threat to our fibre, moral or otherwise, take up these issues and examine them with a little more openness.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, especially those parts which decriminalise sexual activity between homosexual adults.  I should like to congratulate the Minister on the clarity and determination she has shown in relation to this Bill.  As our spokesman, Deputy Gay Mitchell, said, there were choices open to the Minister and the Government to adopt a minimalist approach to reforming this legislation, such as was adopted in Britain, but the Minister chose not to go that road.  As other Bills have passed through this House, we have witnessed the determination of the Minister.  Her stance on the many cogent and passionate arguments put to her to go for a more minimalist approach necessitated a commitment and quality of leadership we have not always had on these issues and deserves to be acknowledged here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome also the tone of the Minister's introductory remarks.  On an occasion like this, when we are trying to deal with deep-seated prejudices in our society, it is important that we understand the origins of those prejudices.  It is also important that we scknowledge those prejudices and try, in so far as we can, to understand them and deal with them in a way that does not push people further back into their corners, or increase divisions, but rather moves the issue along.  Again, the Minister in her introductory remarks dealt very gently <Col N="2027" /> with people who were concerned that the fabric of our society is being potentially attacked.  I also welcome her sense of personal sympathy for and understanding of individuals who find they are part of a homosexual minority, and for their families and parents in coming to terms with that fact.  Growing up is a difficult enough stage anyway but when one also has to come to terms with the fact that one is different from the majority, that constitutes an enormous additional battle to be fought in those adolescent years.</P>
    <P>The central issue of this Bill concerns awarding basic human rights to a minority. Being homosexual, especially in Ireland, is not an easy experience.  Even with this legislative change the position of homosexuals will remain difficult for many years.  One of my colleagues referred to the fact that as a group they suffer more illness and have more deaths from murder and suicide.  I read those statistics rather differently from my colleagues. I contend those statistics underline the very vulnerability of this group. Decriminalising homosexual relationships will allow their way of life to become more open, less clandestine and, I believe, will facilitate more responsible, stable relationships and lives.  As some of my colleagues have said, in the past fear of difference led to appalling treatment of groups of our citizens of which we would now be justly ashamed &mdash; groups such as the mentally ill and children born outside of marriage.  Indeed, it is not so long since the most appalling treatment of them was perceived as moral and justifiable.  I firmly believe that by moving a stage further today in coming decades we will look back in horror at the attitudes that prevailed and caused us to put this legislation on our Statute Book.</P>
    <P>I should like to join in the tributes to Senator Norris and the other leaders of the movement.  Among families and colleagues most of us know gay people who have found great compromises being required of them in their lives.  As Deputy McDowell has said, society has suffered because many of <Col N="2028" /> them were not able to fulfil their ambitions or reach full potential for fear of blackmail.  This is, therefore, a welcome Bill, allowing them to come forth into the light, where they should have been for a very long time indeed.</P>
    <P>I share the concerns of many of my colleagues about the sections on prostitution. While the Minister has adopted some welcome reforms, it is quite clear there are substantial concerns in relation to the total package of proposals here. I would suggest that these sections be deleted or referred to a committee of the House for detailed consideration.  Many substantial issues have been raised here. Such referral would be a way of ensuring that we achieve major reform in relation to decriminalising homosexuality, leaving the sections on prostitution for much more thorough consideration.</P>

      <P>I appear to be heavily outnumbered here this evening, but that will not deter me from expressing my point of view.  I shall not join in the vote of appreciation to the Minister for having introduced this Bill.  Indeed, I believe that the masses of our people, had they been given the opportunity of expressing their opinion by way of a referendum, would not have appreciated it either.  I have never discriminated against any person on the basis of their sexual orientation. I regard homosexuals as being in a sad category, but I believe homosexuality to be an abnormality, some type of psycho-sexual problem that has defied explanation over the years.  I do not believe that the Irish people desire this normalisation of what is clearly an abnormality. I do not think the Minister will be thanked by our people.  Indeed, a recent poll in the <i>Sunday World</i> so indicated.  I know the remainder of Members present are all intellectuals and do not read the <i>Sunday World,</i> but the type of people who do read the <i>Sunday World</i> are the type of people who will express their revulsion of this obnoxious Bill at the next election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa, with whom I agree on many issues, told us this evening that he was an atheist.  I have no difficulty <Col N="2029" /> with that because I have problems myself in that area.  However, Deputy De Rossa told us that it was our duty to legislate. We have a duty to legislate, to ensure that succeeding generations will not have the option of an alternative lifestyle but rather be told to lead a healthy lifestyle. That is the only conventional lifestyle with which I am familiar and that is accepted by the masses of people worldwide.</P>
    <P>Homosexuality is a sad category which has defied explanation throughout the centuries.  Many more enlightened Members might regard my views as rather Victorian.  I ask them: what is wrong with Victorian attitudes?  Irish society today, which is rather sick, could do with a return to some of those Victorian attitudes: they were not all wrong. Society, from the very dawn of history, has given its verdict on homosexuality.</P>
    <P>I believe that this matter should have been the subject of a referendum, but that has been denied the Irish people. I wonder why.  For example, do those gentlemen of superior intellect here feel that perhaps they know more, or that their opinion is more valuable than that of the people outside this House?  I strongly believe that the legislation that has obtained to date should have been allowed remain unchanged.  For example, I do not know of anybody who has ever been sent to jail for a homosexual act.  For many years the legislation on the Statute Book permitted capital punishment but it was never availed of. I do not accept that there is an alternative lifestyle.  When similar legislation was introduced in England the House of Commons had to pass further legislation to prevent homosexuals informing children about this alternative lifestyle.</P>
    <P>Homosexuality is a departure from normality and while homosexuals deserve our compassion they do not deserve our tolerance.  That is how the man in the street thinks.  I know of no homosexual who has been discriminated against.  Such people have a persecution complex because they know they are different from the masses or normal society.  They endure inner torment and <Col N="2030" /> it is not a question of the way others view them.</P>
    <P>The Lord provided us with sexual organs for a specific purpose.  Homosexuals are like left hand drivers driving on the right hand side of the road.  The Minister should seek a derogation from the ruling of the European Court to prevent this unacceptable legislation being foisted on the Irish people.  I remind the Minister that the age of consent has been reduced to 12 years in Holland.  Will we have to accept such an appalling move in years to come?  Many Members of the Minister's party are very unhappy about this legislation although some of them have expressed their support for it.  The Minister should put the issue to the people in a referendum.</P>

      <P>I will not claim that I welcome the Bill.  Indeed, it is sad that we are being forced to introduce legislation that is alien to the moral standards and ethos of many of our people.  I am aware of the decision of the European Court of Human Rights and that we are a member of the Council of Europe.  However, we should have sought a derogation from the ruling on grounds of the nation's welfare and morals.  I heard &mdash; I do not know if this is true &mdash; that the Council of Europe granted a derogation to Liechtenstein on a similar issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not an offence to be homosexual, rather it is an offence to commit buggery. That is an unnatural and unhealthy act and those who engage in it &mdash; statistics prove this &mdash; account for a disproportionate share of those who suffer from sexually transmitted diseases. Society makes laws to discourage unhealthy, unwelcome or anti-social behaviour, be it smoking, buggery, drug taking and so on.  Homosexuals live a secret and lonely life in many cases and we should adopt an understanding, <Col N="2031" /> caring and sympathetic approach to them.  The question that arises is whether the rights of the individual or the common good should be uppermost in our minds.  The State has an interest in the general and moral well being of the community.  Commonsense tell us therefore that it should discourage conduct which is harmful to the way of life and the values which it wishes to foster and protect.  I agree that politicians have a duty to give leadership but they must also take public opinion into account and we know what it is on this issue.</P>
    <P>The problem is that this Bill will be seen as sending a message that society regards buggery as a natural, healthy and acceptable act but I disagree totally with that.  It would be irresponsible to send such a message to young people in particular at this time when AIDS is such a prevalent disease.  We must safeguard our young people in their sexual development.</P>
    <P>This liberal legislation which is being rushed through the House has been designed to soften us up for what some people see as the big event &mdash; abortion. I wish to avail of this opportunity to send a message that that is a different issue.</P>
    <P>I would like to repeat two points I made to the Minister when this matter was discussed at a parliamentary party meeting.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the age of consent proposed before tomorrow.  Why do we have to set the age of consent at 17 years given that even in the United Kingdom, which many people consider to be a Godless den of iniquity, it is 21?  On this issue, we need an Irish solution to an Irish problem.  If the change has to be made in stages so be it.</P>
    <P>I have my fears about what some describe as the wider agenda of the gay movement.  Can the Minister produce a formula of words to prevent what is called the &ldquo;further progression&rdquo; of that general movement?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Recently, as we are all aware, the freedom of the individual as well as the concept of equality have <Col N="2032" /> been the subject of considerable debate. The view has been expressed that one must deal in reality and not morality since they are separate and distinct.  Others say we must not legislate for private morality which presupposes that there is a distinction between public and private morality.</P>
      <P>That brings us to the question of what, in the final analysis, constitutes freedom. A noted philosopher once stated, that freedom to do every mortal thing one wants is to have no freedom at all.  If I am at liberty to shoot you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and you are at liberty to shoot me, both of us must hide.  Furthermore, any demand for equality presupposes that a right exists, that right being the right to correct inequality.</P>
      <P>We all accept that minorities have rights; but it is sometimes forgotten and lost in the fog of time that majorities have rights too.  When both rights collide serious questions arise for legislators.  In this context I ask the House to pause and think whether the decriminalisation of homosexuality is the duty of the House or whether it would in fact adversely affect future generations.  Will the decriminalisation of homosexuality have grave consequences for the ethos of society?  In short, what sort of society does the decriminalisation of homosexuality envisage?</P>
      <P>It has been clear since the beginning of time that, no matter how much anybody may wish to deny it, it is an immutable part of the natural law that the will to procreate is engraved in every human being, it is part of the human spirit and to that extent, except in the case of a disorder, at best it is immutable.</P>
      <P>Will the decriminalisation of homosexuality place the unnatural on the same platform as the natural and create an environment or an atmosphere which equates homosexuality with heterosexuality? If so, where will this lead? If the argument is accepted that homosexuality is not morally wrong is there still a basis for a law to protect youth from corruption?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I turn now to the question of dealing in reality and not with morality.  I want <Col N="2033" /> to make it clear that I am no moralist nor have I ever pretended to be but it is patently untrue to say that these are distinct concepts.  The morals of a society &mdash; this has been established by men far greater than I &mdash; are a reflection of the collective will of its members.  I believe the law reflects the kind of reality which that society wants.  Lord Devlin in his essay &ldquo;The Enforcement of Morals&rdquo; wrote:</P>
    <P>But an established morality is as necessary as a good government to the welfare of society.  Societies disintegrate from within more frequently than they are broken up by external pressures.  There is disintegration when no common morality is observed and history shows that the loosening of moral bonds is often the first stage of disintegration, so that society is justified in taking the same steps to preserve its moral code as it does to preserve its government and its other essential institutions.</P>
    <P>He continued:</P>
    <P>For society is not something that is kept together physically; it is held by the invisible bonds of common thought.  If the bonds were too far relaxed the members would drift apart. A common morality is part of the bondage.  The bondage is part of the price of society; and mankind, which needs society, must pay its price.</P>
    <P>Public and private morality is a matter which has concerned great minds over the centuries.  It has been argued vehemently &mdash; I do not think the argument has ever been broken down &mdash; that the distinction does not exist.  The distinction does not exist because if what is done in private is not moral then what is done in public cannot be moral and <i>vice versa.</i></P>
    <P>There are very serious questions to be answered by the House not just in the context of this Bill but in the context of future legislation.  When does tolerance and compassion reach the stage at which it grossly interferes with the rights of individuals in society to practice what <Col N="2034" /> they consider to be the normal moral code?  When that point is reached, then it is clear that the common bond, the common view of the kind of society we want must be upheld.  In the final analysis, that is what democracy is all about.</P>

      <P>I have reservations about this legislation.  I have already made these views known privately to the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party and the Minister.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to our international obligations.  However, no reference seems to have been made to the Constitution of this Republic.  I wish to give some Members of the House food for thought by quoting from the Constitution. Article 40.1 states:</P>
      <P>All citizens shall, as human persons, be held equal before the law.</P>
      <P>This shall not be held to mean that the State shall not in its enactments have due regard to differences of capacity, physical and moral, and of social function.</P>
      <P>That question bears some thought.  In regard to the family, Article 41.1.1º states:</P>
      <P>The State recognises the Family as the natural primary and fundamental unit group of Society, and as a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law.</P>
      <P>Article 41.1.2º states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2035" /> The State, therefore, guarantees to protect the Family in its constitution and authority ...</P>
    <P>Article 45, which outlines the directive principles of social policy, states:</P>
    <P>The principles of social policy set forth in this Article are intended for the general guidance of the Oireachtas. The application of those principles in the making of laws shall be the care of the Oireachtas exclusively ...</P>
    <P>Article 45.1 states:</P>
    <P>The State shall strive to promote the welfare of the whole people by securing and protecting as effectively as it may a social order in which justice and charity shall inform all the institutions of the national life.</P>
    <P>I am not being intolerant in my remarks. Anyone who knows me well knows that I am a very tolerant person.  As legislators, we have a duty to legislate for the common good.  We seem to have reached the stage where we are legislating for pressure and minority groups. We have a duty to consider what is in the common good of all the people and to legislate for that.  We should not legislate for hard cases, I do not say this in any intolerant way but we should legislate for the common good.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to our international obligations.  We have a duty to legislate for the standards and norms which we regard as appropriate for the Irish people.  This does not necessarily have to include all the people, but we should strive to achieve a certain standard and norm in our society.  The Houses of the Oireachtas have the primary function of laying down rules for the people and the standards they should strive to achieve, and we should never forget that.</P>
    <P>I quoted from Article 41 of the Constitution which deals with the position of the family in our society.  Many countries, including Britain, are now looking at why families are breaking down.  The tragic murder of the young Bolger child in England led to people questioning why <Col N="2036" /> society is breaking down in that country. One of the reasons given for the breakdown of society is that the family unit is breaking down.  We should strive to protect the family unit as the primary unit in our society.  That is not to say that families do not break up &mdash; of course they do &mdash; but we should aspire to attain that. I think most Deputies would agree with those sentiments.</P>
    <P>It was stated that we would be in breach of the charter of the European Court of Human Rights if we did not introduce legislation to implement its decision.  I do not for one minute accept that we have to implement this decision. Britain has decided to derogate from the Social Charter and, in effect, from European monetary union.  Yet, business is still being conducted and no one seems to have taken the British Government to task for this.</P>
    <P>Much play is made of the word &ldquo;equality&rdquo;, for example, equality in regard to the age limit.  I wonder if this issue will end here.  Will the pressure groups which have succeeded in having this legislation brought before the House stop here?  I think not.  Will we eventually see the day in this country when, as has happened in the USA, homosexuals will seek the right to adopt children?  We should think seriously about this possibility.</P>
    <P>I have a problem with the age limit of 17 years.  I appreciate that the Minister is endeavouring to equalise the age limits for both homosexuals and heterosexuals. However, under the child care legislation passed by this House a child is defined as anyone under the age of 18 years.  We should bear this in mind.</P>
    <P>I have a problem with the provisions on prostitution.  I understood that the norm in Europe was to liberalise the laws on prostitution but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to support what I understand is Government policy on this matter.  In response to Deputy Ahern, <Col N="2037" /> whom I know to be normally a considerate person, it is outrageous to suggest, however obliquely, that the murder of a child is in any way linked to homosexuality. I find that suggestion offensive.</P>
      <P>On the substantive issue, homosexuality has been and always will be with us.  It is an innate disposition of a percentage of our population, both male and female.  It is not a disorder.  As such, it is an integral part of a person's expression of their identity, as integral as gender or race.  To have to hide one's sexual orientation for fear of discrimination or worse is a cause of huge stress and damage to the individuals affected and, I would suggest, to our society as a whole.</P>
      <P>While I welcome the Minister's and the Government's initiative, it also behoves us to recognise its limitations.  This issue is essentially about attitudes.  We cannot change attitudes solely by way of legislation. I confess that as a public representative I was slow to take this issue on board and to publicly articulate my view on it.  The same applies to many other Members.  Our failure to do so is shameful and I am ashamed of my failure in the past to have done so.  We, as legislators, have a role as leaders in society to help to create a climate of acceptance and tolerance which ensures gay people are accepted as equal citizens.  Members who oppose this legislation &mdash; Deputy McGahon said it this evening &mdash; frequently say it does not have the support of the people and point to opinion polls such as that of last Sunday which suggests that might be the case.  Previous opinion polls suggested something different but that is not the point. In essence this is not about majorities, minorities or percentages but the fundamental human rights of certain human beings in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We subscribed to the European Convention on Human Rights because we believed some fundamental human rights are essential in a democracy.  To express one's sexual orientation is a basic right. This Bill is not an attack on conventional sexual morality and heterosexuality.  It upholds the right of everybody, homosexual <Col N="2038" /> or heterosexual, to privacy in their own bedroom and does not present a threat to anyone.  It enhances our society.</P>
    <P>There are those who argue that 17 is too young and that the age of consent should be 18 or 21 years.  The essential point is that the age of consent must be the same for homosexual and heterosexual activity if we are to send the right signal.  The purpose of the legislation is to accord dignity to the gay community and to do this a common age of consent is essential &mdash; anything short of that would only encourage further discrimination.</P>
    <P>I will draw the attention of the House, as the Minister did earlier, to the report of the Law Reform Commission which states categorically that the same legal regime should obtain for consensual homosexual activity and no case has been established for providing that the age of consent should be any different.</P>
    <P>Our present legislation in this area dates from the Victorian era.  Deputy McGahon seems to find some merit in Victorian values.  When Queen Victoria was on the throne, children were forced to work in factories, women were accorded no place outside the home, the vast majority of people did not have a vote, most people lived in slum conditions and there was no universal suffrage. We have made a great deal of progress since then, much of it the result of developing a society and a sense of community solidarity.  We have developed a notion of individual human rights in the context of that sense of society.</P>
    <P>This Bill, for which I commend the Minister, forms part of the path of progress that I am happy to see this Government follow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been said so often now that it is almost a cliché that the true value of a society can be measured by how well it deals with its minorities.  We have been waiting a long time for this Bill which implements the decision of the European Court of Human Rights.  I commend the Minister for bringing it before the House.  It is interesting &mdash;<Col N="2039" /> and I will develop this point later &mdash; that a female Minister brought this legislation before the House.  The European Court of Human Rights declared that the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, and the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1885, violated section 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  It is important to read into the record what Article 8 says: &ldquo;Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The case put forward by Ireland in the Norris case is that Article 8.2 allows us not to decriminalise homosexual acts, but, rightly, the European Court of Human Rights quoted Article 15 which refers to exemptions in times of war or other public emergencies and not even Ireland has the nerve to make a case in the European Court of Human Rights that somehow we were being forced into a war or public emergency by the fact that we had homosexuals in our society. It is important to pay tribute to Senator Norris because I can imagine how lonely it was during the years he was fighting this case against all the odds.  He had to face all the prejudice and discrimination that was heaped on top of him but he continued to fight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a belief that Ireland can choose <i>à la carte</i> the human rights we want to implement.  It is interesting to note that Members were sent literature by various groups, the Dublin South Political Awareness group, the Canadian Intelligence Service &mdash; I do not know who they are, but they sent me the most lurid details &mdash; and Family Solidarity.  I know that members of those groups would be the first to fight for human rights for the black people of South Africa because they believe it is wrong that they do not have a vote and that they are discriminated against.  However, when it comes closer to home they think they can pick and choose human rights.  The Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms was implemented in November 1950.  I do not believe there is anything as fundamental, <Col N="2040" /> apart from the right to life, as the right to our sexuality, which is our very essence and makes us what we are.  If we want to be a party to that convention, we cannot decide to pick and choose from it.  As Deputy Flaherty said, maturing sexually is painful and very difficult.  None of us is too old to have forgotten the difficulties experienced during our adolescent years.  I am referring to the difficulties for heterosexuals but how much more difficult it must be for maturing adolescents who, through no act of theirs are attracted to people of their own sex rather than to the opposite sex.  Despite all the stereotype role models in books and films young people may be attracted to members of their own sex and do not have anyone to whom they can turn for advice and help.  Very often they cannot talk to their parents because of the lack of education in this area.  I agree with Deputy Frances Fitzgerald's views on sexuality training and how we must learn to face up to the issues in our society.  There is no point in ignoring or redefining homosexuals as if, somehow by doing so or thinking if you say often enough that they should not engage in these acts, they can stop being homosexuals.  It is nonsense to say, as one of my colleagues said, that homosexuality is a recent phenomenon. Since the time of Adam and Eve people exercised all sorts of sexual preferences as they do now.</P>
    <P>Earlier I said it was interesting that a female Minister for Justice introduced this Bill.  While I do not wish to generalise I think it is easier for women to cope with the reality of the discrimination homosexuals suffer.  I say that from my heart because women have had to face such enormous discrimination in their lives. We have moved in leaps and bounds to eliminate discrimination and perhaps we are <i>ad idem</i> facing up to what it must be like to be discriminated against.  I sense that some of the men who have spoken find it uncomfortable to speak about discrimination against homosexuals.  I do not want to generalise because there are fine men who have spoken on this inside and outside this House but somehow, <Col N="2041" /> having faced the discrimination practised against women, it helps us to have a better understanding.  Women all over the world are still discriminated against for no other reason than that they are female.  Black people are being discriminated against all over the world for no reason other than the colour of their skin.  Homosexuals are discriminated against in many places throughout the world because they do not conform to society's norms of sexual behaviour, or what society considers are the norms.</P>
    <P>In regard to all this talk about the increased dangers to health, I should like to give the lie to the myth that being homosexual is like having some kind of a bad flu, when if you go to your doctor he or she will prescribe tablets to be taken four times per day, tell you to go home and have a good sleep and that when you wake up in the morning you will be fine.  It is not like that.  It is the way people are and we must accept it, even if it is uncomfortable to talk about it.  Of course, people can be uncomfortable and maybe the manifestations in some of the parades and marches upset people's sensibilities.  I get upset too when I see some of the heterosexual behaviour which takes place, and that is natural.  Such kind of behaviour in public should not be accepted by anybody, whether heterosexual or homosexual. With a view to getting rid of some of the myths, I would remind the House, as one or two others did, that the 1989 Law Reform Commission consultation paper on child sexual abuse pointed out that most of the heinous crimes of child sexual abuse are caused by males to females.  Four in five offences are heterosexual, not homosexual, although people would like to imply that homosexuals are promiscuously rampant, racing around the country committing foul deeds of sexual abuse.  That is a great insult to many decent citizens of this country.  As I said, four in five of the offences listed in this report were heterosexual. Three in four victims of sexual assault were girls and one in four was a boy.  Virtually all sexual offences against female victims are committed by <Col N="2042" /> males.  The most recent awful cases we have had involved heterosexual offences not homosexual offences.</P>

      <P>I should like to refer briefly to some of the issues which have been referred to, one of which was that if we legalise homosexuality we are making it compulsory.  For goodness sake, we are not making it compulsory as if we should all go out and practise homosexuality as soon as this Bill is enacted.  There is a feeling that this legislation is attacking heterosexuals and family life, but that is not the case.  We are legislating for a basic human right.</P>
      <P>With regard to the remainder of the Bill, it was unwise of the Minister to include the issue of prostitution in this legislation.  I do not know what her reasons were, unless to ameliorate some of the criticism from her own backbenchers. It is wrong to include it in this Bill.  The fundamental issues in the whole area of prostitution have been outlined in the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women and there are all sorts of recommendations to deal with women who are forced into prostitution. Like Deputy Flaherty, I hope the Minister will take on board this suggestion, think about it overnight and come back tomorrow and suggest that those sections of the Bill be put to the Select Committee on Legislation and Security to be further teased out and augmented in order to assist women who have to turn to prostitution as a way of life.  I am heartily pleased that this Bill has come before the House and hope there will not be a vote on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to thank all the Deputies who contributed to this debate and for the contributions they have made this evening.  I am particularly heartened to note there is considerable support in the House for the measures put forward and that the support is <Col N="2043" /> informed by what I perceive as a very sincere desire on the part of those concerned to extend a human right to a group of people whose rights are now the subject of unjustifiable limitation.  I expect that some of the specific comments made may find further expression in the form of suggested amendments on Committee Stage.  A number of speakers have indicated that they propose to table a number of amendments and, if so, they will be dealt with fully at that stage.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer briefly to a few of the points made.  The limited time available for debate has been raised by a number of Deputies.  There is no question of my deliberately arranging to cut down the time for debate on this issue because I have no fear of debate on it.  The reality is that Bills of this kind, as most Deputies and particularly those who have been in Government will realise, take time to prepare.  Since I became Minister for Justice I have accelerated the preparatory process as much as I could.  At a certain stage when the Bill went to the Parliamentary Draftsman it was outside my control and was finalised only in the past number of days.  The time pressures on all of us are twofold: first, we are very close to the summer recess and, second, we need to get this legislation enacted without undue delay.  I had the distinct impression that the vast majority of Deputies were in favour of the principle of the Bill and certainly that is the view that has come forward in the debate this evening.  They all indicated they would not welcome any further delays.  My position is that the Bill should be enacted as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>I should say to those who had difficulties about the time allowed for debate tomorrow that I understand the time for debate on Committee Stage tomorrow has, with the agreement of the Whips, been extended to two hours and ten minutes.  That is progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to turn to a comment by Deputy Michael McDowell.  I freely acknowledge that the Government in 1988 defended the Norris case.  That is a fact and we all know about it.  It is a <Col N="2044" /> measure of our strength, or of any political party, that we acknowledge the need to look at situations afresh.  For any person, or political party in particular, to assume that a position which was conscientiously adopted at a particular time, or at a particular point in its history, must stand for all time as the correct one is arrogant.  When we as legislators fail to consider fundamental issues, fail to respond to the needs of minorities &mdash; however difficult it maybe to do so at times &mdash; we all lose the right to claim we are providing the public with quality representation.</P>
    <P>Coming from the constituency of Galway West it would be much easier for me politically not to bring forward legislation of that kind.  Since I became Minister for Justice and announced that this was one of the priorities of legislation for me, I have been constantly reminded by telephone and by letter of the type of constituency I represent.  There comes a time when somebody has to act as a legislator and not as somebody who holds a particular view on behalf of the moral majority.</P>
    <P>In relation to the age of consent, I regret that Deputy Gay Mitchell and Fine Gael are proposing to end one form of inequality by introducing a different form of inequality.  I hope his colleagues, particularly his female colleagues who spoke here this evening &mdash; Deputies Nora Owen, Mary Flaherty and Frances Fitzgerald &mdash; will be able to convince Deputy Mitchell overnight that that is the wrong way to proceed.  I know that all three Deputies are absolutely committed to the principle of equality.  The issue we have to decide in relation to the age of consent is: at what age can a person be said to possess the capacity to form a valid consent to have sexual relations with another person?  The age in the case of heterosexuality is 17.  As I said in my statement earlier, there is no logical reason for assuming that, while persons of 17 are capable of giving valid consent to heterosexual activity, persons of homosexual orientation do not acquire such capacity until they are older.  Underlying any such proposition would be the <Col N="2045" /> idea that homosexual orientation carries with it the burdens of lack of maturity or lower intellect.  There is no basis for any such assumption.  Not all individuals of 17 years are mature or capable of forming valid consent, and this has been acknowledged by most Deputies.  That applies equally to homosexuals and heterosexuals.</P>
    <P>There is nothing revolutionary in having a common age of consent.  When homosexuality was decriminalised in the United Kingdom and age of majority was 21 years, that was the age chosen by the Government at that time.  However, if we could raise our sights beyond our nearest neighbour to the European mainland we would realise that a common age of consent is the norm on the European mainland. For example, in France the common age of consent is 15 years; in Italy, 14 years; in Spain, 15 years; in Portugal and Belgium, 16 years; and in Poland, 15 years.  All those countries have a religious heritage similar to ours. Other countries with a common age of consent lower than 17 years are Greece, the Netherlands and Denmark.  In quoting ages of consent, it is important to highlight the tolerant attitude of the law to homosexuals in a wide range of European countries.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies stated that having a common age of consent might send a clear message to the community at large that this type of behaviour is acceptable.  I understand the concerns expressed in this regard, but we are not proposing to dismantle the social fabric nor, indeed, the promulgation of a new morality.  We are concerned about the removal of an unwarranted restriction on the basic rights of consenting adults in this community who are discriminated against at present by the fact that their private sexual activities are criminalised. It has been suggested that people who might have chosen either a life of chastity or a life of heterosexual union with another person will be swayed towards homosexuality simply because it suddenly comes to their notice that the age of consent for sexual relations is similar for both homosexual and heterosexual relations.</P>

      <P>To put it another way, people would be less likely to become actively homosexual having established that the age of consent was one, two or three years higher.  The whole idea seems to be underpinned by what is, no doubt, a genuine lack of understanding of human nature.  Homosexuality does not become a more or less attractive option simply because the age of consent for heterosexual relations is the same as for homosexual relations. No credibility attaches to the idea that messages might be sent to the public at large because of the heterosexual and homosexual age of consent coincidence. We must ask ourselves whether such notions have any basis in reality and in my view the answer is no.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGrath stated that gay people in Britain have suffered an increase in attacks since the decriminalisation there of homosexual acts between consenting male adults.  It would be extraordinary if this House were to withhold from homosexuals, allegedly for their own good, a freedom from criminality which they are demanding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refute strongly the suggestion by Deputy Mitchell that I was seeking a smokescreen to placate some of my own backbenchers by introducing a number of changes to the laws on prostitution. We need to make a number of amendments to the laws on prostitution and I took the opportunity to make them in this Bill.  Deputy Harney and others expressed concerns about those amendments, but we have until tomorrow to examine those issues.  I undertake to examine seriously the points raised in this debate.  A valid case was made about imprisonment, the difficulties in regard to lack of space in our prison system at present and whether we might find some other way of dealing with this issue. People in the community are genuinely concerned about the difficulties created in certain parts of this and other cities in regard to prostitution and we must deal with those difficulties.  In doing so it is <Col N="2047" /> important that we consider the questions raised by a number of Deputies today.</P>
    <P>This Bill is about human rights and most Deputies have acknowledged that fact.  It is also about the rights of women to be free from the harassment and fear associated with kerb-crawling, the fear of being molested or solicited, and to know that the law will respect those rights.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell suggested that it should be made an offence not to display a health notice in a brothel.  In reality, the operation of a brothel is illegal and the law requires brothels to cease operating, not to be better run.  A suggestion that brothels should be legalised and regulated is a serious issue which the House would have to debate carefully in separate legislation.</P>

      <P>Under the law as it stands the type of regulations suggested by Deputy Mitchell are not feasible. He is well aware that legislation on health notices is a matter for another Minister.</P>
      <P>Deputy Harney suggested that we should have an integrated approach between Departments to deal with prostitution and I support her view.  However, that does not mean that we cannot deal with the unacceptable aspects of prostitution, such as nuisance, exploitation and organisation.  I am concerned about the facilities for women involved in prostitution. The Second Report of the Commission on the Status of Women recommended a co-ordinated approach by the Departments of Health, Justice and Education to the problems faced by women involved in prostitution.  That recommendation is being examined at present by all three Departments to ascertain how best it can be implemented and Deputies will be aware that under the auspices of the probation and welfare service of my Department I have initiated a project under the NOW programme for women prisoners, some of whom have been involved in prostitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2048" /> Deputy McDowell referred to section 10 (2) which is a watered down version of an existing provision in the law relating to living on the earnings of prostitution.</P>

      <P>Again, that is something I will consider overnight and I am sure that in the extended debate on Committee Stage tomorrow we will have an opportunity to discuss that matter in greater detail.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore was concerned that I might confer on the Garda Síochána excessive powers or powers that might be used by certain members of the Force in an excessive manner.  I understand the focus which this debate has thrown on prostitutes, but it must be realised that the real change brought about by the soliciting provisions of this Bill will be to extend the law to cover clients of prostitutes, and Deputy Gilmore welcomed that provision.  I would expect the powers of the Garda concerning loitering to be used against kerb-crawlers where necessary. I would be as concerned as Deputy Gilmore that any powers conferred by any law on members of the Garda Síochána would be used in a proper manner.  I know that the Garda Síochána, both at management and staffing levels, would be keen also to ensure that their powers are used in a proper manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this House agrees to give this Bill a Second Reading, it will have taken a positive step forward in moving our social legislation closer to our social realities.  I regret Deputy McGahon's contribution.  I know he has three sons and I hope that none of them ever has to approach him as a father and indicate that he has homosexual tendencies because the one thing a young man or, indeed a man of any age with homosexual tendencies needs is compassion, understanding and tolerance.  In all of the meetings and deputations I received since I became Minister for Justice in January, the person who had the most influence on my thinking in this regard was the <Col N="2049" /> mother of a young homosexual man who indicated that when her 19 year old son told her he was homosexual her reaction was to tell him he would grow out of it, that it was abnormal.  She brought him to her general practitioner, to a psychologist, to a psychiatrist, and finally, after a painful 18 months she realised that this was something with which she had to live.  She had to ask herself a very serious question, one which any parent should ask.  In particular those who have doubts or difficulties with this legislation should ask what they would say to a son of 17 or 18 years of age &mdash; whom they had loved since birth &mdash; if he told them he was homosexual.  They would need to show him love, understanding and tolerance.  I hope this House will do that in regard to this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>This incident to which I will refer is the culmination of a litany of mistreatment of two Irish citizens by the British Army.  Over a period of at least 12 months, since the erection of three barriers by the British Army on the <i>culde-sac</i> lane leading to the home of these two ladies, their fundamental right of access to their home in County Cavan has been curtailed.  I understand the British authorities indicated in 1992, through the Anglo-Irish Secretariat, that the barriers would be in an upright position for most of the time but the reverse has been the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two constituents whose case I represent this morning have, over the past 12 months, had to await the removal of the barrier to allow them to travel to and from their own home.  Two barriers which could loosely be described as &ldquo;light&rdquo; can <Col N="2050" /> be removed by remote control by personnel in the adjoining British Army checkpoint.  Generally a light barrier curtailed access to this laneway.  However, on the night of Friday 11 June 1993 the heavy barrier was in place.  To remove such a heavy barrier I understand that Army personnel and machinery are needed.  At approximately 11.45 p.m. the two ladies arrived at their own laneway on the way from visiting friends.  The heavy barrier denied them access and, having waited some time for its removal without success, they sought the assistance of the gardaí in the local Garda station.  Requests to the British authorities failed to get a positive response. In the early hours of Saturday 12 June the two elderly ladies had to seek overnight accommodation in County Fermanagh. The barrier was removed at 11.45 a.m. on Saturday.</P>
    <P>This treatment of two very honourable and gentle ladies who have both, unfortunately, been in ill health is nothing short of scandalous.  I am glad that the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, following my tabling of a parliamentary question and contact with his Department, conveyed my concerns and those of the local community to the British authorities.  I hope that the Minister of State and the Tánaiste will lodge the strongest possible complaint about this incident and the totally unfair treatment of these two ladies over a period of time at the next Anglo-Irish Conference meeting. Such behaviour is intolerable and officials at the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Justice must be extremely vigilant at all times to ensure that decent people are not denied access to their basic rights.</P>
    <P>Movement to the home of the two ladies in question has been unfairly curbed for their neighbours and for local medical and religious services.  People, including neighbours, waited for up to 30 minutes without success for the light barrier to be removed and such incidents have occurred far too often in the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>In general the closure of Border roads <Col N="2051" /> causes severe economic and social hardship. In the adjourning Swanlinbar area of County Cavan five Border roads which link Cavan and Fermanagh are closed. This is causing undue and unnecessary hardship to local communities in Fermanagh and Cavan.  I appeal to the Minister of State to see at first hand the unfair treatment meted out to local communities in both counties.  I hope the Minister of State will be able to visit us in the near future and speak to the local communities whose livelihood and existence is curtailed by the totally inexcusable behaviour of the British authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Smith for raising this matter.  As he has rightly pointed out this is a particularly serious case which highlights many of the difficulties which can arise for local communities living in the Border area as a result of closed roads and permanent vehicle checkpoints.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that I am fully aware of the background to this case and that I share his concerns with regard to the present situation.  I also assure him that the incident of 11 and 12 June, to which he referred, and the ongoing difficulties caused to the two elderly ladies by the placing of the security barriers on the road leading to their home, have been raised with the British authorities through the Anglo-Irish Secretariat in Belfast.</P>
      <P>The Government has stressed to the British authorities the urgent need for measures to be taken to alleviate the situation in which these two women find themselves and has drawn their attention to assurances previously given with regard to ensuring easy access to and from the sisters' home.  In particular, the Government has asked that all necessary steps be taken to ensure that incidents such as the one which occurred on 11 and 12 June do not recur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government fully appreciates the difficulties caused to communities on both sides of the Border by closed roads <Col N="2052" /> and checkpoints, and has taken every opportunity within the framework of the Anglo-Irish Agreement to impress upon the British authorities the necessity of taking fully into account the negative social and economic effects caused by these measures.  The Government believes that these measures should be kept under continuous review and that the fullest consideration should be given to alternatives.  Where the British authorities consider that such measures are unavoidable for security reasons, we have emphasised that every effort should be made to keep the inconvenience caused to the absolute minimum.</P>
    <P>The Government is particularly conscious of the difficulties which may arise in individual cases and of the hardships which can be caused to the households involved.  The Deputy can be assured that we will continue to impress upon the British authorities the importance of dealing sensitively with all such cases, including that to which the Deputy has drawn attention this evening.  I assure him that I will continue to follow closely developments in this case and will keep him fully informed.</P>
    <P>I will be happy to accept the Deputy's invitation to visit the area and see for myself the effect on local communities and the situation on the ground with regard to these Border roads.</P>

      <P>Many people in my constituency are frustrated and disappointed at not securing a place on a social employment scheme.  Numerous projects have been brought to a standstill and the schemes which have commenced can no longer continue.  The reason given for not continuing those schemes is lack of funding.  South Tipperary has a proud record in the take-up of the social employment scheme.  I understand that because there was lower uptake of the scheme in other counties the people in South Tippeary gained from an overflow of places on the scheme.  However, that position has levelled out and others have <Col N="2053" /> come to appreciate the value of such schemes.  Nevertheless, it is most important that valuable projects commenced in South Tippeary should continue during the summer months.  No one from any Department will convince me that it is better economics to keep people on social welfare than to allow them participate in a social employment scheme. That cannot be argued with any degree of conviction.</P>
      <P>In South Tipperary social employment schemes now at a standstill cannot resume until November or December. There is no logic in the Department's decision in this regard.  Having regard to the nature of many of the projects being undertaken they require good weather and more progress can be made during the summer months.  It is sad there are so many people in receipt of social welfare who desperately want to work.  It is sadder still that so many projects are waiting to be pursued.  The work is there to be done and the will is there to do the work but the go-ahead from the Department is lacking.</P>
      <P>A shop for the blind in Cahir is near to closing because the two people working in the shop under the social employment scheme had to cease their employment in June.  At present the shop is being run voluntarily but that cannot continue for an indefinite period of time or until November.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the value of the schemes and the enthusiasm and desperate need to obtain work among people who participate in them, I urge the Minister to reconsider his decision.  It would be logical and a good decision to give South Tipperary permission forthwith to pursue the schemes already operating.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As was recently indicated to this House the Book of Estimates for 1993 included an Exchequer allocation of £83.811 million <Col N="2054" /> for expenditure on the social employment scheme and the community employment development programme which replaced the social employment scheme in the 12 areas designated under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> area-based strategy to combat long term unemployment.  This allocation would have allowed the participation of an average of 13,500 participants throughout the year compared with 12,000 last year.  However, in order to meet demands for additional places the Government recently approved the provision of a further £13.5 million for the scheme bringing total funding in 1993 to £97.3 million.  This will provide opportunities for an average of 15,500 people throughout the year.  Despite such a significant level of funding the Government is aware that all demands for places will not be satisfied and is currently examining the practical and financial implications of providing additional resources this year.  However, in the context of the overall budgetary situation such additional resources would have to be found from savings elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The scheme, which commenced in 1985, is the principal manpower intervention aimed at assisting the long term unemployed.  It provides opportunities, albeit on a part-time basis, for long term unemployed people to become involved for a year in a work-related situation, thus gaining valuable work experience. In addition, it gives them an opportunity to learn new skills and practise existing skills which should improve the prospects for participants of obtaining employment when full-time employment opportunities arise.</P>
    <P>Just over half of the participants on the social employment scheme and community employment development programme are persons with adult and/or child dependants.  This level of participation by older long term unemployed people with dependants is very satisfactory and has come about due to the availability since 1990 of a child dependant allowance.  The current levels of payment to participants are £75 per week for a person without a dependant, £107.50 <Col N="2055" /> per week for a participant with an adult dependant, and participants with children can also get up to £12.50 per week per child.  I can confirm that sufficient funding has been made available to allow these rates to be increased further from July next to £77 for a participant without a dependant, £110.70 for a participant with an adult dependant, while the full rate in respect of a child will be up to £12.80.</P>
    <P>The scheme represents a successful collaboration between local communities and the State, in that local groups sponsoring projects come forward with proposals for projects in their communities, many of which involve improvements to local amenities.  In addition, local communities must come up with a small element of funding for the projects to supplement the assistance available under the scheme for materials and supervision.  A wide variety of projects is undertaken under the scheme ranging from projects improving the local environment, sports, arts and tourism projects to community development and all Deputies are well aware of the benefits to local communities and local unemployed people brought about through the scheme.</P>
    <P>The scheme is, however, to a certain extent a victim of its own success.  One of the difficulties which has arisen over the years is that some voluntary groups providing services on a continuing basis at local level have come to rely on schemes such as the social employment scheme for assistance in providing their services.  As such the schemes are in danger of becoming project-driven.  The social employment scheme, and teamwork which is targeted at unemployed people under 25, were not intended to provide assistance for projects on an ongoing basis.  Rather the intention was that projects would be of a finite nature which would allow flexibility in providing opportunities for long term unemployed people where such opportunities were needed having regard to the level of unemployment in different parts of the country and, of course, the overall <Col N="2056" /> budgetary situation.  It would be unfair if existing projects were automatically renewed each year.  This, of course, would mean that new projects no matter how deserving or necessary, could not be considered.</P>
    <P>Intake to the scheme must be managed by FÁS to ensure that expenditure is kept within available resources and to ensure an equitable distribution of projects throughout the country based on local needs.  FÁS must have the flexibility to manage the scheme having regard to the needs of the long term unemployed throughout the country and available Exchequer resources.</P>
    <P>EC support for the scheme is being sought in the context of the 1994 to 1999 round of Structural Funds with the aim of moving towards a doubling of participation levels to 30,000 each year.  The Government was very conscious that some long term unemployed people were not interested in participating in the social employment scheme because they would lose their secondary social welfare benefits, notwithstanding the fact that the levels of payments to participants on the social employment scheme exceed those to which they would have been entitled had they remained on social welfare.  As such the community employment development programme has replaced the social employment scheme in the 12 <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> areas on a pilot basis since last October.  Under the programme a training element is being provided on projects involving 15 or more participants and participants retain their secondary social welfare benefits such as butter vouchers, fuel allowance, etc.  The operation of the programme will be evaluated to assess its effectiveness in assisting persons who are long term unemployed.  In addition, the question of extending the programme nationwide will be considered in the context of the funding available under the Community Support Framework for the period 1994 to 1999.</P>

      <P>The Minister and many of us will have seen the programme on television last night which featured the problems at Baize Textiles, a small clothing manufacturing company in the Finglas area.  The experience of that company would indicate that it has lost many of its existing contracts because it has become totally uncompetitive.  When asked to identify the major factor in that loss of competitiveness it points to the PRSI costs associated with employing people in this country.</P>
      <P>A short distance from Baize Textiles there is another clothing firm in my constituency, Glenross Hosiery Limited, which until recently manufactured designer socks for the British market. While it still has some contracts many of those have been reduced as a result of (a) the exchange rate problems and (b) the interest rate problems which put their costs completely out of line.  Up to the end of April these companies were cushioned by the market development fund which was established to help companies during that period.  However, while the interest rates have now stabilised, people are still carrying enormous burdens from the period when the rates were extremely high.  The exchange rate has improved but it still has not returned to the position in which these companies had been competing in the market in Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Glenross Hosiery Limited are not at risk at the moment but at one stage they were employing 170, and are now employing 130 people, many of whom are on part-time work.  This company, like Baize Textiles, must now go to Europe and attempt to sell their products there where the cost factors compare more favourably than they do with Great Britain.  These companies, through IBEC, have identified the need for some ameliorative programme.  They have identified also that rather than a continuation of the market development fund, which was related to direct losses <Col N="2058" /> during the currency crisis, special action in relation to PRSI must be taken.</P>
    <P>All parties in this House accept that the PRSI burden is a taxation on work. We should use the clothing industry as a pilot scheme to test the impact on employment of a reduction in PRSI.  Earlier this session Fine Gael put down a motion to remove the proposed VAT on clothing.  It was defeated but when the Government defeated that motion they indicated that the Minister would bring in proposals to deal, in particular, with the clothing industry.  It must be remembered that this is a labour-intensive industry and the employment tends to be working-class employment.  Throughout working-class areas traditional skilled activities have disappeared.  This is one area where the industry is holding on and employing significant numbers of people.</P>
    <P>Baize Textiles, Glenross Hosiery Limited and other such companies around the country are at risk of closure and need Government action.  IBEC have been campaigning for such a programme for this industry and I would like the Minister to indicate what plans the Department of Enterprise and Employment have, in conjunction with the Minister for Finance, for giving such a concession regarding PRSI.  This would enable Baize Textiles to win back some of their contracts, to become more competitive and for other companies like Glenross Hosiery Limited to offer full employment again which they will have the potential to do if they get the required assistance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to apologise for the Minister's absence here tonight.  I want to assure the House that the Minister is most concerned that the future of Baize Textiles Limited may be in jeopardy. The Deputy's concerns regarding the employment of the company are fully shared by the Minister.</P>
      <P>The loss of up to 90 jobs in Finglas would naturally have major effects on the economic life of the surrounding areas and, of course, present major difficulties, for the employees concerned and their families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2059" /> I am aware that Baize Textiles have issued protective notice to their 90 strong workforce and this is due to expire in August.  I understand from the IDA that the company has been forced to take this action as its uncompetitive position has meant that it has been unable to win sufficient orders for its products.  Baize Textiles produce outer garments such as coats and anoraks for the home and export markets including the United Kingdom and Russia.</P>
    <P>The company, along with a number of other clothing manufacturing companies, have been finding it increasingly difficult, over the past year or so, to compete with low priced imports from third countries into both the home market and the EC.  The problem has been further exacerbated by the fact that clothing manufacturing costs in the UK, which is by far our major export market, are significantly below Irish production costs.</P>
    <P>The clothing and textiles sectors are essential to the Irish economy, providing employment for about 23,000 people.  It is important, therefore, that these sectors overcome their present difficulties and become strong and vibrant elements of the economy, providing secure employment for their skilled workforce, and regaining market share in the home market and also increasing exports.</P>
    <P>I accept that these objectives will not be easy to achieve and will take some time to come to fruition.  It is important, however, for the industry to start addressing the issues necessary to make it competitive once more.</P>
    <P>The Minister in the past referred to the best way forward for the industry, which is that it should become market led, perceived weaknesses should be eliminated, and its strengths maximised.  The successful future of the clothing industry is based on proper strategic planning, competitive advantage in service, shorter lead times, aggressive marketing, and quality and design.  While most of these initiatives rest with the industry, my Department has had, and is continuing to have, <Col N="2060" /> regular contact with State agencies in the context of addressing the problems facing the industry.</P>
    <P>The restructuring of the clothing sector will take time and it is important having regard to the immediate problems facing the industry that some short term assistance be given to the industry to allow it a breathing space.</P>
    <P>In this regard the Deputy is no doubt aware of the special scheme for the clothing and footwear sectors which was recently announced by the Minister for Finance.  My Department has over the past few weeks, had a series of discussions with the IDA who also consulted IBEC in order to examine the best way to formulate the scheme.  I can tell the House that I am now in the final stages of discussions with the Minister for Finance on the matter and I am confident that we can reach agreement very shortly on the level of funding and the criteria to be applied.  The Deputy will appreciate that careful consideration must be given to this process because we must have due regard to the overall EC requirements in relation to State aid.  When this process is completed I hope it will enable the clothing and footwear companies, like Baize Textiles, to become more competitive and, therefore, remain in business.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Minister for Finance has already announced that a review is to be carried out, in consultation with the Department of Social Welfare, of the impact on low paid manufacturing firms of the operation of the employers' PRSI system.</P>
    <P>Hopefully, the benefit of these initiatives, together with the falling interest rates, will meet the pressing needs of the industry and allow it the time necessary to restructure itself to meet the changing needs of the current market and to secure employment for the future.</P>
    <P>The IDA has been asked to make every possible effort to avert job losses and in this regard a meeting between the IDA and the company took place this afternoon. I understand in the course of these discussions, the company has indicated that the introduction of the proposed <Col N="2061" /> scheme mav enable Baize Textiles to continue in operation.  The Department and the IDA will keep the company advised of developments in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarClohessy" hpid="Mr. Clohessy Mr. Clohessy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with my colleague, Deputy Des O'Malley.</P>
      <P>The problem facing 101 pupils and their parents in the Limerick city region in not having secondary school places available to them for the start of the next school year is totally unacceptable.  This appalling situation is a source of great concern and anguish to these pupils and their parents.  This is an appalling situation for these pupils and their parents and is a source of grave concern and anguish to them.  I ask the Minister to do everything possible as a matter of urgency to resolve the problem and allay the fears of these people.  This problem has been ongoing for more than a month and while the number of pupils affected has been reduced from 160, there is still a total of 89 boys and 12 girls who are due to leave primary school in the next week who wish to start secondary school in September.</P>
      <P>The parents of these children have mounted a very effective, reasoned and informative campaign to highlight their plight and deserve better than they have got to date.  Last week they came to Dublin to bring their complaint and frustration to the gates of Leinster House.  When Deputy O'Malley raised this matter with the Minister for Education on 26 May last she told him she had met representatives of parents and assured them that no pupil would be left without a place in a second level school next September.  That was a month ago and the problem still exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Starting secondary school is a difficult experience for children, but when they do not know what school they will be attending or whether there will be a place for them at all it is most unacceptable. Every other pupil leaving primary school in the next week knows what school they <Col N="2062" /> will be attending and their parents can plan their books, uniforms and other needs.  However, these 101 children in Limerick and their families are in limbo. The Minister should convene a meeting of all secondary school principals in Limerick as well as the chief executive officer of Limerick Vocational Education Committee in order to find a solution to this problem, not only for next September but on a long term basis, so that the problem will not recur next year.  The people of this country, including the people of Limerick, are providing a total of £1.8 billion for education this year and one of the basic returns must be the provision of places for every child who wishes to go to secondary school.  The children of Limerick and their parents are entitled to nothing less.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what my colleague, Deputy Clohessy, has said.  It is regrettable it has to be discussed at 12.35 a.m. but that underlines the urgency of the problem facing these children and their parents.  This problem has arisen to a limited extent in the last two or three years since the system was changed in Limerick.  It was resolved quickly every other year but this year has not been resolved.  In spite of numerous promises made to me and others by the Minister for Education, she seems to have done very little about the matter in the past six weeks since the problem arose.  This is a cause of grave concern to the children and parents concerned.  Some of the children have been informed they will not even be allowed stay on in primary schools. At a time when numbers coming out of primary schools are dropping, as they are this year, it seems inexcusable that this difficulty should arise and that more than 100 children are in this position as we come towards the end of June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Education will simply have to stop making promises and do something about the matter now.  The numbers that have to be accommodated next September are less than the numbers that had to be accommodated in earlier years.  Therefore, there is no excuse for <Col N="2063" /> the fact that they are not accommodated. Those children and their parents demand that something be done immediately so that they do not have to suffer throughout the summer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for raising this matter.  The fact that it is being discussed at 12.35 a.m. is an indication of the concern of Deputies about the problem.  The Minister and the Department are very much aware of and concerned about the situation which has developed in Limerick city regarding the intake of pupils into post-primary schools for the purpose of commencing their post-primary education next September.</P>
      <P>There are at present 15 post-primary schools in the city which take in pupils at first year, junior cycle level.  The Department is aware that each year for some years past a number of children experienced difficulty in getting a post-primary school place in the city.  The Department accepts that the accommodation situation in some of the post-primary schools is tight at present and that there is in the short term a peaking of annual output of children from the primary schools in the city.</P>
      <P>The situation has been complicated, however, by the practice of some schools taking in pupils from outside the Limerick city post-primary catchment area and by the unwillingness of some parents to consider placing their child in a school other than that of first preference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was with a view to resolving this situation that the post-primary managements in Limerick have since the 1991-92 school year adopted a uniform <Col N="2064" /> enrolment policy involving a common application form on which parents are required to list schools of greater preference, and a common assessment on a common date.  Regrettably, however, this system has not succeeded in eliminating the problem of where a proportion of pupils still find themselves without an offer of a school place for September next as the end of the current school year is reached.</P>
    <P>The most recent information made available to the Department indicates that some 100 children still remain unplaced.  In this regard the Department's main responsibility is to ensure that overall an adequate number of post-primary places exist in Limerick city to meet the demand.  Over the past number of weeks the Minister met concerned parents, and Department officials met both parents and school authorities in Limerick city.</P>
    <P>The Minister has assured parents that no pupil will be left without a place in a second level school next September.  It has been made clear by the Minister and the Department that if extra resources are required to ensure places for these children they will be made available.</P>
    <P>Negotiations with a number of school authorities in the city are ongoing with a view to resolving the problem.  As Deputies will appreciate, the matter is a difficult and sensitive one.  However, the Minister and the Department are hopeful that the matter will be satisfactorily resolved very shortly.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 12.40 a.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 24 June 1993.</P>

      <P>Ireland strongly supported the adoption of a Community Regulation in December 1992 accelerating target dates for phasing out the most common ozone depleting substances.  In particular, this regulation will phase out production and use of CFCs by 1 January 1995, one year ahead of the amended Montreal Protocol deadline.</P>
      <P>A new EC Commission proposal which will deal primarily with phase-out dates for additional controlled substances is due to be presented to next week's Environment Council.  While this proposal has not yet been formally received, I understand that it will provide for a phase out of HCFCs by 2014 compared with 2030 in the amended Montreal Protocol; a phase out of HBFCs by 1996 as in the Protocol; and for a freeze by 1995 on production and consumption of methyl bromide, as in the Protocol, together with a 25 per cent reduction in respect of this substance by 1996.  The Protocol provides only for discussions to take place on the possibility of a 25 per cent reduction by the year 2000.</P>
      <P>Ireland has consistently maintained an advanced position on control of ozone depleting substances, and I intend that this latest proposal when received will be examined positively.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40, 64 and 68 together.</P>
      <P>The rights of tenants of private rented accommodation and the protection available to them, in the first place are governed by the terms of the lease or other tenancy agreement under which the tenancies are held.  These are subject to the provisions of the landlord and tenant code which is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>The tenure rights of tenants of dwellings formerly controlled under the Rent Restrictions Acts are protected under the provisions of the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Acts, 1982 and 1983 and the rents of such dwellings may be determined by the Rent Tribunal.</P>
      <P>Tenancy agreements under which local authority houses are let are governed by article 83 of the Housing Regulations, 1980; these agreements set out the terms and conditions under which each such tenancy is held.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Statutory backing for those aspects of the charter of tenants' rights, which are the concern of my Department, is contained in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1992.  &ldquo;Distress&rdquo;, i.e. seizure of tenants' goods to enforce payment of rent due, has already been abolished and, subject to some limited exceptions, a minimum period of four weeks notice to quit has been introduced <Col N="1835" /> in respect of all residential tenancies. Regulations have recently been made making rent books mandatory and prescribing minimum standards for rented accommodation.  These measures apply to local authority and private lettings of houses, with some limited exceptions.</P>
    <P>The question of registration of rented dwellings is under examination.</P>

      <P>While in principle, free movement of persons within the Community was to be in place from 1 <Col N="1840" /> January 1993, the competent Ministers have concluded that it is not yet possible to realise this objective in full as the necessary compensatory measures have not all been implemented.</P>
      <P>The Edinburgh European Council in December 1992 took note that free movement of persons within the Community would not be completely achieved by 1 January 1993.  The Council took note also of the fact that the work necessary to achieve this result was still under way. Since then further progress has been made; and competent Ministers have emphasised their determination to bring forward the work on the essential compensatory measures.  These measures involve co-operation aimed at combating crime and drug trafficking and ensuring effective control of external borders.</P>
      <P>In practice, therefore, passport checks may continue to be carried out.  For this reason Irish travellers continue to need a valid passport for travel both within and outside the Community, except, of course, for travel to Britain.  Even when freedom of movement is in place within the Community, it may continue to be desirable for Irish citizens to have a valid passport since this is in effect the only evidence of their citizenship in the absence of an indentity card system in this country.</P>

      <P>The Céide Fields Interpretative Centre project was initiated by the local community in 1989. Substantial funds were raised by the community towards the cost of the development and various lands including a site for the proposed centre were acquired. In 1990, the Office of Public Works was asked to work with the community to provide the centre and a committee was formed to oversee all aspects of the project. The committee included representatives of the local community, Mayo County Council and the Office of Public Works.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of the interpretative centre is to assist in the conservation of what is the world's largest Stone-Age monument.  Visitors to the Céide Fields are brought on a guided tour of the site, and can also see an indoor interpretative exhibition and audio-visual show.  The building also allows visitors a panoramic view of the extent of the archaeological site and the spectacular cliffs.  The centre is a perfect example of the policy of integrating a facility into the landscape so that visitors can come and enjoy the unique attractions that are to be seen in both the immediate &ldquo;archaeological park&rdquo; of 450 acres and also the wider site area of some 2,500 acres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that the Deputy may be concerned at the location of some of these structures in high amenity areas. However, I feel that, having viewed this centre myself at first hand when I performed the official opening there some weeks ago, he need have no worries on that score in this case.  The Office of Public Works have married the sometimes conflicting requirements of conservation and visitor access very successfully here.  I would invite the Deputy to visit the Céide Fields Centre to view the result for himself.  Architecturally <Col N="1842" /> the building is significant in its own right.</P>
    <P>I should also point out that the Céide Fields Visitor Centre has attracted none of the controversy associated with other projects in Wicklow, Clare and Meath, and that it has received the endorsement of both the local population and many informed commentators.  I would refer the Deputy for instance to the report of <i>The Irish Times</i> of 29 May last on this matter which no doubt he will find interesting.  I will be happy to provide the Deputy with a copy of this report directly. I think it is apparent that there is a wide acknowledgment in many areas that this in a very worthwhle addition to and investment in the tourism infrastructure of the Mayo region and will prove to be a significant and valuable amenity for tourists and native visitors alike.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that while provisional figures for 1992 indicate that there was an increase in crime in the Galway city area, figures for the Salthill area in that year indicate that there was a decrease in crime there.  Indications for 1993 to date, are that there has been a decrease in crime levels in both locations.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities confirm that certain problems arise in the Galway and Salthill areas during the summer months arising from the large influx of visitors to these areas.  Most of the problems arise from the behaviour of large numbers of youths congregating in certain locations. This is a symptom of a more general problem experienced in various urban areas throughout the country.  I have taken certain initiatives to deal with this problem, including the preparation of a Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill which is being given priority in my Department.  It will give appropriate powers to the Garda and the courts to deal with street crime and disorderly and threatening behaviour.</P>
      <P>As far as Galway-Salthill is concerned, the Garda authorities are aware of the particular problems being experienced there and a number of measures have been and are taken to deal with the sitution. These include the closer co-ordination and use of foot and mobile patrols and checkpoints and the deployment of Garda resources to meet the special requirements of particular areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1844" /> Since I took up office, 23 uniformed gardaí have been assigned to Galway-Salthill, two of whom have been assigned to full-time community duties.  This brings the total number of members on community policing duties in the city to 11 and the total strength of the Galway West Division to 335.  In addition, 12 student gardaí were assigned to Galway-Salthill patrol car was allowed to Galway city in the past two weeks.</P>
    <P>I would also like to emphasise the role that community action can play in the fight against crime.  The Garda authorities in Galway have been very active in the promotion of crime prevention measures and use all available opportunities to advise the public on sensible crime prevention precautions which they can take.  The involvement of the public neighbourhood watch and community alert schemes has proved very effective in this regard as they bring the local community into closer contact with the Garda in the reporting of suspicious or unusual activities in their localities.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are currently 13 community alert schemes and 48 neighbourhood watch schemes in operation in the Galway West Division.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Garda response to problems in the area is proving successful. The situation is however, being kept under constant review by the Garda authorities to ensure that all appropriate action is taken to deal with problems that arise.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 60, 61 and 62 together.  The nominees through whom the Taoiseach held his shareholding in Temple Bar Properties Limited were Anthony F. O'Rourke and Patrick Teahon.  Following the transfer to me in January last of the Taoiseach's powers, functions and duties under the Temple Bar Area Renewal and Development Act, 1991, John Cullen &mdash; an officer of my Department &mdash; replaced Mr. Teahon as nominee.  The current directors of Temple Bar Properties Ltd. are Patrick Kenny, chairman, Gillian Bowler, Derek Brady, Peter Cassells, John Cullen, Sean Haughey, Owen Hickey, Laura Magahy Managing, Joseph Moreau, Michael McNulty, Patricia Quinn and Mary Walsh.  All of these appointments, with the exception of Mr. <Col N="1848" /> Cullen, who is an officer of my Department, were made by the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>No remuneration or allowances have been paid to the non-executive directors of the company.  The remuneration determined for the managing director is £55,000 a year.  Apart from consultants engaged by the company in a number of capacities, 19 staff are employed.  Since the transfer of functions was made last January, I have familiarised myself with the plans and operations of Temple Bar Developments Limited.  I am satisfied that these are consistent with, and should secure the implementation of, the objectives underlying the enactment of the 1991 Act and the Government's overall strategy for the Temple Bar area.</P>
      <P>As regards new legislation concerning the Temple Bar area, I refer to the reply to Question No. 109 of 5 May 1993.</P>

Energy policy and environment policy are deeply linked, and good practical co-ordination between Departments has developed in response to this connection; this has been particularly assisted by the designation of an Environmental section in the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications.  The recently published Climate Change CO 2 Abatement Strategy was prepared by the Department of the Environment in co-operation with the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, and both Departments are to undertake a joint public awareness campaign relating to climate change.  In the transport area, there are a number of arrangements for <Col N="1849" /> co-ordination of the activities of both Departments.  These include: the monitoring committee for the operational programme on peripherality which oversees the implementation of roads and other transport investments assisted by the EC Structural Funds; the Dublin Transporation Initiative which is preparing an integrated transport strategy for the greater Dublin area; the Dublin Transportation Task Force which oversees traffic management in Dublin.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 65 and 67 together.  The management and maintenance of their rented dwellings are the responsibility of local authorities and the costs involved fall to be met from the revenue resources of the authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 9 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1992, provides that each housing authority must prepare and adopt a statement of policy for the effective management and maintenance of their rented housing stock. These statements must be adopted, as a reserved function, by 31 August 1993.  To assist housing authorities in the preparation of the statements, a memorandum was issued to them on 4 March <Col N="1850" /> 1993 providing background information in relation to housing management, outlining areas of concern and specifying matters which should be addressed by authorities when drawing up their statements. A copy of the memorandum has been placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>At an information seminar for housing officials held subsequent to the issue of the memoradnum, I stressed the need for fundamental and radical review by housing authorities of their functions in this area and for the development of new and improved systems of management and maintenance which would be effective, efficient and economical.  In addition, regional seminars on the preparation of the policy statements have been held for housing authority officials. It is now a matter for each authority to devise the objectives, policies and operational systems to be included in their statement of policy.</P>

      <P>The repossession of houses in respect of which house purchase loans have been made by the Housing Finance Agency is not a factor influencing the annual capital allocations for the local authority housing programmes.  The HFA is not funded by my Department and generally it has a statutory duty to meet its costs from its operations.  I am informed by the agency that the total number of houses repossessed by local authorities on its behalf since 1982 is approximately 800.  Local authorities do not subsidise any losses sustained by the HFA on repossessions.  Such losses have to be borne by the HFA and not the local authorities who are allowed to recoup all their costs associated with repossession.</P>
      <P>Where local authorities decide to take repossessed houses into stock, they may finance the purchase of such houses at their market value from the capital allocation for their housing programmes.  A proportion of the capital allocation is funded from the authorities' internal housing capital receipts but it is not possible to say what amount, if any, of these receipts is utilised to fund the purchase of repossessed houses.</P>

      <P>Under my Department's funding arrangements for swimming pools, a grant of up to 80 per cent of the approved cost of providing a pool may be paid. Where a pool is being provided by a voluntary organisation, application for a grant must be made to the local authority in the first instance and the proposal will only be considered by my Department if it is supported by the local authority. Before supporting an application, the local authority would have to be satisfied that the pool was needed, that the proposed pool would meet the Department's technical specification, that the balance of funding required to complete the project was available, that the pool could be operated on a viable basis and that there would be a satisfactory level of public access to it.</P>
      <P>I have received some inquiries about grant assistance for the provision of a swimming pool at Ballaghaderreen on behalf of the Ballaghaderreen Swimming Pool Committee but no formal application has been submitted so far.  Having regard to the limited capital funding available for the provision and refurbishment of swimming pools, and the number of projects currently before my Department awaiting approval, it would be some considerable time before I would be in a position to give a decision on any such application.</P>

      <P>I have had discussions with representatives of Rural Resettlement Ireland Ltd. on a number of issues, including a proposal for a special revolving fund of £1 million.  In these discussions, the attention of the organisation has been drawn to the potential, in furthering their resettlement programme, of a number of existing schemes, particularly shared ownership, the voluntary housing schemes and the scheme of improvement works in lieu of local authority housing.  The proposed revolving fund, which would involve the company in the purchase and selling on of property, would require particular skills and resources and carry a significant degree of risk.  In all the circumstances, it has been indicated to the company that the proposal should be deferred pending experience in the use of the existing schemes.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 84, 85, 86, 87 and 89 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities are aware that the cost of remedial works to public roads and bridges arising as a result of flood damage must be met from the discretionary grants for non-national roads and from the maintenance grants for national roads.  In the current year, these grants amount to £69.45 million and £20.7 million respectively.  It is a matter for these authorities to make reasonable provision for such contingencies when <Col N="1858" /> preparing their annual road works programme. The same position applies in relation to other local authority property and facilities.  Repair and maintenance works do not, of course, qualify for Structural Fund assistance.</P>
    <P>In the case of damage to residential property caused by heavy rainfall and flooding, it is essentially a matter for householders to have the buildings and contents insured against such damage. There are no funds available to me to provide assistance in respect of such damage.  However, as I indicated in reply to Private Notice Questions on 15 June, assistance may be available from health boards, in necessitous cases, under the Task Force on Special Housing Aid for the Elderly to remedy damage to the householders' living conditions. Where necessary local authorities have also helped through the provision of temporary accommodation.</P>
    <P>As I also indicated in my replies on 15 June, a health board may, under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme, assist a person where an urgent need arises.  While this is a matter for the Minister for Social Welfare, I understand that the boards already have helped by providing temporary accommodation, have contributed towards the replacement of household furnishings and appliances damaged by floods and have made cash subventions where warranted. Individuals affected by the flooding who need assistance should contact their local community welfare officer.</P>
    <P>The EC Commission has notified a provisional allocation of 200,000 ECU (c. £160,000) to assist victims of the flooding and the use to which these funds might appropriately be put is now under consideration.</P>

To assist local authorities in the discharge of their responsibilities in this respect, my Department has provided apropriate advice and guidelines (including guidance in relation to control and co-ordination arrangements) based on a common framework for a co-ordinated response to major emergencies which was approved by Government in 1984.

      <P>The policy of differing levels of grant aid in areas to the east and west of a line drawn from Lough Foyle to the Old Head of Kinsale applies to grant aid provided in respect of development projects undertaken in the fisheries interest at non-State owned harbours.</P>
      <P>This policy is a long standing one.  I believe that the policy is out-dated and does not reflect the capacity of the various maritime local authorities to contribute to the costs of such development projects.  In view of this, the matter is currently being reviewed in relation to the Fishery Harbour Development Programme for the 1994 through 1999 period and in this regard preliminary discussions have taken place between the Departments of the Marine, Finance and Environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the commercial port at Mornington, Co. Louth, Drogheda Harbour Commissioners have applied for 75 per cent EC aid under the next round of Structural Funds towards the cost of the construction of a new deepwater port facility.  The current maximum EC aid level for commercial seaports under the Operational Programme on Peripherality is 50 per cent.  The Commissioners' application is being assessed at present along with numerous other projects received from harbour authorities and private promoters with a view to constructing an integrated and strategic investment plan for our commercial seaports.  It will not be possible to make final decisions on any of the projects submitted, or the EC aid rate to be granted, until such time as the <Col N="1861" /> commercial seaports allocation under the next round of Structural Funds has been determined.</P>

      <P>Following the recent ourbreak of Equine Viral Arteritis (EVA) in the UK my Department has held consultations with various interests in the Irish bloodstock industry with a view to maintaining Ireland's freedom from the disease.  EVA has been designated a notifiable disease in Ireland.  It is included in a voluntary code of practice which owners and managers of bloodstock have been strongly advised to follow.  Thorough implementation of the code of practice would provide good protection against the disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The movement of horses into and within the EC is governed by Community legislation which is fully implemented by my Department.  With the greater freedom of movement permitted by single market structures it is of the utmost importance that importers take responsibility <Col N="1864" /> for ensuring that they do not jeopardise the national industry by importing diseased animals.</P>

      <P>The total public funding provided for the Leader programme in Ireland is £35 million; £21 million EC and £14 million Exchequer.  To date some £7.9 million of this has been paid by way of advances to the Irish Leader groups.  For convenience I will send the Deputy a list of the groups and the amounts of their individual total allocations rather than detail them here.</P>
      <P>It is a requirement of the Leader programme that activities being aided by the groups be normally financed on a 50 per cent public/50 per cent private basis.  An exception is administrative costs of the group which can be funded on an 80 per cent public/20 per cent private basis.</P>

    <P>The Deputy may have in mind the case of St. Patrick's national school, Galway. A special concession was granted to this school in 1990 which gave them until June 1994 to phase out the practice of repeat 6th classes.  This concession will discontinue from the end of the 1993/94 school year at which stage the retention of pupils in 6th class will no longer be recognised by my Department for the reasons outlined above.</P>
