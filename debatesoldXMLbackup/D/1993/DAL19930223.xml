      <asker>Mr. Durkan</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>when the next EC Heads of Government meeting will take place; if the question of economic, monetary and political union is likely to be on the agenda; the role he intends to play; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The next scheduled meeting of the European Council will be on 21-22 June in Copenhagen and it will be for Denmark, as the member state currently holding the EC Presidency, to propose, in the first instance, the subjects for discussion.  It is, of course, too early to speculate with any great degree of accuracy on the subjects for discussion &mdash; so much depends on what happens in the coming months, including in other Community fora.</P>
      <P>Indeed, this is the reason the Presidency makes its proposals available only very shortly before European Council meetings.  However, it is quite likely that when we meet in Copenhagen in June, the European Council will wish to review progress towards economic, monetary and political union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="946" /> I can also assure the Deputy that if circumstances require it, I shall most certainly seek to have this matter discussed at the meeting.  If the Deputy needs any reassurance on that score, I would remind him that in my relatively short time as a member of the European Council, I have not been shy in seeking to influence the agenda or outcome of these meetings where Ireland's best interests or those of the Community so require.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach see himself being in a position to initiate procedures where greater emphasis will be placed on the need for European convergence in the areas mentioned in the question?  Does he see himself playing a major role having regard to recent financial and monetary difficulties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly do.  In the final analysis the agenda is a matter for the Presidency.  The Deputy can be assured that not alone will I avail of every opportunity to follow the whole area of convergence but the Minister for Finance at the meeting of ECOFIN will do so also.  It is an important matter to be followed up in Ireland's interest and, indeed, in the interests of the Community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach expect that Denmark and the United Kingdom will have ratified the Maastricht Treaty by the time of that meeting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>One would hope the Danish people will vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; on this occasion.  That is a matter for them.  I would not speculate on when the British Parliament will finalise ratification of the Maastricht Treaty.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is too early to speculate on what may or may not happen <Col N="947" /> in the House of Commons or what the agenda for the meeting at the end of June may contain.</P>

      <P>If the Social Chapter is incorporated &mdash; I am not too sure what the Taoiseach's attitude would be to that &mdash; would that require a further review of the Treaty by this House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Does the Taoiseach think the Department of Foreign Affairs should have a central role as we progress towards economic and monetary union or is he of the view that there is sufficient expertise in the Department of Finance to carry out the negotiations on behalf of the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy is aware of the various ministries for foreign affairs throughout the Community play their own role in the lead up to any European Council meeting and that includes the general affairs meeting preceding it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the major unemployment crisis facing Europe, and the long term unemployment crisis facing many homes in Europe, would the Taoiseach use his position to encourage the Danish Presidency to hold a special EC Heads of State meeting to tackle this serious problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have raised the very serious question of unemployment not alone in Ireland but throughout the Community at the Birmingham Summit.  A special initiative was taken at the Edinburgh Summit.  I will avail of an early meeting with the Danish Prime Minister to discuss that matter.  It is a very serious problem not alone here but throughout the Community where projections are that approximately 17 million people will be out of work by the end of this year. That is a matter that has to be tackled by <Col N="948" /> the Community working together. Arrangements are being finalised for an early meeting between the Danish Prime Minister and myself in Dublin and I will raise that matter with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that it is necessary for the European Community to reaffirm its commitment to the whole concept of European Union and all that goes with it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not regard that as necessary.  We are all committed to it. Chancellor Kohl said the other day that in his view, if necessary, the ten members should go ahead if the other two members decided not to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is wonderful; it is very comforting to hear that.  Would the Taoiseach not agree that the chairing of Cabinet meetings in the absence of the Taoiseach, and the other matters to which the Taoiseach has drawn attention, represents the full constitutional extent of the Tánaiste's functions?</P>

In relation to the designated joint responsibilities, when the official weekly <Col N="950" /> briefing of political correspondents resumes, is it proposed that these will be joint briefings with both the Taoiseach and Tánaiste present or when the Taoiseach is sick or absent from the country will the Tánaiste do the briefings?</P>

      <i>Notes:</i>
    </P>
    <P>1.  It is expected that the timelag for publication of the 1991 Volume 1 details will be the same as that indicated for 1986.</P>
    <P>2.  The variation in the timelags shown reflects:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="952" /> (a)  the staff resources devoted to the production of the census results; and</P>
    <P>(b)  the strategy adopted in the overall processing of the census, particularly regarding the balance between the finalisation of detailed and summary results.</P>
    <P>3.  In response to use demand, the emphasis in the 1986 and 1991 censuses was placed on finalising basic demographic details (i.e. age, sex, marital status, household size and composition) as early as possible and publishing these in local population reports on a county by county basis as soon as they were available. This strategy has been favourably received by general census users but has had an adverse effect on the publication timelag for the Volume 1 report.</P>
    <P>4.  Preliminary population headcounts at the level of urban and rural district were published within three months of taking the 1991 census. The corresponding preliminary DED figures were made available on demand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister of State agree that a timelag of almost two years in the disaggregation of this data is very hard to explain in the light of the availability to the Central Statistics Office of much more advanced information technology and data processing technology than was available at the time the State was founded?  It would appear census data was available as quickly, if not more quickly, than it is now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The timelag to which I referred is approximately the same as it was between 1986 and 1991.  It is in line, as the Deputy will see from the Official Report, with previous experience.  The average timelag is about 21-22 months going back to 1926.  As I outlined in my reply, the people taking the census were also engaged in taking a census of agriculture. Further, in response to user <Col N="953" /> demand, the emphasis in the 1986 and 1991 censuses was placed on finalising basic demographic details, that is, age, sex, marital status, household size and composition as early as possible and publishing these in local population reports on a county by county basis as soon as they were available.  That strategy has been welcomed and received very favourably by census users.  In that context the timelag is reasonable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister explain whether the Central Statistics Office use computers for disaggregating this data?  If so, how much have they spent on computers?  If they have spent money on computers why does it still take them as long to disaggregate this data as it took in 1926?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 6 together.</P>
      <P>Regulations to give effect to Directive 90/313/EEC on the freedom of access to information on the environment will be made in the near future under section 110 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992.  I intend that detailed guidance notes on the new arrangements will also be made available.  In the interim, my Department has requested public authorities by circular letter to comply with the provisions of the directive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that this directive was adopted during the last Irish Presidency of the European Community? Is he further aware that the deadline for applying this directive in the member states was at the end of 1992? It seems the Minister is taking a rather relaxed view of that.  Could the Minister explain why the Government, or indeed <Col N="955" /> his Department, is citing a provision of that directive to resist giving information to the public about matters that are of direct public concern, even though the directive is not yet in force?</P>

      <P>In regard to the first part of the Deputy's question, I have, by circular letter, informed the local authorities of the necessity to comply with the directive.  There was, of course, a little intervening matter which delayed some of my work in the latter part of last year. For a fleeting moment I thought perhaps even Deputy Dukes might be taking my place.  The Deputy will be happy to know that of the total of 91 mainland environmental directives, 77 have been transposed into Irish legislation.  A number of the remainder do not apply to Ireland.</P>
      <P>In relation to the final part of the question, the directive provides for refusals where there are unreasonable demands or unfinished documents; in other words, where the work has not been completed and that would be quite normal.  In all other cases my attitude is to be as open as possible.  This is a first tentative step. The Deputy rightly said it was sponsored during the Irish Presidency.</P>

      <asker>Mr. Dukes</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for the Environment</askee>
      <Quest>his views on the European Parliament's proposal for a ban on EC exports of waste, including dangerous re-cycled materials, to countries other than OECD countries which are parties to the Basle Convention; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>
      </QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>An EC Regulation on transboundary waste shipments was adopted on 1 February 1993.  The regulation does not reflect the opinion of the European Parliament that exports of waste for recovery should be limited to OECD countries which are parties to the Basle Convention.  Subject to a review by 1996, it permits such exports on a wider basis, but in accordance with conditions which fully respect the Basle Convention.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the new EC Regulation represent the balance of views within the Community on a series of complex arrangements necessary to permit implementation of the Basle Convention. While Ireland does not export waste beyond the EC/EFTA region, and could have accepted a more restrictive export regime, we have joined in the consensus for the new regulation in the wider interests of accelerating ratification of the Basle Convention by the Community and its member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that it is, to say the least, cynical of the European Community, if not immoral, to allow the export of waste to countries that have not signed the Basle Convention and that have no provisions in their national law or in their national administrations for dealing with the <Col N="958" /> waste in question?  Is the Minister aware that member states are now exporting highly toxic waste to countries in East Africa where the very existence of that waste cannot subsequently be determined and where there are no facilities for treating it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>As I explained, Ireland did not advocate the inclusion of this facility in the new regulation but it is in accordance with the Basle Convention, the main purpose of which is to regulate and control the movement of waste both within the Community and outside.  The Deputy will also be aware that the key safeguards which are now being established in a wider way to control hazardous waste &mdash; that is waste for recycling or recovery &mdash; are much stronger now and cover a range of controls which will provide for the type of safeguards which he is seeking and to which I also subscribe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister explain why Ireland has adopted this view and departed so far from a position of principle? Does he agree that the terms of this regulation leave the field wide open to the commercial exploitation of the environment of very vulnerable States by unscrupulous firms within the European Community?</P>
      <P>Is the framing of this regulation not in direct contravention of a very specific recommendation adopted at the Rio de Janeiro summit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Deputy.  Deputy Dukes is missing the point.  One of the purposes of the Basle Convention is to control the management of hazardous waste in developing countries. The key safeguards in terms of transparency, compliance with multilateral, bilateral or other agreements that would have to be put in place in tandem with the Basle Convention are quite new and regulatory and will be enforced.  The question of international facilities in an economic sense that are available for the management of hazardous waste and the re-use of the raw material is a significant factor in some places where there are <Col N="959" /> good facilities for that purpose.  We are not departing from any principle.  One could hold out in negotiations for extreme positions which would, in effect, mean that the Convention would not be ratified.  While neither we nor the Commission advocated this change there were countries who would not be a party to the overall agreement unless these facilities could be provided.  In the interests of consensus and getting the control measures which will follow from that Convention in the context of the developing countries it was felt judicious to go ahead.</P>

Would the Minister agree that the fact that this European Community action which is limited in scope to the countries that have signed the Basle Convention represents nothing more and nothing less than a very cynical expression by the European Community of the nimby principle, not in my back yard?  In other words, the countries to the Basle Convention are very concerned not to have this waste dumped in their countries but they could not give a damn about what happens in Africa.</P>

      <Quest>if the Government is considering any proposals for expanded employment by local authorities in view of the growing unemployment crisis; if his attention has been drawn to claims made by a person (details supplied) that the loss of 3,500 jobs in local authorities has created major gaps in their ability to provide services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The reduction in local authority employment referred to was in manual grades and the bulk of it occurred as a result of the application of the voluntary redundancy early retirement scheme under which local authorities offered the terms of the redundancy package to staff.  The level of employment in manual grades required by local authorities to maintain services is a matter for the authorities themselves.</P>
      <P>A number of initiatives involving local authorities should lead to additional employment this year. These include the substantial increase in the public capital programme, which will lead to additional employment on roads, housing and sanitary services schemes; increased funding of social employment schemes, of which local authorities are substantial sponsors; and the development of projects under the county enterprise partnership boards, on which local authorities will be represented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that the haemorrhage of jobs from local authorities over the past five years, at around 3,500 or the equivalent of three Digitals, is a gross addition to the level of unemployment here?  Would he accept that it would make better sense for the State to invest in the restoration of these <Col N="962" /> jobs and the improvement in services that those jobs would produce than by relying on temporary employment, casual employment schemes and other measures which are a poor substitute for properly paid permanent employment in local authorities?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore is correct. The figures were of that order over the past five or six years primarily in 1988, and in the first half of 1989, under the voluntary redundancy schemes.  It was entirely a matter for the management of local authorities to decide who should and could avail of that scheme.  I am sure, in relation to the activities of the local authorities, decisions were taken where they could afford them and where that option was possible.  It is clear now that arising from the public capital programme increase of 14 per cent, £154 million, the announcement in relation to public housing starts and the social housing increase of £10 million, employment in these and related areas will be considerbly enhanced this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that employment as a result of the increase in the public capital programme will arise mainly in the form of contracts undertaken by local authorities and will not result in increased direct employment in the carrying out of normal local authority services where the 3,500 jobs were lost?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>

Will he agree that it is very poor value for public money having regard to the social welfare payments which are paid, the loss in tax revenue and the expenditure on social employment schemes not to have people employed by local authorities?</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the exceptional difficulties being experienced by local people applying for planning permission for dwelling houses for members of their families in Connemara and the Aran Islands because of the new SR6 regulations applying for septic tanks and percolation areas; the steps, if any, he will take to assist low-income families to meet these requirements; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there may be difficulties with the use of septic tanks and percolation systems in parts of County Galway.  However, <Col N="965" /> Standard Recommendation S.R.6: 1991 is a very important measure for controlling water pollution and protecting public health.  Local authorities were asked in January 1992 to give due recognition in their development plans to the standard and to ensure that the design and location of septic tanks were in conformity with it.  It is a matter for each local authority, having regard to the circumstances of each case, to take whatever action they consider necessary to comply with this request.</P>
      <P>Sewerage grants of up to £500 for houses on the mainland and £750 for houses on certain Gaeltacht islands are available from the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht for the provision of individual sewerage systems to qualified applicants in Gaeltacht areas, which would include Connemara and the Aran Islands.</P>
      <P>The group sewerage grants scheme administered by my Department provides grants of up to £500 per house on the mainland and £750 per house on off-shore islands for approved sewage disposal systems where two or more households get together to provide sewerage facilities and where no such facilities exist or existing facilities are seriously deficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does not seem to be aware of the seriousness of the position.  Everybody recognises the need for a proper sewage disposal system for each house and there is no complaint about that.  The difficulty is &mdash; I do not know if the Minister is aware of this &mdash; the cost of meeting the SR6 requirements in many cases in the Connemara region and the Aran Islands because of the terrain is excessive and beyond the financial ability of the families there.  The grant scheme the Minister mentioned is a group sewerage scheme which very few people have been able to avail of and would be of no benefit to the families I mentioned. I am asking the Minister to introduce a new grant.  Not many people would call for this but in areas where there is very wet boggy land there is no way one can pass the SR6 requirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="966" /> No houses will be built in those areas unless some facility is given to enable these people meet the requirements which can be done sometimes by importing soil and so on.  Puraflo, the Board na Móna system, costs £3,000.  A small householder in Connemara would not be able to pay that.</P>

      <P>As I said, there are grants available to individual houses, £500 on the mainland and £750 on the Aran Islands.  These grants are available for these areas in recognition of their special needs.  As regards Galway, the houses the Deputy is talking about could not be built under the old regulations because there were no suitable sites for septic tank disposal.  That is why houses were not built under the old section 4 system in Galway.  The Deputy will agree with the desirable tightening up of safeguards to prevent pollution of ground water. Systems to prevent pollution are relatively expensive.  The cost of the Bord na Móna system for a single house is £2,500. But in the context of the type of bungalows in Connemara, it would be a very small percentage of the total cost of a house.  I agree that there are families who need to house themselves and the local authority have various ways of assisting them in that regard.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that because of the lack of top soil in Connemara it is now impossible to meet the SR6 requirements for septic tanks?  Is the Minister aware that before the SR6 regulation was enforced in 1992 many septic tanks were properly constructed in Connemara above ground and without percolation areas and that they have been working perfectly for 15 and 20 years?  Will the Minister consider advising Galway County Council to ease the regulations for the Connemara area? Is the Minister further aware that the <Col N="967" /> type of housing to which he referred in Connemara is built by wealthy outsiders from Dublin and the Minister's county who can afford the £2,500 for a purification system or can import top soil to make the soil comply with the SR6 regulation?  Will the Minister agree that this is serious discrimination against the local people in Connemara who wish to provide houses for themselves and their families?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The SR6 1991 replaces and updates the 1975 standard recommendation, the new standard is not more onerous than the 1975 standard. Measures of a technical nature are available to comply with this, and they are not expensive.  Deep ploughing, for example, usually gets over the problem in Connemara. There is not a big change between the old regulations and the new, and their purpose is to retain the purity of ground water.  There has been very serious pollution of ground water used for private and public consumption.  It can often appear to be clear and pure when in fact it is unfit for human consumption arising from septic tank pollution.</P>

I am not asking for any diminution in the standards. They are necessary but if we ask poor people to meet high standards outside their cost range they will not be able to build houses or will not get planning permission.  Will the Minister look seriously at this issue to see if some financial assistance can be introduced?  It will not cost a huge amount of money because the number of houses being built in these areas is small.  Will the Minister agree, that the Bord an Móna Puraflow system should be made available at a subsidised cost to these people to enable them to build houses for their families because, otherwise, they will be forced to emigrate?  They cannot build in their own locality.  Outsiders are building houses because they can afford the cost of meeting the requirements.</P>

      <P>The Programme for a Partnership Government contains a commitment to start the implementation of key elements of the strategy recommended by the Dublin Transportation Initiative.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The interim recommendations are interlocking and complementary and it would not be wise at this very early stage to separate them.  They embrace a very comprehensive range of activities which involve upgrading public transport, completion of the southern and northern ring, the southern motorway, very much improved traffic management and calming measures in residential areas, and facilities for cyclists, pedestrians and disabled people. We have to try to approach this on the basis of the elements of this package which can be fitted into the national plan for submission to Brussels for funds.  It is the first time we have had the analyses and the type of proposals which can be implemented, backed by the Commission, the transport agencies and the Government with clear signs of a very definite commitment to very substantial investment in all these areas.  I will not at this early stage, as I await the final report and the preparation of that plan, start sectorising and breaking out the different components, because they interlock.  It is very important to get the maximum resources possible.  Of course the Deputy will be aware that the interim measures proposed by the DTI would mean, over a period of years, expenditure running into several hundred millions of pounds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>We all have a fair idea of what is in the Dublin transport initiative. I am seeking to establish some idea of the Government's intention with regard to its implementation.  I specifically asked the Minister, and I am asking him again, to give some indication to the House as to the size of investment he anticipates in the lifetime of this Government, the size of funding he anticipates he will be drawing down from the European Community in relation to that investment and, without necessarily splitting <Col N="971" /> one part or another, the extent, if any, of light rail provision that will be provided.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>When the interim report was handed to me, I indicated in the firmest way possible the clear Government intention to implement as far as physically and financially possible the main recommendations of the Dublin Transportation Initiative.  To go further than that is unreal at a stage when we have to complete that report and submit it as part of a plan to the EC to draw down Structural Funds.  It will go into multi millions of pounds.  The type of resources available now at Community level backed up by national support and agreed by the transport agencies and the public as a whole will be necessary to deal with the choking traffic problems of the city and with environmental questions arising from that.  There will be very substantial investment made over the next four or five years.  It is not fair to talk about specific figures at a preliminary stage before we submit the plan.</P>

He is probably not prepared to speculate on a six months basis and I accept that.</P>
      <P>The lack of a proper transport system is destroying any plans that were in place for the development of three towns in County Dublin.

Would he agree that people trying to get through the city ought to be encouraged to travel by rail and furthermore that Swords should be tied in with the airport for that reason, otherwise people there would have to travel far west before coming back into the south of the city through the Northern cross?</P>

      <P>We are all concerned to find solutions to access to the port.  We need to take heavy vehicle traffic off the main streets. The port's economic prospects have been somewhat enhanced in recent times.  The port is a very important element of the commercial life of the city and needs to be able to breathe freely.  The solution to access to the port is one of the areas where I have asked the DTI to come forward with definite proposals in the near future.

      <P>Does the Minister intend publishing a comprehensive plan setting out the proposals it is intended to fund from the Structural and Cohesion Funds when they become available in regard to transport policy?  Will this plan contain expenditure to meet the transport needs of other parts of the country, as well as the urgent needs of the Dublin area? <Col N="975" /> From the major announcements made at Government level, one gets the impression that a very large percentage of the Structural Funds are being committed to one region whereas there are major problems in other areas.</P>

      <P>The question relates to the Dublin Transportation Initiative but I appreciate Deputy Molloy's point.  He can be sure that as we move towards the final stages of the development of the plan the consultation taking place in all the regions will result in concrete and definite proposals for the country as a whole.  I made a public statement last September or October in relation to some of the western routes that have to be developed.  Needless to say, it will not only be comprehensive in terms of Dublin city but will take account of the agricultural, tourism, commercial and industrial needs of the country as a whole, as far as we can afford it.</P>

      <P>Many people would agree that our government system is very much over centralised.  There is a great need to build up tiers of local government which have a stronger base, are more autonomous and, as a result, more resposible and develop in time the resources necessary to develop at local level.  The local government system is very often too cluttered up and not anything like as regional as it could and should be to allow more time at central level for the wider questions.</P>

      <P>There is a fundamental need to make that transfer from central Government to suitably developed local government systems.

Could the Minister assure me that the new structures and functions will not lead to an unnecessary layer of <Col N="980" /> bureaucracy?  I further ask the Minister why neither of his Ministers of State is involved in the sub-committee.

The Government take overall responsibility and the local authorities have authority for real manoeuvre within agreed allocations.

      <P>I am not able to give a definite answer in this regard.  My view would be that by the time we have completed <Col N="981" /> the general examination of the structures for the future, it may well be that Dublin will be excluded because of the major changes taking place and the need to get these new authorities up and going.  It may be that the proposition for Dublin as outlined by the Deputy may not proceed in tandem, but it is early days yet.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 17, 139, 160 and 186 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="982" /> It is at the absolute discretion of each local authority to decide whether charges for services in its area are to be levied and the scale of any such charges.  I have no function in relation to the exercise of that discretion.  I have no doubt, however, that the elected members, in considering their annual estimates of expenses, have careful regard to the needs of their area, the level and the range of services to be provided and all the sources of revenue, including charges, available to finance those services. Amendment of the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 2) Act, 1983 is not necessary to allow elected members to decide not to levy charges.</P>
    <P>Almost all local authorities currently charge for domestic services and have done so in successive years in order to provide and maintain the range of services which they consider appropriate.  It is also apparent that the collection levels of those charges are well up to expectations in most cases, while persons on low incomes benefit from the comprehensive waiver schemes operated at local level.  In these circumstances, I do not accept that the discretionary power of local authorities to levy charges should be abolished by legislation.</P>
    <P>I am considering the findings of the report by the Institute of Fiscal Studies on rate support grant distribution.  This report was published last May and sent to each local authority for their views. The report is complex and technical.  It outlines equalisation models, based on various assumptions, in an effort to make it possible to compare the effects of a range of possible indicators for the distribution of the rate support grant by reference to needs and resources.  The report is based on the use of statistical techniques and their application to selected criteria.  A number of grant distribution options which were examined in the study suggest significant redistribution of the rate support grant between authorities&mdash;some would stand to gain as in the case of Cork Corporation and others stand to lose.  The implications have to be carefully examined before deciding on the feasibility and desirability <Col N="983" /> of adopting one or other of the options suggested by the IFS or any other option of this kind.</P>
    <P>At this stage, observations have been received from most local authorities and these are being examined.  Some local authorities favour the implementation of the recommendations in one form or other, while other local authorities are wholly opposed.  Not surprisingly, this polarisation of views is related to the predicted outcome of a redistribution of the grant allocations as outlined in the report.  Local authorities who might stand to have their grant allocations reduced have put forward a wide range of views on the perceived inadequacy of the report's findings and these views will have to be fully considered.</P>
    <P>Many local authorities have suggested that the report's findings, which are based on analysis of the 1991 spending estimates, need to be tested on more than one year's spending patterns to establish conclusive indications of the extent of redistribution that might arise.  I agree with this view and have asked my Department to run a further analysis of the distribution criteria by reference to the 1993 local authority estimates which have recently been adopted.  In the meantime it is not proposed to formulate legislative or other proposals on matters affected by the report.</P>

      <P>With regard to local service charges, does the Minister recall that on the last occasion this question was raised in this House it was asked by his Minister of State, who found that kind of reply to be so unsatisfactory that he was asked to leave the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the funding of local authorities generally, will he clarify if the extent of Government thinking on the funding of local authorities is simply confined to the distribution of the inadequate overall rate support grant for local authorites? Has he any intention of making a statement or announcement on the overall question of the funding of local authorites, particularly with regard to the source of local authority funds and the <Col N="984" /> amount of money that is available to local authorities?</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take these Private Notice Questions together.</P>
      <P>Those who knew Valerie Place, those who met her in Somalia, and those who saw the poignant film of her at work on television last night, will have been struck by her obvious dedication to helping others and her selfless commitment to the people of Somalia.  Deep anger &mdash; outrage &mdash; must be our feelings at the callous murder of one who had already given so much and had so much more to give.</P>
      <P>Yesterday I visited Valerie Place's family to convey my own and the Government's deep regret and sympathy.  I am sure that all Members of the House will join me in expressing our condolences to Ms Place's family and to her colleagues in Concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Valerie Place's death, and that last month of Sean Devereux, highlight the great difficulties facing aid workers in Somalia and the dangers to which they are exposed.  Following Mr. Devereux's death the Government raised with the European Community, the UN and the United States the question of the safety of the aid community.  We had hoped that the dispatch of the 30,000 strong Unified <Col N="988" /> Task Force would stabilise security in Somalia and reduce the risks to aid workers.  Unfortunately it appears that the bandits who used to attack the aid supplies have turned their attention to aid workers, both Somali and foreign.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Government decided to again approach the United Nations, which authorised the dispatch of the Unified Task Force in Somalia, and the United States, which is in charge of the Force, to reiterate our concerns about safety, to review security in Somalia and to seek greater protective measures.  I have asked the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Tom Kitt, to take up these questions with the UN and US authorities as a matter of urgency.  He will have discussions in Washington and New York tomorrow.</P>
    <P>In the absence of any national authority in Somalia we are also asking UNITAF to investigate and report on the circumstances of Ms Place's killing.</P>
    <P>At home I met today representatives from Concern, GOAL, Trócaire and the Irish Red Cross to review security and to discuss the additional protective measures that might be taken. We all agreed that, while in the present conditions it is not possible to provide complete protection, further steps can and should be taken to enable aid volunteers to carry out their work in greater security.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, will put proposals to the UN and the US tomorrow.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that the Government view the killing of Valerie Place with the utmost concern.  We owe it to the memory of Valerie Place and to the many Irish men and women who give selflessly of themselves in the service of humanity, to explore every possibility to provide the maximum degree of security and protection while they carry out their work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Tánaiste agree with me that the only real practical hope of ensuring safety for people like Valerie Place in future is to insist that some steps be taken by the United Nations to disarm the bandits and that we cannot allow the situation to go on where armed elements co-exist with the UN force in Somalia?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>If one were able to achieve the disarmament of the bandits one would obviously reduce the risks and the dangers.  That will be part of the approach that we will be making to the United Nations.  There are other practical measures which we might be able to implement and one is to look at the method of travel used by aid workers in Somalia.  That is something we are reviewing.  In the course of my discussions with the agencies, we looked at that and some alternative proposals put forward.  We will raise those tomorrow in New York.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Fine Gael, I offer my condolences to the family of Valerie Place and her colleagues on her tragic death.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most people who know the situation in Somalia believe that there will not be peace unless there is complete disarmament. Arising from that, does the Tánaiste think that the number of troops there at the moment, mainly US troops, are trying to complete disarmament and are capable of doing it?  Secondly, would he also accept that a major problem arises from the import of the drug quat and is he aware of any steps to ensure that those imported supplies are stopped?  Can he outline how many aid workers are there? He made a statement that the 33,000 UN troops from the US would not be sufficient to provide security for them. Why does he say that?  How many troops does he think would be necessary?  Is there a case for having Irish troops serving <Col N="990" /> under a UN flag there?  In a sort of doomsday situation, have they thought ultimately of withdrawing or encouraging the agencies to withdraw our aid workers if sufficient security is not provided?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of disarming the bandits and bringing about a peaceful resolution to the conflict has to be the prime aim of any policy in relation to Somalia.  It is difficult to see what progress is being made at present.  In the course of our discussions with the United Nations and the United States tomorrow we will be looking at the policy imperatives and the options for the 30,000 troops in Somalia.  There is obviously a major problem, in relation to drugs.  I do not have information whether it is increasing or decreasing but it is something we can try to get information on.</P>
      <P>On the question of the troops providing complete security, as a concept I am not sure there is any such thing as complete security.  Improvements can be brought about in relation to the level of security.  There is the question of convoys travelling between towns, with protection or otherwise, and the question of an alternative method of travel, particularly light aircraft, which would reduce these journeys to 40 minutes from a number of hours and would I hope also be far safer.</P>
      <P>Withdrawing the aid workers is something I hope we do not have to look at in the short term.  In the course of our discussions, the prime aim has to be to increase protection and security of the aid workers.  That may be something we may have to look at down the line.</P>

      <P>I join the Tánaiste and other Deputies in conveying my condolences and those of my party colleagues to the family of Valerie Place and in paying tribute to her courage in taking on such a task at such a young age. I pay tribute not only to the Irish aid <Col N="991" /> workers but to all the aid workers who continue to work in Somalia in such risky conditions.  Would the Minister agree with the criticism that has been made that the United Nations has not given security of aid workers the priority it deserves and that this is an issue which he will be arranging for the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, to raise with the United Nations in his discussions with them?</P>
      <P>Has the question of Irish troops been considered?  One aid agency indicated that they thought that might be an option, while another felt that it was not a practical option.  Could the Minister indicate if the Irish Government has looked at that option and their view of it?  Has the Minister taken up with John O'Shea of GOAL the point raised by him that aid workers have to pay up to $100 a day to armed individuals and members of these gangs, for their protection?  Surely, this is not an adequate way in which to pursue this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I could link the Deputy's first and last questions as they are quite close.  From the information I have to hand the United Nations would not appear to be giving priority to the protection of aid workers.  That is a matter we will discuss with them as a matter of urgency.  Mr. O'Shea in the course of our discussions today and previously has brought up the question of money being paid to gangs for protection.  That is not satisfactory, and we are setting out to eliminate it.  It comes back to the question of the security of the aid workers.  There is a role for the United Nations in that respect.  That is what we are going to discuss with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the question of Irish troops, last November the previous Government made a decision to provide a transport contingent to serve with the United Nations observer mission in Somalia.  That was to comprise of 60 personnel from the Defence Forces.  Meanwhile the preparation of the observer mission was suspended and the United States was authorised by the Security <Col N="992" /> Council to send in their troops to provide a secure environment for humanitarian relief operations in Somalia.  That force is currently operating there.  Discussions are taking place at the United Nations in relation to replacing UNITAF with a United Nations force established by the Security Council, and that is something I would welcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I join other Deputies in the expressions of sympathy to the family and friends of Valerie Place and to Fr. Aengus Finucane and the other staff of Concern.  Fr. Finucane was in one of the vehicles in the convoy when Valerie Place was shot dead.  Would the Tánaiste not agree that the problem seems to relate to the terms of reference under which the 30,000 UN troops are deployed in Somalia?  Their two jobs are to confiscate the weapons&mdash;they are not doing a very good job on that &mdash; and to escort only the food convoys.  Would the Tánaiste not agree that a section of that 30,000 troop must be deployed to each of the agencies working there so that every journey can be protected by some of those UN troops?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion made by the Deputy in relation to the deployment of troops is a very valuable one which we will be discussing with the United Nations tomorrow in New York.  It is a question of ensuring that the troops are put to the best use and are deployed to protect our aid workers.  The protection to date has not been adequate and that has to be remedied as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Dempsey) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take these two questions together.</P>
      <P>My understanding is that the Civil and Public Services Union objects to changed arrangements for the reporting of proceedings in the Houses of the Oireachtas which were decided upon by management of the Houses before the summer recess and that the union takes the view that its members have to be compensated for such changes.  I recognise that where changes have immediate and adverse effects upon the working conditions or remuneration of staff, steps may need to be taken which minimise any adverse impact which they may have on serving staff and in that context the Department has indicated to the union and to the authorities in Leinster House my willingness to meet, to a substantial degree, the union's concerns.  However, in addition to what I would see as the legitimate concerns of the staff in question in relation to location, continuation of payments paid to them for the specific duties involved and access to a new grade, the union has insisted on and taken action on foot of its claim that ten existing posts of clerical assistant should be upgraded to clerical officer.  The union have, I understand, made it clear, both formally and informally, that a settlement which does not involve an upgrading element is not acceptable to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from any other consideration, I do not regard the question of upgradings as being related to the present dispute. In taking this action the union is well aware that discussions under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i><Col N="994" /> for the restructuring of Civil Service grades, which includes discussion on the future of both the clerical assistant and clerical officer grades, has been initiated on a Civil Service wide basis.  I regard the maintenance of good staff relations in this House as essential to its smooth running. It is, however, equally essential that no union be given encouragement to take action affecting the House in relation to matters for which another mechanism of discussion and negotiation exists.</P>
    <P>Because of the publicity which has been given to those involved in this dispute, I wish to put on record the demands made by the union and the responses already made to them.  The union asked that staff currently serving as audio typists in the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas would not, following the introduction of the transcriber grade, be redeployed to other Departments.  The union were informed that the staff in question would not be compulsorily redeployed. The union complained that the establishment of a transcriber grade would result in the elimination of the grade of trainee reporter for which, since its inception, many of their members had competed successfully.  My Department agreed to the establishment of a trainee transcriber grade and to the the selection of three audio typists for appointment to it later this year.  The union sought a guarantee that at least 12 appointments to that grade would be made over the next five years.  Since the rate of vacancies in the transcriber grade over that period cannot be predicted my Department was unable to enter into such a commitment.  The union sought agreement that the allowance paid to its members in addition to their clerical assistant salary for the performing of audio typist duties would be continued. The union has been informed that the staff involved will not be at any monetary loss.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his detailed reply but does he not acknowledge that, by any outside comparison, to have these people on the lowest possible Civil Service grade is not <Col N="995" /> commensurate with the calibre of job that is required from them?  Does he not acknowledge that it is regrettable that this ought to have reached the stage of a full blown dispute?  Does not the sight of pickets outside Leinster House set an appalling headline for industrial relations outside the House?  Is the Minister aware that the union concerned are prepared to accept the intervention of a third party and that the official side will not accede to a third party intervening in the dispute?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the Deputy's final point the conciliation and arbitration scheme is the system in operation in relation to disputes of this kind and the official side has no difficulty with that.  I regret that anybody would find it necessary to picket Leinster House.  The Minister and the Department have been very forthcoming in relation to meeting the union's demands.  The matter in relation to payments and so on is under discussion.  A useful purpose is not being served by anybody marching up and down outside.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I put it to the Minister of State that this dispute, together with the difficulties arising from Oireachtas Members' secretaries in recent times, has added to the general air of inefficiency and incompetence which pervades this House.  I further put it to the Minister that before launching into a debate on reform of procedures here last week, he should have at least put the mechanisms in place with the staff, to ensure that there were staff willing and able to carry out the reforms once they were put in place.</P>

      <P>The position as I understand it is as follows.  The individuals concerned made a transit stop in Shannon <i>en route</i> to the United States and were apparently refused pre-entry <Col N="997" /> clearance by the United States immigration authorities in Shannon.  The normal situation in cases of this type is for the carrier to transport the individuals involved back to their place of embarkation.</P>
      <P>While arrangements were being made for their return they were apparently advised of their right to apply for political asylum in the State.  In order to clarify the matter however an officer of the Department of Justice travelled to Shannon airport this morining to interview the individuals concerned and to clarify whether they are seeking refugee status.</P>

The Government agreed last week that this debate, which is a normal Private Members' Time debate, be taken over two days.  The importance of this subject and the concern of the people of Galway about possible job losses in this major industry is such that the Dáil should allow two day's debate.</P>
      <P>The Government should not take the exceptional step of confining a Private Members' motion to one day, as it is proposing to do in this case particularly in view of the fact that it agreed last week that Private Members' time would be taken today and tomorrow.</P>

      <P>At last Wednesday's meeting of the Whips, we agreed to the structure of this week's Private Members' Time.  As the budget debate is tomorrow, it was agreed by all concerned that the second portion of Private Members' time would be taken from 12 p.m. tomorrow until 1.30 p.m., concluding with a vote. The motion to be debated was not presented to the Whips' meeting.  This morning I informed the Government and the Whips' office of our intention to pursue our right in Private Members' time to debate this matter today and tomorrow.  Notwithstanding that, the Government Whip was prepared to concede extra time this evening, I regard this as a gross interference by a Government with the largest majority in the history of the State in a fundamental right of an Opposition party, namely interference in our Private Members' time.  As such we object most strenuously to this.</P>

      <P>Consequently, we are not interfering with the Fine Gael time, <Col N="1199" /> or that party's right to put down a Private Members' motion.  I am sure the Deputies opposite are only too well aware that similar matters have arisen in the past which were postponed for a week when they had not been disposed of on a Wednesday evening.  The time given over to Private Members' time is three hours.  We are providing three hours for Fine Gael.  Any curtailment of time this evening is being compensated in Government time.  If the Opposition parties want more time we do not have any problem with that.  That is the position.  I regret they do not see it the way we do.</P>
      <P>I also offered a four-hour-debate, after which a decision would be taken.  We do not see a debate this evening as improving our position, which should be the intention of everyone.  It is a matter of national interest.  At this late stage if the Opposition still wish to go ahead with the debate I see no reason why the debate cannot be completed this evening.  Anything that could be said tomorrow morning could be said this evening.  If the Opposition require more time and if they wish to preserve their Private Members' time for something else, we are prepared to provide Government time for a full debate whenever a decision is taken.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach seems to have forgotten that one of the reasons Ireland has been so successful in attracting foreign industry is that this is a parliamentary democracy.  There is not one party rule.  That is one of the reasons so many industries have felt secure here. For the Taoiseach to suggest it would only be appropriate for the Dáil to discuss this issue after the decision has already been taken betrays his inadequate understanding of the national interest.  It is <Col N="1200" /> important that all Members in this House should have an opportunity to express their concern about this matter so that they might influence the decision.  The only way that can happen is if the debate takes place before the decision is taken and not afterwards as the Government seem to want.  There is a strong case for having a two-day debate because it would allow Opposition and other Deputies an opportunity to reflect on whatever the Minister might say tonight and respond in as constructive a fashion as possible tomorrow.  That is why we want a two-day and not a compressed one-day debate.  For that reason I must press my amendment.  I do not regard the Government's attempt to compress this into a one-day debate as satisfactory in view of the seriousness of the issue and also because this is a Fine Gael motion in Fine Gael time.  It is not Government business.</P>

It was pointed out that such a motion would be discussed one week after a detailed two-day debate on the matter in the Dail and that they might wish to reconsider.  On Friday the Government Whip's office was informed that a motion on crime was to be put down.  On Monday morning when the Government Whip's office asked for a copy of the crime motion it was imformed that a motion on Digital in the names of Deputies Richard Bruton and Pádraig McCormack would be put down within five minutes.

      <P>&ldquo;I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that Bord Gáis Éireann is now undertaking a project, approved by Government in December 1991, to interconnect the Irish natural gas grid with the high pressure network in the UK by way of a subsea pipeline from north County Dublin to Brighouse Bay in south west Scotland.  This project is being undertaken in the interests of the future development of the natural gas industry in Ireland, in order to provide for secure long term supplies of gas and to afford additional supply security during the remaining life of our two existing indigenous gas fields.</P>
      <P>The interconnector project is a major undertaking which will cost almost £290 million.  Progress to date has been very impressive.  Expenditure on the project up to the end of 1992 was approximately £85 million.  While the cost of the project may appear huge, it pales into insignificance when one considers that, over the lifetime of the pipeline, the value of the gas shipped through it will be many times that figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1207" /> The project consists of four main elements.  These are; a 30-inch pipeline which will run from Moffat in Scotland for 79 kilometres to Brighouse Bay on the Scottish coast; a compressor station to be located on the Scottish coast which will compress the gas for onward transmission to Ireland; a 24-inch subsea pipeline, 200 kilometres in length, which will run from the Scottish coast, across the Irish Sea to the landfall at Loughshinny, near Skerries in County Dublin; and a shore station which will be constructed at Loughshinny from where a 30-inch pipeline will run to Ballough on the Dublin-Dundalk pipeline to connect with the existing Irish grid.</P>
    <P>A number of possible routes were examined at the feasibility study stage and sea surveys were carried out during 1990 and 1991.  The criteria for route selection were technical and economic feasibility.  The route from Loughshinny to Moffat proved to be the best option on both these criteria.</P>
    <P>The compressor can deliver sufficient gas for our needs after Kinsale Head and Ballycotton are depleted.  It is expected that our import requirements will have risen to about 5 billion cubic metres over the next 20 years, if market projections are realised, and through additions to compression, the pipeline will have capacity to meet these requirements.  The current market for gas is about 2 billion cubic metres per year.  The main growth sector we anticipate will be electricity generation.  Gas is an ideal fuel for electricity generation and, with new combined cycle technologies, conversion efficiencies of over 50 per cent are possible.</P>
    <P>Extensive planning and preparatory work has been necessary in advance of the construction phase of the pipeline project which is now ready to commence. All the work of surveying and engineering design has been carried out. Included in this work, going back to 1990, were feasibility studies in relation to both the technical and economic aspects of the project.  There were negotiations with the local and central authorities involved on <Col N="1208" /> both sides of the Irish Sea.  This work was co-ordinated by a small task force comprising officials of my Department together with people from BGE and its project management office.</P>
    <P>Contracts have been awarded for the manufacture and coating of the pipe, for the laying of the subsea-section and for the onshore Scotland section.  Contracts are about to be awarded for the construction of the compressor station and the onshore Ireland leg.</P>
    <P>An agreement with the UK Government on the delimitation of the Continental Shelf in the area through which the pipeline will pass was concluded in 1992, extending further northwards the existing delimitation line, agreed in 1988 between the two jurisdictions.  The necessary designation orders will be made shortly.  This delimitation was a necessary first step to the conclusion of a more detailed pipeline treaty with the UK Government concerning all aspects of the laying and operation of the pipeline between the two countries.  This agreement was negotiated by officials of my Department during 1992.  I hope to obtain Government approval for the text in the near future.  It will then be laid before the Dáil for its approval.  The agreement deals with the routing of the line through Irish and UK waters, including the Isle of Man, construction standards, the issue of authorisations to the operators, joint inspections, safety and pollution control, emergencies, abandonment procedures and consultations between the two Governments.  There will be a commission comprising representatives of each Government to oversee the smooth operation of the pipeline. The agreement also deals with the status of the Isle of Man, through whose territorial waters the line passes.</P>
    <P>The on-shore leg of the pipeline in Scotland has been designed following consultation with the Northern Ireland authorities to cater for the transmission of gas from the British high pressure system to the offtake for the proposed Northern Ireland pipeline from Scotland to Islandmagee in County Antrim.</P>
    <P>I should mention that Bord Gáis <Col N="1209" /> Éireann has been careful to comply fully with EC rules on public procurements by advertising contracts Community-wide. Deputies will understand that in many instances no Irish firm would have been in a position to tender.  This is because of the highly specialised nature of the work which is carried on worldwide by a small number of firms.  A good example would be the pipelaying offshore which requires very large pipelaying vessels.  Nevertheless, a number of Irish firms have been successful in tendering for the less specialised areas and it is expected that in the region of £20 million will be spent in 1993 on Irish goods and services.  The project is on target to meet its completion deadline of October this year and is within budget.</P>
    <P>This Bill is necessary to ensure that the interconnector pipeline is completed on schedule.  The pipeline must be financed, constructed, operated and maintained in a manner that helps to sustain and develop the role of natural gas in Ireland and the provisions of this Bill will ensure that this can be done.  Accordingly, it provides for Bord Gáis Éireann's borrowing requirement and for the application of conditions to be laid down by me relating to the construction and operation of the pipeline during its lifetime. It is essential that these provisions are put in place as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The discovery of natural gas in the Kinsale Head field in the early 1970s, at a time of great volatility in the energy market, was very timely for Ireland as it helped to reduce our exposure to the uncertainties of that market.  From the moment gas came on stream in 1978, successive Governments have striven to ensure that the best use has been made of this indigenous resources.</P>
    <P>Thanks to the efforts of Bord Gáis Éireann we now have a safe, efficient and profitable transmission system, which has made gas available to domestic consumers in many of the urban population centres, to industrial and commercial customers from Cork to Cavan and, of course, to the ESB for electricity generation. The 1992 annual report and accounts of the board are not yet available <Col N="1210" /> but I understand that it has been another profitable and successful year.  In 1991, the board declared a profit of £54.9 million on a turnover of £165.6 million and surrendered £31 million in dividends to the Exchequer.  Sixteen million pounds of Bord Gáis Éireann's turnover in 1991 was accounted for by sales to NET, and while concern has been expressed at the use of indigenous gas for fertiliser production, notably in the Culliton report, a major consideration in any decision on the future of such sales must be whether there is a better alternative.  When the recommendations of the task force on the implementation of the Culliton report have been fully considered, the Government will decide on the issue.  It should be noted that sales to NET are the subject of commercial contracts dating from 1976 to 1987.  Apart from the cost of voiding these contracts, there is a question of employment in the fertiliser industry.</P>
    <P>The level of development of the transmission and distribution infrastructure achieved by Bord Gáis Éireann in such a relatively short time is no mean achievement. Bord Gáis has managed to build up a sizeable customer base.  There are now over 195,000 gas customers, and natural gas currently represents about 17 per cent of our primary energy demand. Natural gas is the dominant fuel for industry within the gas supply area.  In the domestic sector, gas central heating is the first choice for new housing within reach of the network.  Volume sales in that sector increased by some 16 per cent in 1992 and almost 22,500 new central heating customers were connected in that year.  In addition, Bord Gáis Éireann is now well into its major programme to connect non-gas housing estates to the grid, where this is economically viable.</P>
    <P>It is clear, therefore, that natural gas has greatly expanded its role since the days when the only customers were NET and the ESB.  The reasons for this are clear.  It has proved to be a clean, versatile and competitive fuel, transported by pipeline, available on tap and requiring no storage arrangements.  Modern gas-fired plant is very efficient and technology is improving all the time in gas <Col N="1211" /> turbine-powered electricity generation and combined heat and power units in industry.</P>
    <P>Government policy is to ensure that we are not overly dependent on any one energy source or on any one fuel.  An even balance of fuels achieves this and enables us to respond better in times of emergency and crisis.  Most countries have about five primary energy sources&mdash; oil, coal, gas, hydro and nuclear.  We, of course, do not have nuclear but we do have peat.  We import about two thirds of our energy supplies and in turn about two thirds of the imports are oil, either as crude or product.  Because of our development of gas use, our dependence on oil has been greatly reduced, but it still supplies nearly half of our energy needs.  Naturally we wish to use these fuels as efficiently as possible&mdash;hence the emphasis in the Programme for Government on energy efficiency, and also of course on alternatives and renewables. Our indigenous fuels, gas and peat, are produced in about equal amounts. The bulk of both of these fuels is used for electricity generation.  We have taken great care over the last number of years to have as wide a range of fuels as possible for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The use of natural gas has resulted in savings to date of over £2 billion in our bill for imported fuels.  Those who do not benefit directly from availability of natural gas have indirectly shared in the economic rent represented by dividends paid by Bord Gáis Éireann to the Exchequer.  To date Bord Gáis Éireann has contributed over £300 million in this way.  Therefore, gas has become a vital part of our energy and industrial policy and the Government is determined that it will continue as such.</P>
    <P>The environmental benefits of gas are well known.  As the cleanest fossil fuel, increased use of natural gas figures prominently in Ireland's startegy to minimise emissions of harmful gases such as sulphur dioxide and carbon dioxide in line with our international commitments in that regard.  Gas use in urban areas has <Col N="1212" /> also contributed significantly to improved air quality.  It is hoped that over the next 20 years, natural gas will have increased its share of primary energy demand to about 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>It was against the background of a growing natural gas industry, international environmental commitments, yet finite indigenous resources, that the decision to build the Ireland-UK gas interconnector was taken.  This does not imply that the Kinsale Head and Ballycotton gas fields are all that the Irish offshore has to offer in terms of gas supply.  We are still hopeful of further commercial finds.  Indeed, much has been and continues to be done to encourage further exploration for oil and gas in the Irish offshore area.</P>
    <P>In 1991 my predecessor signed an agreement with Marathon Petroleum under which that company agreed to drill seven exploration wells over a five-year period commencing last year.  While the first of those wells was disappointing, I am hopeful of positive results from the rest of the drilling programme.</P>
    <P>At the same time Bord Gáis entered into an agreement with Marathon under which the latter company has installed additional compression on the production platforms which will enable the parties to recover and bring forward in time an additional four billion cubic metres of gas.  This gas, which might not otherwise have been recovered and is equivalent to two years' supply under the existing Kinsale Head contract, will be used in the period to end 1996.  One result of this has been that Bord Gáis will not now require imports of large quantities of gas before 1996.</P>
    <P>The 1992 Finance Act included provisions for the enactment of special petroleum taxation legislation which, for the first time, clarified the tax &ldquo;take&rdquo; from a field development and set it at a level designed to attract exploration investment to Ireland, while ensuring that Ireland would share in the benefits which would arise in the event of another find.</P>
    <P>Another necessary condition to encourage further exploration is the application of modern and progressive <Col N="1213" /> licensing terms for exploration and production activities.  A review of the existing licensing terms, first drawn up in 1975 and amended from time to time, was undertaken by my Department last year. The result of that review was that new licensing terms appropriate for the conditions of today and of the coming years were drawn up and recently launched. This package of measures is designed to bring about further activity in the Irish offshore by making Ireland a worthwhile location for international exploration investment.  I am hopeful that an increased level of exploration activity, as a result of this package, will lead to further commercial finds.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, we must be realistic.  We cannot assume that further indigenous reserves will be identified and brought on stream in time to cater for increased demand and to replace our current supplies as they begin to taper off.  An alternative source is needed to assure supplies long into the future.</P>
    <P>In the event of reserves of gas in excess of our needs being discovered, gas could be exported via the interconnector. This possibility should encourage further exploration and development in our offshore as it opens up a large market to potential developers.</P>
    <P>The existence of the interconnector will see the end of Ireland's isolation as a stand-alone grid, dependent on a single supply pipeline and a single source.  Irish participation in the UK and European gas markets will enable us to enjoy the benefits of greater competition and greater security of supply which the Community's single energy market offers.  The pipeline will earn its keep from day one by providing security against any interruption of supply.  An agreement, completed last year between BGE and National Power in the UK, will give BGE access to supplies at short notice in the event of any interruption in our indigenous supplies.  The agreement is for a five-year period from November this year, by which time it is intended that a longer term supply agreement should have been finalised.  Bord Gáis has already started work in this area.</P>

      <Col N="1214" /> The ESB will require additional volumes of gas during the remainder of the decade.  As things stand, these volumes will have to be imported, and the ESB will need access to the pipeline for that purpose.</P>
    <P>The interconnector project is not only of significance to Ireland but also to the European Community, which sees it as a vital link in the completion of the internal market in energy.  As a result, the European Commission has agreed to grant aid the project at a rate of 35 per cent of approved cost from its REGEN initiative. Among the key objectives for the completion of the internal market in gas were the introduction of a price transparency, rights of transit for large utility companies, and third party access.</P>
    <P>Directives relating to the first two of these are now in place.  Proposals for third party access were not as successful, but it would be my intention that, subject to security of supply, access to available capacity should be afforded to large users such as the ESB and to producers.</P>
    <P>It was open to the ESB to take an equity share in the pipeline.  In the event, however, BGE and the ESB were unable to agree terms for such participation and Bord Gáis is now undertaking the financing of the project itself.  There is, of course, nothing to prevent such a third party from becoming a partner.  For the moment, however, the rest of the cost must be found by BGE and, in the absence of a suitable equity partner, this means from its own resources and from borrowing.  No Exchequer funding is involved.  This brings us to the matter in hand, the Gas (Amendment) Bill, 1993.</P>
    <P>The statutory limit on BGE's borrowing for capital purposes was last amended in the Gas (Amendment) Act, 1987, when it was increased to £170 million. Expenditure in 1993 on the interconnector project, when added to the board's existing debt and the cost of capital expenditure which it must undertake in the course of its other activities, means that the limit must be raised substantially. I propose to increase it to £350 million.</P>
    <P>The Gas (Amendment) Act, 1982, increased the limit on State guarantees <Col N="1215" /> on the borrowings of the board to £80 million.  At the end of 1992, £55 million of BGE's borrowings were guaranteed. One element of the financial package which BGE has developed for the project involves borrowings from the European Investment Bank.  These borrowings will require a State guarantee.  In order to cater for this, I propose in this Bill to increase the limit on the amount of the Board's borrowings, which may be guaranteed by the State to £190 million.</P>
    <P>In addition to the borrowing requirements, the question of BGE's statutory power is addressed in the Bill.  Under section 8(7) of the Gas Act, 1976, as amended, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications has the power, with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, to give or withhold consent to the construction of pipelines by BGE, and to attach conditions to any consent.  These conditions may relate, among other things, to ownership, operation and inspection.  Doubts have been expressed that section 8(7) of the Act as it stands applies outside the State.  The proposed amendment to section 8 of the Gas Act, 1976, contained in section 2 of this Bill, will remove that doubt, thus ensuring that BGE will have the statutory authority to proceed with the interconnector pipeline.  It will also introduce the power to revoke a consent given under section 8.</P>
    <P>References to the Minister for Industry and Commerce in section 8 of the Gas Act, 1976, are being deleted from this Bill.  This is a technical amendment to tidy up the text of the Act, as the powers which were vested in the Minister for Industry and Commerce under the 1976 Act were transferred to the Minister with responsibility for Energy in 1980 by means of a transfer of powers order which was approved at the time.  These functions now reside in me as Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.</P>
    <P>The design life of the interconnector pipeline is fifty years.  The possibility exists that during the lifetime of the pipeline, interests in all or part of the pipeline could pass to other parties.  Due to the <Col N="1216" /> vital nature of this pipeline, in its role as an energy link to Ireland, the Government will wish to retain control over its operation.  I propose in this Bill to amend section 8(8) of the Gas Act, 1976, to allow me to impose a condition on Bord Gáis that any transfer of an interest in this or any other pipeline would be subject to my approval, and that any conditions which have been laid down for BGE in regard to construction, operation, maintenance and transfer of an interest in a pipeline would also apply to the transferee and to any subsequent transferee.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill in principle.  As the Minister pointed out, it is a necessary piece of legislation to provide for the supply of natural gas to an interconnector pipeline from Moffat in Scotland across the Irish Sea to Loughshinny in County Dublin.  The interconnector currently under construction extends approximately 147 miles and costs in the region of £290 million.  It is one of the most important engineering feats to be undertaken by this country.</P>
      <P>The Minister said the project has been undertaken for a number of reasons.  It will secure the supply of gas following the depletion of the Kinsale Head field by providing a link into the existing system north of Dublin.  It will meet additional gas needs that might arise before the year 2000 and allow Ireland to benefit from the integrated European natural gas network. In the long term the interconnector will provide an opportunity for exporting any surplus supplies of gas to the United Kingdom and mainland Europe should further reserves be discovered off the Irish coast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted all the engineering and design work for this project has been undertaken in Ireland and that approximately 60 per cent of the design team are Irish.  The total employment created by this project during the construction stage will be almost 800 jobs at any one time. An additional 200 to 300 will be employed indirectly through engineering and port and docks services as well as in <Col N="1217" /> the transport and servicing of the lay-barges. Considering these numbers I am extremely disappointed that BGE awarded a major contract to a consortium to carry out the work in Scotland.  The consortium, Wood Bredero, submitted two tenders to BGE for the coating or wrapping of pipes.  Under one tender, the work could have been carried out in Cork and under the other in Scotland.  When accepting the Scottish tender, the chairman of Bord Gáis stated the decision was based on a difference of millions of pounds in expenditure.  I accept Bord Gáis was subject to EC tendering and value for money regulations.  Nevertheless, one must ask why an Irish company could not have been grant-aided to allow it to develop and carry out this work.  The Minister said no Irish company had the expertise to do the work, but why were decisions not made and steps not taken to ensure that they could? This might have resulted in almost 300 jobs in the Cork area.  In these times of unprecedented unemployment it is unthinkable that an opportunity such as this could have been allowed to slip from our shores for the want of foresight and determination.  It is extremely regrettable that a project of this size did not result in a greater input of Irish manpower.</P>
    <P>The interconnector is a vital link into the European gas grid.  Bord Gáis has been concerned for a number of years about its security of supply especially as it has signed up for many major Irish industries to guarantee supply contracts. The Kinsale Head field will run out in the year 2000 at current depletion rates, with the small and nearby Ballycotton field extending its life by just under one year. Unless there are other natural gas finds in the Celtic Sea, Bord Gáis could face a major supply problem.  The solution is an interconnector to the British grid.  As the Minister stated, the five-year agreement between Bord Gáis Éireann and the United Kingdom Power Generating Company will enable BGE to ensure security of gas supply which will cater for domestic, commercial and industrial sectors should an unexpected shortfall <Col N="1218" /> occur in any of these areas from October 1993.</P>
    <P>We must ask whether the decision to proceed with the interconnector is the right one.  The decision by the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications to build this gas interconnector between the United Kingdom and Ireland is a major and irreversible one.  It will have a substantial influence on the direction of all future energy policy in this country.  Though funded from the EC to the tune of approximately £85 million, its total estimated cost will be in the region of £290 million.  That will undoubtedly have an immense influence on future energy prices in this country. In view of the size of the investment, it is important to be confident the decision to proceed with the project is the correct one.</P>
    <P>I regret that the results of the cost benefit study of the interconnector have not been released for study and public scrutiny.  It is vital that an investment such as this be subjected to the most serious and rigorous economic analysis by all interested parties.  The case for investing in an interconnector pipeline has to be based on the standards of costs and profitability.  Searching questions must be asked in this regard.  Does the construction of an interconnector provide primary energy at a lower cost than any other source?  What are the economic consequences of building it?  Does the development of the resource to serve the Irish market maximise the return on the investment?  Is it appropriate to vest ownership of the pipeline only in the existing monopoly suppliers of gas, Bord Gáis Éireann?</P>
    <P>It is wise to ensure a continued supply of gas after domestic resources have been exhausted.  When the Kinsale grid is exhausted, it would be unacceptable and unwise to replace gas with other primary resources such as oil, coal or even peat. It is clearly in our interests to secure a gas supply, but all avenues and ways should have been explored as to how this interconnector could be paid for.  They were not.  We must ask whether the provision of the interconnector would have <Col N="1219" /> been a viable investment project for a private consortium.  The Government never seemed willing to contemplate putting the pipeline up for private sector tenders.  Why was the market not tested?</P>
    <P>Bord Gáis indicated the cost of the interconnector will absorb most of the board's profit for the next seven years, leaving little or nothing to the Exchequer.  This means it is the taxpayer who is investing in the interconnector. Surely the taxpayer would prefer to see Bord Gáis continue to return dividends from its profits to the Exchequer, rather than have those dividends invested in a project which has not been subjected to market viability tests.  They cannot be sure the funds are being well used.  Doubt and uncertainty could be eased if Bord Gáis could finance the pipeline by a share issue in a subsidiary pipeline company. At least this would have proved that the project was commercially viable.  As it stands, the taxpayer has no guarantee whatsoever that this investment will earn a reasonable return.  The history of equity investment by the taxpayer in Irish semi-State companies has not been a happy one.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of this Bill provides for an increase in the limit on State guarantees on Bord Gáis borrowings from an existing level of £80 million to an exorbitant £190 million.  This does not inspire confidence in the project's capacity.  However, some economists will argue that the profitability of Bord Gáis must be judged on its contribution to the ESB and NET and to employment in these sectors.  While debating this Bill it is important to examine the costs to Bord Gáis Éireann of supplying NET and the ESB with gas and the effect of that on the viability of this project.  At present the ESB uses 45 per cent of Bord Gáis's gas output but pays half the price paid by residential and commercial consumers.  For example, the residential sector pays between 33p and 37p per therm and the commercial sector pays between 21p and 38p per therm while the ESB, on average, pays 17p per therm.  When the interconnector is built the cost of gas will increase substantially <Col N="1220" /> but Bord Gáis Éireann will have to keep its prices competitive with oil or it will lose some of its market share.  It will not be feasible or fair to expect the residential or commercial sector to subsidise Bord Gáis Éireann's supplies to the ESB or to NET.</P>
    <P>When the interconnector is in place, Bord Gáis will not be able to sell at its current prices to the ESB or to NET. What will be the outcome?  The ESB could possibly switch to oil but NET may have to close down since it is only kept operating at present by cheap gas supplies. If, as I predict, NET will have to cease operations when Bord Gáis Éireann becomes dependent on the interconnector for bulk supplies, we must ask ourselves whether we should be propping up NET at the moment.  It is folly to process legislation in this House to prop up NET one week while the next week facilitating its demise by the introduction of this Bill.</P>
    <P>NET pays less than 20 per cent of the price paid by industrial and residential consumers, while the ESB pays 34 per cent.  We must also remember that NET's allocation of gas is almost as large as the total supply of gas sold to residential or industrial users.  Therefore, NET is central to examining the justification of spending almost £300 million on the gas interconnector.  At present, gas supplies to NET cost Bord Gáis Éireann 400 per cent of the price paid by NET.  The economic implications of this are horrifying. Each year, Bord Gáis Éireann is foregoing 70 per cent of the financial returns it might have by selling the gas that it now sells to NET to residential and commercial users.  NET is actually burning out our gas fields.  The same applies to gas sold to the ESB but in this case the margin of waste is about half that in the case of NET.</P>
    <P>Another effect of present energy policy is that Bord Gáis Éireann, by selling at the present rate to the ESB and to NET, is advancing the date at which existing reserves will run out and thereby bringing forward our dependence on the interconnector supplies.  Without the ESB and NET the lifetime of the Kinsale and <Col N="1221" /> Ballycotton fields could be trebled.  It is estimated that this interconnector would not be needed until 2010 if Bord Gáis were not supplying NET and the ESB at the present rate.  If the interconnector were not needed until 2010, savings to the economy would be enormous.  The savings can be estimated by comparing the cost of interest payments if the project is started now to the cost of interest payments if the project were not started until the year 2005.  This would involve 12 years interest payments on a borrowing of £280 million estimated, according to economists, to cost about £165 million. One has to seriously question the decision to invest immediately in the interconnector.  Considering that this early start could cost £165 million a serious question whether or not the project should have started immediately.</P>
    <P>There are several other arguments for the interconnector apart from simply securing a supply of gas.  There are environmental reasons which make it wise to continue to use gas.  It is a cleaner and more environmentally friendly fuel than others.  Emissions from gas-based energy production are less than those from burning coal or oil.  In this era of immense interest in environmental protection it is wise and logical to encourage and ensure greater use of gas.</P>
    <P>There is also a domestic reason for the continuation of a good gas supply.  Bord Gáis Éireann has been outstandingly successful in capturing the domestic heating market.  Many householders have converted to natural gas which in many cases involved substantial structural work, the cost of which was borne by the householder. If gas subsequently became unavailable it would be impossible for domestic gas users to turn to oil without incurring major costs.  The consequences of this need not be spelled out and gives Bord Gáis Éireann a strong argument for maintaining itself and for building the interconnector regardless of the costs and benefits.</P>
    <P>Another reason in favour of the interconnector is that it will ensure energy supply diversification.  It is logical that the country's energy supply is less exposed to <Col N="1222" /> interruption if it has several rather than a few primary energy resources.  It is envisaged in the Bill that Bord Gáis Éireann will finance and operate the interconnector.  In other words, Bord Gáis will be a monopoly supplier for the interconnector.  Giving Bord Gáis control over bulk supply from abroad removes the possibility of any competition with Bord Gáis and will enable BGE to act as a monopoly and engage in the cross-subsidisation involved in supplying NET and the ESB.  Third party access, though not covered in this Bill, will have to be seriously considered and I am glad the Minister mentioned it in his speech.  I hope that provision for this is being considered by the Department of Energy as it will be necessary and wise to allow the ESB third party access to the pipe.</P>
    <P>Taking all aspects into account the arguments weigh in favour of the interconnector. However, the project should have been open to far more public economic scrutiny.  Will the interconnector provide primary energy at a lower cost? The answer has to be in the negative. Who will carry the burden?  Will some suppliers continue to be supplied with gas at uneconomic prices?  When will the price of gas start to increase?  Will it be in 1994 when the interconnector becomes operational or later?  What effect will dearer gas have on industry and consequently on unemployment?  It must be a primary aim of the Government to ensure that energy costs are kept at a minimum and, with 300,000 people unemployed, it is vitally important that we do not impose exorbitant energy costs on industry.</P>
    <P>Does it make good economic sense to continue subsidising NET and the ESB with the resultant need for this expensive interconnector?  It would not be needed until the year 2010 but for the commitment to those two bodies.  Bord Gáis Éireann must make known the price per unit charged to all users.  All pricing practices must be transparent even if it causes some embarrassment.  A price publication system should be established immediately, reporting average prices <Col N="1223" /> paid by the various representative categories of industrial consumers.  It is regrettable that in market terms no effort was made by Bord Gáis Éireann to obtain equity funds to finance the project and thereby get an indication whether the project is economically viable.</P>
    <P>The decision to proceed with the interconnector has been made in an attempt to secure a supply of natural gas in the long term, given the projected outlook for the two operating fields at Kinsale and Ballycotton.  Nevertheless, the construction of the interconnector has had an early start when one considers the projected depletion date of our present reserves.  This will have implications for the project's viability in its crucial earlier years.</P>
    <P>The Culliton report recommended that the option of private participation in the financing and operation of the pipeline be fully explored and that the operation of the pipeline should offer maximum economic benefit to natural gas consumers in industry and elsewhere.  The report stated that private funding should be found so as to reduce the need for significant investment by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The commencement of the interconnector provides an opportunity to consider alternative structures for the gas industry.  The Culliton report suggests that customers should be entitled to buy gas directly from producers.  In other words, the pipeline should operate an open access policy.  Competition would be healthy in the gas industry and would result in the reawakening of exploration activities around Ireland.  At present the level of exploration is disappointing.  Is the Government committed to the recommendations of the Culliton report on energy?  I hope the Minister will outline his attitude to the recommendations.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill in principle. However, when investment of this magnitude is undertaken the repercussions for consumers and taxpayers must be examined and reported.  I look forward to Committee Stage where issues can be teased out and debated.  I regard this Bill as the initiator of the interconnector and <Col N="1224" /> I hope it will be followed by further legislation which will deal with other issues arising from the existence of the gas interconnector between Ireland and the United Kingdom.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In a debate on gas in Ireland the most important factor which should dominate our thinking is that natural gas is a finite resource.  There has been no commercial discovery of gas since the discovery off Kinsale Head in 1973.  That is a major disappointment. When dealing with these matters in the late 1970s, I believed that a discovery of gas and, perhaps, oil, would take place because of the rate of exploration at that time.  However, the level of exploration has declined considerably and the number of wells being drilled offshore is now a fraction of what it was.  That is a reflection of the fact that many companies have been unsuccessful in their attempts to discover gas.</P>
      <P>There must be substantial reserves of gas.  We have substantial reserves of oil in the Porcupine Bank which is located 110 miles off the west coast, but it would be economically viable to extract it only if the price increased substantially in real terms.  I would like to see, as would Deputy Molloy, a considerable expansion in the exploration for gas in the Celtic Sea and Irish Sea, because it is feasible to land gas without great expense or difficulty from these areas.</P>
      <P>The former Minister for Energy, Deputy Molloy, signed a contract with Marathon to drill seven wells over the five years in their holdings in the Celtic Sea.  That was an achievement but it contrasts with the position 15 years ago when it was common to have seven, eight or nine wells drilled in one year by several companies and not over a five-year period.  Now that new seismic knowledge is available, I hope that Marathon will be successful in one of the wells either this year or next year.  It is important to have further reserves because existing reserves will expire in the year 2000.  It is a pity to see something we thought we might have forever running out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the interconnector is <Col N="1225" /> vital.  Deputy Ahearn questioned the economics of the interconnector.  One could question the economics of it but for strategic reasons it is right to proceed with the interconnector.  It will be valuable and important to this country.  If further discoveries were made around the Kinsale Head and Ballycotton fields and we did not exhaust our gas supply, we would still be in a vulnerable position because we have only one pipeline coming ashore from our fields.  If anything should happen to the pipeline all gas consumers would be without gas.  If an accident were to happen at sea it might take months to repair and domestic and industrial consumers would be in an impossible position.</P>
    <P>It is right that we should seek to become part of a European Community gas grid as soon as possible.  One of the disadvantages from which we have suffered has been the lack of an electricity interconnector, which the Provisional IRA has deprived us of since 1974.  This has been a considerable cost to the Exchequer, the ESB and the taxpayer in Northern Ireland.  I hope they are proud of their achievement.  I am glad that they can be circumvented by the laying of this interconnector and I welcome this.</P>
    <P>Regarding the cost and the manner in which it is proposed to finance the interconnector, the Minister should examine the matter carefully.  During my time in the Department of Energy in the late 1970s I proposed that we build a pipeline from Cork to Dublin.  After much study by BGE I received an estimate of £130 million.  As that was a lot of money I baulked and vacillated for some time.  I asked companies from abroad to examine and estimate the proposed cost of such a pipeline.  They said it need not cost £130 million.  Arrangements were made with a partly formed consortium to build and design the pipeline. It was built between 1980 and 1982 at a cost of £30 million, as opposed to the 1978 estimate of £130 million.  One must remember that inflation was approximately 19 or 20 per cent at the time.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that the Cork-Dublin pipeline was built for approximately one <Col N="1226" /> fifth to one sixth of the original BGE estimate.  That is a horrendous reduction but it is marvellous that it happened.  It was an error to have given the original estimate, it is fortunate that it was seriously questioned at the time and that I was not prepared to go ahead with the Cork-Dublin line unless a more reasonable estimate of the cost was given.  I presume that everyone has learned a lot since the 1970s and that the Minister and the Department of Energy are satisfied that the £290 million cost of the proposed sub-sea line is the best and most competitive quote that can be obtained.  I believe that is the case, but I hope it has been confirmed by independent sources as well, lest we have a repetition of what almost happened in the late 1970s and early 1980s.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech was helpful because it contained considerable information. However, one vital piece of information which is necessary for an evaluation of what is being proposed in this Bill and which the Minister did not give, is the import cost of the gas.  We know it will be more expensive than what Marathon are paid.  It is not paid a high price by BGE.  This cost could be several times greater than Marathon are paid, but it is important that we know the amount.  Perhaps before this Second Stage debate is concluded the Minister could inform the House of the figure.  He may say that the contracts have not been finalised, but he could give us an approximate figure.  I have heard that the price could be three times higher than that BGE are paying as a base price to Marathon. It is important that we know the cost because although natural gas is inexpensive for the ESB and NET, it is not inexpensive for domestic, industrial and commercial consumers.  As a consumer myself, I know that when three years are up&mdash;&mdash;</P>

This is an important matter which is of great interest and concern to 2,000 families in Galway and many other families throughout the country.  The fact that the Government has interfered with Private Members' Business on this motion suggests a lack of self-confidence on the Government's part in facing what should be a normal debate on a matter of great importance.  I believe it is in the best interests of the House and of the workers in Digital that we be seen to <Col N="1228" /> discuss this over two days and that all Members should have an opportunity tomorrow to reflect and comment on what the Minister says tonight.

      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann expresses its grave concern at the threat to the Digital plant in Galway, condemns the delay in effective political action to head off this threat, demands an urgent assessment of the capacity of the Irish electronics <Col N="1231" /> sector to survive the radical change occurring in the industry; and in the light of the steady deterioration in unemployment, demands a radical change in existing economic policy.</P>

      <P>I hope we will have an opportunity to make a real contribution towards helping to save this plant and that we have not reached a stage where hope is lost.  I am convinced that there is still an opportunity to save it.</P>
      <P>The threat to Galway resulting from Digital's rationalisation plans was not sprung on us suddenly.  We received ample warning of this threat when the Clonmel plant was closed.  In October the situation warranted a ministerial visit by the then Minister, Deputy O'Malley.  It was known that the new chief executive of Digital was entering a concentrated brain-storming session about his future rationalisation plans.  It was also known that the Galway and Ayr plants would be vying with one another to become the main site for Digital's equipment manufacturing activities.  The extremely uncertain future of Digital was known.  Against that background, it must be asked why the matter was put on the back burner by the subsequent Ministers for Industry and Commerce, and later the Minister for Enterprise and Employment in the critical weeks leading up to the decisionmaking process that is now in its final phase.  Why was the Government unaware, until the very last minute, of the tactics used by the British Government to secure the plant in Ayr?  Why did the Taoiseach and Tánaiste not launch a sustained campaign to mobilise influential Irish-American opinion in support of the Galway plant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several weeks ago, the Minister of State informed us of the establishment of <Col N="1232" /> a job protection unit within the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  Its explicit purpose was to co-ordinate the early warning systems of the IDA and the Department of Labour as it then was, to enable timely intervention when companies were in difficulties.  How did this unit miss out on Digital?  It is sadly obvious that the Government was caught napping when the threat loomed at Digital and their response since then has been flatfooted.  Over the weekend there seemed to be bewilderment in Government circles.  They spoke optimistically in the public arena about the future of Digital, but, in private briefings to the media, they indicated their despair of saving anything but the software component of Digital's business in Galway. Deputy Kemmy was the only Member who saw events as they were when he described the fire-brigade action embarked upon by the Government to save a plant when it seemed too late.  We must all hope that it is not too late.</P>
    <P>The Galway plant is more efficient and more adaptable than the plant at Ayr with which it is competing.  In the Galway plant, the full spectrum of manufacturing activities is available.  It has developed the knowledge-based software segment of the industry and could more easily become the consolidated base for a manufacturing plant for the company. Over the weekend, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht claimed that the Cabinet knew of unfair inducements being offered by Britain.  Why did the Minister not raise that issue with Digital when he was in Boston?  Surely, if EC rules regarding public procurement were being breached &mdash; a Member of the Cabinet indicated that that was the case &mdash; the company should have been told that there was a great cloud hanging over the procurement of contracts.</P>
    <P>If this company is lost, the potential catastrophe for Galway cannot be underestimated. Direct and indirect employment accounts for 2,500 people.  This figure combines those working part-time and full-time and those employed in sub-contracting firms.  There are also at least 1,000 jobs dependent on the spending <Col N="1233" /> power of Digital employees.  What happened in Digital indicates the failure to create an effective regional policy.  A region can be potentially devastated by a decision taken thousands of miles away. There is enormous scepticism about this Government's commitment to a regional policy.  Equally, there is scepticism about the ability of the EC regional policy to operate effectively.  A superior plant located in Ireland in a peripheral disadvantaged region is being gazumped by the muscle power of market forces in a stronger economy using their potential to offer the inducement of high contracts. There can be no regional policy if that is permitted.</P>
    <P>The promise of £8 billion from EC funds will not mean anything if strong viable companies like Digital can be grabbed by stronger economies in the EC. There is no future in building myriad interpretative centres if they are only to show tourists the wilderness created by the absence of an effective regional policy.  The bishops are correct in calling for effective regional government where entrepreneurs and people in the villages and towns can have a real say in their future.  The Minister's proposal for a regional arm within the indigenous industry sector will not provide that sort of a forum.  As he said, he will split indigenous industry into industrial sectors and a layer of regions thereby imposing a complicated structure on economic development in the regions.  There should be a willingness to delegate money, decisionmaking and economic power to regional authorities so that those regions can become less dependent.  Centralised decision-making, a feature of this Government's approach to economic policy, will not work.</P>
    <P>We are facing serious problems in Galway, and I look forward to hearing the Minister's proposals.  We, on this side of the House, are anxious and eager to support constructive moves to win Digital and save those jobs.  We are also determined that if jobs are lost in Digital, the Minister will use the might of the IDA to produce for those workers the type of employment opportunities that will not <Col N="1234" /> see their skills dissipated and lost to the Galway region.</P>
    <P>It is well known that the IDA have identified sub-supply in the electronic sectors as an industry capable of creating £300 million of Irish business.  There is a very skilled workforce in Galway, large enough to overcome the deficiencies in the normal Irish sub-supply segments of the electronic sector.  I demand a real programme to save those jobs, to make sure that the talents so painfully built up in this region are not lost, and that the families who depend on those incomes will not face life on the dole.  That would mean catastrophe for Galway and a very serious blow to the Exchequer.  If you look even at crude Exchequer returns, every job lost in a company like Digital is £6,000 per year lost to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>We cannot afford to lose these jobs and we must not leave any stone unturned in our efforts to retain them.  I am disappointed that we appear to be moving slowly in the effort to save these jobs. The fact that we were not alerted to the danger of losing the Digital plant must mean that something has broken down badly in Government circles.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's proposals for the future to make sure that we do not lose this industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to support the motion in the names of Deputies Richard Bruton and Padraig McCormack. As politicians we sympathise with the people affected by this impending tragedy, the people of the west, and those in Scotland who are faced with a similar situation.  This motion is fundamental to the economy of Galway and the west.  Deputies from the constituency directly affected and from surrounding areas understand how the Digital Corporation has become synonymous with Galway and the economic development of the west.  A substantial number of workers travel to Galway every day from County Mayo to work in Digital at both management and worker level.  It is important to note that many firms in the supply service area from County Mayo <Col N="1235" /> and other surrounding counties have supplied services to the Digital Corporation for a number of years.</P>
      <P>If a decision is taken to close this plant or to substantially reduce the numbers employed there, it will be a stake through the heart of the west.  It will be a crisis of unprecedented proportions in terms of the numbers involved and in a general economic sense, taking into account American and other foreign investment in Ireland in the last number of years. Multinational corporation are big ships. They are very difficult to turn around. They are difficult to steer through shallow waters and they are very difficult to deal with when one considers the vested interests involved in multi-national corporations of this magnitude.  Digital is a fine company with a highly skilled workforce which has grown steadily over the years.  One wonders how such a successful corporation could get into a situation where it was faced with hard decisions which will have disastrous consequences for many families.  It calls into question the economic strategy being followed here.</P>
      <P>In the computer business the percentage of profits on the product in terms of the cost of labour was very substantial in the early days.  The bigger the number of units to build on, the bigger the budget and the better the results.  While a small number of technical people would build up any company, they require huge numbers behind them in order to keep that company afloat.  It is obvious that there must be radical change in the computer business and the electronics industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister will give details of his meeting with the chief executive of Digital in Boston and that on his return we will also hear of the other issues and incentives to which he referred.  The Japanese Government spends billions of dollars every year lobbying for its continued economic involvement in the United States.  The opinions of the political parties and our Government do not count for much in the boardrooms of Chicago, Texas or Boston when it comes to the reality of profit.  The key word is <Col N="1236" /> profit and profit is the bottom line. Reality dawns and a decision is made by technocrats far from here.</P>
    <P>It is critical that anything we say here be constructive in terms of Digital and that we are seen to exert the Irish-American influence.  People have called for the involvement of Senator Kennedy and Congressman Kennedy, the Mayor of Boston, Ray Flynn and former Congressman Brian Donnelly and other Irish Americans with influence.  If multi-national corporations and Governments are not speaking to each other, disastrous economic consequences can follow.</P>
    <P>In the early 1980s, the Travenol plant, which manufactured a health care product, was threatened with closure and the loss of 1,400 jobs.  Those people cashed their cheques on a Friday, reared their families, built their houses, paid their mortgages and sent their children to school.  They had become part and parcel of the weave of the economic and social fabric of that part of the country. While numbers were reduced the plant remained open and has flourished because of three critical factors.</P>
    <P>The first factor was the commitment of management to their location and a commitment to the tradition which they had built over the years.  The same applies in Digital.  There was a willingness to change direction in terms of research and development and the workforce were quite willing to achieve set targets.  They themselves had renewed motivation in terms of increased targets and guaranteed extra productivity.  The excellent workforce in Digital can also achieve that.  Most importantly, Government assistance was also made available.  Every facility to save that plant and allow it prosper was made available.  I hope the Minister in his contribution spells out exactly what is involved in this.</P>
    <P>Digital is more than just a single plant. It is unprecedented in this country, in terms of its size, and threatened job losses.  If the Government cannot secure its future either now or by changing direction in the future it spells very serious consequences for the country in terms of international economic investment in all <Col N="1237" /> kinds of industry.  I support the efforts by the Mayor of Galway and other politicians in their attempts to exert as much influence as possible on the Digital Corporation headquarters so that the plant will continue and prosper in Galway.  I am sceptical of the allegations made concerning the retention of the Scottish plant.  It appears economic muscle may have been exerted by political forces in Britain at a high level.  With a major recession worldwide, with many redundancies, political people will play the game as they see it.  It is up to this Government to do the same.  We have always played within the rules.</P>
    <P>I trust the Minister and the Government will ensure that every ounce of pressure and influence is exerted on our Irish-American contacts.  I hope that the historical links between Galway and Boston will ensure that the plant is kept intact and is given the opportunity to expand and change direction.  This will secure the livelihoods of thousands, not alone in Galway city, but throughout the west. If it collapses, it will represent a stake through the heart of the region and neither the Minister nor Deputies would like to see this happen.  I hope we can secure its future together.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Galway&rdquo; and to substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;which is so crucial to the economic welfare of the west; and urges a sustained and united national effort to ensure the retention of the company's full operations in Galway&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was proud to be a member of the 1969-73 Government which approved the first grant for Digital, and which brought this computer manufacturing industry into my constituency.  Subsequently, I was present at the signing of the contract, when there were only four individuals locally employed by Digital in the Galway Industrial Estate.  In the intervening 22 years, I have seen this factory grow to enormous proportions.  It now <Col N="1238" /> has a major influence on the economics of my native city, Galway, and its surrounding regions.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the changes in the computer industry over the past year and of the threat posed to our computer factory in Galway.  I was in close contact with the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, who went to Boston to discuss this threat with the chief executive of Digital but, as the House knows, the Progressive Democrats left office in November.</P>
    <P>Because the situation facing Digital is so serious, not only for its 1,200 direct employees and the 1,300 in the sub-supply sector, but for the economy of both Galway and the west, we undertake this debate in a sombre and fearful mood. Nor would the disastrous social and economic consequences stop there if the plant were to close or have its workforce drastically reduced.  Digital is a flagship of the Irish electronics industry, and our status as a viable location for this industry would be adversely affected.</P>
    <P>The atmosphere in Galway is currently one of grim foreboding, with fearing the worst, while praying for a reprieve.</P>
    <P>The tragedy of what is, and what could happen, is almost too awful to contemplate. Digital is a model company and employer, who have grown with, and generated much of the increased prosperity of Galway over the past 20 years.</P>
    <P>Digital has been good to Galway, but Galway has also been good to the company. It has made good profits there down the years, based on the commitment and skill of a dedicated and hard-working staff who exude a pride in their work and are the face of the new resilient, self-confident, and well-educated Ireland.</P>
    <P>It would be heartbreaking if all this was to disintegrate now, especially when it may arise for no factor for which the workforce could be held responsible.</P>
    <P>If Digital-Galway is to be decimated, it will be due to factors beyond the control of the staff there.  For that reason, it simply cannot be allowed to happen.</P>
    <P>The staff of Digital-Galway and all those in the immediate area, including <Col N="1239" /> public representatives of all parties, are united in seeking to ensure the survival of the entire operation.  Moreover, they are determined not to do anything that may stop this from happening.</P>
    <P>That is why the Progressive Democrats and I cannot, at this juncture, support the full terms of the Fine Gael motion. This would divide and dissipate the united effort, at both a national and a local level, which is essential in the battle to save the factory.</P>
    <P>There will be plenty of time for political recriminations and they will be justified, if this awful event comes to pass. But, in the meantime, the Progressive Democrats strongly believe that all parties should maintain a united national front so as to optimise the pressure on Digital headquarters in Boston, for retaining their full operations in Galway.</P>
    <P>For that reason, my party colleagues, Deputies O'Malley and Cullen and I, tabled the amendment which expresses grave concern at the threat to the Digital plant in Galway.</P>
    <P>Digital is not considering pulling out of Galway because of the performance levels there.  Galway has, and is represented as the model plant in the corporation worldwide.  The complexity of product set and the quality levels made it the number one choice for supply managers. It is these managers who have responsibility for deciding what plants build specific modules or products.</P>
    <P>Galway is currently responsible for manufacturing Digital's most complex and progressive product, the Turbo Laser.  This is regarded by the Digital Corporation as a prime revenue generator and should help secure their future.  Galway was chosen because of its capability in manufacturing quality and complex products.  Galway engineers have, and are, playing a major part in the development of this and other products.</P>
    <P>The plant also has the capacity &mdash; and is currently performing at this level &mdash; to place 200 million components per annum, whereas the Ayr facility in Scotland has only got the annual capability to <Col N="1240" /> place 64 million components.  The Galway product set is also in the higher edge of the technology scale, whereas Ayr operates mostly on lower technology products.</P>
    <P>It also supplies the Stowage module set to its sister plant in Germany.  The Ayr plant does not have the capability to do this.  Galway beat competition for this set from the Far East &mdash; renowned for its cost effectiveness &mdash; when the key metrics were quality and cost.</P>
    <P>Last week, Digital-Galway was commended for its excellent performance in its supply of network and communication products.  It outperformed the Digital-Augusta plant in Maine, USA in the key areas &mdash; its delivery, cost and quality.</P>
    <P>It also took on the work of plants that have closed, such as the Puerto Rican plant in 1992 and the Clonmel plant in 1991.  It got this business because the corporation had confidence in Galway.</P>
    <P>During the last quarter, the plant has reduced its manufacturing cost by 40 per cent in cost per placement, and is well positioned to strongly challenge the Far-Eastern plants by July 1993.</P>
    <P>A compatible product set produced by the Ayr plant, shows that Galway is outperforming them by 200 per cent in cost terms.</P>
    <P>The supply manager for the Corporation visited Galway two weeks ago to meet plant staff and review its capability. She made it known that she was exceptionally pleased with its current efforts and future expansion capability.  She did not even visit the Ayr plant.  She saw Galway as the European plant.</P>
    <P>Galway has a totally integrated manufacturing system.  It has the ability to design, build, test modules and put them into a system under one roof and provide the software neccesary.  No other Digital site in the corporation has this capability.</P>
    <P>Up to last week, expectations from within the plant, and communications from outside, including Digital Corporate headquarters, was strongly in favour of Galway as opposed to the Ayr plant.  Some employees even suggested today that they would be willing to take <Col N="1241" /> a cut in wages to save their jobs.  They could not have done much more than this to survive.  Political action, including inducements over and above what is morally acceptable, have intervened to change the agreement in favour of the Ayr plant.  I hope the Minister had the authority yesterday when he travelled to the United States to change this situation which should never have been allowed to develop.  I wish to share my time with Deputies O'Malley and Cullen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of my concern, and that of the officials in the Department of Industry and Commerce, and senior officials in the Industrial Development Authority, I travelled to Boston last October to meet the senior management of Digital to try to ensure as far as I could that the future of the Galway plant would be safeguarded.  That trip afforded me the second opportunity within a year to meet the new Digital president and chief executive, Mr. Palmer.  When I met him the previous year he was vice-President of Digital's manufacturing division.  The meeting lasted about two and a half hours, was conducted in a social ambience and was very satisfactory.</P>
      <P>I returned to Ireland satisfied that there was no great threat to the Galway plant at the time but, being aware that the company was continuing global cost-cutting measures, I strongly felt that the matter needed to be carefully monitored on an ongoing basis.  I was told by Mr. Palmer, who had only taken up the office of president and chief executive a few days before I met him, that he would be looking carefully at every plant throughout the world and that Digital had already closed plants which they regarded as excellent in every way but which they could not avoid closing because the company was losing such large sums of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had no guarantee, therefore, that Galway would remain open but, equally, I had no reason to fear that its closure was imminent within the next number of weeks.  I have no doubt that the IDA, and the relevant personnel in the Department, fully realised the necessity for this <Col N="1242" /> careful monitoring because it was obvious that a decision could be arrived at within a month or two which might be unfavourable if the proper contact were not maintained.  Unfortunately, my enforced departure, and that of my party, from Government at the instance of the Taoiseach happened within two weeks or so of my return from my trip to Boston and I was no longer in a position to directly monitor the ongoing developments.</P>
    <P>For that reason the political onus for keeping the Digital situation under scrutiny lay first with the minority Fianna Fáil Government after 4 November 1992 and, in particular, with the then acting Minister for Industry and Commerce, Mr. Flynn.  This House is entitled to know what action that Government took in regard to Digital given that direct and immediate information would have been available on an ongoing basis from the IDA and the relevant departmental officials.</P>
    <P>It is worth recalling also the political situation that prevailed in the aftermath of the general election on November 25th and the appalling time wasting which was indulged in by the Labour Party first and later by that party and Fianna Fáil from-the time they commenced discussions on the formation of a government at the beginning of December.  Deputies will recall my pleadings with them before Christmas to get on with the job as there were serious economic problems besetting the country, not least the currency crisis, and they did not have the luxury of proceeding at such a leisurely pace.  At that time I was upbraided by both Fianna Fáil and Labour for being too harsh in my criticism.</P>
    <P>When Deputies and the general public now survey the economic wreckage of the enforced devaluation and the terrible vista of the possibility that faces us regarding Digital, they will see plainly that the urgency I sought to engender in the process of forming a Government at that time was correct and that it was vital there be a full-time Government in place all of whose members were concentrating on their jobs rather than on the various <Col N="1243" /> political activities that went on for some months.  Clearly the Government did not keep their eye on the ball and we are now counting the cost in so many ways.</P>
    <P>The early days of this Government were dominated by largely peripheral issues.  They may have been important in themselves but in relative terms, compared to this difficulty and the devaluation debacle, it is hard to say that issues such as Mullaghmore or ethics in Government were matters which should have had the prime attention of Government. Rather than concentrating on matters of that kind, and on the appointment of party officials and personal relatives to various positions in Departments, it is time we had an exhibition of competence from the Government rather than what we have seen to date.</P>
    <P>Why did we have to wait until I called publicly last Friday for a senior Government Minister to travel to Boston for the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to decide to make the trip?  When I raised this matter in the House last Friday morning there was no response.  The Minister acknowledges in today's newspapers that the trip was vital, which I am quite sure it was, but I wonder if it would have been more productive if it had happened a week or a month earlier.</P>
    <P>I hope we are not going to see the unfortunate result that all of us have feared over the past number of days.</P>
    <P>It would be an appalling tragedy for Galway and for Ireland.  I know of few, if any, multinational companies that were more successfully integrated into our economy and community than Digital in Galway and, therefore, their loss would be all the greater.  I cannot imagine any company in the country whose departure or partial closure would have a greater and more deleterious effect.  I hope that even at this late hour every possible effort will be made to try to avoid this tragedy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been three Ministers for Industry and Commerce since my colleague, Deputy O'Malley, resigned from that portfolio when our <Col N="1244" /> party was forced out of Government.  The first was Deputy Flynn, who is now a member of the European Commission. The second was Deputy Ahern and the present incumbent is Deputy Quinn.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that officials in the Department, and those at the very senior levels within the IDA, were fully involved and capable of doing their jobs. The Taoiseach, in his response yesterday, seemed to distance himself from the important role he should have been playing in addition to that played by the officials.  I have no doubt those people were fully on top of their briefs and adequately carried out their functions but it is clear to me that there was insufficient political attention paid to the issue over the past months since my colleague, Deputy O'Malley, in his role as Minister for Industry and Commerce, visited the company and met its senior executives. This lack of political involvement has contributed in a major way to the situation in the Digital plant in Galway.  It was a reneging of duty in some respects in that it was not until this party, through the former Minister, suggested in no uncertain terms that the Minister should be in the United States meeting with Digital's executives that action was taken.  If it was clear that there was political intervention, and we have yet to see precisely what was occurring on the British side, then why did it take us precious days and hours to react and get involved politically?  There are serious questions on the Government's proiorities which have to be answered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to comment further on the Government amendment which lays emphasis on the implementation of the Culliton report.  No report, Culliton or any other, could do for this country and its employees what this company has been doing.  I see Digital as a flagship embodying all Culliton was speaking about.  It is wrong for the Government to suggest that therein lies the answer.  What this company has been doing over the last three years &mdash; the growth to 1,100 permanent jobs, 200 temporary jobs and 1,500 subsidiary jobs &mdash; has made it the flagship of what Culliton was talking about. <Col N="1245" /> The sooner the Minister, his Department and the Government understand that and begin to realise that there are companies that are implementing what should be happening in this country today, the better.  I fear that the political will, understanding and ability have been clearly lacking in this Government over the last three to four months.  I hope that the Minister will have some definitive information to impart on his leadership in this crisis and what he has contributed on behalf of the workforce in Galway bearing in mind the importance of this plant to the economy.</P>

      <P>I will move my amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Carlow-Kilkenny</i>): Technically the Minister cannot move this amendment because there is an amendment already before the House.  You can speak to your amendment which will be moved and voted on when the PD amendment is dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>If I was in a position to move the amendment I would move it. The text of my amendment is on the supplementary Order Paper.</P>
      <P>We will deal with these matters procedurally when it comes to a vote.  I am taken by the constructive tone adopted by Fine Gael speakers.  I would like to acknowledge the support I received from the Mayor of Galway, all the parties elected to Galway Corporation and for their constructive comments and good wishes which were conveyed to the Mayor of Galway who was accompanied by the City and County Manager of Galway, Seamus Keating, on our visit to the headquarters of Digital International in Maynard, Massachusetts.  I am surprised that, notwithstanding the constructive tone of the Progressive Democrat amendment, their contributions have not been in the same spirit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This problem did not arise today or <Col N="1246" /> yesterday.  Over the last couple of years Digital lost in the region of $2 billion and continues to lose large sums of money. The number of employees has been reduced from approximately 130,000 in 1989 to a current figure of 100,000.  The company's shareholders believe that figure will have to be reduced to 85,000 before it can become viable.  It is a company in crisis, and that crisis has to be responded to by the corporate management as they are currently attempting to do.</P>
    <P>If I may make one point of relevance to Deputy Cullen; the focus of the Culliton report is that we will be dealing with people whose headquarters are not in Maynard, Massachusetts but on this island and who would have a sense of commitment to this country that, unfortunately, a multinational cannot have.  It is for that reason that the reference to the implementation of the Culliton report is the most relevant point which can be made from the point of view of the future.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with the thrust of some of the comments made to date, to the effect that this Government did too little too late.  That is simply not the case. From the first day I was appointed, technically and legally, as Minister for Industry and Commerce and a week later as Minister for Enterprise and Employment &mdash; and that is the official title, not the other way around &mdash; it was brought to my attention that there was a problem with Digital Galway.  That problem had been tracked constantly and with considerable professional commitment by the IDA, and is a commitment with which Deputy O'Malley is more than familiar.  A briefing note was made available to me and I got a phone call from the chief executive of the IDA to update me on the position and to assure me that the IDA had been dealing with this matter on an ongoing basis for the previous nine months.  It was a matter of public record in the financial journals in Europe and the United States that Digital was going through massive restructuring problems.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach spoke directly to Mr. Palmer by telephone and, following that conversation, Mr. Kieran McGowan the <Col N="1247" /> chief executive of the IDA visited Mr. Palmer last week.  When the Taoiseach was in contact with Mr. Palmer I asked if he thought it was necessary for me to travel at that stage &mdash; we sought advice from the IDA about that matter.  The answer was no, it was not necessary.  The moment I was advised by the IDA that it was appropriate for me to go, I went, and not a moment sooner.  I received a request at 1.30 p.m. on Friday from the Mayor of Galway indicating that he was available to be of whatever help and assistance the Government thought was appropriate.  Within two hours of that telephone conversation I called him back to indicate that I would like him to accompany me on the visit.  At that stage, because Mr. Palmer was away for the weekend, we were not sure when the meeting would take place.  We were so determined in our efforts to ensure that the management of Digital International would be made fully aware of the dramatic importance of the Digital plant to the city and county of Galway, and indeed to the western region to which Deputy Kenny refers, we were prepared to travel anyway.  When we arrived on Sunday evening we met and had discussions with people from the IDA who were based locally, and with people in the Digital Corporation.  The following morning we met senior executives of Digital who have a key role in the decision-making process over the future of all Digital's plants to get the company back into profitability.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the House without prejudice to anything that might occur, and I am very conscious of the sensitivity of all that is transpiring at present, that, as the Minister responsible, everything that could be done has been done to date. At the meeting on Monday trenchant points in favour of Digital locating in Ireland and consolidating its overall plant for Europe in Ireland, particularly in the areas of software and manufacturing that are currently carried out in Galway, were made by myself, the Mayor of Galway and the IDA representative.  Those points were listened to, we were <Col N="1248" /> assured that no decision about the future of the Galway plant had been made and that no decisions would be made until the people in Digital headquarters had evaluated the new points and the new, hopefully persuasive, arguments we put to them.</P>
    <P>That is the factual position as of now. I hope that we were persuasive and that they listened carefully to what we had to say.</P>
    <P>They had no doubt about the quality of the workforce and the management in Galway, or about the commitment of the Irish Government to ensuring that the framework within which Digital could function on this island would be the most competitive from their point of view.  I further made the point in no uncertain terms that of Digital's $13 billion sales, $4 billion are in the European Community and $1 billion in the UK, and it would be in Digital's interest to ensure that it was seen to be a company committed to European Political Union and the Single Market, and to all the values which underpin that, including the Social Charter and the social chapter.  I suggested that it would not be in Digital's interest to be mistakenly or wrongly associated with what has been referred to elsewhere as social dumping.  In today's <i>Financial Times</i> there is a banner headline story about Chancellor Kohl and the UK in relation to the future of Maastricht and the need for the pursuit of European Union, including the social chapter and the Social Charter.</P>
    <P>They are the points which have been made to date and the points I wish to stress.  The reality is that Digital, in common with IBM, is going through a massive transformation.  We cannot prevent this but hopefully we can assist in ensuring that it decides to consolidate its Galway manufacturing and software functions in a productive and profitable manner.  A series of points and arguments have been put to them as to why that should be the case and Digital is examining them at present.</P>
    <P>It was pointed out that Digital's contribution to the Irish economy, which is on the periphery of Europe and has <Col N="1249" /> unemployment at the level of 20 per cent, is enormous and that the consequences in the national sense for a serious reduction in output or closure of the company would be catastrophic.  I made this very clear in case anybody thinks otherwise. Deputies perhaps already know that the company's expenditure in wages in 1991 amounted to £43 million.  In addition to expenditure on wages, Digital's sourcing of Irish raw materials and services contributed on average £25 million annually to the Irish economy over the last number of years.  Ireland's exports are significantly boosted by Digital's manufacturing operations here with the vast bulk of their products being exported.  Their average annual exports over the last five years were to the value of £900 million.  As a result of that volume of activity, Digital contributes massively to the Irish economy through tax payments.</P>
    <P>I stressed, as the chief executive of the IDA stressed, to Digital the importance to Ireland not just of Digital <i>per se</i> but of the electronics industry generally and how Ireland has been extremely successful in attracting and retaining state of the art, modern electronics companies. We also stressed to them that companies such as Apple and others found no difficulty in exporting to the rest of the European market from their Irish base.</P>
    <P>We sought to reassure them that the location of Digital plants in other parts of the European Community and in the UK in particular was not necessarily a guarantee of market share and that the consolidation of Digital's Galway plant was no impediment to ensuring that they could maintain and expand their market share within the European Community. Indeed, Mr. Palmer recognised that the probable enlargement in formal terms of the European Community to take in the former EFTA countries would consequentially increase the total population of the Single Market to approximately 370 million people and that the probable growth potential for Digital's market within Europe lay in that direction.  These points were all cogently and consistently made in a manner which left no stone <Col N="1250" /> unturned.  In relation to that, I make no apology to anybody in this House or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>We indicated that the Government was prepared to assist Digital in its difficult efforts to try to restructure the company on an international basis and that, if that involved additional assistance for the plant in Galway in some shape or form, the Government was prepared to give it the most positive and sympathetic consideration when Digital come back to us. The management in Digital are very clearly aware that the people of Galway and the workforce are committed to assisting a difficult decision-making process in Maynard so that the company will come down heavily in favour of Galway. They will facilitate in whatever way is necessary, whether it be the restructuring, the readaptation or the reorientation of the entire plant in Galway.  This message was conveyed forcibly by me and very trenchantly and strongly by the Mayor of Galway and the city and county Manager.</P>
    <P>The management are aware that we understand the difficulties of restructuring for the electronics industry in general because of the rapid development of technology in the computer industry but we have argued with them cogently that Ireland is a good location and a sound European base from which to penetrate other European markets and that major electronics companies like Intel, Dell and Apple export 90 per cent of their product to the EC market without hindrance or disability.</P>
    <P>I wish to turn to some of the points which were made perhaps more in bitterness than in a constructive way by Deputy O'Malley.  I am sorry Deputy O'Malley feels that he was forced out of Government.  He and his colleague, Deputy Cullen, referred to the fact that they were forced out of Government.</P>

      <P>Neither is the Deputy's contribution helpful.  The Deputy has only just joined us; I am sorry he was detained elsewhere.  The fact is Deputy O'Malley sought to make reference to his party being forced out of Government and that somehow as a consequence the process of Government was negligent to the extent that things which could have been done were not done and that the decision now before the Digital board would not otherwise have to be made.  I took that to be the thrust of the Deputy's comment.  To that extent I assure him &mdash;<Col N="1252" /> he will know this because he is a more experienced Minister than I, with many more years of multiple departmental experience &mdash; that the work of the Department and in particular the commitment of the IDA continues.  If Deputy O'Malley is suggesting that, because of his enforced departure from Government and that of his colleagues, the IDA decided they were on hold and not doing anything, then I have to assure him from the detailed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to stick to the subject.  We are frequently accused in this House of coming in and reading scripts. I have come in and listened to what Deputies are saying and I am now responding.</P>
      <P>Let me turn to the last point I want to make.  Whatever the decision made by Digital, be it the one we all hope for, which is the consolidation of the plant in Galway, or the one we all dread, which is the closing of Digital Galway as Digital Clonmel, Mosteck and many other companies were closed, there is a lesson for us to learn.  Until we start to take control and ownership of the economy for ourselves, and until such time as headquarters are rooted on this island and in this State, we will not have the sort of influence everybody in this House desires.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cullen inquired as to the relevance of our motion to the Culliton report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of a global market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of a global market.  We are concerned with multinational <Col N="1254" /> companies making strategic decisions about locating plants on this island, in this economy or elsewhere.  The essence of Culliton and Telesis is that until such time as we have strong, indigenous Irish owned companies, irrespective of the nature of that ownership, we will always be subject to the last minute visits to headquarters in Tokyo, Chicago or in Massachusetts pleading to hold on to jobs that might remain here or go somewhere else.  That is why Culliton is so important and why it is so important to have learned the lessons from what may be a very difficult decision by Digital.</P>
      <P>The tone of the Fine Gael amendment and the tone of the contributions before the leader of the Fine Gael Party joined us were very constructive and supportive on these issues.  How can we go into a Single Market when international competition is loosely regulated because of the difficulty of enforcement of competition law in a number of areas?  How can we ensure that mobile investment is headquartered in this country, has a loyalty to this country and will make strategic decisions that are to our benefit?</P>
      <P>The people of Galway in particular, and of the west of Ireland in general, have made a fantastic contribution to building up Digital.  This was admitted repeatedly by the people in Maynard, Massachusetts. However, one thing we have learned is that notwithstanding that commitment, notwithstanding the £900 million of exports on average, over the last five years, and the profits they have made legitimately as a consequence of that, when it comes to major stategic decisions we are not in control.  If the sovereignty of this Republic means anything, it is about regaining control over some of those key decisions.  That is why the implementation of Culliton is worth doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This story is not over.  The decision has not been made.  There is an air of resignation in some quarters which I condemn. The Mayor of Galway, myself and others went to Digital headquarters in Massachusetts convinced that we could persuade them that on balance and notwithstanding <Col N="1255" /> all the arguments that appeared to be coming from the other side about the presence of Digital in Ayr and in Edinburgh, Galway in particular and Ireland in general was the best location for the future of Digital and for its return to profitability, which is ultimately the bottom line for that company. I am convinced that we made the best case possible on the day.  I am assured that that case was consistently presented by Minister O'Malley last October, by his predecessors and by the IDA.  There is nothing I have come across since Sunday, 4 October 1992, or since the election and during the formation of the Government, that would lead me to think that, because of changes that were taking place in this House, the presentation of the best argument to Digital was not made.  For that reason I commend the amendment in my name and on behalf of the Government to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Connaughton and McCormack.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that satisfactory? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Mayor of Galway because it would appear that within two hours of his contacting the Minister the Minister decided to visit Digital.  Having heard the Minister's report, this was a good decision on the Minister's part and the meeting was useful.</P>
      <P>It is obvious that this was a foreseeable event.  The type of manufacture in which Digital is engaged in Galway, namely, main frame computers, increasingly has been supplanted by the fact that people are now available to do more of this work on personal computers linked into a network.  That technological trend has been hanging over the Digital corporation and similar corporations for some time.  As I said, these events were foreseeable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Watching the Government's behaviour in this matter, it would appear that it was <Col N="1256" /> caught unaware by this development.  It is clear that the then Minister was involved in discussions with Digital last October, but the Government's eye has not been on the ball in the meantime. There is no evidence that the Government was anything other than taken completely by surprise last Thursday when this matter developed so rapidly.  It would appear also, although this is hard to confirm, that the British authorities were involved more intimately in the thought processes of the company.  It would appear that up to two weeks ago or more, the British Prime Minister, or others on his behalf, made attractive offers to Digital which may have swayed them from their original decision to maintain the full operations in Galway and to close the operation in Ayr.</P>
    <P>The Government's failure to keep its eye on the ball is a legitimate matter for public debate.  I hope the situation has been retrieved by the initiative of the Minister and the Mayor of Galway. However, we must learn from the experience.</P>
    <P>There are 30,000 people engaged in the computer related industry in this country, almost all of them in firms not Irish owned.  There is approximately 30 per cent over-capacity in the computer industry worldwide.  In some cases the market has been saturated and is not growing. Furthermore, the area of growth is in software. Given the very large commitment that Ireland has made to the electronics industry over the last 20 years, we are more vulnerable than most other European countries to any downturn or major structural change in this area. Therefore, more than any other country we should devote massive amounts of official time and policy time to understanding the forces at work in electronics and in the electronics industry.  For example, we have in agriculture an industry which, in terms of its output, is not much more important.  However, there are massive research and advisory resources devoted to monitoring trends in this industry.  It would appear that we should be devoting as much attention to monitoring trends in electronics because <Col N="1257" /> we are as sensitive to losses in this area as to losses in agriculture.</P>
    <P>It seems the Minister is unclear about what he will be able to do about what would appear to be unfair competitive intervention by the British Prime Minister. The Minister spoke in a resigned way about the difficulties of enforcing European Community law.  Given the importance of this matter he should tell us exactly what he is going to do rather than talk about the difficulties involved. He is the Minister responsible for this area; he is not a commentator or observer.  He is responsible for competition policy.  At the Council of Ministers he is responsible for making Ireland's case on competition and on industrial policies.  If he believes, as I think he does, that there is unfair competition from the British he should tell the House what he will do about it rather than helplessly wringing his hands.</P>
    <P>He also spoke about the Culliton report in a fashion that suggested he did not understand it.  For example, he said that part of the Culliton report would involve regaining national control of industry.  However, if one wishes to survive in the electronics sector, one must export.  The company, whether Irish or foreign owned, is not in control as the market determines its fate.  The same forces affect Irish and American owned mainframe computer manufacturers and the Minister does not seem to understand that.</P>
    <P>Both foreign and Irish owned companies require a strategic vision of how the Irish electronics industry should develop and that was absent from the Minister's speech.  He did not suggest how that industry should develop; he did not identify growth areas &mdash; apart from software &mdash; where Ireland has competitive strengths, and he did not present an analysis of the development of the European electronics industry.  It is the responsibility of the Department to have the capacity to think strategically and the lack of that capacity is one of the great defects in the formulation of this country's industrial policy.  The Department has become a downtown office for the <Col N="1258" /> IDA rather than a body which is formulating a strategic plan for major sectors like electronics or pharmaceuticals in which we have a major investment.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Minister did not have a view of the future of electronics and could not reassure Members who are conscious of how many jobs are committed to that sector.  The Minister did not refer to the much famed job protection unit proposed in the Programme for a Partnership Government. There is no indication of how it will be funded or of it would have any role in the Digital case.  If the unit was a serious initiative &mdash; and it was presented as such &mdash; the Minister should have been able to tell us about its resources and role in relation to Digital.  He did not mention it, thereby indicating his lack of seriousness in that matter.</P>
    <P>We are told, every St. Patrick's Day, of Irish influence in the US Congress. However, one of the factors adversely affecting US investment in Ireland at present is the change in American economic policy initiated by a Democratic President and supported by a Democratic majority in Congress.  Irish influence should be used to ensure that we do not suffer from protectionist trends that may develop in American economic policy. The Minister did not discuss this issue. It was a casual speech delivered in the Minister's relaxed style.  In some senses it was an informative speech, but it did not demonstrate, either politically or technologically, a strategic plan to deal with the situation.  Although he spoke of regaining control of the issue, he did not seem to be in control of it.</P>
    <P>There has been some controversy about the Taoiseach involving Dr. Tony O'Reilly in this matter.  I have no criticism to make of that decision and I do not believe it is a reflection on the Minister that Dr. O'Reilly should have been asked to use his influence.  That being the case, why does the Taoiseach not consider intervening?  One of the strongest cases the Minister could make &mdash; I compliment him on not having made it &mdash; is that, by locating in Ireland, an American electronics company is locating <Col N="1259" /> within Europe.  Over recent days it has become clear that Britain has become semi-detached from Europe.  It is not sure if it will ratify the Maastricht Treaty, it has already negotiated major exemptions from the Treaty and it is not certain that Britain will be one of the European team. The best person to make that case in the board rooms of America is not the Minister for Enterprise and Employment but the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach spent a week in the United States during September but apparently did not meet Digital representatives during his visit.  As a former Minister for Industry and Commerce and a former Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach, rather than immuring himself in Government Buildings, should visit America to impress on the US authorities and on the authorities in Digital the importance of this plant to Ireland.  More importantly, he should emphasise to Digital the potential for profit in Ireland because of the standard of our infrastructure and education, the 10 per cent corporation tax relief which is not available in Britain and the fact that we are part of Europe whereas Britain is detaching itself from Europe.</P>
    <P>These valid arguments should have been advanced in a more planned way by the Government and not in the haphazard way they seem to have been advanced.  The Mayor of Galway had the initiative to ring the Minister who then decided he would travel to the US.  The person who deserves most of the credit for this visit is the Mayor of Galway who took the initiative and asked the Minister to travel.  Why give the Minister credit for having responded quickly when the ititiative was suggested to him?  What would have happened if the Mayor of Galway had not made that phone call? Would there have been a visit?  The Minister should be politically accountable for his lack of planning.</P>
    <P>Politics makes a difference in this issue. It is not just an issue of commerce and technology.  The intervention of the British Prime Minister would appear to have made a difference; the changes in economic <Col N="1260" /> policy in the United States would appear to be making a difference, therefore it is legitimate that this House should discuss the issue.  It would have been foolish if the Government had got its way, as suggested by the Taoiseach, and had the debate postponed until a decision was made.  Could anything be more foolish or be a greater indication of the irrelevance of this House than debating this issue after the decision was made?  We did not agree and thus our party indicated that this House is still relevant to examining policy making.  I hope this debate will serve a useful purpose.</P>

      <P>There is a serious situation in Galway due to the threatened closure of the Digital plant.  I hope it does not happen but the signs are not good. The workers in Digital and their families have been through a very tense time over the last four days.  I appeal to Members to concentrate on the issue rather than any other aspect of the debate.</P>
      <P>The speculation was so intense in Galway on Thursday and Friday that, as the Minister acknowledged, I took the initiative and contacted both the Minister's office and the Digital plant in Galway.  I was available, as Mayor of Galway, to do anything in my power to resolve the situation.  I was pleased to accept an offer to travel to Digital headquarters on Sunday with the Minister, Deputy Quinn, Kieran McGowan of the IDA and the Galway City and County Manager, Seamus Keating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reports in the evening papers before we left for America were devastating and, if we had not been strong willed people, we might have been inclined to turn back.  I will quote from one of the headlines: &ldquo;Digital to close; 3,000 jobs lost, decision has already been made&rdquo;.  That article quoted high Government sources, not me or anybody in Galway.  However, determined to approach this matter in a positive manner, we ignored media speculation. At the international headquarters of Digital in Massachusetts we met Bob Palmer, the manager, and four high ranking <Col N="1261" /> officials of Digital who listened to our case.  We presented a solid case for the retention of the Digital plant in Galway. I put some proposals on behalf of Galway to the management and was assured that they would be considered.  I was also assured that a decision would not be made until we had been in touch with Digital again.  I was able to go to Galway early this morning to make other contacts in this regard.  I am not without hope that this matter can be resolved because I was able to make the point that Digital is now part of Galway.</P>
    <P>Digital arrived in Galway 22 years ago when the city had a population of 25,000. It was then estimated it would employ 180 people; now it employs 1,300 people directly and many more indirectly.  The population of Galway has increased in those 22 years from 25,000 to 52,000. Digital has grown with Galway and is now part of Galway.  Our deputation was able to make that case.</P>
    <P>We were also able to say that Digital was good to Galway but Galway was also good to Digital.  In the mid-1970s and early 1980s the profits of Digital's Galway plant was in millions.  Digital was catered for in every way.  The Galway site is bigger than any unit outside Digital headquarters. Galway provided the infrastructure, the site and other services for Digital.  The airport was built almost wholly to facilitate Digital.  We were proud of Digital.  People visiting Galway with the intention of setting up business there were shown the successful Digital plant and told how happy management were with the plant.  I was able to point out that after 22 years in Galway, Digital now had a more skilled workforce than any other plant.  The management acknowledged to the deputation that they were very satisfied and happy with the plant and the workforce in Galway.  Our approach was very positive and acknowledged the serious contribution of the Minister and the other people who attended. My only regret was that the visit did not take place a month ago.  I regret to have to say that because we were assured that no decision had been taken, and I accept that, but Mr. Palmer pointed out that a <Col N="1262" /> decision was imminent.  It is our visit that is now stalling the decision for a few days and I hope it will be in our favour. However, the fact that we were not there in time may prove costly in the end but I hope it does not.</P>
    <P>There was a breakdown in communications, not anybody's fault but solely because of the situation in this country since mid-October when Deputy O'Malley visited the plant.  We were told on our visit that for eight months Digital had been considering rationalisation worldwide.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley acknowledges that he was there at that time but since then, there has been an uncertain political climate in this country.  We were in the middle of the beef tribunal, which eventually led to an election, Deputy O'Malley left Government and Deputy Flynn was appointed Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I suspect Deputy Flynn had a lot on his mind during that time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bertie Ahern became Minister for Industry and Commerce for a short time but I suspect he did not concentrate all his efforts on the future of Digital either, not because he was not interested but because of the high level talks about the formation of a Government which lasted seven weeks.  This is something we must look at.  People thought the situation was not serious but it may now prove to have been very serious.  We must look back and ensure that this does not happen again in the life of this Parliament because we are supposed to be looking after the interests of the State.</P>
    <P>During that period our competitors saw the gap and negotiated while we were in turmoil and did not know from day to day if we were going to have a Government or another election.  Those are the factors which affected our case. During a general election everybody, including myself is more concerned with getting re-elected, that is our job.  After an election, Members are concerned with negotiations to form a Government.  Normally that is not a major event but, on this occasion, it took seven weeks negotiations, or pretence at negotiations.  For <Col N="1263" /> the good of the country this must not happen again because now Galway is going to pay a price.</P>
    <P>I hope that because of our mission to Boston we can reverse some of the perceived damage done at that time.  I am only going by press reports as I have no further knowledge of the situation. We received a hearing from Mr. Palmer. He is no softy and I do not think he would have met with us for over an hour &mdash; he might not mind wasting the Minister's and my time but he would not waste his own time &mdash; unless he was going to take account of what we were saying.  I was delighted to have had the opportunity, on behalf of the people of Galway, to present in the strongest language the damage the closure of this plant could do to Galway.  Losing Digital would tear Galway asunder, it would be like a person losing two arms because Galway is part of Digital and Digital is part of Galway.</P>
    <P>Three weeks ago, as Mayor of Galway, I had the privilege to attend a party where up to 500 senior citizens from Galway sat down to a dinner courtesy of Digital, Galway.  During the Galway races there is a sponsored Galway Digital plate.  Those are only two examples of how much Digital is involved in Galway.</P>
    <P>I want to thank the people of Galway for the support they have given me in the mission I undertook with the Minister, Deputy Quinn, Mr. McGowan and the City and County Manager, Seamus Keating. I thank them for their good wishes, prayers and masses.  If we have been negligent in any way since October I hope the faith of the people may save Digital and I will be glad if I have played some part in that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed that the Taoiseach proposed that this debate should not take place this evening.  More than 2,000 families are directly affected by the greatest upheaval they are ever likely to experience.  There would be little point in holding this debate this day week should the decision go the wrong way <Col N="1264" /> for us.  I am amazed at the Taoiseach's political judgment on this issue.</P>
      <P>Like Deputies McCormack and Molloy, I feel the heat in the kitchen. Digital is not just another factory in Galway; Digital means 1,200 jobs with another 2,000 ancillary jobs.  We and the IDA have always regarded Digital as the flagship of the west.  It was used by the IDA as a symbol of excellence when negotiating multinational contracts.  We were extremely proud of Digital Galway who for the past 22 years have been excellent employers.</P>
      <P>Digital provided excellent job opportunities for the best and brightest young men and women leaving our universities and regional technical colleges.  Digital in Galway must have the best trained workforce in Ireland.  Should the company have to leave Galway, I would consider it the mother of all closures in modern times.  It would have an enormous impact on the society I have come to know so well in the west and on the workers and their families.  The Minister, Deputy Quinn, did not avert tonight to the effect it will have on the suppliers of goods and services of the company.  They will be absolutely devastated.</P>
      <P>I must now deal with some of the questions left unanswered by the Minister's contribution tonight.  Why was there such a lapse between last October, when Deputy O'Malley visited the Digital plant in America, and the present Minister's visit?  The Government and the nation must have been aware that everyone working in Digital, particularly since last Christmas, was very vocal about their anxiety for their jobs in Galway. That has been the position for the last six weeks.  If workers were anxious Ministers must have known about it.  I acknowledge the great work done by the IDA but they would find it difficult to compete against a phone call from John Major.  That is the problem.  If that actually happened the IDA should not have been the people to speak to the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am appalled no ministerial visit was planned last Friday and Saturday.  The Minister can shake his head but that is the way it is.  Whoever else was planning <Col N="1265" /> to go, or whenever it was planned, it was not decided before this weekend.  When Deputy McCormack, the Mayor of Galway, rang on Friday morning he was told the Minister would be contacted but he was left in no doubt there was nothing planned by the Minister at that time.  The initiative was taken after that.  I understood both Minister Quinn and Deputy McCormack put up a wonderful show when they got there but for the 2,000 people affected, it was too little too late. The Minister said nothing tonight that would lead me to believe otherwise.</P>
    <P>Why did the Taoiseach not adopt a higher profile?  Where was the Minister for Foreign Affairs?  This company is very important to this country.  If we are to lose an industry as influential as this, it would affect everyone in this State, not just in Galway and the west.  I cannot understand why the Minister for Foreign Affairs did not use our embassies and other contacts on this occasion.  I believe he made no effort to save this plant.</P>
    <P>It is said the English Government exerted pressure or gave inducements to Digital. I cannot blame them for doing that. I understood there was a strict EC competition policy and I would like the Minister to explain to this House if there is one and who polices it.  Commissioner Flynn was on television last night and he did everything but answer what 2,000 people in Galway wanted to know.</P>

      <P>I am glad to speak on the Government amendment to this motion and to support the consensus approach adopted by the Lord Mayor of Galway.  He found it difficult to restrain himself in the debate but I appreciate his patriotism and his fine display of citizenship in serving the people of Galway as Lord Mayor in travelling with the Minister, Deputy Quinn, to Boston to put the country's case.  Both he and the Minister said the meeting was fruitful and productive and that is what we should emphasise.</P>
      <P>I see no reason we should divide on a vote.  In this debate we can show all of us in this Chamber are united in the task before us, that is, the task of persuasion which has already borne fruit in Boston and the continuing of that process.  It would be of no avail to have either an acrimonous debate or a division on a vote.  It is only semantics about the words on the Order Paper which divide us.  The purpose and the objective of all of us, in our professional duties, our constituency duties or our political parties, is to keep the fine Digital plant in Galway.</P>
      <P>It was for that purpose that the Lord Mayor, the Minister, the IDA and Government officials went to Boston to put our case.  Nothing can take from that or from the fine case put forward.  In those discussions, the capabilities and the adaptability of the workforce in Galway through every level of the operation was discussed.  In particular mention was made of the great education given to the many fine workers in Digital.  The educational attainment would give them a degree of flexiblity which we all agree would not be found in any other Digital operation, particularly the Ayr branch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a sustained effort by past Governments, interim Governments and this Government to keep a watchful eye on Digital.  Former Ministers and others have said that because Governments <Col N="1267" /> negotiated eveything stood still.  I am getting tired of that being said in every debate.  We are told our eyes were off the ball.  Our eyes were on the ball.  Elected persons, those still in their stations, the Departments and the IDA were all clearly attending to their duties.  It is erroneous to say there was any misplacement of duties during any period. From perusal of the files and talking to officials and political figures, I know the whole matter of Digital was addressed in a comprehensive fashion.  For a long time, the future of the company was being comprehensively addressed and the case for Ireland was being put forward.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats have now brought in their own amendment which is a slightly toned down version, for which they are commended, but I ask this question: if the other political parties believe that the voice of this Dáil will be heard in Boston, why not let it be a united voice.  Why not continue the spirit which prevailed on the cross-party trip taken in the last few days, the very clear case they put and what I believe will be a fruitful outcome.  Why not let one voice go from this Dáil that we are all encouraged and remain committed to the Digital operation in Galway, to its very fine workforce and to a continuation of its viability in that fine city?  I ask the Opposition to consider that seriously.  Do not divide this House when we all seek the one objective.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm deis a fháil labhairt ar an ábhar tábhachtach seo.  For anybody living in Galway the possible consequences of a closure or a scaling down of Digital are horrific.  We must all pull together.  It is not a time for recriminations or about who did what and when.  That would be equivalent to a football team arguing among themselves with five minutes to go and one point down.  Our obligation is to fight this united, to the line.  As someone who has spent 20 years creating employment, I know the effect the creation of employment can have on a community and I also <Col N="1268" /> know the effects of the loss of employment. In the last 25 years Galway city has changed dramatically in its prosperity and development.  A large part of that on the industrial front was played by Digital. It gave many young people in the area a chance to be involved in the modern technological industries that were coming on stream.  Therefore, it is of tremendous importance that we all stand together to ensure the retention of Digital in Galway.</P>
      <P>A factor often overlooked in job loss is the knock-on effect in the community. It is estimated that for every direct job lost, three to four jobs are lost in spin-off services, supplies and in general loss of money to the economy.  That certainly would be the case with Digital because the various services supplied to them had a huge spin-off effect, and a much greater one that many other multinational companies in different areas.  What is at stake here is not 1,100 jobs but 3,000 or 4,000 jobs.  We must stick together, work right to the line and until decisions are made to ensure that this factory is saved.  We must also think of the individuals.  Sometimes we get caught up with numbers and forget that each worker represents a family, that for each person laid off there is an individual trauma and whether the number laid off is on a small or large scale, many individuals will suffer great hardship.  This applies in all cases.</P>
      <P>It is very important to put structures in place to support individuals, in post lay-off situations, because often one of the tragedies is that everybody thinks, works and talks about what is happening until the decision is made but then forgets that the people laid off have to live with that situation, often in the long term.  Therefore, the people in Galway will need support on an ongoing basis if this happens. However, our first effort must be to ensure, if possible, that there are no lay-offs.</P>
      <P>The point has been made again and again regarding what Galway has to offer Digital.  I do not need to repeat them but it is fair to say that for everything that Digital gave Galway, Galway gave something back to Digital &mdash; the dedication of the workforce, the loyalty of the city, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1269" /> There is always the problem with multinationals that decisions are going to be made not only on the basis of the bottom line but on what they term a global strategy.  We must ensure as far as possible that the global strategy will favour Galway as the European location.</P>
    <P>The best efforts have been made by the Government.  The divisive talk I have heard in the last few days adds nothing to the debate.  I commend the Minister, the Taoiseach and Mayor McCormack and the many others who are endeavouring to sustain this industry in Galway. I hope for a united effort between now and whenever a decision is made to ensure that this industry which is vital to Galway is maintained.  When the crisis passes, the time would then be right to examine the seeds of the recurring crises occurring in this type of industry and to examine other strategies that could be applied in the future; reference has been made to Telesis and Culliton.  The short term aim must be to ensure that Digital remains in Galway.</P>

    <P>I congratulate the Minister and the Minister of State and thank them and the Mayor of Galway, Deputy McCormack, Mr. Seamus Keating, City and County Manager, Mr. Kieran McGowan and his officials in the IDA for their visit which was very helpful to the Digital company and the people of Galway.  We may be arguing here tonight about whether we kept our eye on the ball but we all agree <Col N="1270" /> that we should work together to save these jobs.</P>
    <P>As a Deputy from east Galway, I would love to have a flag ship company like Digital located there.  While that is not possible a large number of people from north Galway in particular travel to Galway to work in Digital.  Transporting people to Digital in Galway city is almost an industry in itself.  To put the record straight, if we are arguing about a lack of ministerial involvement, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn made it clear in his contribution, and I quote:</P>
    <P>In recent months my predecessor visited Boston on two occasions with the express purpose of advancing the case of Digital, Galway and to meet the President of Digital.</P>
    <P>It is clear that his predecessor visited Boston on two occasions and that has been endorsed by various Ministers.  I am glad that has been highlighted by the Minister this evening because the impression may be given that nothing happened since Deputy O'Malley last visited Massachusetts.</P>
    <P>Many small firms supply Digital, many of them in my own constituency, and people working in these firms will suffer if Digital is to close.  That must be borne in mind.  Furthermore, services such as security, canteen facilities and cleaning services are provided by contractors who might go out of business if Digital closed.</P>
    <P>Every step must be taken to save this company.  In my own constituency multinationals have been in difficulty and people have been laid off.  Some companies have put workers on a three day week in order to stabilise the situation and then return to a five day week.  I hope these steps will be taken.  Digital has been committed to the arts in Galway, to the Galway Races and the rugby internationals and has provided many services for the elderly in the form of entertainments and a park in Galway.  That is a testament to the company's commitment to Galway and I hope our debate will unanimously send out the message <Col N="1271" /> that we want to preserve these jobs for the people of Galway.</P>

      <P>It gives me no pleasure to intervene in this debate on the future of one of the most important companies in our country.  For 22 years Digital has been the most important employer in the city and county of Galway.  Its annual financial value to Galway was £100 million.  This consists of approximately £40 million in wages, PAYE and State taxes, £20 million on sub-assembly and component manufacture and a further £40 million in supply and ancillary services and consumer demand.</P>
      <P>Last year Digital International lost $2.8 billion on its worldwide operations. Since then the company has been restructured into nine divisions, each of which reports to the new chief executive, Mr. Robert Palmer.  It is now clear that the board of Digital have decided to downsize their entire operation and when they announced in April 1992 a plan to shed 30,000 jobs we all felt that as 6,000 of their staff were involved in the United Kingdom sales the quality of the Galway workforce would ensure their survival as an integral, permanent part of the entire Digital operation.</P>
      <P>As a Member representing East Galway I am fully aware of the key economic importance of Digital to our area. Many of my friends, neighbours and constituents work in Digital.  Members of families work there, in some cases up to five family members, many of whom married, work in the same Ballybrit plant.  People from Tuam, Athenry, Loughrea and Ballinasloe and from the many adjoining rural parishes are all employed in this excellent company. Digital Galway is still operating and performing as efficiently as ever.  The staff of the company are absolutely positive in their attitude to the future of the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Digital is a market leader.  It is a flagship Irish company both nationally and internationally.  Digital has been an <Col N="1272" /> exemplary corporate entity in the opportunities it has provided by way of employment for the people of the western region and the support it has given to many voluntary bodies and organisations in Galway and throughout the country.</P>
    <P>In addition to its importance as a major employer in the area, Digital has financially supported the establishment of the Galway Regional Airport, the Western Cardiac Foundation and the National Breast Cancer Research Institute in University College Hospital.  It sponsors the annual old folks' party in Merlin Park Regional Hospital and the Digital Galway Plate in the historic racecourse situated beside its Galway operation.  It provided the funds for the establishment of an old folks' park in Salthill and maintains it annually.  In the past it has sponsored County Galway GAA hurling and football teams and at present sponsors our international rugby team.</P>
    <P>I put these facts on the record of this House to show clearly the involvement in and importance of Digital to the economic, commercial and cultural life of the west, in particular, and the nation in general. It is a truly humane and outstanding organisation.  Today there are 1,250 people employed directly by Digital in Galway.  Of these 1,100 are permanent and 150 are temporary.  There are a further 2,000 jobs which depend on the orders for supplies and services required by and for Digital.  We cannot contemplate the catastrosphic effect and diminution of service or reduction in the Digital workforce on our region, the most peripheral in Europe.</P>
    <P>I have listened to all speakers in this debate here this evening.  There is no point trying to pretend that the international recession has not had effect on mobile business.  For the past number of months rumours have been going around concerning Digital.  Listening to some speakers this evening one would think that Digital held a large invisible umbrella between Ireland and the international recession.  The facts suggest otherwise.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1273" /> During past months I have had discussions regarding Digital with the Taoiseach, with former Minister Flynn and ministerial colleagues, Minister Geoghegan-Quinn, Minister O'Rourke and Minister Quinn.  I have had several discussions with senior executives in the IDA.  I am absolutely satisfied that the Taoiseach and members of the Government have kept and are continuing to keep the maximum pressure on the parent company.</P>
    <P>Minister Quinn and his colleagues are doing their utmost to save this huge employer.  I commend both him and Mayor McCormack for the political unity of purpose in their approach to this serious matter.  I know the Government, in conjunction with the IDA, has ensured that the most responsible and flexible attitude of support is available to Digital. On behalf of 2,000 families in Galway and the west in general, I appeal to everybody here and throughout the country to work together, as my colleague Minister O'Rourke said, to ensure that we can save Digital, one of our country's premier employers.</P>

      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputy Gilmore.</P>
      <P>There have been a number of calls from the Government side for a reasoned and non-acrimonious debate this evening and there is little doubt there is widespread agreement that that should be the case.  However, not only have some of the contributions from the Government side tended towards the acrimonious and nit-picking, but the efforts by the Taoiseach today to have this debate stopped and, failing that, to ensure that the debate took place just tonight and not tomorrow also, seems to indicate that for some reason the Government is not at all anxious to air the issues tomorrow.  What is the Government afraid may develop over the next 24 hours?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach's remarks today in the House which imputed some lack of <Col N="1274" /> national concern on the part of Opposition parties were unworthy of him. The implication that we have to stand up, beat our breasts and claim to be as concerned as the Government about the national interest or jobs is unworthy of the Taoiseach.  The arrogance with which the Taoiseach has sought to dictate the terms in which Private Members' Business should take place indicates that he considers the only valid viewpoint to be that of the Government side and that alternative views are not to be heard.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that while there is obviously a case to be made to retain Digital in this country and to maintain the jobs involved, I do not believe that lets the Government off the hook in relation to how they handled this matter. It cannot have come as a surprise that Digital was in trouble.  There were press reports about proposed lay-offs in Digital as early as last July.  There were reports of Digital making decisions to reduce their workforce by up to 30,000 as early as last April.  The panic over the past week, when it became known publicly that this was the case, indicates that the Government took its eye off the ball.  There is no imputation in what I am saying in relation to the IDA, the Departments concerned, or any of the other agencies whose responsibility it is to monitor these matters.</P>
    <P>The fact that the IDA or the Department monitors and tracks what is occurring on any particular issue does not automatically mean that the Minister of the day is actually pursuing the objectives which it is indicated to him or her should be pursued.  On the basis of the evidence available to us, and nothing the Minister, Deputy Quinn said in the House today indicates anything to the contrary, certainly before the general election, precious little had been done at political level as distinct from official level, to guarantee the jobs at Digital.</P>
    <P>There have been demands and exhortations that we should not have an acrimonious debate, that this House should not divide on this issue by <Col N="1275" /> way of a vote tonight.  I agree with that view.  There should not be a vote if at all possible.  Before 8.40 p.m. efforts should be made by the various parties to reach an agreement on a motion of this House. My party has put down an amendment which is an addendum to the Fine Gael motion, but I am quite prepared to look at alternative wordings to avoid this House dividing on the issue.</P>
    <P>I received an invitation this morning from the Taoiseach to meet him along with the Leader of the Progressive Democrats, Deputy O'Malley, and the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy J. Bruton.  I assumed the purpose of that meeting was to discuss a joint approach to this debate.  Instead we were met with a request, if not a demand, that the debate not take place at all.  We were told it would not be in the national interest and if we were not agreeable to that, the Taoiseach would insist that the debate be concluded tonight.  There was no request that we try to reach an agreed position here tonight.  That is surprising, to say the least.  It is surprising in view of the claims from the Government benches that what is being sought is a united approach to the problem at Digital in Galway.  I am certain this side of the house will co-operate if the Government is serious about seeking such an agreed position.</P>
    <P>If the Digital plant should close or shed the number of jobs being talked about, there is no doubt it would be a tragedy for the workers of that factory who stand to lose relatively well paid jobs which they &mdash; and most of us up to about a year ago &mdash; thought were quite secure.  It would be a body blow to the city and county of Galway which already has 15,600 people on the live register.  The loss of such a huge number of jobs would send economic and social shock waves throughout the community.  When one considers the spin-off jobs which would also be lost in Galway in supplier companies, in the retail and leisure areas, in the motor industry, in the transport and construction sectors, the potential economic damage is incalculable.  On a <i>pro <Col N="1276" /> rata</i> basis, it would be equivalent to the loss of about 5,000 jobs in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>Digital is highly thought of in Galway. I hope the management will recognise the efforts put into the company by the workforce and the generous support they have received from the Irish taxpayers.  I hope Digital will show that it is not just another company in the computer and electronics areas which is prepared to take the money and run. Some companies accept lavish grants and generous tax breaks when times are good but are quick to pull out or substantially scale down their operations at the first sign of difficulty.  There are many examples of companies which have done just that in the Irish industrial area.  Companies like Nixdorf, Prime Computers, Maxtor, Seagate, Apple and Wang are all firms in this sector which either failed to deliver on their job creation promises, pulled out altogether, or substantially reduced their operations in this country. Unfortunately, there is nothing new about the Digital crisis; only the potential scale of the job losses makes it unique.</P>
    <P>A further point needs to be made in this regard.  There have been reports of substantial inducements being offered by the British authorities to Digital to retain the Ayr factory rather than the Galway plant.  That emphasises yet again a point I have made consistently in this House, namely, the need for a common industrial policy at European level.  There is increasing evidence of multinationals engaging in Dutch auctions over grants and being prepared to switch production from one country to another, without any consideration for the social consequences. There is a need for urgent action to deal with that approach by multinationals.</P>
    <P>Irish plants of multinational companies are all too vulnerable to decisions which take no account of the social consequences of the job losses.  When a multinational sneezes, it is an Irish plant that catches cold.  Decisions are being made in boardrooms in Boston, Bonn and Tokyo that can result in thousands of Irish workers being dumped out of <Col N="1277" /> work, and entire communities being plunged into economic crisis.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider the points made earlier.  It is possible to get an agreed position here tonight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I come from Galway and share the views expressed here this evening by Deputies, particularly those who represent the two Galway constituencies and adjoining constituencies, regarding the devastation which the closure of Digital, or a serious reduction in the numbers employed there, will mean for the Galway area and the west. I know of neighbours and friends who will be devastated by the loss of this employment.</P>
      <P>I also speak as one of a series of trade union officials who attempted, unsuccessfully, to encourage employees at the Digital plant to become members of a trade union.  I share the generous comments made by the General Secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Mr. Peter Cassells, on Friday evening last when he said that Digital was one of the best employers in this country.  It had one of the highest levels of pay and one of the highest standards of employment conditions of any company of its kind in this country.  I wonder, however, if the eleventh hour crisis which we now find ourselves in might have been averted if the employees in Digital had been plugged into the wider family of the trade union movement with all its research facilities, resources and understanding of the international forces that can cause a decision like this to be made.  I do not believe any decision of this kind is necessarily sudden. One sees the writing on the wall and there are signals that one can read.  Some reflection should be given to why we find ourselves in this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Deputy De Rossa, I do not believe this is an occasion for recrimination. If Digital closes and there is a serious loss of employment, there will be plenty of time to attribute political blame.  At this crucial stage, our objective should be to see how we can contribute positively towards ensuring that Digital and its employment remains in Galway <Col N="1278" /> and continues to contribute to the economic life of Galway, the region and this country.</P>
    <P>The Digital affair raises two issues about industrial strategy.  The first concerns what Deputy De Rossa referred to as our over-reliance on multinational companies as part of our industrial strategy. None of us will refuse the employment a multinational company will bring to this country.  However, there have been reports going back to Telesis and more recently the Culliton report, that have identified the weakness in our industrial strategy regarding over-reliance on multinational companies.  There are too many cities and towns in this country too heavily dependent on a handful of multinational companies for their employment and economic life.</P>
    <P>A decision made in a boardroom in the United States or in Germany can have the effect of creating economic and social devastation in too many towns in this country.  Often we find ourselves having to compete against &mdash; as we know in this particular case &mdash; unfavourable and unfair competition in order to retain employment.  There is something pathetic about a Minister, a Mayor of a city and a head of our Industrial Development Authority having to rush across the Atlantic to plead for employment to be retained.  It damages our pride as a people.</P>
    <P>The effect of a closure at Digital is not just confined to Galway and to the western region; the ramifications of the Digital affair are reverberating across the country.  No matter how secure the jobs of employees in multinational companies may appear on the surface, they are asking themselves if a good long-standing, apparently secure employment like Digital can pull up and leave, or be about to do so, where does it leave them in relation to their own employment?  In turn, that raises a question referred to by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment which relates to the European Community dimension.</P>
    <P>It has been mentioned that, in a way, we are being outbid by the United Kingdom Government in some kind of <Col N="1279" /> economic auction for the location of the Digital plant.  The question of EC competition law and whether it can be invoked has been raised.  The Minister for Enterprise and Employment referred to the case he made about the concerns Digital should have about staying onside in terms of its relationship with the European Community and the importance for it as a company not to engage in some kind of social dumping.</P>
    <P>The affair also raises a question about the absense of an industrial policy in the European Community.  Many of us wonder where is all the fine talk now about cohesion and European solidarity when we find ourselves in a situation in which there is no industrial strategy in the European Community regarding investment and the location of plants and, at the same time, when our neighbouring state can effectively flout the competition laws of the European Community in order to outbid this State for the location of the Digital plant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Higgins and Bruton.</P>
      <P>I come from Clonmel and it is for that reason I join in this debate.  I am sure Members of the House realise that, above anybody else, I can understand the dismay and apprehension of the Galway community with the bombshell news of the threat to the Digital plant.  Unfortunately, it is too similar to what happened in Clonmel.</P>
      <P>In April 1991, Clonmel had bombshell news; the threat to 350 jobs at the Clonmel plant.  In our situation, as in Galway, the same hopes were raised, the same missions were undertaken and the same commitments were given; unfortunately, the outcome was total closure.  I join here tonight to plead that everything possible be done to ensure that Galway does not have to experience what my home town experienced because of the closure of its main employer, the Digital plant with the loss of 350 jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On that occasion in April 1991, we sent a delegation to Geneva to meet with Mr. Palmer and to put the Clonmel case <Col N="1280" /> before him.  We returned with promises that some jobs would be retained but the outcome was a delayed closure.  Today, that plant is closed and 350 jobs have been lost in Clonmel.  It has been said that the warning signals of the threat to the Digital plant in Galway were there since last October.  I disagree; the warnings about the future of the Digital plant in Galway have been there since spring 1991 when the Digital plant closed in Clonmel.</P>
    <P>The Clonmel plant closed because of the downturn in the electronics industry and because many of the components that Digital were producing had become obsolete.  Anybody involved in employment and the protection of industry in our country should have foreseen that what happened in Clonmel, at a later date, could happen in Galway.  Even at a that stage it was widely known that Digital would have to shed more of its workforce but we did not know where.</P>
    <P>The Government has been too lax.  I would like to know what communication and dialogue was maintained with the management of Digital to ensure that when further closures had to be made it would not be a plant in Ireland that would be affected.  That opportunity was not used to maximum effect.  The Government owed it to the workers in Digital; we should have known it was an industry that would come under further threat and it was very remiss of us to allow any other country to get in before us to make a better case.</P>
    <P>I feel sad for the workers in Galway.  I feel sad for the Galway community because I know what the effects have been on the community in Clonmel following the closure of its major employer. It has had a devastating effect on the entire economy and on the commercial, social and cultural life of the town.  The market for houses has absolutely ceased and we even lost teachers in our schools because of the movement of the workforce and their families away from Clonmel. I extend my sympathies to people from Clonmel, some 100 families who, on the closure of Digital, moved to Galway. They uprooted their families, changed schools, gave up their homes and now <Col N="1281" /> find themselves faced with redundancy.</P>
    <P>I do not want to see happening to Galway what happened to Clonmel.  I regret that no lessons were learned from the Clonmel experience.  The warning signals were there since 1991.  We have not been faithful to the Digital workforce and the community in Galway by not recognising the danger signals and not taking action when it should have been taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be fatalistic but the harsh reality is that the west is dying on its feet.  That is not hyperbole, rhetoric or sensationalism; it is a fact.  Our population is scattered throughout the building yards of Boston, Brisbane and Birmingham. Instead of being arrested, the rot continues. The closure of Digital in Galway, if it happens, will be well and truly a king-size nail in the coffin of the west. I can well appreciate the feeling of bewilderment now being experienced in Galway.  This week last year the United Meat Packers crisis broke in my native home town and in the neighbouring town of Ballaghaderreen when 600 workers faced a similarly bleak future.  Thankfully, the plants were taken over, they are up and running again and the workers are back at their jobs.</P>
      <P>As has been so eloquently said here, this is not simply a case of 1,100 jobs being lost; we are talking about 1,100 families being affected.  We are talking about the additional spin-off jobs.  We are talking about the loss of the flagship industry in the region, a region which has been a hard sell to foreign industrialists, but which, on the other hand, has proved very profitable as a base once those industrialists were convinced to come there. While foreign industry has given much needed employment in the regions, such foreign investment has been handsomely repaid in terms of billions of pounds of repatriated profits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are talking about the economic, social and human devastation of a region. If these jobs go we will be talking, as and from next month, about unpaid mortgages <Col N="1282" /> and house repossessions.  We will be talking about the loss of the family car.  We will be talking about how it will affect parents' choice of schools for their children.  We will be talking about whether people can pay for their medical care or have to take their place in the already too long queues at the Regional Hospital in Merlin Park and we will be talking about people's existence and their standard of living.  We will be talking about bread on the table.  There is an imminent human tragedy which must be headed off.  I do not care what means the Government has to use, political or economic, or a combination of both. I do not care what ingenuity or effort the Government has to resort to, or what steps have to be taken.  Digital must be saved.</P>
    <P>I do not know if this closure can be averted.  I honestly believe it could have been averted and that the previous Government more so than the present one was asleep when this was happening.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Ahearn said, the writing was on the wall with the closure of the Clonmel plant.  That should have alerted the Government to the fact that major rationalisation plans were afoot.  As Deputy Bruton said, the Taoiseach was in the United States last September for a very high profile meeting with 50 American industrialists.  Even though the Digital rationalisation plans were well under way and well known at international level, the company does not seem to have been included on the list of invitees to meet the Taoiseach.  I doubt if a single job has emerged from the Taoiseach's high profile and much-vaunted visit.  Yet 2,200 jobs at a minimum are in real danger of going to the wall because we were outflanked and out-manoeuvred by the British Government who knew exactly what was happening, who read the imminent danger signals and relentlessly pushed Scotland's case at the highest possible level.  Fairly or otherwise effective political interventions were made by the British Government, apart altogether from distortions or possible <Col N="1283" /> breaches of competition rules and regulations.  Perhaps we are too good Europeans in this country with layers of bureaucracy brought into play to introduce many of the regulations, structures and guidelines that we take upon ourselves as part of being proud to be in Europe.</P>
    <P>The signals were there.  The then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, saw the danger signals last October but, because the Coalition broke up, responsibility fell to the then Fianna Fáil appointee as Minister for Industry and Commerce, the former Deputy Flynn.  He already had more than enough ministerial baggage.  It is quite evident that the Fianna Fáil Government, the caretaker or interim Government, took its eye off the ball.  Eventually when it became known, it would seem that Digital had been allowed to slip through the Government's fingers.  I hope it is not too late to save Digital.</P>
    <P>I do not want to disparage the efforts of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn.  I believe that he genuinely made every effort to save the plant once the crisis came to his attention. I listened to the Minister and was somewhat taken aback by his off-the-cuff remarks and expert treatment without having recourse to his script.  I note the following sentence in the Minister's script:</P>
    <P>In recent months my predecessor visited Boston on two occasions with the express purpose of advancing the case for Digital Galway and to meet the President of Digital.</P>
    <P>This is the first time Members of the-House have heard that a predecessor, Minister Ahern or Minister Flynn, visited Boston on two occasions with the express purpose of advancing the case of Digital Galway.  I would like to know who was this Minister.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that Fianna Fáil were in Government in a caretaker or interim capacity it must take the blame for this blatant negligence.  I <Col N="1284" /> believe it should have been the Taoiseach, not the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, who was dispatched to the United States.  If we are to have any hope whatever of thwarthing or neutralising the British intrigue, then political intervention at the highest level is required.  This is power politics, tough economics, ruthless rationalisation, and every political contact at the top level should have been used.</P>
    <P>I listened yesterday to the Taoiseach on RTE's 1 o'clock news, when he finally came out of hiding.  His attitute showed a lack of concern, a coldness and a certain detachment.  Mr. Kieran McGowan should not have been sent on his own to the United States two weeks ago; it should have been Mr. McGowan and the Taoiseach.  It is not Deputy Quinn, as Minister for Enterprise and Employment, who should have gone to the United States this week, it should have been the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach should be attending this debate here this evening, not the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that I am wrong and that Digital will be saved in its entirety. The top-class skills and productivity levels, the superb commitment of the Galway workforce and the capacity of the Galway plant to change and adapt provided they are given the necessary time to do so, are known to the Digital management.  Above all else, I hope that the salutary lessons of this experience will not be lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the approach the Government has taken in this debate.  First, to suggest that it is not in the national interest to discuss what every newspaper and radio is devoting huge amounts of time to, is naive at best.  There is no issue more important for debate in this House than the threatened closure of a company that has 1,100 full-time and 200 part-time employees, and at least 1,000 sub-contractors. In addition, there are at least 1,000 more depending for their living on the wages and the household spending of those families in Galway.  If the Dáil is to <Col N="1285" /> be relevant, we must debate these issues and critically analyse what the Government is doing.</P>
      <P>However, I cannot say we should pretend that everything is rosy and that no mistakes were made.  I cannot endorse a motion commending the Government's policy on reform of industrial policy along the lines of the Culliton report. Culliton is being used by this Government as a thin fig leaf to cover its present policies.  It has rejected many critical areas where Culliton made controversial and serious recommendations.  It has rejected its tax and training proposals, its recommendations on industrial reorganisation of our agencies and those governing regional devolution.  It has also rejected the proposals made about how we should develop the spending and administration of the Structural Funds we receive from the EC and has rejected the energy proposals of Culliton.  If you strip the Culliton report of all of those proposals you have very little left. Even with this, it is impossible to assess if the Government is doing anything.  It is then reduced to vague elements of policy, which could have been said to have been in gestation.</P>
      <P>I do not believe the Government is on top of industrial policy and we have heard no evidence from Minister Quinn to support this view.  As other speakers have said, we have not heard any strategic plans that the Minister and his Department have for the electronics sector, which is a very important industry.  In it, we have 28,000 or more employees in the hardware production of computer equipment and 5,000 or more in software production. The reality is that we are facing dramatic changes in this sector.  We have to design a new policy to deal with the weaknesses and threats that confront it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We face threats at every turn.  The tax incentives that have proved successful in attracting electronic industries to Ireland are under scrutiny and others may be reforming their tax regimes to compete with ours.  Those incentives have, quite consciously, brought into Ireland those components of the electronics sector that have lower value added and do not have <Col N="1286" /> the high brain power elements.  Our sector of the industry is unique in a lack of key business functions.  Only three overseas companies that do business in this area in Ireland have conducted any primary research here.  This is the seabed upon which future jobs can grow here.</P>
    <P>The multinational electronic companies have not set down roots, because they have not been capable of generating entrepreneurial start-ups within their own numbers to set up new businesses. Only five entrepreneurial start-ups have come from overseas electronics firms. Most of those electronics companies do not have integrated products.  They are producing an element of another product. They are producing components and do not have ongoing research.  That makes them extremely vulnerable to the changes and rationalisation taking place in the electronics sector today.  The Minister has said nothing about the threats facing this sector and about how we can overcome the barriers preventing our indigenous companies from growing.</P>
    <P>It is a sad fact that indigenous companies have not made the progress expected.  They have had problems with size, with their ability to deliver a quality product on time, in the volume needed and with diversifying their range. As a result, they have not taken up the opportunities of subsupply that might have existed.  We must devise a strategy to strengthen the domestic electronics sector and part of that is to work on a recommendation in the Culliton report. We must recognise that some foreign companies that make the effort to put down roots in Ireland, as Digital did, are effectively indigenous companies.  We should give them the same support, company development plans and hands-on effort that we give to native companies. Digital in my view was and is an indigenous company and to see it lost because of a decision made in Boston is a tragedy for Ireland.  It is unfortunate that we did not devise policies that could have prevented this from happening.</P>
    <P>I cannot support this amendment by the Government tonight.  It asks us to acknowledge the strenuous efforts made <Col N="1287" /> by the Government.  Despite Deputy Molloy's plea for a united front, it was his party who gave the most eloquent descriptions of how political manoeuvring and lack of attention were partly to blame for these problems.  The former Minister, Deputy O'Malley, said tonight that the Government and a successive range of Ministers took their eye off the ball and Deputy Cullen stated that the latter had effectively reneged on their duty.</P>
    <P>I cannot say that we can endorse the statement that the Government made strenuous efforts to save the company.  I have seen no evidence of hands-on ministerial activity, either during the inter-regnum when former Minister Flynn and Minister Ahern were looking after the shop, nor by the incoming Minister, despite the fact that we were told he learned of this problem on his first day in office.  We did not hear any initiatives from him until last Friday when, at the suggestion of the Lord Mayor of Galway and others, he decided to go to Boston.</P>
    <P>I heard nothing tonight of new initiatives to prevent the 2,500 jobs in the Galway plant being gazumped by the superior economic muscle of the British Government. It seems totally in conflict with EC regional policy that a Government could offer inducements to rob the most peripheral and disadvantaged region in the EC of one of its strongest flagship companies, which was integrated into that economy.  That is wrong and Ministers should have told us how they are going to pursue these breaches of EC directives.  Over the weekend, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht said the Government knew what was going on and it was not acceptable.  I know there are directives on public procurement. There is the EC Directive 77/62, agreed at the end of 1976, which states there can be no favouritism in the handing out of contracts.  It says they must observe the principle of non-discrimination and there must be open procedures. Even in defence cases they cannot use these as fronts for what is essentially economic favouritism.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1288" /> I am disappointed with tonight's debate, I am sorry we have not heard of new policy initiatives to save these jobs and of ways in which we can defend our regions against the possibility of such closures.  We heard an oversimplified version of the Culliton report from the Minister when he spoke of regaining control. It showed little understanding of the way we must evolve co-operatively with the multinationals in order to integrate them into our economy.  We will not exercise control but they must be like indigenous companies, determined to be successful.  They have a talented workforce and a profitable base in Ireland.</P>
    <P>We need more from the Government and it is right that we should oppose the Government motion.  I hope this debate will spur the Government into action to defend the jobs at stake in the west of Ireland.  The loss of 2,500 jobs directly and 1,000 jobs indirectly would have a devastating effect on County Galway.  It would mean total devastation of the economy of the west of Ireland.  It is not sufficient to say that regional funds will be used to build roads or interpretative centres if the region is depopulated and without an industrial base.  This debate is about one quarter of County Galway's industrial base.  We must devise real and effective policies which will ensure that County Galway and other regions do not face this type of problem again.</P>

The preparatory arrangements, including the ordering of the Government jet, were made on Friday morning.  It was not subsequent to the request of the Mayor of Galway that we decided to go to the US.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> In the Department of Justice or in any Department there should be no question mark over fair play.  However, since the Department of Justice is involved in administering justice, there is a special onus on it to look after its employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Garda Representative Association and the AGSI went to arbitration in the autumn of 1982, the arbitrator's report recommended that the Garda rent allowance should be regarded as salary and, therefore, included for pension qualifications.  His recommendation &ldquo;that the commencement date be 1 October 1982&rdquo;, has been misinterpreted by the Department of Justice, under pressure, I presume, from the Department of Finance, and is a grave <Col N="1293" /> injustice to the men who have served this country well when times were bad.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to see how rent allowance paid to a garda after 1 October 1982 can qualify for pension purposes, while pre-1982 rent payments should not be allowed.  The principle of accepting rent allowance as part of salary does not change in practice by choice of dates.  The rent allowance is either part of the salary or it is not.  It makes no sense to say that some of it is part of salary, while other rent allowance is not.  The arbitrator's recommendation &ldquo;that the commencement date be 1 October 1982&rdquo; appears to me to mean that payment commences from that date, not that this is the commencement date to qualify for pension purposes, which is the Department's interpretation.</P>
    <P>The argument put forward by civil servants on behalf of the Minister at the arbitration hearing that the cost would be several million pounds, suggests that they were thinking of all retired gardaí rather than those retiring after October 1982.  Otherwise, there would be no justification for talking about the cost because it would be pittance after October 1982.  It is my view that a grave injustice has been done to these men who retired before October 1982.  I believe the Minister cannot hide behind financial restraints and prevent justice being done.</P>
    <P>The only criterion being used in deciding whether to implement the recommendation in this case is that of cost.  Fair play cannot be determined by financial considerations.  Once a principle is established it must hold.  That is why the decision of the Department of Justice to ignore the rent allowance for pension purposes for those gardaí who retired before October 1982 is unfair, unjust and indefensible.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will not reply in the same language used in answer to my parliamentary question.  The interpretation of the arbitration ruling cannot, in my opinion, be that of the Department. That is why I am asking the Minister to reconsider this decision.</P>

      <P>Deputy Browne should not try to anticipate me because I am full of surprises.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to be in a position to respond to this matter and to help clarify this situation for the information of the House.  First, I should state that there is no justification for the use of the term &ldquo;discrimination&rdquo; in relation to pension rights of members of the Garda Síochána who retired before 1 October 1982.  This date was determined by the Garda Arbitration Board, whose chairman is an independent entity, in the Garda Arbiration Board report No. 15 of March 1983 as being the commencement date for pension purposes of a number of allowances, including rent allowance.</P>
      <P>As the Minister explained in her reply to Questions Nos. 19 and 50 on Wednesday, 17 February 1993, the provision is that the Garda Representative Association and the Association of Garda Sergants and Inspectors referred the claim to arbitration to have a number of allowances paid to members of the Garda Síochána made pensionable.  The arbitrator recommended in March 1983 that some of those allowances, including rent allowance, should be made pensionable with effect from 1 October 1982. The recommendations contained in the Garda Arbitration Board report No. 15 have been fully implemented.  A copy of this arbitration report is available in the Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be helpful to Members if I describe briefly the background to the conciliation and arbitration mechanism under which this report was originally issued.  After long and detailed discussions some years back with the four Garda representative associations which represent the various ranks in the Garda Síochána, up to and including the rank of Chief Superintendent, the present Garda conciliation and arbitration scheme was put in place.  The scheme provides for a Garda conciliation council and an arbitration board which may deal with claims and proposals in relation to the pay and conditions of service of the members of the ranks represented by the association. <Col N="1295" /> The scheme is similar to other schemes operating elsewhere in the public service and provides for the direct participation of representatives of the Minister for Finance in negotiations under the scheme. If, as in this case, agreement is not reached at conciliation, the matter may go before the Garda Síochána Arbitration Board, the chairman of which is appointed by the Government on the nomination of the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Finance, in agreement with the representative bodies concerned. The arbitrator's recommendations in this case was that 1 October 1982 be the commencement date for a number of allowances to be made pensionable, including the rent allowance.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the Garda conciliation and arbitration scheme, pensionability of allowances is not an arbitrary matter.  However, under the terms of the Second National Understanding then in operation, the matter was allowed to go to arbitration.  I cannot stress enough to this House that the terms of the Garda Arbitration Board report No. 15 have been fully implemented.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána Pensioners' Association subsequently asked to have the benefits of the recommendation concerning rent allowance applied to their members who retired before 1 October 1982.  The association was informed in August 1984 that because of the unfavourable and considerable costs involved and the critical state of the Exchequer finances, the recommendation could not be applied to those members.  There are no proposals, unfortunately, to change that decision.</P>
    <P>The following is an estimate of the cost involved if pensionability of rent allowance were to be extended to members of the Garda Síochána who retired before 1 October 1982.  If rent allowances were to be made pensionable for members and surviving spouses of members which is estimated at 682 and 1,845 respectively, who retired before 1 October 1982, the full cost in 1983 would be approximately £1.2 million.  This estimate, of course, <Col N="1296" /> does not provide for retrospection.  An estimate of the cost in subsequent years would require detailed information on and analysis of the age distribution and, therefore, the life expectancy of the pensioners in question.  The information readily available would suggest that the corresponding cost in 1997 would be £600,000 falling to £200,000 by the year 2002.  Unfortunately, from the point of view of the people who might benefit &mdash; and I have every sympathy with them &mdash; the decision of the Government is that the report which is being implemented stands and there will be no retrospection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for coming to the House to reply to this matter.  I tabled a motion at the Western Health Board's October meeting last year to ask the health board to allow medical cards to handicapped persons.  I did this after being approached by the parents of handicapped children who were concerned that medical cards in many cases were being withdrawn from their children.  I discussed this matter at meetings in November and December. I was glad the Western Health Board agreed on 9 December 1992 to a proposal to meet the Minister for Health to discuss four issues.  One of these issues was the inclusion of legal provision in the Health Acts for the cost of general medical card services for all handicapped children.  I hope the Minister will be able to accede to my request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I noticed in the Programme for a Partnership Government that there was a very fine section dealing with the health services, particularly mental health service but there was no reference to the question of medical cards for the handicapped. The situation developed on from there in that parents of handicapped children came together as a group.  They have had many meetings and have received support from the parents of Down's Syndrome children.  They have made the point to me that they wish to get a definite <Col N="1297" /> answer either from the health board or from the Minister as to whether medical cards can be granted as a right.  They have been concerned particularly that medical cards have been withdrawn from handicapped children who suffer from Down's Syndrome, cerebral palsy or other types of handicap.</P>
    <P>They made the point also with the gross income taken at £118 for a married couple and £14 for each child that sometimes they may lose out if the guidelines are strictly interpreted.  A letter from a secretary of this parents' committee pointed out that there was no allowance for bus travel for the children to their special schools or if they had to go for private tuition and there was no allowances for childminding.  It was also pointed out that in many cases handicapped children have an inferior immune system and, consequently, suffer much more regularly from throat infections and respiratory infections. There is a long term illness programme but these parents have been trying to impress on the Western Health Board that regular visits to GPs and other doctors and consultants are an enormous drain on their financial resources.  I hope from that point of view that the Minister can include legal provision in the Health Acts to have medical cards granted as a right.  Ironically these families receive a domiciliary care allowance which is a recognition that these special children need special care.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately from the replies I and parents have received from previous Ministers the question has been transferred back to the health board when the chief executive officer can use his discretion to grant medical cards if people cannot provide medical care.  In this situation the parents consider the matter so seriously that they have come together to form an <i>ad hoc</i> committee and an <i>ad hoc</i> group to press for medical cards as a right.  I hope the Minister will be in a position tonight or as soon as possible to announce a change in the legal provision of the health Acts to allow medical cards as a right to handicapped people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and welcome the opportunity to explain to the House the background to the medical card scheme and the conditions under which medical cards are issued.  One of the basic principles underlying the provision of the health services in Ireland is that no one is denied essential services because of inability to pay.  The medical card scheme is designed to ensure that persons who are unable without undue hardship to provide general practitioner services for themselves and their dependants are provided with a full range of health services free of charge.</P>
      <P>Determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility, as the Deputy has correctly said, of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board.  Entitlement to a medical card is based on means and income guidelines are available to assist the chief executive officer in the determination of a person's entitlement.  These guidelines are revised annually in line with changes in the consumer price index.</P>
      <P>However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and the health boards have the discretion to issue a medical card to a person whose income exceeds the guidelines if medical or other circumstances warrant it.  At present almost 36 per cent of the population hold medical cards and in 1992 payments under the medical card scheme came to £227 million, or 13 per cent of the total health expenditure.  By anyone's standards that is a huge amount of money.  Every 1 per cent increase in the numbers entitled to a medical card represents an increase of expenditure of £2 million to £3 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even in by brief period as Minister of Health I have received a number of requests to extend the automatic entitlement to a medical card to particular groups such as, for example, the elderly or children, asthma sufferers and students.  There is a case to be made for each of these requests but I cannot look at requests for improved services in isolation from the overall context of providing <Col N="1299" /> health services in an extremely difficult and tight financial situation.</P>
    <P>Deputies will appreciate that there are very many demands on the health services and that I am already faced with difficult decisions as to what services are given priority.  Once such decision relates to the medical card scheme.  Having given the matter raised by the Deputy very careful consideration, I consider it is not justifiable to grant an automatic entitlement to a medical card to any group without any reference to their means or, in the case of children, without any reference to their parents' means.</P>
    <P>If there are persons with a handicap who do not hold a medical card and who are experiencing difficulty in paying for general practitioners' services, it is open to them to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board on hardship ground.  I am satisified that health boards take a sympathetic view of applications where circumstances warrant.</P>
    <P>I take the opportunity to point out that non-medical card holders are entitled to an extensive range of health services free of charge.  For example, everybody, regardless of income, is entitled to public hospital and public consultant services subject to modest statutory hospital charges.</P>

With regard to persons with a handicap, I would like to point out the drugs and medicines prescribed for the treatment of a wide range of conditions are available free of charge.  I would also like to add that hospital inpatient and outpatient services are available free of charge to all children suffering from the following conditions: mental handicap, mental illness, PKU, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, haemophilia and cerebral palsy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, I am anxious that every person who is in genuine need of a medical card should receive one.  It is in the best interests of the public at large to rely <Col N="1300" /> on the careful consideration of individual cases by the health board rather than to grant automatic entitlement without reference to means.</P>

      <P>I thank the Chair for selecting this item for the Adjournment debate and I take this opportunity to wish the new Minister for Education well in her portfolio.</P>
      <P>One of the most precious rights and privileges of Members of the House is the right to ask a parliamentary question. It is a legitimate device to extract information from Ministers in relation to local and often national issues.  It is the one occasion when a Deputy can really get to grips with an issue.  Supplementary questions afford Deputies their only real opportunity of eyeball to eyeball contact with the Minister in relation to topics and subjects.</P>
      <P>In fairness to Ministers, questions are generally answered in the required detail when such questions are quite obviously going to come within the lucky lottery of 15 or 20 questions to be taken orally.  All Ministers, or the majority of them, will give Questions 50 on the Order Paper, the answer to which will only be given in written form, the same kind of attention to detail as a question which is to be orally answered.  We can say in fairness that the information is generally readily given.  Sometimes it may be unpalatable but generally it is put on the table for debate for discussion.</P>
      <P>Apart from an acknowledgement of the right of Members to seek and extract information, there is also the fact that every Minister has the substantial bureaucracy of the Civil Service at his or her disposal to deal with each and every aspect of their Departments where files are readily available, information can be obtained at the press of a button and accountability is very much the order of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The easiest questions for Ministers to answer are statistical because we are talking about precise figures as <Col N="1301" /> against something of an arbitrary nature or something that is open to conjecture, the subject of a policy review, etc.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education is one of the biggest Departments.  The total Estimate for that Department and the running of the services under the aegis of that Department is £1.6 billion.  The Department of Education is one of the three big spenders in terms of staff and services.  On 16 February 1993 I put down a question to the Minister for Education to state the numbers of qualified teachers of art, music and physical education in post-primary schools with first, fewer than 100 pupils, then between 100 and 200 pupils, between 200 and 300 pupils and so on, up to 800 pupils plus.  I asked the Minister to make a statement on this matter.  I received the following reply:</P>
    <P>The information sought by the Deputy is not readily available in my Department.</P>
    <P>That is not acceptable because this information is readily available in the Minister's Department.  The information is on file and on computer in the Department. Each and every teacher about whom I sought information is an employee of the Minister's Department, is paid by the Department, is monitored and is the subject of inspection by the Department and is answerable to the Department.  Yet, when I sought this information I was given a reply which is not in accordance with the facts and is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>When I asked the former Minister for Education, Deputy Brennan, for specific details in relation to precise class sizes and other statistical information, I received precise replies.  Similarly, I tabled during the limited period in office of former Minister for Education, Deputy Davern, equally detailed statistical questions and again accurate responses were forthcoming.  The former Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, and I never really hit it off in political terms but I will say that when it came to supplying statistical information, even though it may have been unpalatable at times, she never flinched, never shirked and never tried to evade an issue. <Col N="1302" /> I am saying to the Minister for Education in the straightest possible terms that when I table a Dáil question, seeking precise information particularly statistical information which is on file within the Department, I want an accurate reply.  As a Member of Dáil Éireann I am entitled to an accurate reply and I will have an accurate reply.</P>
    <P>I note, that in the intervening week I was not afforded the courtesy of a followup reply giving the details which I did not receive last Tuesday.  I also note that a similar question tabled by Deputy Frances Fitzgerald on 10 February received a reply, which again, is unacceptable.  The question was in relation to Scoil Mhuire, Sandymount, Dublin 4.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Higgins for his good wishes on my appointment as Minister for Education.  I am glad the Deputy raised the matter he did as it gives me an opportunity to inform the House of my Department's position on this statistical question.  The Deputy requested specific information in relation to the number of qualified teachers of art, music and physical education in schools of varying sizes.  I would like to assure the House that the prime reason for not supplying <Col N="1303" /> the information sought is, as I stated in my reply to his parliamentary question on 16 February, that the information requested is not readily available at this time in my Department.</P>
      <P>My Department determines the teacher allocation for individual secondary and community/comprehensive schools and vocational education committees by reference to the current pupil-teacher ratio and taking account of the approved ex-quota posts.  Wherever approval given for the filling of a vacancy it is a matter for the management authorities of individual secondary and community/comprehensive schools and for vocational education committees, in the case of the vocational schools, to decide on the subject or subjects which should be catered for.  The management authorities would be expected to take account of the curriculum needs of their pupils and their existing resources in arriving at that decision.  The approved appointment procedures must then be followed in the filling of the post.</P>
      <P>The authorities of community/comprehensive and vocational schools must submit a formal proposal and recommendation for appointment of a particular teacher to my Department for approval.  My Department examines the proposal and, provided the post is within the approved teacher allocation, the proper appointment procedures have been followed and the person is fully qualified, the appointment is approved.</P>
      <P>In the case of secondary schools, my Department does not formally approve the appointment.  It does, however, sanction the filling of the vacancy and ensures that teachers are registered in accordance with the conditions set down by the registration council.  The authorities of the schools notify the Department of the appointment and the Department arranges the payment of incremental salary, where appropriate.</P>

    <P>My Department allocates and approves the appointment of teachers to the vocational education sector on a scheme basis and not to individual schools.  It is a matter for the chief executive <Col N="1304" /> officer of each vocational education committee to allocate staff to individual schools within his vocational education committee as he thinks fit.</P>
    <P>The relevant documentation in relation to appointments is not kept in such a way as to enable me to indicate that a teacher who holds a specific qualification is appointed to a school in a certain enrolment category.  In order to compile the type of information requested by the Deputy it would be necessary for my Department to correspond with the authorities of each postprimary school and to divert scarce staff resources for the purposes of analysing the relevant returns.</P>
    <P>My Department is conscious of the need to maintain readily accessible up to date statistical information on teachers. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that it is proposed to set up a computer-based personnel system for teachers which, when operational, will enable the type of information sought by him to be made available at short notice.</P>

      <P>For the first time since the grievance procedure was introduced I believe that the two minutes allotted will be in excess of my requirements.  I say that because I know that, in asking the new Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht to ensure that a proper percentage of lottery funds goes to the arts as originally intended, I am pushing a wide open door.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not trying to build up an argument here tonight or to marshal the facts in favour of more lottery money for the arts, I am assuming that the Minister is in total agreement with me on this.  What I am seeking to do is provide a platform for the Minister to announce his intentions on the day before the budget to pre-empt any designs the Department of Finance might have on easy lotto money.  I believe that there would never have been a national lottery but for the inclusion of arts and culture for a major slice of the proceeds.  The then Taoiseach, Dr. <Col N="1305" /> Garret FitzGerald, sanctioned the lottery because he saw in it one way of finally having some proper funding of the arts. Of course, what we are getting is merely substitution for what should have have been cogent Exchequer expenditure. The intended percentage for the Arts was 35 per cent of the total funds.  I was involved in that decision at the time. Unfortunately, this was not written into the Bill and here I detect the hand of the Department of Finance.  There is no need to remind the Minister, Deputy M. Higgins, of how that Department, which also controls the Office of Public Works, likes to maintain its control over most things as far as finance is concerned.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the Minister of State, on behalf of the Minister, telling us that he intends to deliver to the arts, now that he is in control, what was originally intended when the lottery was established. I am sorry the Minister is not present but I am glad of this opportunity to congratulate the Minister of State and wish him well on his reappointment to his portfolio.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. Gallagher,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Donegal South-West):</i> I would like to thank Deputy Nealon for his kind wishes and to apologise on behalf of the Minister who is unavoidably absent this evening.  National lottery funding has provided the arts and culture area with much needed funding to finance both its current spending and its capital programme. This funding has enabled the national cultural institutions to greatly expand their activities and to develop their services to the public.  On the capital side, it is clear that many worthwhile projects could not have been completed were it not for the availability of lottery funding. For example, the Irish Museum of Modern Art which opened in May 1991 was assisted by the national lottery to the extent of £930,000; the heating system in the National Museum is being completely overhauled at a cost of £800,000.  Similarly, in regard to arts facilities in the regions it is doubtful whether a project such as the Firkin Crane in Cork which, <Col N="1306" /> for example, received £250,000, could have proceeded without lottery funding.</P>
      <P>In the Programme for a Partnership Government our commitment to the arts and culture area is clearly stated.  I would like to restate the Minister's and my own commitment to the many areas touched on in that document, from the increased funding to the Arts Council to the current and capital funding needs of our national cultural institutions, including support for their modernisation and refurbishment programmes.</P>
      <P>As you are no doubt aware, responsibility for the allocation of lottery funds is a matter for Government.  I fully accept that while there are so many worthwhile issues to be addressed and so many exciting projects to be undertaken, there will always be greater demand on our funds than can be met immediately.  However, I can assure Deputy Nealon and the House that every effort will be made by the Minister to ensure that this area receives its fair and due share of funding.</P>

        <i>(Donegal South-West):</i> Is ceantar é an Ghaeltacht Lár atá buailte go dona le tamall anuas le fadhbanna na dífhostaíochta agus na himirce. Tá géarghá le tionsclóirí a mhealladh chun tograí fiúntacha a bhunú sa cheantar d'fhonn deiseanna fostaíochta breise a chruthú do mhuintir na háite agus caighdeán maíreachtála na ndaoine sín a ardú oriead agus is féidir.  Tuigimse agus tuigeann Údarás na Gaeltachta é sin go maith.  Chuige sin bíonn iarrachtaí leanúnacha ar siúl ag an Údarás chun gnóanna inmharthana a aimsiú a thabharfaidh spreagadh agus uchtach do phobal an cheantair sin chun aghaidh a thabhairt ar na blainta atá romhainn le misneach agus féinmhuinín.</P>
      <P>Maidir le Coiste Oibre Bhaile na Finne, atá ag feidhmiú mar eagraíocht fhorbartha áitiúil, tuigim ón Údarás gur bhuail feidhmeannaigh dá chuid faoi dhó le toscaireacht d'ionadaithe an choiste sin le roinnt míonna anuas chun deis a thabhairt do phobal an cheantair a gcuid tuairimí agus moltaí maidir le forbairt na háite i gcoitinne a nochtadh agus a chur ina luí ar lucht an Údaráis.  Is comhartha dóchais é an tsuim seo atá á léiriú ag muintir na háite ina dtodhchaí féin. Bíonn comhoibriú ar siúl idir Oifig Réigiúnda an Údaráis agus an Coiste Oibre d'fhonn daoine áitiúla a spreagadh chun tionscnaimh a bhunú a bheadh dírithe ar achmhainní nádúrtha an cheantair a fhorbairt.  Is trua nach bhfuil an toradh a rabhthas ag súil leis bainte amach go fóill ag na hiarrachtaí go léir chun fostaíocht bhreise a chruthú sa cheantar ach caithfear brú ar aghaidh go dícheallach leis na hiarrachtaí sin.</P>
      <P>Tá céimeanna suntasacha glactha agus á nglacadh agamsa i gcomhar leis an Údarás chun féachaint chuige go ndéanfar an oiread dul chun cinn agus is féidir i bhforbairt thionscail sa Ghaeltacht lár sa tréimhse go deireadh 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I measc na gcéimeanna sin tá: cinneadh glactha ag an Údarás le cúpla mí anuas iarrachtaí speisialta a dhíriú ar an nGaeltacht <Col N="1308" /> Lár sa tréimhse go dtí deireadh 1993 ar a laghad; dlús curtha ag an Údarás lena gcuid iarrachtaí chun togra fiúntach a aimsiú don mhonarcha folamh i mBaile na Finne; cead tugtha agam don Údarás ceithre ionad nua fhiontraíochtas a thógáil sa Ghaeltacht Lár &mdash; ceann amháin díobh i gceantar Ghleann Finne; cúrsa oiliúna fiontraíochta do choistí sa cheantar curtha ar siúl; liosta de dhaoine atá ag iarraidh cúrsa traenála curtha le chéile i gcomhair le Coiste Oibre Bhaile na Finne; agus teach de chuid an Údaráis curtha ar fáil don Choiste Oibre mar Ionad Acmhainní don cheantar.</P>
    <P>Maidir le Raudon Teo tuigim ón Údarás go bhfuiltear ag feitheamh le plean gnó ó phríomhaithe nua d'fhonn an tionscal seo a athbhunú.  Tá an tÚdarás dóchasach go n-éireoidh leis ar iarracht seo.</P>
    <P>Is léir ón méid atá ráite agam thuas go bhfuil iarracht nach beag ar siúl chun tionchar fadhbhanna dífhostaíochta an cheantair seo a mhaolú oiread agus is féidir agus bí cinnte de go ndéanfaidh mise mo chion féin i gcónaí ar mhaithe le saol eacnamaíochta, sóisialta agus cultúrtha phobal na háite seo a fheabhsú agus a chur chun cinn.</P>

      <P>Baineann an cheist seo leis na hoibrithe a chail a gcuid postanna i monarcha Éadach Chonamara Teoranta i gCill Chárthaigh, Co.  Dhún na nGall, breis is dhá bhliain ó shin.  Chaill 53 duine a bpostanna an uair sin agus níor tugadh dóibh ach an ráta reachtúil iomarcaíochta. Fuair daoine a bhí ag obair ann feadh leathchéad bliain £6,000 nó £7,000 d'íocaíocht agus ní bhfuair daoine eile a d'oibrigh ann ar feadh fiche bliain ach £3,000.  Cé gur dhein bord Údarás na Gaeltachta cinneadh go bhfaigheadh na hoibrithe níos mó ná an ráta reachtúil iomarcaíochta, níor éirigh leis na hoibrithe aon íocaíocht sa bhreis a fháil. Tuigim, leis, gur tháinig an moladh sin chuig Roinn na Gaeltachta ach nár dearnadh aon rud faoi i rith an dá bhliain <Col N="1309" /> sin.  Deirtear go bhfuil fadhb ag an Ard-Aighne maidir leis an íocaíocht bhreise ach nuair a chuimhnímid go bhfuair daoine eile a chaill postanna laistigh agus lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht, íocaíochtaí sa bhreis ar an ráta reachtúil, ní thuigim cén fáth nach féidir rud a dhéanamh ar son na n-oibrithe in Éadach Chonamara Teoranta a thug seirbhís chomh fada sin.</P>
      <P>Tá ráflaí ag gabháil thart anois go mb'fhéidir go mbeidh dífhosta ar siúl ag bord stáit eile cosúil le hAer Lingus.  Más amhlaidh, tá mé cinnte go bhfaighidh na hoibrithe sin íocaíochta sa bhreis ar an méid reachtúil.  Chas an tAire Stáit leis na hiar-oibrithe níos mó ná uair amháin ach tá siad ag fanacht go fóill le aitheantas a fháil dá seirbhís don mhonarcha seo, d'Údarás na Gaeltachta, do Ghaeltarra Éireann agus don dream a bhí ann roimh Ghaeltarra.  An mbeadh an tAire ábalta insint dúinn an bhfaighidh siad íocaíochtaí breise go háirithe óir nár éirigh lena bhformhór post eile a fháil ó shin?</P>

        <i>(Donegal South-West):</i> Sa chéad dul síos is mian liom a rá, mar Theachta Dála don cheantar áirithe seo agus mar Aire Stáit na Gaeltachta chomh maith, go dtuigim go maith cé chomh buartha is atá iar-oibrithe Éadach Chonamara Teo.  toisc nach bhfuair siad íocaíochtaí iomarcaíochta de bhreis ar shuimeanna reachtúla. D'fhreastail mé ar roinnt cruinnithe áitiúla faoin ábhar seo agus rinne mé gach iarracht ab'fhéidir ó thús chun réiteach sásúil a fháil ar an gceist.</P>
      <P>Ba bhuille tubaisteach do cheantar Chill Chárthaigh nuair a d'imigh an chuideachta seo as gnó agus nuair a ceapadh leachtaitheoir uirthi dhá bhliain ó shin.  D'ainneoin na tacaíochta a thug Údarás na Gaeltachta don fhochuideachta seo thar na blianta theip ar an ngnó sa deireadh ar chúiseanna éagsúla. Ní fiú dul isteach go mion sa ghné sin den scéal anois ach tig leis an Teachta glacadh leis gur scrúdaíodh na féidearthachtaí uile a bhain leis an gcás ag an am féachaint an bhféadfaí an tionscal a tharrtháil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bhí suim phearsanta agam sa chás seo i gcónaí d'fhonn teacht i gcabhair ar na hiar-oibrithe trí íocaíochtaí iomarcaíochta <Col N="1310" /> de bhreis ar na suimeanna reachtúla a íoc leo mar chúiteamh ar an tseirbhís dhílis fhadtréimhseach a thug siad don chuideachta.  Phléigh mé an cheist leis an Aire Airgeadais agus d'iarr seisean comhairle ón Ard-Aighne faoin gcás agus is í an chomhairle a fuair sé uaidh ná nach bhfuil aon chumhacht ag Údarás na Gaeltachta pá iomarcaíochta de bhreis ar na suimeanna reachtúla a íoc le hiaroibrithe Éadach Chonamara Teo. Chuir mé é sin in iúl do na hiar-oibrithe ag cruinniú a bhí agam le Rúnaí Údarás na Gaeltachta in Ard Rathain cúpla mí ó shin.</P>
    <P>Chuamar ar ais go dtí an Aire Airgeadais agus an tArd-Aighne agus cuireadh in iúl dúinn arís nach bhfuil an ceart ná an cead ag Údarás na Gaeltachta airgead sa bhreis ar na suimeanna reachtúla a íoc leis na hiar-oibrithe.  Is oth liom nach féidir liomsa mar Aire Stáit ná leis an Aire Gaeltachta ná an Aire Airgeadais, fiú, an cead sin a thabhairt.  I rith na tréimhse, rinne an Teachta McGinley, an Teachta Coughlan agus mé féin gach iarracht ab'fhéidir ar son na n-iar-oibrithe ach ní raibh sé ar ár gcumas an ceadú a bhaint amach d'ainneoin an chinnidh a ghlac bord Údáras na Gaeltachta ina thaobh.  Sin mar atá an scéal i láthair na huaire agus is trua é.</P>

      <P>St. John's Church of Ireland was built in 1819.  The clock and the church tower, which is such a feature of the square in Listowel, was installed in 1861.  The church ceased to be used as a place of worship in the late seventies. In 1987 a voluntary committee was set up to restore St. John's and convert it into an arts and heritage centre.  To date, over £200,000 has been spent on restoration and conversion work.  The committee were fortunate to receive £50,000 from the Irish American fund, £30,000 from Shannon Development, £30,000 from the National Heritage Council and £30,000 from local fund raising events.  However, there is an outstanding deficit of £60,000 owed to the bank.  There is also a need to develop the literary foundation section and carry out further remedial structural work to the main building, including <Col N="1311" /> replacing the existing roof and repairing the church spire.  The additional works will cost in the region of £75,000.</P>
      <P>St. John's Arts and Heritage Centre has proven to be an outstanding success. It has become a major centre for the visual and performing arts in the north Kerry-West Limerick area.  It now caters for over 100 events per annum.  Over 10,000 patrons attended the various events in 1992.  The front section of the building is used as a tourist point.  From May to September over 10,000 tourists were assisted in 1992 at this location.</P>
      <P>Minister Higgins is an acknowledged supporter of the arts.  Indeed, he has had memorable moments in Listowel, especially during writers' week.  No doubt there are moments during writers' week which he cannot remember.  I appeal to the Minister on behalf of his several admirers in Listowel to make a commitment to provide funding for this most magnificent and valuable centre of the arts, both in County Kerry and in Ireland.</P>

        <i>(Donegal South-West):</i> As Deputy Deenihan is, no doubt, aware, the National Heritage Council offered a grant of £35,000 to this project in May 1990.  The project involved restoration work to St. John's building, the former church in the centre of the square in Listowel.  The building itself, as well as its important location in Listowel, were the determinants of the decision to offer grant assistance.  The sum of £30,000 of the grant had already been paid by the National Heritage Council. This related to carrying out specified works agreed between the Office of Public Works architect and the secretary of the restoration committee.  The <Col N="1312" /> National Heritage Council are of the view that the grant of £35,000 is relatively generous and while they cannot guarantee any increase in the funding, they would, however, be prepared to consider the matter further if specific information and proposals are submitted.</P>
      <P>I wish to point out that the Arts Council provided grants of £7,500 in 1990-91 and £6,159 in 1992 to help defray some of the operating costs of the centre.  The council has also approved a grant of £13,000 in 1993 of which £2,500 has already been paid.</P>
      <P>Níor mhiste a lua freisin gur aithin Roinn na Gaeltachta sa bhliain 1991 go raibh sár-obair ar siúl san ionad sin.  Már chomhartha air sin, ceadaíodh deontas £4,000 in aghaidh na bliana ar feadh tréimhse trí bliana ó fháltais an chrannchuir náisiúnta chun a chumasú don choiste clár sonrach ar mhaithe leis an nGaeilge a chur i bhfeidhm san ionad sin agus sa cheantar maguaird.</P>
      <P>Tá an deontas seo á ioc i dtráthchuideanna dhá uair sa bhliain agus tá £6,000 íochta go dtí seo.  Mar Aire Stáit ag an Roinn Ealaíon, Cultúir agus Gaeltachta is cúis sásaimh ar leith dom an raon fairsing d'imeachtaí cultúrtha ealaíon atá á reachtáil ag muintir Lios Tuathail faoi scáth Ionad Naomh Eoin.  Is léir go bhfuil cúnamh nach beag faighte ag an togra seo agus guím gach rath ar an ionad sna blianta romhainn.</P>
      <P>As I have said, the National Heritage Council cannot consider further funding in the absence of specific information and proposals.  Perhaps the Deputy would discuss that with me.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.40 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 24 February 1993.</P>

      <P>The encouragement of home ownership is a long standing principle of the housing policy of successive Governments and I support it fully.  It is an important element in both <i>A Plan for Social Housing</i> and the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-1997.</i></P>
      <P>The promotion and implementation of tenant purchase schemes in any particular area is a matter for the local authority concerned.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the views being expressed by the residents of Skibbereen, County Cork, against the introduction of a one way traffic system; whether there is any mechanism for the expression of these views within a local authority area by way of plebiscite; and if not, if he will have arrangements made to ensure that such a procedure can be followed.</Quest>

      <P>The implementation of traffic management measures in any individual <Col N="1002" /> area is a matter for the local authority concerned and I have no function in the matter.</P>
      <P>The statutory basis for the application of traffic management measures is contained in Traffic and Parking By-Laws made in respect of each county by the Garda Commissioner, with my consent. Individual measures are implemented by the provision of traffic signs by local authorities, acting either at the request, or with the consent, of the Garda Commissioner.</P>
      <P>There are no statutory provisions to require local authorities to seek views on individual traffic management measures by way of plebiscite, or to engage in a public consultation process.  However, the statutory provisions governing traffic management are currently being reviewed and proposals for revised arrangements will be included in the Road Traffic Bill which is being finalised. The need for public consultation in the case of significant measures is among the issues under consideration.  However, it is not envisaged that such consultation would override the powers of elected representatives to take the final decision.</P>

      <P>These houses, which were built in the early seventies, are in private ownership and accordingly responsibility for their upkeep rests with the individual owners. While there are no grants available from my Department for house improvements, it is open to the owners to avail of the special arrangements offered to <Col N="1003" /> them by Limerick Corporation, including the enhanced terms approved by my Department for house improvement loans.  On the basis of this package, it should be possible for Limerick Corporation, in conjunction with the residents, to work out satisfactory overall arrangements for the carrying out of the necessary improvements to these houses.</P>

      <P>Details of the authorised programmes for the individual housing authorities for 1993, which total 3,500 new starts and which are being notified to them today, are set out in a tabular statement which I am having circulated in the Official Report.

The numbers of houses for the individual authorities have been determined having regard to the needs shown in the latest assessment carried out under section 9 of the Housing Act, 1988 and taking into account also output under the voluntary house schemes.</P>

      <P>The Shankill/Bray by-pass was designed to reduce, as far as possible, the <Col N="1009" /> effect of noise on residential areas.  Noise abatement measures, such as the provision of mounds, walls and other landscaping works, have been provided and have been funded from road grants.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board carried out a noise survey on the route between May and June, 1992.  That survey showed that noise levels in excess of the UK standard were recorded at only two properties.  As both cases involved property acquisition, accommodation works were agreed as part of the compensation paid to the parties. While the UK standard has no statutory force in this country, I am satisfied that the ameliorative measures already implemented by the local authority are adequate and that no further remedial works are necessary.</P>

      <P>Environmental impact assessment, in accordance with the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1990, has already been carried out on the Tramore sewerage scheme, which is being promoted by Waterford County Council.  In compliance with statutory requirements, the County Council published a notice on 4 March, 1992, advising the public that the environmental impact study had been completed and that submissions/observations could be made to the Minister for the Environment within one month of that date.  A number of submissions were received within the prescribed period. A number were also received after the expiration of this period and therefore could not be considered.  No submission from the Southern Regional Fisheries Board was received at any stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having assessed the EIS and all submissions made within the prescribed <Col N="1013" /> period, I certified on 14 December 1992 that, subject to two modifications which I prescribed, the proposed scheme would not, in my opinion, have significant adverse effects on the environment.  The modifications relate to relocation of the sludge dewatering building and incorporation of odour controls, and to the construction of the stage 1 treatment unit in the stage 2 location.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Wexford):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 150 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Important measures have already been developed in support of greater recycling throughout the country.  In 1990, local authorities were asked by the Minister for the Environment to prepare recycling <Col N="1014" /> schemes for their areas, identifying recycling possibilities and the means for facilitating and promoting these. Schemes have now been prepared for 32 local authority areas.</P>
    <P>My Department has operated a scheme of capital grant assistance for recycling projects for the past four years, and this will continue in 1993.  Many projects throughout the country have already been supported under this scheme. including the Kerbside project in Dublin; a large number of these projects involve collection of paper for recycling.  ENFO has produced a range of information leaflets relating to recycling, including particulars of the location of recycling facilities.</P>
    <P>Considerable progress in recycling rates has accompanied these various measures.  Glass recycling has increased from 7 per cent in 1986 to more than 20 per cent at present, and aluminium can recovery has risen in the same period from virtually zero to 12 per cent.  The paper recovery rate now stands at some 16 per cent.</P>
    <P>A consultants' report on the development of a national recycling strategy has been completed, and I intend to publish it very shortly, with a view to obtaining comments from all interested parties. The report and the consultative process will place particular focus on the practical merits, in Irish circumstances, of different approaches to recycling.</P>

      <P>The fees in relation to planning appeals introduced under the Local Government (Planning and Development) (Fees) Regulations, 1984, include a fee for making submissions or observations; this fee was last revised, to £30, under the Local Government (Planning and Development) (Fees) (Amendment) Regulations, 1992.</P>
      <P>The system of making submissions or observations in respect of which the fee is charged is an intergral part of the appeals process, specifically recognised and regulated procedurally in the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1992.

      <P>My Department and the Department of the Environment Northern Ireland, have concluded their examination of this application and have concluded that the proposed study is not suitable for inclusion in the current INTERREG Programme.  In arriving at this decision, account was taken of the fact that the proposed road link has already been the subject of a feasibility study undertaken in 1979 by consultants engaged by the respective local authorities. This study costed the provision of a bridge at Narrow Water and the upgrading of the county roads from there to Omeath and Carlingford at £2.23 million at 1979 prices.  Subsequent discussions between the two Departments established that, while the proposal appeared to be technically feasible, there were serious reservations on the extent of the benefits that would be derived in relation to the scale of the costs involved. An update of the study carried out by consultant in 1986 revealed that the cost had increased to £6.15 million.  In these circumstances, it is considered that there is no justification for a further feasibility study at this time.  The matter will, however, be kept under review.</P>

      <P>To report within three months on the formation of constituencies for the election of members to the European Parliament, taking account of the following: (a) the number of members to be elected for any constituency shall not be less than three nor more than five; (b) there should be reasonable equality of representation as between constituencies; (c) each constituency should be composed of contiguous areas; (d) the desirability of avoiding the breaching of county boundaries; (e) geographical considerations including the extent of the proposed constituencies; and (f) the desirability of effecting the minimum changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The following persons have agreed to serve in person on the commission: The Hon.  Mr. Justice Liam Hamilton, President of the High Court (Chairman), Mr. M. Mills, the Ombudsman, Mr. B. O'Donoghue, Secretary of the Department of the Environment, Mr. K. Coughlan, <Col N="1020" /> Clerk of the Dáil, Ms. D. Lane, Clerk of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>A Bill to amend the European Assembly Elections Act, 1977, would be necessary to give effect to any proposals for changes which may be put forward by the commission.</P>
    <P>Legislation is being prepared to implement the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government that an independent Electoral Commission will be set up on a statutory basis to prepare proposals for revision of constituencies. It is evisaged that this statutory commission will carry out the next review of Dáil constituencies.</P>

      <P>The total provision for maintenance works on national primary and national secondary roads in 1993 is £20.7 million, the same as in 1992.  A sum of £8.911 million was assigned to national secondary roads in 1992.  The corresponding amount for 1993, and the apportionment among local authorities, will be determined as soon as possible <Col N="1021" /> in the context of this year's road grant allocations.  The programme of maintenance works to be carried out on national roads in their area is primarily a matter for the local authority concerned.</P>

      <i>Vote for Foreign Affairs</i>
    </P>
    <P>There are no policy changes underlying the variations in the 1993 allocations for subheads on the Vote for Foreign Affairs and the Department will continue to provide the same level of services both in Dublin and through our embassies and consulates abroad.</P>
    <P>The overall increase in the 1993 Administrative Budget under the Vote is mainly due to the cost of public service salary increases (Subhead A.1) and certain exceptional costs arising from the leasing of premises overseas (Subhead A.6) together with increased expenditure in foreign currencies owing to the recent devaluation of the Pound.</P>
    <P>The 1993 allocations for Information Services (Subhead D) and North-South and Anglo-Irish Co-operation (Subhead F) are being kept at the level of the 1992 estimates provision.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Vote for International Co-operation</i>
    </P>
    <P>The provision for 1993 for International Co-operation shows an overall increase of 44 per cent over 1992 expenditure. This allocation fulfils the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government for an increase in Ireland's Official Development Assistance to 0.2 per cent of GNP in 1993.</P>
    <P>There will be an increase of 71 per cent over the original 1992 estimate in the allocation for bilateral aid (which includes the Bilateral Aid Fund, APSO, emergency humanitarian relief and the care of refugees).  Most of the increased provision for multilateral aid will be allocated to the international aid organisations and development agencies of which Ireland is a member.  Our voluntary contributions to a range of UN development agencies (such as UNICEF and UNDP) will be doubled.</P>

      <P>The issue of the application of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia for admission to the United Nations is closely linked to the question of its international recognition as an independent State.  Following the publication early last year of the report of the Badinter Commission, established by the Twelve in the framework of the EC Peace Conference, which indicated that Macedonia fulfilled the conditions established by the EC for its recognition, the Twelve have made clear their readiness to recognise the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. However, as I stated in a recent reply to another question, we wish this to be done in a manner which will avoid creating a further area of tension and potential conflict in the Balkans.</P>
      <P>The application by the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has been referred to the UN's Committee on the Admission of New Members which has not yet prepared a report for the Security Council.  When this report has been considered by the Security Council, the Council will make a recommendation to the General Assembly.</P>
      <P>I will give the Security Council's recommendation very careful consideration. It would not be helpful to speculate further on the matter at this stage as we cannot anticipate the course of the Security Council's discussion or its eventual recommendation.  Moreover, important consultations involving the Greek and Macedonian authorities and members of the Security Council are now taking place.  The objective is to secure agreement on the admission to the UN of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia under an interim name, to be followed by binding arbitration on the final name of the State.  I fully support this process.</P>

      <P>In view of the continuing outbreaks of violence and human rights violations in Cambodia in the runup to the elections in May, I believe there is a case for strengthening the operations of the human rights component of the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC).  The present situation cannot be allowed to continue if the environment needed to conduct free and fair elections is to be established, as mandated by the Paris Accords.</P>
      <P>The UN Secretary General's Special Representative in Cambodia, Mr. Akashi, has recently addressed this serious matter.  As an exceptional measure, he has set up a special UNTAC office &ldquo;with powers to investigate and prosecute serious criminal acts, which are also human rights violations&rdquo;.  He has designated a special prosecutor from within UNTAC for this purpose.  Mr. Akashi informed the UN Commission for Human Rights in Geneva last week that the UN had been obliged to take these unusual and radical measures in the interests of proceeding with the Paris Peace Accords.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, UNTAC convened in Phnom Penh last December the first International Symposium on Human Rights in Cambodia.  The human rights groups at the symposium strongly endorsed the need for the UN to play a continuing role in support of their efforts in the difficult years ahead.  Mr. Akashi has therefore proposed that the UN Centre for Human Rights should exceptionally establish an operational presence in Cambodia later this year, to follow up and monitor the various human rights programmes initiated by the UNTAC Human Rights Component.  He also told the Human Rights Commission of the need to appoint a Special Rapporteur of <Col N="1034" /> high standing to assist the human rights process in Cambodia.  I welcome and support these initiatives.</P>

      <P>Firms in the customs clearance sector wishing to diversify into other areas of business may avail of the broad range of training schemes operated by FÁS, as well as advice and support schemes from the industrial promotion agencies.</P>
      <P>EC assistance is available to former customs clearance agents under three headings:</P>
      <P>&mdash;existing programmes funded by the European Social Fund,</P>
      <P>&mdash;Council Regulation 3904/92 on measures to adapt the profession of customs agents to the internal market,</P>
      <P>&mdash;INTERREG, which is a joint cross-border programme with Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of existing programmes the full range of FÁS services is available to former customs clearance agents.  Under Council Regulation 3904/92, some £430,000 is available to provide assistance to Irish firms with diversification plans, principally by way of training and retraining measures.  Assistance can be given under INTERREG to persons affected by changes in border-related activities arising from the establishment of the Internal Market.  This programme is confined to the Border counties.  As the financing measures involved are provided for under the European Social Fund, <Col N="1035" /> applications for assistance are being processed through the Department of Enterprise and Employment.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 74, 75 and 76 together.</P>
      <P>As far as my Department is concerned the position is as follows:</P>
      <P>
        <i>EC Directives which have been signed by the Council but are not yet due for transposition into Irish law.</i>
      </P>
      <P>Council Directive 92/50/EEC of 18 June 1992 relating to the Co-ordination of Procedures for the Award of Public Service Contracts.  This measure is expected to be transposed before the due date of 1 July, 1993.</P>
      <P>Council Directive 92/121/EEC of 21 December 1992 on the monitoring and control of large exposures of credit institutions. It is expected that this Directive will be implemented by the due date of 1 January, 1994.</P>
      <P>
        <i>EC Directives which are overdue for transposition into Irish law and the expected date of transposition.</i>
      </P>
      <P>Council Directive 92/77/EEC of 19 October 1992 on the approximation of VAT rates.  It is expected that this Directive will be implemented in the Budget and Finance Act, 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Council Directive 90/531/EEC of 17 September 1990 on the Procurement Procedures of Entities operating in the <Col N="1037" /> Water, Energy, Transport and Telecommunications Sectors.  It is expected that this measure will be transposed by Statutory Instrument in the next two weeks.</P>
    <P>Council Directive 92/13/EEC of 25 February 1992 co-ordinating the laws, regulations and administrative Provisions relating to the Application of Community Rules on the Procurement Procedures of Entities operating in the Water, Energy, Transport and Telecommunications Sectors. It is expected that this measure will be transposed by Statutory Instrument in the next month or so.</P>
    <P>Council Directive 92/83/EEC (structure of excise duties on alcohol and alcoholic beverages) is implemented in the Finance Act, 1992 and S.I. No. 394 of 1992, apart from the taxation of beer on the end-product basis.  This aspect will be implemented by means of an Order to be made by the Minister for Finance under section 102 of the Finance Act, 1992, when detailed negotiations with the trade concerns have been completed.</P>
    <P>Council Directive 92/80/EEC (approximation of taxes on manufactured tobacco other than cigarettes) and 92/82/EEC (approximation of the rates of excise duties on mineral oils) deal with rates of duties to apply to these products in the Internal Market.  Ireland complies with practically all of the provisions specified in these directives in its existing rating structure.  Those very few areas in which we do not strictly comply at present (pipe tobaccos and heavy fuel oil duties) will be dealt with in the context of the forthcoming budget.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Department of Finance.</i>
      </P>
      <P>The increases/decreases in the subheads for my Department's Vote do not reflect any policy changes.  The level of service provided in 1993 will be equivalent to that provided in 1992.  My Department will continue to keep its services under review in order to ensure that these are provided efficiently and effectively.</P>

        <i>Valuation and Ordnance Survey Office.</i>
      </P>
      <P>The 1993 provision shows no percentage variation <i>vis-à-vis</i> the 1992 Estimates. Accordingly, it is envisaged that there will be no significant change in the level of services provided in the current year.</P>
      <P>
        <i>State Laboratory.</i>
      </P>
      <P>Variations in subhead allocations do not reflect any policy changes.  The level of service provided in 1993 will be the same as that provided in 1992.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Office of Public Works.</i>
      </P>
      <P>There are no policy changes underpinning the increases or decreases in the subheads in Vote 10.  It is not anticipated that there will be any significant change in the level of services provided in 1993.</P>

      <Col N="1045" />
      <i>Civil Service Commission.</i>
    </P>
    <P>The decrease in the 1993 pay allocation for the Civil Service Commission results from the winding down of the recent Garda recruitment programme.  The overall increase on the non-pay allocation reflects a lower demand for the Commission's services in 1992 involving fewer large scale written examinations.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Office of the Ombudsman.</i>
    </P>
    <P>Variations in subhead allocations do not reflect any policy changes.  The level of service provided in 1993 will be the same as that provided in 1992.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Office of the Revenue Commissioners.</i>
    </P>
    <P>Any increases/decreases in subhead allocations do not reflect any policy changes for 1993.  Services provided by Revenue in 1993 are expected to be comparable with those provided in 1992.</P>

      <P>To qualify for an old age contributory pension a person must have entered insurance at least ten years before reaching pension age, have at least 156 contributions paid and have a yearly average of at least 20 contributions registered since January 1953 when the unified system of social insurance came into effect, or the time they started insurable employment, if later.</P>
      <P>Social insurance paid before 1953 under the National Health Insurance Acts can be taken into account in satisfying the first two conditions but cannot be used in calculating the yearly average.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The old age contributory pension scheme was introduced in 1961.  Contributions paid by insured persons prior to 1961 did not contain an element in respect of that pension.  However, as a concession and to enable persons reaching pension age at that time to qualify immediately for a contributory pension, contributions paid prior to 1953 were <Col N="1049" /> taken into account in calculating a person's entitlement to pension.  These transitional arrangements operated until 1973.  From that date contributions paid prior to 1953 were no longer counted for the purposes of the satisfying of the yearly average test.  However, they are still reckonable for the other two conditions.</P>
    <P>The whole issue of contribution conditions for social insurance pensions, including the position of persons with gaps in their insurance records due to periods spent looking after a family, are among the issues being addressed by the National Pensions Board in its final report on a new national pensions system.  I expect to receive the board's report shortly and the matter will be considered further in this context.</P>

      <P>Directive 86/613/EEC on equal treatment between men and women engaged in self-employment contains a provision concerning access to social insurance for spouses of self-employed workers which may require amendment of the Social Welfare Acts.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to EC recommendations and regulations adopted during 1991 Regulation (EEC) No.  2195/91 on 25 June 1991 is relevant.  This Regulation concerns the application of social security schemes to employed persons, self-employed <Col N="1052" /> persons and members of their family moving within the European Community and the procedure for implementing such provisions.  The provisions of the Regulations have direct application and are, where appropriate, being applied by my Department.</P>
    <P>There were no other EC Regulations or recommendations relevant to my Department adopted during 1991.</P>
    <P>Finally, with regard to EC Directives which have been signed by the Council but not yet due for transposition into Irish law, EC Directive 92/85/EEC, which was adopted by Council on 19 October 1992, is relevant.  This Directive concerns the introduction of measures to encourage improvement in the safety and health at work of pregnant workers.  Member states are required to implement the provisions of the Directive not later than two year after the date of its adoption.</P>

      <P>Changes in recent years in the range of supports for children under the social welfare system have been designed to direct any available resources in the most effective way to assist families in greatest need, while simplifying as far as possible the range of supports available.</P>
      <P>The rates of child dependant allowances payable with social welfare weekly supports have been increased significantly. Since July 1992 the minimum allowance has been £12.50 per week.  The number of different child dependant allowance payment rates has been reduced from 36 to 3.</P>
      <P>Child dependant allowances in respect of all children up to 18 years are paid with social welfare payments, including short term payments such as unemployment benefit, which is payable for a maximum of 15 months.  However, in recognition of the additional burden of providing for children over 18 in full-time education, particularly for people who are long term dependent on social welfare, the age limit of 18 was raised to 21 in these cases.</P>
      <P>Any proposal to increase the age limit from 18 years for short term payments would have significant cost implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context and having regard to the other demands on available resources.</P>

      <P>In 1989 I extended the free telephone rental allowance scheme to pensioners receiving State pensions from EC member states who are resident in <Col N="1054" /> Ireland.  This extension also applies to pensioners from countries with which we have completed bilateral agreements in relation to social security pensions.</P>
      <P>As a result, British and other EC social security pensioners who are resident here may qualify for a free telephone rental allowance on the same conditions as Irish social welfare pensioners.  The purpose of the scheme is to encourage elderly or disabled persons who are living alone and who are dependent on social welfare-type payments to have a telephone in order to be able to summon help in an emergency. The allowance is not payable in cases where there is another person in the household who is capable of seeking help in such circumstances.</P>

            <entry>Directives 92/114/EEC and 92/97/EEC relate to the Type Approval of motor vehicles.  They are amendments to existing Directives.  To transpose them into Irish law requires an amendment to an existing Statutory Instrument.  As amending Directives are adopted on a regular basis the Statutory Instrument is amended twice a year to incorporate a number of amending Directives.  The Directives listed above will be transposed in the next amending Statutory Instrument which is due in the next few weeks.</entry>

      <P>The overall net increase in the 1993 Estimate for my Department is £6.8 million (2 per cent) compared with the 1992 provisional out-turn as published in the Estimates for Public Services (Abridged Version).</P>
      <P>The principal determining factor in arriving at departmental allocations for 1993 is, as the Deputy is aware, the constraints inherent in the overall budgetary situation, and this accounts for those areas of my Department's Vote which are the subject of a decreased allocation. As far as the individual subheads appropriate to the State agencies under my Department's control are concerned, the management of the amounts allocated would, in each case, be a day-to-day matter for the agency or body concerned. Policy changes are not involved.</P>
      <P>In regard to the training and employment schemes provided by FÁS, it is envisaged that training will be provided for about 14,500 persons which is on a par with 1992.  There will be an increase of 1,500 approximately over 1992 in the number of participants on the social employment scheme, which will bring total participation up to 13,500 approximately in 1993.  The employment subsidy scheme is due to end this month as intended when the scheme was started in February 1992.  The estimates provide for payments to continue in respect of those employees already recruited under the scheme.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Labour Relations Commission, when increases in pay are taken into account the resources available to the Commission in 1993 are the same as 1992.  The level of services provided will therefore continue to be maintained.</P>
      <P>The bulk of the grant to EOLAS for capital services, which shows an increase of £1.5 million to £4 million, is ear-marked for the building of a modern national metrology laboratory which will provide improved services to industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reduction of £5.568 million in the Estimates for the Science and Technology Development Programme is compensated by an additional £13 million <Col N="1070" /> which is being provided directly for the first time this year by the Commission of the European Communities towards expenditure by industrial firms under this programme so that total expenditure under the programme will show an increase.</P>

      <P>I understand that the partnership company established under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> in the Coolock/Darndale area was paid £109,600 by the Department of the Taoiseach in respect of the company's administrative and running expenses over the period 1991 and 1992.</P>
      <P>The role of the partnership companies is to assist the long term unemployed in their areas to secure employment, placement on a training or education programme or set up their own enterprises. In addition the companies promote economic projects and initiatives likely to generate jobs at a local level.  In 1992, the partnership company in the Coolock/ Darndale area dealt with 720 unemployed people.  The number of unemployed people placed on education courses was 390; 57 unemployed people were placed on training courses; 37 unemployed people were placed on employment programmes; and 13 unemployed people took up self employment.</P>

      <P>The authority has already repaid a sum of £1.35 million to my Department, in addition to securing the redevelopment of a substantial portion of the site.

      <P>Following conviction for offences under sections 49 and 56 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961 the court ordered that this person be disqualified for holding a driving licence for 12 months and further ordered that his driving licence be endorsed with the particulars of his disqualification. Section 37 of the Act requires that, where a person's driving licence has been so endorsed, there must elapse a continuous period of not less <Col N="1072" /> than three years or a series of discontinuous periods of not less than five years during which such person has lawfully held a driving licence before that person may be granted a licence free of endorsement.  This person held a one year licence from 8 May 1989 to 7 May 1990 and took out a three year licence on 15 April 1991.  He will accordingly be entitled to a licence free of endorsement on 15 April 1994.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the improvement and maintenance of non-national roads rests with the local authority concerned. The costs of such works fall to be financed by the local authority from its own resources, supplemented by the discretionary grant provided annually by my <Col N="1081" /> Department.  The determination of priorities in the expenditure of these grants is entirely a matter for the local authority.  Galway County Council received £4.683 million in discretionary grants in 1992.</P>
      <P>Special grants are occasionally made available to local authorities for projects on non-national roads.  However, as I have attempted to maximise the extent to which grants for regional and county roads are provided on a block-grant discretionary basis, so as to give local authorities greater control over their use, the funds available for special grants are necessarily limited.  In 1992, such grants came to less than £6 million out of a total provision of £267.48 million for road grants.</P>
      <P>The selection of non-national road projects for special road grants in 1993 will be made in the light of the overall level of road grant provision, the competing demands for grants for this type of project throughout the country, and the need for compliance with the criteria for European Regional Development Fund assistance under the Operational Programme on Peripherality.  I hope shortly to be in a position to notify local authorities of their road grant allocations for 1993.</P>

    <P>The expanded local authority housing programme in 1993 and the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to an appropriate long term building programme are designed to reduce the pressure on waiting lists to the greatest extent possible over the life of the Government.  I am satisfied that the <Col N="1089" /> enlarged programme, together with the full development by local authorities of the other measures introduced in &ldquo;A Plan for Social Housing&rdquo;, will result in a significant increase in the extent to which social housing needs are met.  Since a range of social, economic and demographic features influence the number of households on waiting lists at any given time, it is not possible to speculate on what that number might be in 1997.</P>

      <P>Local authorities have the duty both of regulating activities impinging on the environment and providing environmental services.  In the latter capacity, the greatest requirement for capital investment arises under the Water and Sanitary Services Programme for which, in 1993, some £79 million has been provided in the Estimates just published.  A significant amount of this will be dedicated to pollution prevention and control purposes.</P>

      <P>The report of the committee established to carry out that review was published on 1 July, 1992.  Because of the extent of the changes recommended and the high level of interest in the matter, I allowed a period for interested persons and bodies to consider the issue and make submissions to me.  A total of 85 submissions were made.  Subsequent to their receipt I held detailed discussions with representatives of interest groups, including hackney operators.  The recommendations of the review committee do not represent the only way forward and I am at present considering a range of options taking into account the views which have been expressed to me.  I do not intend to introduce any fundamental changes to the regulations which relate to the relationship between hackney and taxi operations until such time as I have completed my consideration of those options.</P>

      <P>Under the Environment Action Programme, an Environmental Information <Col N="1095" /> Service (ENFO) has been established by my Department as an easily accessible source of appealing and authoritative information on all aspects of the environment.  ENFO is well advanced in establishing a country-wide network through the county library service.  Separately, my Department publishes a quarterly Environment Bulletin and periodic reports and other documents on environmental topics.  The range of publications available on environmental matters is kept under review in the light of needs and resources, and account is taken in this context of what is available elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The needs of cyclists are fully considered in the formulation of road policy. Under section 68 of the Roads Bill, 1991, which is currently before the House, local authorities will be able to construct or provide cycleways reserved for the exclusive use of cyclists, or pedestrians and cyclists.  This power will be in addition to the provisions in the Road Traffic Acts dealing with cycle priority measures on public roads.  The Interim Report of the Dublin Transportation Initiative, which was published recently, recommends, subject to further evaluation, that a network of cycle routes/lanes should be identified throughout the Dublin area.</P>

      <P>The Government's plans for responding to housing needs are set out in the Programme for a Partnership Government. The programme states clearly that the aim of all the Government's policies will be to reduce pressure on local authority waiting lists to the greatest extent possible. In particular, the Government is committed to speeding up implementation of the Plan for Social Housing and to making a much more substantial provision for local authority housing.  Thus the local authority housing programme is being expanded to 3,500 &ldquo;starts&rdquo; or acquisitions in 1993 and the necessary financial provision for this is included in the Estimates for Public Services, 1993. Additional resources are also being provided for the other measures introduced in &ldquo;A Plan for Social Housing&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I am aware that some fishermen may be opposed to the introduction of further restriction on the use of particular types of fishing gear. However, it is most important to stress that fish stocks in the Irish Sea in particular are seriously in decline and that this problem has to be addressed as a matter of urgency.  The Department of the Marine is currently considering how the present difficulties can be resolved in order to ensure a sustainable livelihood for the fishermen concerned.</P>
      <P>Multi rig trawling, to which the Deputy refers, is a method of fishing that is at present being reviewed, along with other methods, in the context of an examination of stock levels in the Irish Sea.  In the light of that review, including consultation with fishermens' organisations, it may be necessary to take measures, which might include restrictions on certain types of gear, in order to conserve and protect stocks that are now under threat.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will note that the layout of the Marine Vote (No. 30) has been changed this year to provide for far greater clarity in relation to the activities of the Department of the Marine.  The Vote has been organised into programmes, as follows:</P>
      <P>&mdash;Administration</P>
      <P>&mdash;Marine Safety and Shipping</P>
      <P>&mdash;Harbour Development and Coast Protection</P>
      <P>&mdash;Marine Research</P>
      <P>&mdash;Sea Fisheries and Aquaculture Development</P>
      <P>&mdash;Inland Fisheries</P>
      <P>&mdash;Other Services.</P>
      <P>I am glad to advise the Deputy that, notwithstanding the general budgetary situation, the major programme of improvement in marine safety and emergency infrastructure of the State which has been ongoing for the last number of years will continue in 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is reflected in the 9 per cent <Col N="1106" /> increase in provision for Marine Safety and Shipping Services and also in the salaries and wages figure of the Department's administrative budget where allowance is made for staffing a greatly up-graded rescue co-ordination and emergency response capability.</P>
    <P>In relation to Harbour Development funded from the Vote, the 1993 allocation shows a 12 per cent increase which will facilitate further development.  A major component of this programme is expenditure in Dún Laoghaire Harbour.</P>
    <P>Marine Research &mdash; which I regard as a key element in the development of our marine resources &mdash; sees a very large increase of 69 per cent and this reflects implementation of the EC STRIDE (Science &amp; Technology for Regional Innovation and Development in Europe) programme.  This programme will bring about a major improvement in the State's marine research capacities.</P>
    <P>The Sea Fisheries and Aquaculture Development programme represents support for the fishing industry including the development of infrastructure at the State's Fishery Harbour Centres.  Taken as a whole, funding is increased by 8 per cent and this again represents the Government's commitment to the development of this sector of the economy. Within this programme, economies will be called for in the current operations of BIM, as well as curtailment of BIM loans to fishermen.</P>
    <P>The Inland Fisheries programme remains at its 1992 level, whilst the Shipping Investment Grants programme is now wound down having represented a useful aid to that sector in recent years.</P>

If so, ownership of Keel Lough would have passed to the Land Commission on the dissolution of the CDB in 1923 and, therefore, my Department would have the normal responsibilities at common law and by statute, including the Land Acts, concomitant with ownership.

      <P>In common with our European partners Ireland has seen a long term decline in the number of people employed in agriculture.  The table shows that the decline in this country has not been as severe as elsewhere and that the number currently working in agriculture in Ireland remains high by European Community standards.</P>

    <P>Although some downward trend in agricultural employment is likely to continue, <Col N="1121" /> this need not be the case as regards rural employment generally.  With the help of various schemes operated by the European Community, the Government is endeavouring to facilitate the creation of a vibrant rural community giving those who wish to live in rural areas the opportunity to have a standard of living comparable with other areas of the country.</P>
    <P>The existence of a vibrant rural community is only possible if there are enough opportunities for work and enterprise for those living there.  This does not necessarily have to be directly in agriculture and many of the rural enterprise measures are concerned with promoting alternative uses for land and finding sustainable employment for people in rural areas.  These measures include providing assistance to groups and individuals for agri-tourism and the LEADER Community initiative for rural based enterprises. At the same time the Government and the European Community are helping to improve the livelihoods of those working in agriculture through such measures as the headage grants schemes and other premia.</P>
    <P>These and other measures will help to improve the employment position in rural areas.  It would be my aim to ensure that the numbers employed in those areas will be at least maintained and that standards of living will continue to improve.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for remaining within our allocated EC milk quota is a matter for the dairy industry itself.  Under the quota system operated by Ireland, milk quota is allocated to milk purchasers.  While my Department monitors the national position on the basis of milk intake information received from purchasers, the purchaser is responsible for the management of that quota and thus for the transmission to individual producers of information on an ongoing basis regarding his/her quota position.  Each individual producer has an allocated milk quota and a decision by that producer to deliver milk in excess of that quota involves making an assumption that other producers will deliver less than their entitlement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The surge in milk production during Autumn 1992 which has given rise to our over-quota position at present is due to a number of factors including favourable weather, under production during the earlier part of the year and the incentive provided by buoyant milk prices.  The fact that super levy was not incurred in the previous three years may also have caused producers to disregard the warnings issued in relation to their quota position. I have no reason to believe that the quota monitoring arrangements, either nationally or at purchaser level, contributed to the increased production.  The current milk year will not end until 31 March and so it is not possible at this stage to say what the super levy liability will turn out to be.  Action can still be <Col N="1123" /> taken by producers to reduce their potential liability for levy and they should keep in close contact with their purchasers between now and the end of March.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the continuing drop in the application of ground limestone by farmers in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1141" /> My Department and Teagasc have continuously encouraged farmers to take soil samples regularly and have the requisite amount of lime applied.  Subsidies were used in the past to help farmers reach the desired level of lime usage and they were successful in this regard.  Lime is a relatively low-cost farm input and its beneficial effect continues to act on the soil for a number of years.  It is therefore disappointing that farmers have failed to maintain the lime status of land.  I am keeping the question of the lime status of soils under review.</P>
    <P>The funds available to me are being used to support the most pressing needs of agriculture and there is no scope for the reintroduction of a lime subsidy at this time.</P>

      <P>The <i>Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-97</i> acknowledges that national economic growth is crucially linked to the generation of foreign earnings, through both increased exports of goods and services and the attraction of greater numbers of tourists from outside the State.  The Government's commitment to these tasks is reflected in the establishment of the new Department of Tourism and Trade and in the 1993 Book of Estimates.</P>
      <P>I have already set out in some detail in a speech last Thursday, 18th February, policy objectives which I have set for An Bord Tráchtála whose grant-in-aid is up 11% on last year's level enabling them:</P>
      <P>(a)  to run what will be the biggest promotional programme ever undertaken by the Bord.</P>
      <P>(b)  to develop new markets and reduce dependency on the UK, to be achieved through, <i>inter alia,</i> the acceleration of their Regional Markets Programme</P>
      <P>(c)  to intensify work with indigenous companies;</P>
      <P>(d)  to increase the emphasis on the placement of marketing personnel abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Programme for a Partnership Government also has a clearly-stated aim <Col N="1146" /> to increase tourism related foreign earnings by 50 per cent in real terms and thus provide an additional 35,000 jobs in the Irish economy.  My immediate priorities are to ensure that the sector remains on line for growth this year and to prepare the case for increased support for tourism development in the next round of EC Structural Funds along the lines already set out in the Programme for a Partnership Government.</P>

      <P>Seo ábhar a bhaineann go príomha le RTE.</P>
      <P>RTE is aware that residents in the Droumanasig/Bonane area of Kenmare have been experiencing TV reception difficulties. At present service is provided by two community-owned TV self-help schemes, one in Droumanasig and the other in Bonane.  These schemes were grant-aided by RTE.  Both areas are very low in population density and extremely difficult to service with quality TV signals due to the nature of the local topography.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>RTE report that the self-help schemes have fallen into a state of very poor repair giving degraded signals.  Notwithstanding that the systems are community owned, RTE has undertaken, as a first step, to upgrade the Droumanasig system which covers the higher population area of approximately 70 homes.  This work is now in hand and RTE report that local residents have been kept fully informed. It is expected to have the improvements carried out by the end of May next.  RTE also proposes to assist with improving <Col N="1158" /> signal quality in the case of the Bonane system.</P>

      <P>A range of health information/education initiatives are in place to reduce cigarette smoking among young people and specifically among young women.</P>
      <P>Just this morning I launched a major new Health Promotion Unit anti-smoking campaign targeted specifically, but not exclusively, at young people.  The campaign is a multi-media one using TV, radio and outdoor advertising.  Particular use will be made of local radio to maintain a high profile for the campaign throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Last week I launched the 1993 &ldquo;Health is Lookin' Good&rdquo; health messages competition for first and second-level schools. Smoking is one of the themes on which entries are being sought.</P>
      <P>My Department's Health Promotion Unit is engaged jointly with the Department of Education and the Irish Cancer Society in an anti-smoking initiative for young people called SCRAP &mdash; Smoking Cessation and Reduction Action Programme. This pilot project is using a peer-led approach whereby pupils themselves choose other young people who are then given information, skills and leadership training to enable them to return to school with the skills necessary to discourage smoking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Smoking is also addressed in a substance abuse prevention project being piloted in a number of Dublin second-level schools by the Health Promotion Unit in conjunction with the Department of Education and the Mater Dei Institute. Both these pilot projects are being evaluated.  If they prove successful it is my intention to have them disseminated nationwide.  In addition to these initiatives <Col N="1159" /> many of the health boards have school health education programmes which address, <i>inter alia,</i> the issue of smoking.</P>
    <P>Posters specifically designed to highlight the unaesthetic effects of smoking for young women are available from my Department's Health Promotion Unit. Some of these were designed in consultation with the Council for the Status of Women.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive data base on young people's knowledge, attitudes and behaviour in relation to smoking is necessary if we are to monitor smoking trends and target programmes effectively.  For this reason the Health Promotion Unit has commissioned the Economic and Social Research Institute to carry out a major national survey on this issue among 12-18 year olds.  Incidentally the survey is also gathering similar information on alcohol use.  The fieldwork for the survey is being completed this week.</P>

      <P>The position in relation to the bed situation at the Meath Hospital is that all of the in-patient beds are open and in use.  In addition, the hospital has eight day beds in operation which allows suitable priority elective work to proceed.  The Deputy will be pleased to learn that within the last two weeks the hospital has been able to transfer sixteen long-stay patients to more appropriate facilities as a result of the initiative which I took to relieve the pressure on in-patient beds. £500,000 was made available to the Eastern Health Board to fund additional places in nursing homes in order to relieve pressure on acute hospital beds.</P>
      <P>On 1 July next the hospital will open a geriatric assessment rehabilitation unit with twenty dedicated beds for the care of elderly patients.  This unit will be under the care of a newly appointed consultant geriatrician.  Additional paramedical staff have also been approved by my Department for this unit.</P>
      <P>In relation to waiting lists, the Deputy will be aware that the Government is providing £20 million to tackle the waiting list problem generally.  The objective is to eliminate all waiting lists in excess of twelve months in the areas of orthopaedic surgery, ophthalmology, ear, nose and throat, cardiac surgery, vascular surgery and plastic surgery and in excess of 6 months for children awaiting ENT or eye treatment.  This initiative will improve the situation in relation to waiting lists in the Meath Hospital and other hospitals throughout the country.</P>

      <P>Of the health centres listed above the following were constructed since 1971: Arklow, Barndarrig, Blessington, Donard, Greystones, Knockananna, Shillelagh and Wicklow &mdash; incorporated in the new administrative headquarters. In addition, extensive renovations are currently being carried out to the health centre in Newtownmountkennedy.</P>
      <P>With regard to the health centre in Carnew, this building, while small, is structurally sound and well decorated and maintained.  The need to provide additional accommodation is being examined by the Eastern Health Board.</P>
      <P>In relation to the health centre at Roundwood the health board has obtained full planning permission for the erection of a new health centre.  They expect that work will commence on this centre later this year.</P>
      <P>At present health services in Bray are provided from three strategic locations. These are:&mdash; (1) Strand Road where improvements costing up to £7,000 were carried out; (2) Saint Cronans which was acquired recently from Bray UDC.  There are two separate modern buildings fitted out as dental suites with modern up-to-date equipment and (3) Killarney Road; the building here is in good repair and has recently been painted internally and externally.</P>

      <P>In reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 182 and 183 of 16 February, 1993 I have already detailed the number, salary and qualifications of the staff I propose to appoint to my private office.  The positions were not advertised.  They require the agreement of the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, if appropriate, the sanction of the Department of Finance and, as they are not civil servants, excluding orders from the Civil Service Commissioners pursuant to section 5 of the Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956.  I am not in a position to give details of the contracts of employment as they have not yet been finalised.  The role of my proposed partnership programme manager will be to monitor the implementation of the Programme for a Partnership Government. The role of my proposed special adviser will be to advise me on a wide range of matters in relation to the health services.</P>

      <P>I would like to explain that the provision of an out-patient appointment is a clinical decision for the consultant concerned. Priority is given to urgent cases.  If a patient's condition is causing concern it would be a matter for his or her general practitioner to contact the consultant concerned with a view to obtaining an earlier appointment-date.</P>
      <P>I am aware, however, that delays have arisen for some orthopaedic patients in Cork.  The Deputy will be interested to learn that approval was given to the Southern Health Board last year to provide for new clean air theatre facilities at St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital, Gurranebraher.  A project team has been established and the planning process is under way.  I am confident that this development will improve services for orthopaedic patients in Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the health priorities of this Government is to tackle waiting lists.  In this context, £20 million will be provided in 1993 for a major action programme to <Col N="1166" /> reduce waiting lists, including orthopaedic waiting lists.  I am hopeful that this initiative will play an important part in alleviating problems which have arisen for patients in Cork and elsewhere.</P>

      <P>For the past few years special additional allocations have been provided specifically for the development of orthodontic services. As a result health boards have been able to increase their levels of orthodontic service provision.  At current levels of treatment health boards are completing over 5,000 cases annually.</P>

Disabled person's maintenance allowance &mdash;disabled person's maintenance allowance&mdash;is a means-tested scheme of allowances operated by the health boards.  The means test for disabled person's maintenance allowance for disabled people living at home is significantly more favourable than that applying under social assistance schemes.  Under disabled person's maintenance allowance the value of board and lodgings provided by the parents is not taken into account in assessing income whereas such benefits are taken into account in the case of social assistance schemes.</P>

      <P>The following press statement released by me today will give the Deputy the information he requested in relation to out-patient and in-patient charges and charges for private and semi-private accommodation in public hospitals in 1993.</P>
      <P>There are no public beds in private hospitals.  Persons occupying a private or semi-private bed in a public hospital may, in addition to the appropriate maintenance charges for private or semi-private accommodation, be liable for the charge of £15 per day or part of a day (£20 from 1 March 1993) for the first 10 days in any 12 months, subject to the same exemptions and limitations as apply to patients in public beds.</P>
      <P Just="Center">Press Release</P>
      <P Just="Center">Public Hospital Charges</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health, Mr. Brendan Howlin, TD., has announced changes in out-patient and in-patient charges and for private and semi-private accommodation in public hospitals as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>
        <i>Out-Patient Charge</i>
      </P>
      <P>From 1st March, 1993 the existing out-patient charge of £10 in respect of the first visit for any particular medical condition will be replaced by a charge of £6 for each visit, subject to a maximum liability of £42 per individual in any period of twelve consecutive months commencing on 1st March, 1993.  The £6 charge will cover all out-patient services availed of in the course of a single visit.</P>
      <P>
        <i>In-Patient Charge</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current hospital in-patient charge of £15 per day, subject to a limitation of £150 per individual in any period of twelve consecutive months, will be <Col N="1171" /> increased to £20 per day from 1st March 1993 and the maximum liability per individual will be increased to £200 in any period of twelve consecutive months.</P>
    <P>The Minister is concerned that the in-patient charge, as applied at present, can have a disproportionate impact on persons admitted to hospital for very short stays&mdash;for example an individual admitted in the evening and discharged the following morning is charged for two days.  He has instructed his Department to carry out a review of the current Regulations and to report back to him as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Discretion of Chief Executive Officers of Health Boards</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Minister has asked the Chief Executive Officers of health boards to be mindful of the provision under which in-patient and out-patient charges may be waived where undue hardship would otherwise be caused, particularly in cases where a number of members of the one family are subject to the charges within the same twelve month period.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Exemptions</i>
    </P>
    <P>A significant number of people are exempt from these charges.  The following categories of persons are exempt:</P>
    <P>(i)  Medical card holders and their dependants.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Women receiving services in respect of motherhood.</P>
    <P>(iii)  Children up to the age of six weeks.</P>
    <P>(iv)  Children suffering from diseases or disabilities prescribed under Section 52 (2) of the Health Act, 1970, e.g. mental handicap, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, cerebral palsy.</P>
    <P>(v)  Children referred for treatment from a child health clinic or a school health examination.</P>
    <P>(vi)  Persons receiving services in respect of infectious diseases prescribed under the Health Act, 1947.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1172" /> (vii)  Persons deemed to have full eligibility by a Chief Executive Officer under Section 45 (7) of the Health Act, 1970.</P>
    <P>(viii)  Persons in receipt of long term care in geriatric, psychiatric or mental handicap institutions.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Charges for Private and Semi-Private Accommodation</i>
    </P>
    <P>Daily charges for private and semi-private accommodation in public hospitals will be increased by £20 per day from 1 July 1993.  The new rates of charges will be as follows:</P>

      <P>Under section 54 of the Health Act, 1970 a dependent person, instead of accepting <Col N="1173" /> services made available by the health board, may have such services provided in a hospital or home approved by the Minister.  A number of nursing homes are approved to receive section 54 subvention at a rate of £52.15 per person per week.</P>
      <P>A health board may also make arrangements under section 26 of the Health Act, 1970 to subvent dependent elderly persons in private nursing homes. This subvention is paid by arrangement between the health board and the nursing homes.  There is no fixed rate of subvention paid under section 26.  The rate of subvention paid may very with the circumstances of the patient and the care provided by the nursing home.</P>
      <P>There are about 4,600 persons in nursing homes who are receiving section 54 or section 26 subventions.  Most elderly people in receipt of a subvention from a health board have a medical card.</P>
      <P>The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 provides for a new system for the payment of subvention in respect of dependent elderly persons who require nursing home care but who cannot afford to pay for it.  It is my intention to commence the Nursing Homes Act and bring the new system of subvention into effect later this year.</P>

      <P>The rate of subvention in a nursing home approved by the Minister for the payment of subvention under section 54 of the Health Act, 1970 is £52.15 per week in respect of each subvented person.  This rate is the same whether the patient is receiving short-stay convalescent care or long-stay care.</P>
      <P>Health boards may also make arrangements to subvent dependent persons under section 26 of the Health Act, 1970. This subvention is paid by arrangement between health boards and nursing homes.  There is no fixed rate of subvention paid under this section.  Rates vary with the circumstances of the patient and the care provided by nursing homes and the duration of the subvention may also vary depending on circumstances.</P>
      <P>Under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, a health board may pay a subvention to a person who requires nursing care and who is unable to afford it, following an assessment by the health boards of the person's dependency, means and circumstances.  The subvention may be paid towards the cost of care in a nursing home registered by a health board.  It is my intention to commence the Act and introduce the new system of subvention later this year.</P>

The association has, however, been in receipt since 1989 of grant-aid to assist in the areas of coaching, equipment, administration and special projects.</P>
      <P>The application will again be considered in the context of the 1993 provision for sport.</P>

      <P>The educational needs of children with specific learning disability, sometimes referred to as dyslexia, are generally met within the ordinary school system, employing a variety of <Col N="1190" /> approaches to suit individual needs, with the help, where appropriate, of remedial teachers.</P>
      <P>There are 945 remedial teacher posts assigned to national schools and 71 per cent of pupils in the county attending such schools have the services of a remedial teacher.</P>
      <P>I am currently examining the scope for the deployment of additional teaching resources to children with special educational needs and the appointment of additional remedial teachers will form a key element in this consideration.</P>
      <P>In this connection, the Programme for a Partnership Government provides for the recruitment of 500 remedial teachers by September 1996.</P>
      <P>The needs of children with a more acute specific learning disability are met by three special schools, two in Dublin and one in Cork.</P>

      <P>The 1993 gross provision of nearly £1,784 million for education in the recently published Abridged Estimates Volume represents an increase of almost £137 million or 8.3 per cent on the 1992 outturn.  This increase indicates a strong Government commitment to education and has been spread as equitably as possible over the three different education levels.</P>
      <P>The increase will enable me to address my major priority as the Minister for Education <i>viz.</i> combating disadvantage in the Education system.  The 1993 provision will enable me to target additional resources to help those suffering most from disadvantage.  This includes additional capital funding to upgrade school buildings and ensure that the physical conditions in which children are taught are improved as a matter of priority.</P>
      <P>The other main areas that will benefit from the increased resources available in 1993 are reform of the curriculum, third level student support, primary management bodies, publications in Irish, youth and sports organisations and marketing Ireland as an international education centre.</P>

      <P>Intake policy is primarily a matter for school management subject to acceptable criteria being applied.  It would be expected that priority would be given to pupils who are resident in and attend primary schools within the school's own catchment area.</P>
      <P>Dunboyne is located within the greater Dublin Post-primary catchment area for accommodation and full transport purposes. While the two second-level schools referred to by the Deputy have traditionally catered for Dunboyne pupils the management authorities of those schools would not be under any obligation to do so.</P>

      <Col N="1193" /> The other second level schools which currently cater for the majority of pupils leaving primary schools in Dunboyne are: Coolmine Community School, Dominican Convent, Cabra, St. Declan's CBS, Navan Road, and schools in Dublin City.</P>
