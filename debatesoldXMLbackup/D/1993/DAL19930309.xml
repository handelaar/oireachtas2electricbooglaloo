      <P>Before proceeding with our business today I feel sure that Members would wish very much to join me in extending a most warm welcome to the Prime Minister of New Zealand, Mr. Jim Bolger, his wife, Joan, and their entourage.  May their visit to us be very happy, successful and memorable. They have returned to the land of their forebears and we are very proud to extend to them a most hearty céad míle fáilte &mdash; a hundred thousand welcomes.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3 together.  I am arranging to have a schedule circulated in the Official Report which sets out the arrangements for ministerial commitments for the St. Patrick's Day period.  I will not be participating in any St. Patrick's Day parades during my forthcoming visit to the United States. I will, however, be undertaking a full programme of other engagements on St. Patrick's Day including, as indicated in reply to parliamentary questions on 2 March, a meeting with President Clinton. I will also be attending the second meeting of the Ireland-America Economic Advisory Board, meeting Mr. Thomas Foley, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and attending a function on Capitol Hill organised by the Friends of Ireland in Congress which will afford an opportunity for discussion with leading figures in both Houses of the US Congress.</P>
      <P>Ministers fully understand that St. Patrick's Day parades have a particular significance for Irish people and people of Irish descent.  Such occasions provide an opportunity for Ministers going abroad to promote Ireland as an attractive and profitable location for investment, for trade and for tourism.  It is on that basis that successive Governments have been represented at St. Patrick's Day parades over the years.</P>

      <P>We must have a major representation by Ministers and Ministers of State abroad if the information has to be given to the Dáil by way of a schedule rather than giving us the details.  Will the Taoiseach give the House an idea of the cost of sending his team of Ministers abroad for St. Patrick's Day?  Will he outline the central purpose of these visits?  Will the Ministers, and Ministers of State, be presenting in discussions in the United States and elsewhere a coherent line on Northern Ireland policy and what will be that line?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Answers such as those required to these questions are usually given by way of a schedule.  I have answered the second part of the Deputy's question &mdash; going abroad provides Ministers with the opportunity to promote Ireland as an attractive and profitable location for investment, trade and tourism. That should be very clear.  It has always been the practice of Governments down the years to avail of the opportunity at St. Patrick's Day for Ministers to go abroad in response to the many requests from all parts of the world for ministerial presence at St. Patrick's Day parades. There is no question but that a very coherent policy in relation to the Government's position on Northern Ireland is in existence.</P>

      <P>While not wishing to appear too penny-pinching I would like to raise with the Taoiseach the part of my supplementary question to which he did not reply.  Has the Taoiseach any idea as to the approximate cost of representation abroad on St. Patrick's Day? It is only by having such information we can assess whether it is cost effective, if he has not this information is the House to take it that he has authorised all these visits abroad without any consideration of cost?</P>

We cannot be represented at all parades but we consider those that are most strategic, and everybody has accepted that the exercise is well worthwhile.  I am sure the Deputy had no reservations, in his time in Government, about his colleagues going abroad to participate in St. Patrick's Day parades.</P>

Major questions which had not been settled in relation to other institutions and which comprised an ongoing controversy about the seats of the principal Community institutions, the Parliament, the Commission and the Council, were settled at Edinburgh and that opens the way for further discussions at Copenhagen.

Is maith liom an deis seo a fháil chun focal nó dhó a rá faoi cheist na Gaeilge sna himeachtaí seo uile.  Faoi mar is eol do Theachtaí, bhí sé mar thraidisiún riamh ag Aire na Gaeltachta ceisteanna Dála a bhain lena chúraimí féin a fhreagairt as Gaeilge.  Tá sé i gceist agam go leanfar leis an nós imeachta sin.</P>

    <P>Tá dearbhú tugtha sa Chlár le haghaidh Rialtais Chomhpháirtíochta go mbunófar Teilifís na Gaeilge.

Tuigim gur leor an tsuirn sin chun íoc as an obair a d'fhéadfaí a chur i gcrích sa bhliain reatha.  Meastar go gcosnóidh sé £7.5 mhilliún eile chun an gréasán craolta a iomlánú.</P>

    <P>Faoi mar atá leagtha síos sa Chlár le haghaidh Rialtais Chomhpháirtíochta, tá sé ar intinn agam gur i nGaeltacht Chonamara a bheidh a ceanncheathrú ag an tseirbhís nua, a chuirfidh idir dhá agus trí uair a chloig de chláracha do pháistí agus do dhaoine fásta ar fáil in aghaidh an lae ag na hamanna den lá is mó a oireann don lucht féachana.</P>
    <P>Go dtí go mbeidh tuairisc faighte ar ais agam on mheitheal oibre, ní feidir liom meastachán cinnte a thabhairt faoin túsdáta craolta.  B'fhearr liom féin, ar ndóigh, go gcuirfí tús leis an tseirbhís i mbliana ach níl sé sin indéanta anois.  Tá súil agam, áfach, go gcuirfear tús leis an gcraoladh an bhliain seo chugainn.  I dtuarascáil a réitigh Údarás na Gaeltachta i 1989, measadh go gcuirfeadh seirbhís den chineál atá i gceist fostaíocht ar fáil do 200 duine san earnáil phríobháideach, a bhformhór sa Ghaeltacht.  Toisc gur seirbhís don tír uile atá beartaithe anois cuirfidh sí deiseanna fostaíochta ar fáil taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht freisin.</P>
    <P>Céim an-tábhachtach í seo, ní amháin i saol na Gaeilge agus i bhforbairt chultúrtha agus infrastruchtúir na Gaeltachta, ach i bhforbairt an chraolacháin sa tír freisin.  Chomh maith leis na craolta Gaeilge beidh fáil ar an gcainéal nua seo do chraolta eile chun leas an phobail, <Col N="1005" /> craolta oideachasúla, forbartha agus parlaiminteacha a chur ar fáil.</P>

      <P>Tógfaidh mé Ceisteanna 13, 14 agus 31 le chéile.</P>
      <P>The current Order under section 31 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, was made on 6 January 1993, came into effect on 20 January 1993 and is due to expire on 19 January 1994.  Section 31 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, does not empower the Minister to modify or suspend an existing order under the section while it remains in force.</P>
      <P>It is no secret that I have little enthusiasm for restrictions on broadcasters in the coverage of news and current affairs. The issue of the renewal or otherwise of the section 31 order is complex in regard to the central issue of the restrictions themselves and to the timing and perceptions of any change in policy which might be contemplated.  It is an issue to which I will be devoting careful consideration in conjuction with my Government colleagues at the appropriate time.</P>
      <P>I will also be giving careful consideration to the appropriateness in current circumstances of the provisions of section 31 itself, which were enshrined in legislation 17 years ago, when formulating my proposals for broadcasting structures in the long term.</P>

      <P>As the Minister has indirectly pointed out, there has been no debate on section 31 for the past 16 years despite the fact that it has been renewed every year since it was amended 16 years ago.  Would the Minister undertake to provide some opportunity for the House to debate this matter before the time for renewal comes around again at the end of this year, bearing in mind that the House will probably go into recess by the middle of December and will not return until after this order is renewed once more?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me also put it to the Minister that circumstances have changed fairly significantly in that at the time section 31 was introduced in its amended form 16 years ago we did not have an Incitement to Hatred Act which now precludes people from going on radio or television or writing in the newspapers to publicly <Col N="1010" /> incite people to acts of violence because of religion or politics.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The points raised by the Deputy are certainly points that should be borne in mind.  I will be reviewing section 31, particularly in terms of its broadcasting impact and appropriateness, when I am reviewing the whole structure of broadcasting.  I intend to do that as quickly as possible given that, as the House will appreciate, I have been very busy for the last few weeks and moving with great speed.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Minister's invitation to use Private Members' time to debate this issue, but it is not an answer to the question of the need to have this matter debated in depth by the House.  Having it debated in Private Members' time risks posturing of one kind or another.  Perhaps the Minister would consider establishing a secondary legislation committee which would review not just this regulation but the many hundreds of regulations automatically made by this House every year without any debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also draw the Minister's attention to the fact that the practice in Northern Ireland where a similar restriction applies is that people who would be restricted from speaking on political matters in the North on BBC or UTV are not prevented from speaking on trade union matters or local government matters. <Col N="1011" /> That is one reform the Minister could make with regard to section 31.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>My inclination is to provide an opportunity for a thorough and wide ranging debate when I am reviewing broadcasting.  On the second matter raised by Deputy De Rossa, apart from the general issue, there is the specific issue of practice which again is a point that needs to be looked at.  I am conscious that the question of the Minister with responsibility for broadcasting interfering in a programming function should be treated with the greatest of care; programming function is exercised by RTE.  There are, in turn, matters of the actual exercise of that function which are being resolved by the courts. Certainly when I come to review the whole question of the general principle and its operations I will be affording Deputies plenty of opportunity of addressing that and other issues.</P>

      <P>Tógfaidh me Ceist 15 agus Ceist 49 le chéile.  I want to compliment the Deputy on the comprehensiveness of her question and on her personal sympathy and interest in the matters addressed therein.</P>
      <P>The question of the perception of the role of the artist in society is a very important one.  I believe that the arts and culture sector is now recognised as a dynamic and important aspect of our social, spiritual and economic life.  For instance, artists today are increasingly regarded as self-employed persons and are treated on that basis.  This creates certain problems.  Under social welfare legislation, artists pay the same social insurance contribution as other self-employed people, i.e. Class S.  This contribution covers them for old age contributory pension, widows contributory pension and orphans' contributory allowance. Similarly, in terms of health care, artists are covered on the same basis as any other resident of this State.</P>
      <P>However, although there has been an improvement in the status of the artist in recent years I believe that, because of the special nature of the work they do and the often precarious nature of their livelihood, there is a need for additional supports. I am happy to offer the Deputy an assurance that I will be examining this question in the coming months.</P>
      <P>With regard to generation of jobs through the arts, the Programme for a Partnership Government explicitly states that the arts will be part of overall job creation strategy.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that there is very solid evidence of how easily &mdash; and, by comparative terms, cheaply &mdash; jobs are created in the arts.  Also money is circulated through the local economy with a very strong multiplier effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have long held the view that the arts can provide rewarding sustainable <Col N="1013" /> employment at a lower cost than other sectors of the economy, and that investment in the arts has significant benefits to other sectors such as tourism.  Therefore, without in any way compromising the integrity and the special nature of artistic endeavours, I will be keen to maximise the economic benefits that accrue to the State from the activity of artists and I will be particularly keen to develop the potential for employment.  To this end all the appropriate facilities of the State will be engaged, including the expertise of an Bord Tráchtála.</P>
    <P>It is my determination to enhance the perception of the role of artists in society and increase respect for the work they do while at the same time integrating them into the dynamics of our economic life where they have so much to offer.  I believe that this approach will help artists realise their full potential in conditions of reasonable security while playing their full part in the life of the nation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Minister for his very comprehensive reply and for his kind comments.  What he has said covers a great deal of what I asked in the question.  I am glad to hear that he is having a fresh look at security of health cover and pensions for artists because to date it has been very precarious and has done nothing at all to encourage practising artists.</P>
      <P>Having said that, let me ask about two matters arising out of the remainder of my questions.  One related to the provision of proper facilitative workshops for artists in the regions.  There is a provision here in Dublin at the old fire station.  Would the Minister agree that similar provision should be made in the regions.  If a young graduate in print-making in the city of Cork wants to set up there, there are no facilities to do that. There are similar examples in every other city outside of Dublin.  Also, can the Minister say how we would plan to engage a State agency like an Córas Tráchtála to market art works abroad?</P>

      <P>I can assure the Deputy that, first, my proposal for capital expenditure for the period 1994 to 1998 will have a strong regional element to it. This will provide us with an opportunity to address many of the issues which the Deputy raised.  Secondly, I assure her that I will see that all the State agencies which can be of assistance in bringing recognition and knowledge of Irish art works abroad will be used.  I am the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and it is my intention that the agencies which have been established will remain at a certain distance from me, for example, the Arts Council is a statutory body and I will not interfere with it on a day to day basis.  However, through using the institutions, I will ensure that what she &mdash; and I &mdash; want will be achieved.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's comments in relation to job creation.  Indeed in Ireland and abroad we have seen the critical relationship between the arts and the economy.  The flourishing of the arts in Galway was not unconnected with the input of Digital in that city, there is a very close connection between the two. However, in relation to the planned development of job creation in the arts, will the Minister state the priority areas?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Myerscough report looked in detail at the question of employment in the arts.  In Britain employment and arts related activities have never been lower than 1.2 per cent, sometimes it has been as high as 2.1 per <Col N="1015" /> cent; usually it stays around 2 per cent. This is a very good indication of the employment potential in the arts. However, one must be careful not to put an imposition on artistic activities, the employment should be generated from artists and through different forms of cooperation, exhibitions and so on.  I certainly see that as a very real possibility and it is something to which I look forward.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that there should be freedom of the artist in relation to creating works of art. However, will he accept that opportunities can be created for artists?  In that context will he be looking at the Structural Funds to ensure that where there are major infrastructural developments, a percentage of that kind of funding will be spent on artistic endeavour?  For example, in relation to the art in architecture scheme, is he satisfied that local authorities are sufficiently aware and taking the opportunity to encourage local artists under the scheme, where there is infrastructural development?  In relation to public funding, many artists benefit from the SES schemes but, because they are so inflexible, they cause frustration in relation to long term benefits to artists. Will he create flexibility in those schemes?  I accept what the Minister said in relation to the freedom of the artists but he now has a tremendous opportunity to provide a space for artists to do creative work.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Deputy for raising these matters.  The greatest assistance I can give is possibly in the area of legislation.  As I pointed out, I am not a funding agency, agencies whose autonomy is important should operate without interference from me. When agencies of this kind have been interfered with in any jurisdiction it has not been to the benefit of artists.  In regard to infrastructure, the experience has been varied.  In local authorities the experience has been generally good but there have been exceptions, which I am <Col N="1016" /> examining.  Another point which follows logically from what the Deputy asked is whether the private sector might act in a voluntary or mandatory capacity in relation to provision for the arts; this is something I intend to keep under review. In regard to the SES schemes specifically related to arts activity, I will be keeping them under review and communicating with my Cabinet colleague in that regard.</P>

I was very impressed and it is important <Col N="1017" /> that such access is open to me.  I agree that the funding which has been available up to now for making work of Irish artists known internationally has been inadequate and I will be looking at mechanisms for improving this situation.</P>

      <P>Tógfaidh mé Ceisteanna <Col N="1018" /> 16, 26, 45, 46, 48 agus Ceist Scríofa 262 le chéile.</P>
      <P>As the House is already aware, I have been assigned responsibility for the formulation and development of future policy in relation to heritage, including inland waterways, national parks and wildlife and national monuments and historic properties.  The Commissioners of Public Works will continue to exercise their day-to-day functions in those areas in accordance with policy decisions made by me and setting out my priority areas and proposed implementation targets. Future policy in relation to the construction of interpretative centres by the Office of Public Works falls within my area of responsibilities.  My Department is at present reviewing the resources it will need, including the co-ordination of existing resources, for the formulation and development of future policy in relation to the areas already mentioned by me.</P>
      <P>My views on the Mullaghmore interpretative centre remain unchanged and, when the Supreme Court gives its ruling on the appeal, which has yet to be heard, against the High Court judgment that State authorities are not exempt from section 24 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, the matter will again be considered by the Government.  In the meantime, I have established a review group to examine strategic options for future policy in relation to Mullaghmore, Luggala and the Boyne Valley.</P>
      <P>I will be formulating a policy in relation to State funding for heritage centres, local museums and interpretative centres and that policy will also cover the necessary procedures of consultation which will have to be carried out before major projects are undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Heritage Council advised over a year ago that a comprehensive management plan, for example in relation to the Burren area, should be commissioned before the site of any interpretative centre was decided.  That is an indication of the direction in which I should like to go.  It is important to encourage and assist, where possible, <Col N="1019" /> interest, appreciation and enjoyment of our culture and heritage.  I am concerned, however, that any general scheme of funding for the development of heritage centres, local museums and interpretative centres should also take into account the meaning of heritage for local communities.  One problem is that they are often seen only as a means of attracting additional visitors rather than explaining the heritage, sometimes there is a fundamental difference between the two although they are capable of reconciliation.</P>
    <P>I have received the views of the National Heritage Council on this matter as well as their views in relation to a strategy for museum development, heritage interpretation and conservation and I will be looking at all these measures in detail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's reply.  Would he not agree that the proliferation of heritage centres, museums, display centres and interpretative centres throughout the country at present diminishes the effectiveness of this type of facility in certain instances? Is there a real long term strategy within the Department as regards the future development of these centres?  The Minister said today that this Department is reviewing future policy.  When can we expect a statement of that policy from the Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept I may have raised expectations as to what I may be able to achieve in such a short time, bearing in mind that I have been in office for less than two months.  Accepting the great challenge from Opposition Deputies, I have said in my reply that I am in the process of setting up a working group, which will draw from the expertise of agencies, to assist me in drawing up a future policy.  Quite frankly it was necessary for me to define what skills and professional competence were necessary, and there is no delay whatsoever in this regard.  When the group finishes its work I will report in the short term rather than <Col N="1020" /> in the medium term about the shape of future policy.</P>
      <P>In answer to the Deputy's interesting supplementary about the question of proliferation interfering with the validity of the concept of heritage, it is necessary that we have a good and accessible debate on the meaning of heritage.  When I put the Heritage Council on a statutory basis it will be in a very good position to contribute to, initiate and act as monitor of such a debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this question on the understanding that approximately three-quarters of the people in the Burren area are in favour of the Board of Works proposal.  Against the background I ask the Minister whether he accepts that from the point of view of local democracy there must be a procedure whereby local people will be able to express their view and whereby those views will be taken into account?  Will the Minister accept &mdash; I am not pointing the finger specifically at him in this instance &mdash; that there is a danger of accusations of cultural elitism and even cultural fascism in that there appears to be a total overriding of local views in relation to controversies such as that in Mullaghmore?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will assist you, a Cheann Comhairle.  In relation to the latter matter raised, I am very familiar with what cultural fascism is and I have no intention of embracing such a concept. Large meetings have been held recently expressing the opinions of the people of County Clare and other meetings have expressed the opinions of people who are close to Mullaghmore.  I have already said in my reply that I would like to see a <Col N="1021" /> consultation procedure in existence, that an overall management plan should follow such widespread consultation and thereafter specific proposals should be made.  I hope in future this is what will prevail.</P>
      <P>I regard matters such as those that have been a source of conflict as ones involving the local people but also ones that raise issues which are beyond the locality. There are fundamental questions involved that extend nationally and, in some senses, internationally.  I announced the establishment of a working group to consider the strategic options in the wake of the court decision. My aim has been always to achieve consensus so that people can see that their best interests are served.  All the options in relation to County Clare will be considered such as investment there, the provision of jobs, the secure location of the institutional structure and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister any bright ideas about what can be done with a half constructed building on the top of a mountain in County Wicklow?  I would be very interested to hear whether he has any proposal in that regard.  I welcome the fact that a review is being carried out on the whole question of interpretation. It appears that nobody has given this matter any serious thought &mdash; the only thought that has gone into it is how to spend the money as quickly as possible. Will the Minister consider looking at the work that has been carried out in this regard in County Wicklow?  Two major studies were carried out by a Trinity study group on the question of interpretation and the management of the uplands generally. Will the Minister look at this mould breaking work to see if there can be produced from the research, which is very comprehensive and involves practically every person living in County Wicklow &mdash; certainly in the upland areas &mdash; a model as to how we can proceed in a way that is based on human need and human understanding rather than a top-down approach as has been the case in the past?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>On the second matter, I have outlined my approach to heritage and I would like the policy group to regard heritage as a composition of people's stories.  In answer to the question I said that local people will have many hidden stories.  This is all part of one's heritage; heritage is not simply derived from the economic benefits of the tourist industry.</P>
      <P>In relation to the project on which work has commenced, the working group that will be established will consider all options that arise in the wake of the court decision.  The Deputy will be aware that I have already taken initiatives in suggesting alternatives which will result in reconciliation and consensus.  I cannot stress sufficiently that what is important at this stage is that everything we do, even in this House, should assist in the resolution of conflicts that have arisen in communities rather than adding to them. It is not a time for obduracy on anybody's part in relation to this matter.  Finally, the policy of the study group will draw on all documentation that is available. As has been suggested by the Deputy, I do indeed see this as one of the resources that will be considered.</P>

      <P>The increase of 158 per cent in the number of visual arts practitioners quoted in the Capital Programme for the Arts 1994-1997 published by an Chomhairle Ealaíon &mdash; the Arts Council &mdash; refers to the period 1971 to 1990.  During this period, funding for the Arts Council itself increased from £80,000 to £9,478,000 per annum.  For the information of the Deputy, the allocation for an chomhairle for 1993 is £11.5 million. The Deputy will appreciate, as I do, <Col N="1024" /> that the percentage increase in funding is far in excess of the percentage referred to in her question.</P>

The Deputy has asked a question on which I do have an opinion.  I agree with him that there is an importance attaching to the bursaries. There will have to be an examination of what happens when the bursaries have been exhausted.  In relation to music, for example, the manner in which beneficiaries of bursaries can feed their experience back into the music system needs to be examined, and I shall certainly do so.</P>

      <P>From this morning clerical and administrative staff of the Eastern Health Board have taken industrial action following an appointment to the board's personnel department.  Arrangements necessary to ensure the continued maintenance of all essential services are under ongoing discussion between the health board and the union concerned, IMPACT.  While this is a personnel issue, the resolution of which the health board has prime responsibility, I am keeping in close touch with the matter.  I am assured that the health board is taking all possible steps towards an early resumption of normal duties and I understand that discussions are taking place at this moment in an effort to resolve the dispute.  I shall keep the Deputies and the House informed of all developments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister be a little more specific in relation to the time involved?  It is quite clear that, if there is no settlement, within a matter of days up to 1,800 staff and professionals employed in the Eastern Health Board could be affected by an extension of strike action.  The action could have major repercussions for a service that is already overstretched and having difficulty in meeting the demands made on it.  Could the Minister give more details in relation to the attempts being made to resolve the difficulty?</P>

I have been in touch with the chief executive officer of the health board to underline the gravity <Col N="1026" /> of the position from my perspective. I am hoping for an early resolution of the difficulty.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>(1) Deputy M.

    <P>I would also remind the House that the Criminal Justice (No. 2) Bill is also on the Order Paper and is being debated this evening and tomorrow evening.  It deals with matters which are at least as important as those in this Criminal Justice Bill, and which are equally as urgent.  I would like to think the Government would show the same sense of urgency about that, and they can demonstrate that tomorrow <Col N="1212" /> evening by accepting the provisions of the other Criminal Justice Bill in Deputy Harney's name.  I think an ideal package would be a combination of what is in the two Bills because each deals with matters which are of extreme urgency.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:</P>
      <P>Finance Act, 1992 (Commencement of Section 15) (Disability Benefit and Injury Benefit) Order, 1993,</P>
      <P>a copy of which order in draft was laid before Dáil Éireann on 24th February, 1993.</P>
      <P>Section 15 of the Finance Act, 1992, provided for the treatment as income for tax purposes of certain short term social welfare benefits.  These are disability benefit, injury benefit, unemployment benefit and pay-related benefit.  The section can come into operation generally or in relation to specific benefits or categories of recipients of benefits on such day or days as may be fixed by me by order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1215" /> As I announced in the Budget Statement, I propose to bring the section into operation with effect from 6 April 1993, in respect of disability benefit and injury benefit.  I should emphasise, as I have done in the past, that the taxation of these benefits is essentially a matter of equity.  The reason for treating disability benefit as income for tax purposes is simply to treat people in similar circumstances, with similar amounts of incomes, in the same way.  In other words, it is to make sure that where two people in similar circumstances have the same amount of income, one does not pay less tax than the other simply because the first person's income contains disability benefit and the second person's does not.</P>
    <P>Of course, the extent to which taxation will actually arise in a given case as a result of this change will depend on the level of other income that a recipient of disability benefit or his or her spouse has in the same tax year.  In this context, I should like to draw attention to a paper published in 1991 by the Economic and Social Research Institute titled &ldquo;Income Tax and Welfare Reforms&rdquo;. This paper demonstrated the flaw in the argument that taxation of disability benefit would impact unfairly on the lower paid.  The study found that the vast bulk of the benefit from the non-taxation of certain short term social welfare benefits, including disability benefit, went to the better paid.  In particular it found that 70 per cent of those tax units affected by taxation of disability benefit are in the upper half of the equivalent income distribution and that removing the exemption would affect fewer than one in ten of the lowest paid workers.  These figures are based on a study carried out in 1987; the increases in the income tax exemption limits since 1987 and the introduction of substantial child additions to them should mean that the effect on the lower paid would be even less now.</P>
    <P>This change in the treatment of disability benefit for tax purposes has been recommended by, among others, the Commission on Taxation, the Industrial <Col N="1216" /> Policy Review Group, better known as Culliton, the Commission on Social Welfare, the National Planning Board.  It is a desirable co-ordination of the income tax and social welfare systems.  It should also ensure that persons are not better off sick than working, and so diminish the attraction of disability benefit, especially for higher paid workers.</P>
    <P>When introducing the enabling legislation in the 1992 Finance Act, I outlined the way in which it was envisaged the measure would operate.  A limited, interim, form of taxation of disability benefit for those in employment &mdash; to be operated by their employers &mdash; was being considered for introduction in the autumn of 1992.  The intention was that full taxation of disability benefit, to be operated by the Department of Social Welfare, would be introduced from 6 April 1993.</P>
    <P>In the event, the interim arrangement was not proceeded with last year. Because of various operational constraints the Department of Social Welfare will not now, as originally envisaged, be in a position to operate taxation from 6 April 1993.  However, it is hoped that they will be able to do so from as early as possible in 1994.  In the meantime, the full taxation system which it had been intended to introduce with effect from 6 April 1993 is being modified for the year 1993-94.  The system will involve the Department of Social Welfare continuing to pay disability and injury benefit gross, that is, without deduction of income tax. Where the recipient of disability benefit is in employment, the employer will reduce the tax-free allowances of the employee by the amount of the employee's disability benefit.  The Revenue will notify employers, by way of a general notice which is to be issued shortly, that tax-free allowances are to be automatically reduced by the personal rate of disability benefit or by such an amount as is notified to the employer by the Department of Social Welfare where the amount of disability benefit is other than the personal rate.</P>
    <P>In addition, employees in receipt of those benefits will have tax deducted <Col N="1217" /> under the non-cumulative basis of PAYE, which is generally known as the &ldquo;Week 1&rdquo; basis, from any payments made by the employer.  Normal cumulative PAYE takes account of the employee's cumulative position from the beginning of the tax year up to the pay week that is being dealt with.  In a disability benefit case, what happens, at present, is that disability benefit is not taken into account by the employer at all, and, unless the employee has occupational sick pay in excess of his tax-free allowances, he can get a tax refund each week he is on disability benefit to the extent that he has previously paid tax in the year.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Week 1&rdquo; non-cumulative PAYE, on the other hand, looks only at the employee's position in the pay week that is being dealt with and does not, as a consequence, incorporate the refund procedure.  In the context of the taxation of disability benefit through the reduction of tax-free allowances by the employer, it would not be possible for employers to continue to operate the cumulative system of PAYE in respect of the employees concerned.  Under the proposed system, therefore, what will happen is that the employee's tax-free allowances will be reduced by the amount of his disability benefit and the &ldquo;Week 1&rdquo; basis will, at the same time, prevent any refunds of tax being made to him.</P>
    <P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the proposed system the employee's tax free allowances will be reduced by the amount of his disability benefit and the &ldquo;Week 1&rdquo; basis will at the same time prevent any refunds of tax being made to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of different situations may thus result and I want to indicate how each will be dealt with.  If the tax-free allowances exceed disability benefit, the excess will be set by the employer against any occupational sick pay that the employee may receive.  If there is no occupational sick pay, the excess tax-free <Col N="1218" /> allowances will remain unused but the employee can recover any tax overpaid if he applies to the Revenue for the restoration of cumulative PAYE system after resumption of employment or on review at the end of the tax year.  If disability benefit exceeds the available tax-free allowance, the generally small amounts of tax payable in respect of the excess may be identified on review after the end of the tax year or, if the employee applies to Revnue, on restoration of cumulative PAYE after resumption of employment.</P>
    <P>In a situation where disability benefit and occupational sick pay exceed tax-free allowances, the employer will deduct tax from the excess of occupational sick pay over tax-free allowances as reduced by disability benefit.</P>
    <P>Turning to the position of disability benefit recipients not in employment, what will happen in the case of such persons who are in receipt of benefit for more than 12 months is that the Department of Social Welfare will notify Revenue of relevant details and Revenue will, as far as possible, restrict by the amount of their expected disability benefit, their tax-free allowances against any other PAYE source of income they or their spouse may have.  Where the other source of income is from a non-PAYE source, the disability benefit will be directly assessed along with the other income under the self assessment process. This is the same procedure that currently applies for those in receipt of taxable social welfare pensions.</P>
    <P>In the case of non-employed disability benefit recipients who have received or are receiving disability benefit for less than 12 months, the disability benefit will be taken into account by the Revenue by either a restriction of tax-free allowances, where appropriate, during the course of the year or on review of the employee's tax liability after the end of the year.</P>
    <P>One point that must not be lost sight of &mdash; indeed it is one I have made before but one which I must stress once again &mdash; is that the extent to which taxation will arise under this measure will essentially depend on the amount of other income <Col N="1219" /> which the person or the person's spouse has in the tax year.  If there is no other income in addition to disability benefit, the exemption limits &mdash; the levels of which I increased in the budget &mdash; will generally ensure that there is not tax to pay.  The yield that is estimated will arise from this measure is £10 million in 1993.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to mention unemployment benefit which was among the short term social welfare benefits covered by section 15 of the 1992 Finance Act. While it is not covered by the present order, the intention is that unemployment benefit payments will be taxed under the PAYE system, operated by the Department of Social Welfare.  It is hoped that the necessary preparations will be completed so as to enable taxation to commence in 1994.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The taxation of sick benefit represents another typical attack by the Government on the middle income sector.  Since April 1992 pay related benefit was abolished for anyone who got sick.  The case that was rightly made before that, that people in the latter half of the tax year would be better off going on disability benefit, getting pay related benefit and the tax rebate, has changed. This tax represents a levy in a full year of £20 million on insured workers and will impose undoubted hardship on many families.  In effect, it is another tax on sickness.  That is in line with Government policy.  Hospital charges have been increased.  Inpatient charges are now £20 a day up to a maximum of £200.  The same group of people are constantly hit by the Minister for Finance and the Government.  The same people will pay the 1 per cent income levy and are hit by the lack of proper adjustment to the PAYE tax bands.  The same people have mortgages and will have to pay higher VHI charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the budget the Government did not bring forward any measures to alleviate the cumulative effect of all these measures on ordinary workers who are genuinely ill.  It is ironic that this Government, in its new taxation proposals, <Col N="1220" /> should perceive two groups to be well off, the sick who happen to go to hospital and those on disability benefit who now have to be taxed.  Another category are the dead.  The Government have introduced a death tax in the form of a probate tax.  That is ironic.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael recognises that there must be equality in the income tax code and that income from all sources must be taxed equally.  At present there are many anomalies in the tax code and I will give an example which relates to married couples.  Take for example a postman who is earning £240 per week.  If his wife has a part-time cleaning job and is earning £60 per week he will use up all the personal tax free allowances and her only tax free allowance will be a PAYE allowance. If she were on disability benefit she would not be taxed on it, whereas if she is in a cleaning job with the same level of pay she will pay his marginal rate of tax which could be 48p in the pound.  Clearly that is unjust.  Other social welfare payments in the form of invalidity pension and disablement pension, are also taxed at present whereas short term social welfare is not.</P>
    <P>Claimants of disability benefit during the past three years averaged 180,000 per annum at a cost of £173 million.  The most common duration of claim is between two and three weeks.  This clearly indicates there is not abuse but genuine illness.  At any one time &mdash; I understand it fluctuates &mdash; the likely number of recipients at a snap-shot in time is around 50,000.  These figures show that for employers and employees this proposal &mdash; and this is the reason we are proposing this measure today &mdash; would represent a bureaucratic and administrative nightmare of unprecedented proportions for those who would have to implement it in cases where there is no occupational sick pay scheme.  In other words, when somebody goes sick they send in their doctor's certs and await their claim from Store Street. In those cases employees will be faced with the prospect of further delays in the issuing of their disability benefit.  Even worse, however, is the prospect that there will have to be a continual adjustment <Col N="1221" /> of tax free allowances for people who return to work after sickness.  This will be truly a nightmare.</P>
    <P>The ESRI report on taxation of disability benefit, Policy Series No. 8, which came out in March 1988, makes instructive reading.  It itemises clearly that this is not a new idea.  In the Finance Act, 1979, a provision was introduced to tax short term social welfare benefits from April 1980.  We were told it would raise £13 million in the income tax year 1980-81 but a year later it was dropped.  Why? The matter was subsequently dropped for administrative reasons.  It has been estimated that an extra 650 employees would be required, between the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Welfare, to make the revisions in tax allowances.  At the time it was estimated that the only way it could be implemented was to impose a flat 20 per cent deduction at source tax on pay-related benefit with subsequent refunds for overpayments for which the claimants would have to apply.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael are opposing this order to introduce this measure in three weeks.  It is clear that the Revenue Commissioners have not yet issued to employers or employees the necessary guidelines for the implementation of this measure.  The reprogramming of computer software will be expensive as will be the element of retraining for personnel staff.  The worst burden will apply to small employers who do not have occupational sick pay schemes.  Already we have had a plethora of complaints and representations from the small firms' association, people in the service sector, the construction industry, that they are overburdened with red tape in regard to employing somebody.</P>
    <P>What we are doing today is creating a whole new layer of continual adjustments in tax free allowances.  Today's measure will create a huge additional administrative burden on such employers.  It is not clear whether this taxation measure will apply to the basic rate of benefit only or to dependants' allowance payments as well.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify that point.  This will add to the bureaucratic nightmare for such employers. <Col N="1222" /> Given the existing delays with the Department of Social Welfare, where many disability benefit claimants are only paid long after they have returned to work, there is little likelihood of quick information from that Department now to implement this measure.</P>
    <P>I understand this measure is to be implemented in two phases &mdash; as outlined by the Minister.  In the first phase employers are to reduce the weekly tax free allowance of benefit claimants by the amount of the personal rate of disability benefit.  Subsequently the Department of Social Welfare is to notify employers as to whether the benefit payment exceeds the personal rate; they will then have to make the necessary adjustments in the employer's tax free allowance.  An employer with a staff of 30 people will need to assign someone almost full-time to changing tax free allowances as nearly always somebody is out sick.  The second phase &mdash; this is the most incredible part &mdash; presupposes that computerisation in the Department of Social Welfare and the Revenue Commissioners will be integrated. I understand this will allow excess benefit over the tax free allowances to be taxed at source; in other words they will never get the cheque.  This will bring a whole new complexity into our social welfare code.  For the first time there will be a gross social welfare pay and a net social welfare pay.  This is farcical.  Is there no limit to the complexity being introduced into our system?  Will gross reckonable earnings in future show a gross and net social welfare figure?  Will people subsequently be entitled to a tax rebate on their social welfare tax?  I would urge the Minister to exercise caution in treading too far down this road as each new departure will bring its own anomalies.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also clarify whether he proposes to extend the taxation to other social welfare short term payments such as unemployment benefit. I want to assure him that my party will oppose this measure because the last thing the unemployed want is another kick in the teeth.  It is bad enough being employed and having a derisory rate of social welfare but now it will be taxed. <Col N="1223" /> There is a world of difference between someone who can return to work and someone who has no such prospect.</P>
    <P>Finally, it is clear that this measure has not been adequately thought out.  It is being rushed through this House in a smash and grab raid on the pay packets of ordinary workers to the tune of £10 million this year.  It should be deferred until there are adequate safeguards in place to protect vulnerable employees who are genuinely sick and all employers have had an adequate opportunity to understand and administer its implementation.</P>

      <P>It would be disingenuous of the Progressive Democrats to oppose this order since we were involved in the Finance Act, 1992, and we are supporting this order today.  It is difficult to disagree with the principle underlying the proposed taxing of disability benefit and occupational injuries benefit, that is that similar levels of income, irrespective of their source, should be taxed similarly under our taxation code, in other words, a basic equity under the tax system as recommended by Culliton and other agencies, as stated by the Minister.  That is the principle that the Progressive Democrats have consistently supported as the exemption from the taxation code of various benefits or payments gives rise to anomalies not only in the tax system but also in the workplace and can also give rise to unemployment traps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The non-taxing of disability benefit or sick pay, as it is more generally termed, has given rise to various anomalies in the workplace, most notably towards the latter part of each tax year, because workers may be going on to a higher tax rate or simply to recoup some tax already paid.  It is an opportune time to go sick and everybody in this House knows this means there has been an abuse of the system.  In those circumstances people get disability benefit and they can also qualify for a rebate of tax paid.  This proposed measure should help to tackle that abuse.  However, it would appear <Col N="1224" /> that this measure could create fresh anomalies. I know that the order which proposes to tax disability benefit and occupational injuries benefit is based on section 15 of the Finance Act, 1992. However, it is interesting to note that in addition to the proposed taxing of disability benefit and occupational injuries benefit it is envisaged that unemployment benefit and pay-related benefit would also be taxed.  I note from the Minister's speech that he intends to introduce measures to deal with this in 1994.  When one takes into account that the payment rates for disability benefit and unemployment benefit are identical it would be illogical to exclude those two items along with the new measures being introduced today.</P>
    <P>Another abuse in the workplace which is not unheard of relates to unemployment benefit where some employers and employees collude in layoffs towards the end of the tax year.  The net effect of this practice is to create further inequities between people under the tax system. There is a need to ensure equity across the tax code.  However, I would be much more satisfied to see the measures envisaged by this order coming into effect if the anomalies in the system were already being tackled and tax equity was to become a guiding principle for the entire taxation system.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats support this motion.  It has to be seen in the overall context of the integration of the tax and social welfare systems, which I believe the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, Deputy Joan Burton, proposes to deal with in the near future.  I would welcome such a move.</P>

      <P>Not having been a Member of the previous Government I do not have to support this motion. Indeed, I wish to indicate quite clearly that I will be opposing it, not simply because I was not a Member of the previous Government but because I believe it is inequitable to start applying tax at the bottom of the ladder to people who, in many cases, already find it difficult to <Col N="1225" /> survive.  The Minister sought to justify this proposal by quoting from the ESRI report which indicated, based on the 1987 study, that only 10 per cent of those involved might be adversely affected.  Of course, the Minister gave no indication that he intended to do anything to assist those 10 per cent who would be adversely affected.  He gave no indication either as to the actual number of people involved. The Minister in his speech expressed the hope that the effect of this measure might be ameliorated somewhat by the slight rise in the exemption limits which have occurred since 1987.  Of course, that again is a vain hope: he offers no specific statistics or indication of precisely who will be hurt and how it will hurt them.</P>
      <P>The proposal to start taxing disability and injury benefit cannot be separated from the series of social welfare cutbacks introduced last year by the former Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy McCreevy.  This point was made by Labour Party speakers during the debate on the Finance Bill last May when they voted in favour of an amendment tabled by the Democratic Left which would have allowed for the continued exemption of the social welfare payments for tax purposes. Nothing has changed since then.  I wish to draw attention to a statement made during that debate on 19 May by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, I quote from column 1903 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>The principle of persons earning income or getting income from any source and then paying tax on it is not one with which the Labour Party disagree.  With the present low threshold of income tax allowances, and bearing in mind the tax rebate as a result of redundancy or illness in one year, and in one year only, the Minister is being unnecessarily harsh and uncharacteristically cruel if that is all he going after.  There are other ways of collecting revenue, as the Minister has shown.  I should like to hear the Minister's comments on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A slight increase in the exemption limits was offered in the Minister's Budget <Col N="1226" /> Statement but even those have yet to be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Nothing has changed since the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, made that statement in this House less than 12 months ago when he opposed the taxation of disability benefit, as proposed here today.  The cutbacks introduced by the then Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy McCreevy, have not been reversed.  On a number of occasions I have drawn attention to Circulars 14/92 and 18/92 introduced by the then Minister for Social Welfare during the middle of last year.  These decisions have not been reversed by the Government, and, despite promises that additional money is being provided for the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, there are people living in this city at present who cannot get assistance from community welfare offices because of the continued existence of these circulars.  I got half a promise from the Minister for Social Welfare two weeks ago that community welfare offices had discretion and could, in fact, give help.  However, the community welfare offices have pointed out that they are constrained by these circulars and cannot act outside them unless they get a countermanding circular.  I would again draw the attention of the House to that matter &mdash; at present people are living under the threat of having their light and heat cut off.  Action needs to be taken on this measure, one of what I think was referred to by the Labour Party during the last election as the McCreevy dirty dozen.  The arguments made by both Democratic Left and the Labour Party last year still stand.  In order to be <Col N="1227" /> consistent, the Labour Party should not only come in here for a quorum today but should vote against this proposal.</P>
      <P>Much has been made of the recommendation by the Commission on Social Welfare that these benefits should be taxed.  That proposal was clearly part of a major package of reforms put forward by the commission, many of which have still not been implemented.  The principle of taxing short term benefits is unacceptable while we have an unreasonably low tax threshold.  People come into the tax net at a ridiculously low level, far below the levels in most other EC countries.</P>
      <P>The result of the implementation of this order will be to take more tax from those on low and moderate incomes and to reduce the living standards of those dependent on social welfare.  People who are ill very often have substantial additional expenses.  A visit to the doctor can cost as much as £15 and the cost of drugs is particularly high.  Some allowance should be made for those extra expenses.  It should not be forgotten that those in receipt of disability or injury benefit already suffer a substantial decrease in income and this is being whittled away each year as pay-related benefit is progressively cut.</P>
      <P>There are many potential sources of tax revenue but the Government does not have the political will to go after them.  Farmer taxation remains a joke, the average tax paid by farmers having come down from £786 to £537 between 1989 and 1991, a decrease of some 30 per cent.  The Revenue Commissioners can apparently find only 5,000 self employed people who will admit to earning more than £25,000 per year, despite the fact that most of the high earning professions are included in this category.  These are the people who should be pursued, not those who are unable to work due to illness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both, the Commission on Social Welfare and the Commission on Taxation have referred to the complexities in introducing an equitable taxation system in respect of short term social welfare benefits. <Col N="1228" /> Since those reports, successive Governments have depressed the level of payment of disability benefit below the minimum adequate income stipulated by the Commission on Social Welfare and have further abolished pay-related benefit for disability benefit.  It has also made it more difficult to comply with the qualifying conditions.</P>
    <P>On all these grounds I urge this House to reject the motion put forward by the Minister for Finance.  I do so in the interests of fair play and equity in our tax and social welfare systems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The interests of the Labour Party are, apparently, of primary concern to most Members.  The Labour Party has never shirked its responsibility and if it was to do so on this occasion I am sure that Fine Gael, the Progressive Democrats and Democratic Left would welcome a general election in the week after St. Patrick's Day.  That would be the inevitable result.</P>
      <P>This provision was framed last year and supported by the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil.  We said then that there is something wrong with the concept of taxing people on benefits to which they contribute.  There is a counter argument that if one is allowed tax relief for the PRSI element of one's contributions towards disability benefit and unemployment benefit, there must be some measure of equity and taxation might be considered where the benefit exceeds the tax free allowance.  This will be presented by the Opposition as taxing disability benefit but that is not what the order is about.  It means that income from disability benefit will be considered with other income as being subject to consideration for tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The vast majority of people who draw disability benefit are not during that period in the income tax bracket and will not therefore be taxed on their disability benefit.  Some employees are fortunate enough to be employed in enterprises which have sick pay schemes, such as local authorities, parts of the private sector, the co-operative movement and so on.  These sick pay schemes indemnify <Col N="1229" /> families for up to six months in the case of loss of earnings due to illness.  If income from social welfare is added to the balance of the income from the employer, this income would be taxable.  The normal procedure is to transfer to the employer the social welfare payment so that the employee receives the equivalent of a normal rate of pay.</P>
    <P>No tears have been shed by the Opposition for people such as old age pensioners, invalidity pensioners, or recipients of disablement benefit who are already included in the tax net.  My 88-year-old mother who has a contributory old age pension is paying income tax because she has a small county council pension resulting from my late father's employment as a road worker.  I do not need lectures from the Opposition about the facts as they affect ordinary working class people.  My mother has been paying income tax for 15 years.  I have not heard a word today which identifies that section of social welfare recipients who have to pay tax on their income.  All pensions are considered to be incomes.  There are exceptions, of course.  If two spouses are working and one of them is ill and drawing disability benefit but not in the tax code, the total income for both spouses will be subject to tax.  That is one of the anomalies.  It penalises the working spouse who would normally hope that the income would be treated separately. Equity in the taxation code means that spouses can separate their tax allowances. There is no imposition if they want to remain separate.  There are anomalies throughout the tax code, but this measure makes sense to people like old age pensioners whose income from social welfare is already subject to tax.</P>
    <P>I would prefer not to have to address these minimal areas of revenue but if we address inequity in the system we are moving forward.  Let us hope that people will accept that if their income is above the level of their tax free allowance they should pay their fair share of income tax.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Social Welfare is implementing in a very selective way one of the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare published in 1986, while largely ignoring the other recommendations of that report.  The move by Ministers of a Fianna Fáil and Labour Government to tax disability benefit can be seen as a move against the PAYE sector because those in receipt of disability benefit are PAYE contributors.  This decision comes hard on the heels of the decision by the Minister for Social Welfare to disqualify disability benefit recipients from pay-related benefit.  The Minister is now expecting more from social welfare contributors while offering increasingly less. We only have to look at the restrictions that were put on social welfare beneficiaries in recent months to see how this sector is being squeezed more and more by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's refusal to deal with many of the key recommendations in the commission's report leaves the social welfare system a very complicated and confusing one which is anti-family and creates unbelievable barriers to work. The lines of communication between the Department and the public are still very unsatisfactory.  There is an urgent need for these lines of communication to be harmonised and for the whole service <Col N="1231" /> to be made user friendly.  The Minister should realise that persons availing of social welfare are victims of either economic failure or of ill health.  The Minister has failed to ensure that the guiding principles of the social welfare system are successfully met, even at this stage.  To date the Minister and his Department have failed to address the principal features of the report.  The effects of the &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; provisions over the last number of months are now being added to as people who are affected by bad health, stress and short term unemployment due to illness will be adversely affected by this added burden.</P>
    <P>In short I am asking the Minister not to go ahead with this recommendation, even at this late stage.  I am absolutely amazed that the Labour Party who projected themselves over the last number of years as a pro-worker party are now party to introducing an anti-worker provision. The Minister goes even further today by sneaking in, in the last paragraph, another attack on the workers of this country.  People who are contributing at the moment are now being told that in the event that they become victims of the present recession their unemployment benefits will be taxed.  I am asking the Labour Party who are supposed to be the &ldquo;proud protectors of the working people of this country&rdquo; to stand up now and be counted.  To say the least, I am amazed that less and less has been heard from the Tánaiste and the members of his party over the last days when these measures were tabled in this House.  If all Deputy Ferris can offer this House is the threat of a general election, I can only assume that he is afraid of losing his job or of the job of his advisers being lost.</P>

      <P>Let me reiterate what I said at the outset.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1232" /> The reason for treating disability benefit as income for tax purposes is to treat people in similar circumstances with similar amounts of income in the same way. It is to make sure that when two people are in similar circumstances with the same amount of income that one does not pay less tax than the other by virtue of the fact that one person's income contains disability benefit and the other's does not.  This is to introduce equity into the system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party policy, which Fianna Fáil accepted, of increasing child benefit was precisely to deal with this matter and it is families in need who are targeted.  All of the various bodies, including the Conference of Major Religious Superiors have argued for years that we should tax&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the Labour Party that has changed on this.  I want to congratulate Deputy Yates on taking over an onerous task and to wish him well.  When we debated this in the House in autumn 1991 and at length last year Fine Gael supported this measure.  The Commission on Taxation supported it.  It is part of the Culliton report and the Commission on Social Welfare recommended it.  It is not a selected piece. The overall thrust is that income, from wherever it comes, should be taxed, that we should get rid of the shelters, the exemptions and the thresholds.  Tax should be levied and whatever is raised from that tax should then be channeled towards people in need.  That is precisely the policy of Deputy Ferris and his colleagues. We have accepted that and that is why child benefit has been increased.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.  This is to do with taxing the various benefits.  There is one further point.  Deputy Burton is working on integrating the social welfare and tax systems and that has yet to be completed. I am disappointed that it has taken so long but it is a major job that must be done.</P>
      <P>To answer Deputy Yates's question, disability payments from the Department of Social Welfare will not be delayed but will continue to be paid gross.  The system is designed to integrate all of the administrative burdens on employers.  The instructions to employers will be issued soon.  However, they received notice back in the autumn of 1991 so they are well aware of the implications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the point made by Deputy Ferris, all social welfare pensions are taxable. In talking about people in need we are talking about some of the categories mentioned by Deputy Ferris and there is no need for me to go back over them.  This will apply to all disability payments including dependant allowances.  The proposal mooted in 1979 was dropped not because it was unworkable but because it was part of the National Understanding worked out in 1979.  However, it subsequently came back into all of the <Col N="1234" /> reports that took place during the eighties.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa argued the case of people on low incomes.  Generally, we all agree with that.  However, the categories Deputy De Rossa is talking about would have medical cards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I was talking about low and middle income people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Even in that category expenses would qualify for income tax relief.  A number of Deputies have mentioned the post budget annual rates of disability benefit, unemployment benefit etc. in the context of the income tax exemption limits.  The personal rate is £2,891; the exemption limit is £3,600. The benefit for a person with an adult dependant is £4,737 and the exemption limit is £7,200.  For a person with one dependant it is £5,402 and the exemption limit is £7,550 and so on up to five and six children.  For a person with six children the benefit is £8,797 and the exemption limit is £10,400.  I think the concerns of the Deputies have been clearly answered.  We will continue in the other areas to try to bring equity into this system.</P>

      <P>One of the remarkable features about the Minister's speech in introducing the Bill was his general overview of the natural gas scene as it applies in Ireland now.  However, he did not deal with how the interconnector will be financed and I would have thought that if the House is asked to approve very substantial increases in borrowing and <Col N="1237" /> guarantee limits, it should be given details of the financial package.  I understand that, some months ago, the financial package was not completed and put in place.  For that reason it is important to know the present position.  I assume it has now been completed and put in place and we should be given the details and how it is made up.  Even though the Minister made a lengthy speech in moving the Bill he did not deal with that aspect of the matter.</P>
      <P>One of the points which struck me in particular about the Minister's speech was that he anticipates that the current market of two billion cubic feet per year will gradually rise to five billion cubic feet per year.  He went on to say that he anticipated the main growth sector would be electricity generation.  He also said that gas is an ideal fuel for electricity generation.  However, many people would take issue with that remark; I agree that gas is an ideal fuel for electricity generation provided it is peak shaving because it is the best fuel by far to bring on very quickly and does not require a lot of preparatory time, as a number of other fuels do, before the generating machinery begins to work.  On the other hand, natural gas, which is a very valuable and special fuel, is clearly not suitable for base load electricity generation. As far as I can see, in recent years the ESB has been using it for that purpose and I query their wisdom because it is using something which is in itself valuable and which can be substituted for by other fuels for long term base load production of electricity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I question, in particular, why the ESB does not complete the fourth set of 300 megawatts at Moneypoint because Moneypoint is by far the cheapest and most efficient generator of electricity.  I know there are some environmental drawbacks to it but the fact is that we are committed to 1,200 megawatts at Moneypoint, of which 900 are in production.  A great deal of work has been done on the fourth 300 megawatt set and it seems foolish not to complete it.  Anything that raises steam will generate electricity and <Col N="1238" /> it does not have to be a very valuable fuel like natural gas.</P>
    <P>The efficiency factors in converting natural gas are disappointingly low where it is used for the generation of electricity. Even though they have improved &mdash; the Minister mentioned they are now at a level of 50 per cent &mdash; nonetheless that is a very low conversion factor, bearing in mind that gas has virtually 100 per cent efficiency when used for specialised purposes, such as cooking, for example.  We are in danger in some of the terminology the Minister uses &mdash; probably inspired by Bord Gáis Éireann &mdash; of getting into a situation where a board like BGE will try to sell the use of gas at all costs and the ESB will try to sell electricity and advocate its use, almost at all costs, and, in particular, for purposes which are inappropriate.  This is an instance where a national energy policy should be laid down by the Minister for Energy and the use of particular fuels or sources of energy for inefficient purposes should be prohibited in the overall national interest.  That has never happened here &mdash; it is a cause of some regret that it has not &mdash; but it should now happen. Otherwise we are liable to fritter away this very valuable and finite resource of natural gas.</P>
    <P>In the debates that took place in 1976 on the first gas Bill, Members were talking about unlimited supplies virtually. The whole atmosphere was different.  We did not think we would be facing a situation which is a great disappointment, that our supplies would run out in or about the end of the century, unless there is a further discovery.  I mentioned the last day the necessity for an accelerated exploration programme offshore Ireland and, indeed, onshore if there were any prospects.  The then Minister, Deputy Molloy, signed an agreement with Marathon to drill seven new wells.  That was quite an achievement when one bears in mind that Marathon, and others, had not drilled any wells for some years.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, the drilling of seven wells over a five year period is not a particularly exciting programme.  I recall when I was in the Department of Energy there were <Col N="1239" /> years when ten or 12 wells were drilled offshore Ireland and we regarded it as the norm.  They were the days when people were a great deal more optimistic than now. They are much more sanguine now as a result of much unsuccessful drilling.  To this day, however, I remain convinced there must be further reserves, both of gas and oil, off the Irish coast and I would very much like to see more intensive exploration for it.  It is a great shame that we have to import the amount of energy we do &mdash; in all we import approximately two-thirds of our energy requirement. The advantages that countries like Britain and Norway have are inestimable compared with us and a number of others.  It underlines the degree of failure in the British economy that even though they are self-sufficient in oil and gas &mdash; indeed almost net exporters of both now &mdash; they are still in dire trouble.  It would certainly transform this country if we were self-sufficient in oil and if we had enough gas to ensure that we could distribute it throughout the country.</P>
    <P>There are a number of references in the Minister's speech to the position in regard to NET.  I recall Deputy Ahern dealing with that in detail when she spoke the last day.  It certainly is not satisfactory but on the other hand, I do not think we can turn our backs on it.  The Minister referred to the 1987 agreement, in particular, under which Bord Gáis Éireann supplies gas to NET who in turn sells it on to what is now IFI.  That arrangement between IFI and NET is one of the most improvident agreements ever entered into by the Irish State.  What it has done is mind boggling and the consequences of it, and trying to deal with it later, have proved appallingly difficult.  It is very serious indeed.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the large number of central heating customers who have been connected in the past couple of years.  I am glad of that as it is one of the optimum uses of this fuel.  As a user I should like to tell those customers who were connected in the past few years that when the third year is over they will get a sudden sharp shock because the price at <Col N="1240" /> which natural gas is sold to the domestic customer after the third year is extremely high and must be extraordinarily profitable for BGE.  I get the feeling that domestic customers may well be subsidising, in effect, many of the very large customers such as the ESB and NET because the prices charged are quite frightening. Bord Gáis Éireann should look at that because they are losing a great deal of use because people suddenly come to the realisation that as it is very expensive in the domestic sphere they will have to consider going back to other fuels.  That is a great disappointment because it is an efficient use of gas.  It would be a great pity if there were a decline in the demand for it at that level.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the question of third party access had not yet been finalised and the directives relating to it are not yet in place.  That is very important. Access should be given to third parties and I hope there will be agreement on that shortly at the Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>If the ESB is going to be the main user of gas in the future, as indicated by the Minister, and of most of the projected increase, particularly after the inter-connector comes into use, it should be making a major contribution to the cost of this.  The former Minister sought to have this done and it was not possible to reach agreement between the two bodies. It seems remarkable that a body who is going to be a major user &mdash; even though I believe it should not be and should be only a peak shaving user &mdash; is apparently not making any contribution.  That is why it is important to know what the financial package is and what the exposure is in regard to the Exchequer.  We know what the potential exposure under the guarantees and borrowings are, but we should have some details on that so that we can give the matter further consideration.  We should also have an explanation as to why the ESB has not made a contribution if it is to be as significant a user as the Minister suggests.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister also to deal with the point I raised the last day we discussed this matter in that I had a very unhappy experience with this board at <Col N="1241" /> the end of the seventies when it gave me an estimate for the cost of the Cork-Dublin pipeline.  That estimate turned out to be excessive by a factor of between five and six times.  We went elsewhere to have the pipeline built and it was built satisfactorily for a small fraction of the estimate I was given in 1979.  I hope there is no repetition of that in regard to the under-sea interconnector because the amount of money involved is a great deal higher.</P>
    <P>I reiterate my plea that the Department of Energy would stop a number of these State monopolies trying to expand at the expense of one another and insisting that their particular fuel or energy could be used for all possible purposes rather than for the purposes for which it is most efficient.  The advertising which the ESB, in particular, indulge in, in telling us how important electricity is, is totally unnecessary; it adds to the cost and to the monopoly mentality which is part and parcel of its outlook on life and is of very little value to the consumers.</P>
    <P>There has been an expansion of pipelines within Ireland but sometimes not to the most obvious places.  For example, even though there is ample gas in Limerick city, it is disappointing that it has not been expanded to Shannon Airport where there would be many valuable customers and relatively heavy users.  It is disappointing also that it has not been found possible to extend it from Patrickswell to Aughinish Island, which is a relatively short distance.  This involves more than the physical piping of the gas to Aughinish, the question of price also arises.  That company is a very large user of imported HFO and some calculations should be done on the national benefit of substituting natural gas for the imported heavy fuel oil used there at present.  We are in the somewhat unhappy position of having no real user of energy of any significance.  The biggest energy user is Aughinish Alumina at Askeaton whose total demand for electricity is only the equivalent of the output of 32 megawatts. That is amazing when one realises that there are single manufacturing plants throughout Europe and the world which <Col N="1242" /> often require the equivalent of an output of 1,000 or 1,500 megawatts.  We have no smelting industry and no refining of any commodity takes place here, other than a small oil refinery in Cork Harbour.  We are never likely to have such facilities until we get our energy costs under control.</P>
    <P>While it is marvellous to have our own natural gas and the back-up from the European gas grid, gas is an essential part of industrial costs and if it is being supplied at too high a price it makes no contribution to the increased competitiveness of Irish industry; if it is not doing that, we are not making full use of it.  We face so many disadvantages from the point of view of industrial production and industrial costs that where we have some advantages, for example, in having our own gas, we should seek to maximise its use and that means keeping its price at a reasonable level to redress some of the balance which is so heavily weighted against so many aspects of Irish industry.</P>
    <P>Our transport and telecommunications costs are very high and we do not seem to be able to bring them under control. At the industrial tariff level our electricity is very expensive which means we have no large user of electricity.  The one natural advantage we have compared with a number of other countries is that we have our own natural gas; there are only five or six other countries in Europe who have their own natural gas.  Therefore, we should make the fullest use of this resource and reduce its cost inequities and imbalances from which we suffer and some of which we can do nothing about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá cúpla rud le rá agam i dtaobh an Bhille seo.  Tá cónaí orm cóngarach don áit a dtagann an gas i dtír &mdash; Loughshinny a ghlaotar ar an áit in aon rud a léigh mé but it would be more accurate to say the entrance to this plant is between Rush and Loughshinny, alongside St. Catherine's estate.  From that point of view, it is both a local and a national project with major implications for my area.  The local people had a certain amount of apprehension about what <Col N="1243" /> was involved in regard to the pipeline. While, in general, I am aware of the need for it and welcome the connection, in future Bord Gáis Éireann and similar organisations should consult the local population well in advance about what is planned, as the thought of a high-pressured gas pipeline running close to people's homes makes them ask questions. Two years' ago, when Bord Gáis Éireann said it would be consulting the local population in the form of a public meeting, I was happy, but nearer the time I learned with dismay that no moves had been made to have a local meeting although local representatives were met and I welcome that.  However, those questions have been answered and I am glad to say that the local population is much more reassured at present.</P>
      <P>The issue must be considered at a national level and the Green Party, as people may be aware, favours a reduction in the use of fossil fuels to which we committed ourselves at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, which would alleviate the problems associated with global warming.  We would also favour the development of more renewable sources of energy, but it is important to note that gas has a very important role in the transition economy which may, with political will, take about 50 years to put in place, an economy which depends more on renewable sources of energy than on finite resources and fossil fuels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer to the gas interconnector project environmental statement which describes in some detail exactly what is involved with this interconnector. Detailed as it may be on certain issues it omits very important background information which would be useful in this case.  Such information might include the wider world trend towards interdependence of energy, particularly gas.  There is a pipeline ranging from Siberia to Russia, through Poland and into Czechoslovakia and there is already a pipeline between France and Germany.  In that context it is timely that Ireland as an island nation is connected to the wider grid throughout <Col N="1244" /> Europe and Asia.  There is a limited number of years supply left of our own gas field and it is very important that we take steps to prevent a crisis in the event of an interference with that supply.</P>
    <P>Another omission from the information on this interconnector is the failure to address the issue of energy efficiency.  A number of speakers said we should be careful in the way we use our gas.  We should also challenge the marketing policy which encourages the consumer to use more gas, thereby becoming a super saver.  That of course does not refer to saving gas but rather to saving money.  It is a travesty to encourage people to consume more gas than they need.  It should not be allowed in this country nor in any economy which values finite resources.</P>
    <P>Conservation does not seem to feature prominently in the background information to this interconnector.  Market projections seem to forecast and even encourage more use of gas.  Some speakers have suggested that to use more gas is something to be proud of.  That could be a very short lived pride as we have to pay prices for imported gas over which we have no control.  The alternatives have not been considered with any great seriousness &mdash; I hope some of these alternatives, such as nuclear power, would be ruled out.  Nonetheless, the ESB had an option of investing a small amount of money with considerable return in Cape Clear, agus in Oileán Chléire tá muileann gaoithe faoi láthair agus níl aon chóras ríomhaireachta ar fáil mar a bhí.  Is trua é sin mar bhí seans ann an t-oileán sin a dhéanamh neamhspleách ó thaobh fuinnimh de.  It is important in general that the whole area of investment in renewable resources be taken as seriously as we are taking this interconnector.</P>
    <P>I disagree with some comments made by the Minister.  He said, as did a previous speaker, that the best use of gas would be in generating electricity.  One would not need a great scientific background to realise that to use gas to generate electricity renders it much more inefficient than using it as a primary fuel.  The best use of gas is as a primary fuel and <Col N="1245" /> not as a generator of electricity, which is only about one-third as efficient and therefore is not an ideal use of fuel.</P>
    <P>In saying that gas can best be used in farming one is not looking at all the options.  As regards employment potential there is a case to be made for organic farming methods which are much more labour intensive and do not require the use of gas, as is the case in, for example, making artificial fertilisers.  It would be highly inefficient to generate electricity from gas without a system of combined heat and power, a system which ironically is in use, as I discovered recently, in places about which we have little good to say, such as Sellafield.  The combined heat and power system in operation there uses heat to heat buildings.  This would be very practical, particularly near centres of population where the heat could be piped quite easily.</P>
    <P>There are some references in the interconnector project environmental statement which need examination.  It states: &ldquo;It is thought that the total primary energy requirement will increase from around 10 billion tonnes of oil equivalent in 1990 to nearly 15 billion tonnes of oil equivalent in 2015.&rdquo;  This assumption needs to be questioned.  Are we sufficiently committed to using energy effectively and how are we contributing towards tackling global warming, as we said we would do at the Earth Summit in Rio?  This does not tie in with examples in other countries where the use of energy is being carefully monitored.  It has been shown that it is possible to generate more wealth using less energy by applying all our knowledge to conserving the energy we use.  The statement refers to the ESB becoming very reliant on imported oil.  It states: &ldquo;Will Ireland (ESB) be able to meet its commitments with respect to the Helsinki Protocol on sulphur dioxide emissions, and also the Large Combustion Plant Directive on SO² Limits?&rdquo; These are questions which are not being taken into consideration in this overall debate.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the use of energy and the reference in the statement to the increase necessary to become wealthier and more <Col N="1246" /> prosperous.  I question that seriously and will give examples to prove my case. Japan has achieved a greater output in terms of economic growth and wealth creation per unit of energy.  This flies in the face of projections that we have to increase our dependence on fossil fuels if we are to become more prosperous.  It is not enough to say that a 2 per cent increase in gross domestic product will result in a 2 per cent increase in energy consumption.  We could do a lot better than that.  From the point of view of overall consumption, industry has done better than other sectors in terms of energy efficiency.  This is in stark contrast to the domestic sector which has become more inefficient despite the talk about energy conservation.  Perhaps this has something to do with the type of advertising campaign to which I referred where it appears that you save money by using more fuel.</P>
    <P>Overall energy usage has, as one might predict, increased from six to seven million tonnes of oil equivalent in 1980 to nine million tonnes of oil equivalent in 1990.  But is it acceptable to say that that trend will continue and that by the year 2005, consumption will be 15 million tonnes?  It is time we searched carefully, bearing in mind all the information and the technical expertise we have, and acknowledged that we can create more wealth for less energy, and work towards that as a rule of thumb.  If we do not do so, we will walk ourselves and the next generation into a crisis of a sort we can only imagine at this stage.</P>
    <P>Gas has a very important place in the transitional economy between our huge dependence on fossil fuels and a more benign economy where renewable energy has a more important part to play.  There is a case to be made for gas in this regard because it is cleaner than other fossil fuels, it can be used more efficiently as a primary fuel and also when it is used as part of a combined cycle system in generating electricity.  There is a need in the meantime to depend less on fossil fuels wherever we can and to have less pollution as a result.  Balancing that we <Col N="1247" /> should have a more efficient use of the fossil fuels we use and encourage more dependence on renewable energy sources as time goes on.</P>
    <P>At the moment our huge dependence on oil is largely dictated through the prices fixed internationally for oil based on supply and demand.  That is quite inefficient. In terms of fuel usage for generating electricity oil is between 30 and 35 per cent efficient.  That contrasts with gas which comes out quite well at 50 per cent efficiency in generating electricity. Already gas has an important part to play from the efficiency point of view as well as being cleaner.</P>
    <P>If we are using fossil fuels we should concentrate on systems whereby all the energy is used and not wasted.  Heat generated in the generation of electricity should be used with a combined heat and power system so that we can make the optimum use of the limited resources at our disposal.  The primary use of gas, that is to say using gas for direct heat as in cooking with gas, is far more efficient than first turning it into electricity and then back into heat again.  One could have almost 100 per cent efficiency with using gas directly.  That ought to be encouraged.  I am sure Bord Gáis will encourage that.</P>
    <P>The future is important and it has not been mentioned yet.  We must bear in mind that with the best will in the world and all the connectors and interconnectors throughout the world, there will be a more difficult time when the amount of gas available will not be as plentiful and consequently the price will not be as attractive.  Having the pipes in place is important in the transition economy which will lead us towards a time when our dependance on renewable energy sources as well as energy conservation measures will allow us to turn the electricity generated by wind power, for instance, through a system of electrolysis into hydrogen gas.  This has already taken place in Germany where, in the Ruhr Valley, a very highly industrialised area, there is at present a 100 <Col N="1248" /> kilometre length of pipe where hydrogen gas in being used.</P>
    <P>Given that the components are simply wind and water one could not imagine a more benign form of gas.  Hydrogen is more than simply a form of energy, it is an important component in some of the pharmaceutical processes carried out in the Rhur Valley.  There are other spin-off advantages from hydrogen gas.  Ireland would benefit from that, given that we have an important pharmaceutical sector, some companies being better than others.  Nonetheless, hydrogen gas would indicate progress in terms of its effect on the environment.  That is looking quite far into the future, so I will not go any further.</P>
    <P>The interconnector is extremely important from a national point of view as it ensures that any rupture in the present pipeline coming ashore will not be catastrophic in terms of its effect on our economy and there is the option of using gas from other countries, perhaps as far away as Siberia which, as the way things are going, I can see being connected in the near future.</P>
    <P>The price of gas to some of the growers in north County Dublin, for instance, is quite high.  Because it comes ashore in north County Dublin, the gas pipeline is a topical issue there and is very relevant because it is so close.  It is ironic that the price of gas to many of the growers in north County Dublin is cruel.  Many regret changing over to gas because the transition cost them so much and now keeping themselves in business is costing them so much.  We need a review of pricing. NET at the moment are a great beneficiary but it pays far below the market price and produces an environmental down side.  That should make us consider more investment in and development of organic farming.</P>
    <P>I welcome the interconnector and hope it can be used wisely on the basis of the general energy objectives that I have spelt out.  We ought to look more comprehensively at our overall energy policies so that we do not run around at a great rate like lemmings using what we have available and suddenly come to the <Col N="1249" /> end of the cliff and wondering &ldquo;what next?&rdquo;.  We must bear in mind that fossil fuels are not forever.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the purpose and the principle of the Bill.  Potentially it secures the future of our gas industry into the next century.  The construction of a gas interconnector with Britain is essential and must be welcomed.  However, I am disappointed that Dublin rather than Wexford was chosen as the site to land the gas.  Listening to Deputy Sargent I wonder whether he is happy or unhappy that it will be coming ashore in north County Dublin.  Dublin already has a gas grid and an infrastructure that is the envy of the rest of the country.  By not building the interconnector in Wexford an opportunity to redress the imbalance, and, if such idealism is not naive, to treat all the children of the nation equally, has been missed.</P>
      <P>Wexford's claims are not only based exclusively or even mainly on calls to equity and justice.  Given the geographical location of the county, with proximity not only to Britain but also to the continent, and also that that part of the continental shelf is most likely to yield future finds, I question the choice of Loughshinny in County Dublin.  Realistically, however, I also acknowledge that the selection has been made and this House must set about managing the end of an Irish sacred gas industry for the foreseeable future.  In so doing, it is essential that we manage the winding up of our resources, and the plans for their subsequent replacement, far better than we managed their exploitation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1976 when the then Minister for Transport and Power, Deputy Peter Barry, set up Bord Gáis Éireann, several fundamental mistakes were made, the effects of which still reverberate.  In the debate in this House then, it was plainly stated by Fianna Fáil that proposals to provide low priced gas to certain industrial users was grossly wasteful of our first, and so far our last, new energy source in centuries.  By 1987 when the Gas (Amendment) Act of that year was being debated Fine Gael's Deputy Richard <Col N="1250" /> Bruton had also arrived at the same view.  In effect we are now almost at a stage when we will have no gas with which to subsidise chosen State enterprise.  Our gas supplies will come via our interconnector from the open market at market prices.  NET, and the ESB, will have to face a reality that the State has, in my opinion, foolishly sheltered them from for 20 years; the reality being that in a modern world there is no cheap energy.  If the Minister wants further elaboration on my views on this singular relationship between BGE and NET he need go no further than the Culliton report where it is expertly stated.</P>
    <P>The looming problems I refer to do not take account of the losses suffered by the taxpayer because we have chosen to literally discount a scarce natural resource.  Similarly, BGE will have to brace itself for a new world.  It will not get another Marathon deal.  I can only hope that its projections are entirely realistic.  It is the absolute duty of the Minister to rigorously cross-check that they are.  It is anticipated that in 1993 Bord Gáis Éireann will yield a dividend of £15 million to the Exchequer.  I have stated that the Minister has a duty to guard against false optimism on the part of Bord Gáis Éireann.  Equally he, and his successors, have an obligation to keep their fingers out of the till.  The capacity to pay back borrowing of up to £350 million, allowed for in this Bill, is based on projections, one of which is that the company is not going to be rated by the Exchequer. Let us not be tempted to repeat in any form the mistakes that were made in the seventies.  Bord Gáis Éireann is neither the way nor the means to subvent either semi-State industry nor, indeed, the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>This legislation facilitating our interconnection with the British system and the North Sea market is essential if we are to have a gas supply beyond the end of the century.  It is estimated that the pipeline has a potential life of about 50 years, the same as North Sea supplies are expected to last.  Of great potential interest is the fact that via the British system we can potentially link with the <Col N="1251" /> European grid.  I understand that a feasibility study is being carried out at present as to the viability of a link between Britain and France.  If this were to happen it would give us access to Siberian supplies. The prospect of an almost global gas grid is neither far-fetched nor far off. Ever widening access to broadly based energy markets is essential if we are to protect the huge investments that have been made in gas technology here.  This investment is not only in industry but in tens of thousands of homes around the country the interconnector is literally a lifeline and has to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I would now like to comment on the nature of the commercial lifeline that is our national gas grid.  It is a limited and selective one.  By effect, if not by design, it causes even further imbalance in our already unbalanced regional structure.  In Wexford &mdash; I live on the Hook Peninsula &mdash; we can look across Waterford harbour and see the gas lamps of relative prosperity, yet only a few miles away we are denied a chance to link into this valuable energy source.  Whatever the causes the effect is certainly discriminatory.</P>
    <P>The net effect of this discrimination is that Wexford has the third highest unemployment rate in Ireland; 25 per cent of our people are on the dole.  There is a perception of Wexford as being prosperous, the land of milk and honey.  It is interesting to note that even with last week's Digital disaster the unemployment figures for County Galway are 24 per cent.  It is difficult for most people to understand that our unemployment levels are as high as those in areas west of the Shannon but that is a fact.  It is well known that the economic health of any county or area can be judged on its unemployment. Some of my colleagues from the west pointed out to me many of their people are abroad but so too are many Wexford people.  I have two daughters in England.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, our county is plagued by unemployment.  Machines have replaced people on our farms; the industries that serviced agriculture have either declined or disappeared.  Pierce's in Wexford <Col N="1252" /> town and Wexford Agricultural Machinery in New Ross are no more. Albatros Fertilizer which once employed 480 people now employs only 50.  The county's produce is largely processed outside Wexford.  Wexford produces one third of Ireland's sugar beat crop but the processing factories are elsewhere.  No manufacturing base has been established to replace employment in agriculture and its subsidiary industries.  The model county &mdash; as we are known &mdash; is on the verge of stagnation and, possibly, worse.</P>
    <P>Today I ask not for subsidy or subvention because those are not long-term solutions.  Wexford is not asking for cheap gas but rather for gas at market prices.  Deputy Sargent said that gas was too dear in north county Dublin but we would gladly have it.  To justify the initial capital outlay, capital grants are necessary. We need a shot in the arm, not dole and not butter vouchers.  During the next few years substantial funds will be coming into Ireland for the purpose of regional development.  This is the last hope of getting poorer areas on their feet.  We in Wexford demand the chance to compete on equal terms with the rest of the country and with Europe.  I ask the Minister to do his utmost to make this interconnector a reality not just for a few but for everyone.  Effectively, this can only be done by extending the national grid and the arguments for doing this are compelling.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will take up the point made by Deputy Byrne as to why Loughshinny was selected as the location where the interconnector should come into the country.  I am sure there are many and varied reasons for doing this, and the environmental statement issued by Bord Gáis makes a good case for the line coming in at Loughshinny in north County Dublin.  It probably has something to do with cost, the geology of the sea bed, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the installation of the gas interconnector between Britain and Ireland and, in general, the European grid.  I think it is widely accepted that natural gas is the least environmentally <Col N="1253" /> damaging of the fossil fuels &mdash; it has very low SO² and NO² levels, the &ldquo;SOX&rdquo; and &ldquo;NOX&rdquo; as they are referred to.  It also emits a smaller proportion of CO² for a given unit of heat output than other fossil fuels.  It is important that such an environmentally friendly heat and energy source is available to the Irish people.</P>
    <P>At present, approximately 15-16 per cent of our primary energy requirements are met by natural gas.  As we all know, this supply comes from the Kinsale field. I think there is a small subsidiary satellite field at Ballycotton to supplement the Kinsale Head field.  In the main, our gas supply comes from the Kinsale field.  We know from present usage that gas supplies from the Kinsale field will be exhausted by the year 2000 and that unless we make new discoveries we will have no natural gas supply.  Therefore, it is important that we recognise the need for gas.  It is also important to recognise that this will be a two-way interconnector and that if we are lucky enough to have another gas find off our coast it may well be that we could be a supplier of gas into the UK grid and elsewhere in future years.  One should not look at the interconnector as a one-way system; obviously gas can flow in either direction.</P>
    <P>As we know, the gas interconnector will also supply gas to Northern Ireland, which has no supply of gas at present.  I understand a connection from Britain will be made from the same landfall on Moffat across to Northern Ireland. Obviously that will improve the position in the North also.  When talking about this issue one must look at it in the context of making facilities available to the entire island of Ireland.  This is why many speakers in this debate and elsewhere have expressed disappointment at the fact that there is no electricity connection between the North and South.  One would hope that the Minister would try to re-establish such a connection.  I know there would be security problems involved in such a connection &mdash; there may also be a security risk in terms of the gas interconnector &mdash; but I believe the facilities which would be put in place would protect such a connection.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1254" /> It is important to note that with the introduction in 1990 of a ban on the use of bituminous coal, particularly in Dublin and its surrounding areas, to comply with EC environmental requirements, there has been a bigger dependence on gas. For that reason I welcome the Bord Gáis Éireann assertive and aggressive policy of marketing gas into non-gas estates, the NGEs, in Dublin city and county.  I recognise that it must be economical for it to do this, but it must also take into account all the circumstances and the future potential of extending its supply to the many housing estates in County Dublin, particularly in the sprawling suburban areas.  It needs to get in first when these housing estates are being built and developed so that gas is a viable alernative to the other forms of heating and energy available.  Obviously it is cheaper for householders to have the gas supply connected when the house is being built. It is also cheaper for Bord Gáis Éireann to install the necessary infrastructure when a housing estate is being built.</P>
    <P>Recently in my town of Malahide, a large hotel which does excellent business and the developer of the Marina site got together with Bord Gáis Éireann to extend the gas supply to the town.  The extension of the supply to Malahide looked somewhat dodgy for a while because the first housing estate on the Swords Road did not seem to have the potential to take up the gas supply. However, as a result of the initiative of the developers of the Marina site and of the hotel owner, the gas supply was extended to Malahide.  This will be of benefit to Bord Gáis Éireann who will be able to market its products in many estates in the town, particularly the older estates where heating systems are obsolete or where people are considering changing their heating systems.  These kind of initiatives are very welcome.</P>
    <P>I know when he is replying to the debate the Minister will give the House an assurance about the security of this pipeline, particularly where it comes into the country at Loughshinny in north County Dublin.  I see Deputy Ryan is in the House and Deputy Sargent has <Col N="1255" /> already spoken on this issue.  Concern has been expressed by the people living near Loughshinny about this issue.  They want absolute assurances, to the extent that assurances can be given when one is dealing with a product like natural gas, that there will be no extra risk to the people living in that small community through the location of the interconnector landfall site close by their houses, farms, schools, church, pubs, etc.</P>
    <P>I have attended meetings in the area and I know that the officials of Bord Gáis Éireann have met with the local people. It is extremely important that those contacts are kept up and that the management of the interconnector project are conscious of the sensitivities of the people living near the interconnector landfall site.  There is always a risk, when one is dealing with a natural product such as gas, which can be easily ignited, that if it is not protected it will become a target.  In this connection, I should like to get an assurance from the Minister &mdash; I realise this issue cannot be talked about openly &mdash; that every effort will be made to have proper security plans in place at Loughshinny.  Both the local gardaí and gardaí from other stations should have an involvement so that the area is kept under close scrutiny and is protected from people who might have some evil vested interest in using the interconnector to disrupt life and society.  For that reason I hope there is liaison between the Garda Commissioner and the other relevant people.  There should also be a system of alert and monitoring if anyone gains unauthorised access to the small plant which will be built there. I understand that the plant will not be very visible &mdash; there will be some pipes over the ground with a good land bank around them.  Nevertheless the local residents are worried and they do not want to be made a target by any subversive elements.</P>
    <P>I have studied the environmental statement issued by Bord Gáis.  I want to pay tribute to it for its comprehensive statement.  I am not sure, but I do not think it was obliged by law to prepare <Col N="1256" /> such a statement; rather it recognised the need to do so.</P>
    <P>The area of Loughshinny, Skerries, Rush and Lusk is rich in archaeological sites.  The remains of many ancient settlements lie beneath the ground and will be discovered in the course of excavations for the pipeline.  Eight sites in the area are classified as nationally important.  Of these, none is close to the pipeline but three are complex monuments which are expected to have extensive remains outside the immediate area of the pipeline. It is extremely important that archaeologically qualified people should be involved in this project.  I remember the difficulties in Dublin when the civic offices were being built and the lack of sensitivity to archaeological remains which caused such trouble.  We have had assurances from Bord Gáis Éireann that archaeological considerations are being catered for and I would welcome further assurances from the Minister in this regard.  Bord Gáis Éireann might also fund improvements and security around these archaeological sites so that they will not be lost for ever.</P>
    <P>This is an enormous and very expensive project, the overall cost of which is almost £290 million.  Bord Gáis Éireann must recognise that they have a role to play in regard to the local community.  It is not every community that would accept the disruption which is happening in that locality.  Many of the lands are being traversed and farmers have not been able to plant.  I accept that they will be compensated and I welcome the fact that an agronomist has been appointed who will be available for up to five years after the completion of the project to monitor the effects of the land works.  There should not be any reluctance by Bord Gáis Éireann to recognise that this is a major intrusion into a small community.  There are instances in other areas where small communities have been up in arms and have delayed projected developments. The people of Loughshinny have been extremely co-operative and I hope that any reasonable requests made by their vibrant representative body will be listened to and, if possible, complied with. <Col N="1257" /> There is a suggestion that a scenic walk could be planned along the cliffs.  Bord Gáis Éireann should be prepared, in liaison with Dublin County Council, to fund the laying out of such a walk for the people of the area and for visitors.  Such minor requests should be met.</P>
    <P>On leaving my office this evening I received information to the effect that there is some hiccup on the Irish side about the provision of a road.  This is causing some problems for the Scots, who are afraid the project will be delayed. Perhaps the Minister will look into this matter.</P>
    <P>The prime concern of local residents is the safe operation of the pipeline.  They want an assurance that every conceivable safety feature will be built into this project. I see from the report that there was an examination of the benefits of a leak detection system.  Is the Minister satisfied that cost has not been the deciding factor in regard to safety features, especially in view of the enormity of the project and the potential destruction which could be caused by a major leakage or fire?  Could there be a blowback of gas trapped in the pipeline if there was a fire on the land side?  Local residents are anxious to know if there is a cut-off valve which could be activated in the event of something going wrong.  I understand it is necessary at all times to keep the pipeline filled with gas but there would have to be a fail safe value half way along the pipeline which could be opened to allow the gas to dissipate in the water around it.  Assurance is very important in this respect.</P>
    <P>The Minister said a commission would be appointed comprising representatives of each Government to oversee the smooth operation of the pipeline.  The agreement also deals with the status of the Isle of Man, through whose territorial waters the pipeline passes.  This project is of mutual benefit to the Irish and the British.  If we buy gas from them, it is good for their economy.  If the gas is reasonably priced, that is good for us.  If we make further finds of gas we could be a net exporter of gas through the European grid.  Has the commission been set up? Who is to be a member?  Could local <Col N="1258" /> representatives be involved, in view of the land fall site?</P>
    <P>I realise that this is a main gasline which cannot be tapped into to provide a supply for local houses.  Perhaps the Minister would suggest to Bord Gáis Éireann that they bring a line from the closest spur connection at Ballough to Loughshinny as a recognition of the co-operation of the local community.  Perhaps the Minister could take that up in view of the ease with which this project has gone ahead.  I warmly welcome the project.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal of Bord Gáis Éireann, which had the full support of the previous Government in 1991, to connect the Irish national gas field into the British grid is of vital importance to the future economic and industrial development of this State.  This can be looked at in the context of Ireland being at present dependent on coal and oil imports for two-thirds of its primary energy requirements.  The balance is provided by depleting stocks of indigenous fuels such as peat and natural gas.  Given that there is a doubt as to whether Bord Gáis Éireann is statutorily empowered to carry out works outside this State, I fully support this Bill and I hope it will get the full support of the House.</P>
      <P>The demand for natural gas to meet the growing energy needs of this country is increasing daily.  I understand that the potential demand is three billion cubic metres and it is expected to grow to four billion by the year 2000.  This demand is increasing as more industries with access to the gas transmission network switch over to natural gas.  I understand that 90 per cent of industries along this route have already made that connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill passed in the last Dáil which banned the use of bituminous fuel in the Dublin area is still further increasing the dependency on gas.  In the absence of further major discoveries, our indigenous natural gas supplies from Kinsale and Ballycotton will be largely used up by the year 2000.  Given that more than 30 per cent of the State's electricity is generated by gas and 90 per cent of industries with <Col N="1259" /> access to the grid have switched over to gas, this is a matter of grave concern. In 1991 a previous Minister for Energy signed an agreement with Marathon Petroleum Limited under which the company undertook to drill seven exploratory wells over a period of five years.  To date only one of these test holes has been drilled.  I understand the result of this test drilling was, unfortunately, not very encouraging.  Given the demand for natural gas, I am asking what is holding up further exploration in this field.  I know the Minister is hopeful of positive results in the remainder of the drilling programme. I presume he knows more than he is telling us.  I hope so.  In this context I request that he use his influence with the company to have further tests carried out as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>In the absence of further significant discoveries of gas during the next 15 to 20 years this country will be very dependent on the UK as its single source of supply.  In that event would the Minister agree that this State would be very vulnerable to any interruption of gas supplies for whatever purpose or from whatever source?  The possibility of terrorist attacks whether here or in the North Sea can never be disregarded.  I hope that will never occur.  The Minister, when responding, should outline some of the alternatives he has in mind in such a doomsday situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that an agreement completed last year between Bord Gáis Éireann and National Power in the UK will give access to supply.  Can he assure us that when we are connected to the British grid, as will happen when this process goes through by means of a gas interconnector project, we will not be held up to ransom at some stage in respect of the cost of the gas?  I would like the Minister to confirm what arrangements have been secured in this regard. Can we be assured that the European Commission, which has grant-aided this project to the extent of 35 per cent of approved costs, will protect our interests in that regard?</P>
    <P>The onshore pipeline will be approximately <Col N="1260" /> 9 kilometres in length and extend from the existing transmission system at Ballough in my own constituency to the landfall at Loughshinny in County Dublin.  There will also be a shore station at Loughshinny with a facility for metering and pressure reduction.  In the County Dublin development plan, the area through which this pipeline runs is described as (1) an area of scientific interest, (2) an area protected for archaeological reasons and (3) areas protected for scenic views.  Each of them is very relevant.</P>
    <P>In view of these classifications, and the potential for tourism in the area, the residents, through their community associations, expressed concern at the possible effects on the environment.  As their public representative I share their concern and I hope to get assurances in relation to some of them.  Two elements in particular have given rise to concern. One is the shore station which, for technical reasons must be located close to the landfall and interfere with the scenic views.  That has been taken on board by BGE but every effort must be made to minimise the visual impact of this structure by the provision of a screening arrangement so that it will not restrict the view across the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>Dr. A.A. Ryder for RSK Environment Limited in a summary in the environmental statement stated that the construction of the landfall may also be a cause for concern and could give rise to significant environmental impact.  The boulder clay cliffs at Loughshinny, a very important feature of that area, have been selected as the landfall location.  This is an area of scientific interest.  All of us, particularly in our role as local authority representatives, would be concerned that that be protected.  Every effort must be made to ensure that the cliff lands suffer the minimum amount of environmental impact.  The area between Ballough and Loughshinny is predominantly one of market gardening.  It is at the centre of Ireland's horticultural industry and, by its very nature, its landholdings are relatively small in size.  Those market gardens are very important, however, and there <Col N="1261" /> is no doubt that the laying of pipes will have an impact on the gardens.</P>
    <P>Given the commitment made by Bord Gáis to enter into meaningful negotiations with the farmers and the growers of the area, whether individually or through IFA representatives, I am disappointed that the Minister found it necessary on 7 February last to sign 34 CPOs on the landowners in question.  The case has been made very clearly that the vast majority of farmers believe that, because of the value of the land, the importance of their activity and the way in which that activity will be affected, the deed of easement agreement of £11 per metre is insufficient.  As I have said, the holdings in question would be between 20 and 40 acres.  Bord Gáis maintains that it cannot distinguish between one part of the country and another when valuing land to be affected by the laying of pipes but there is a major difference in the impact that would be experienced on a small holding &mdash; and we could perhaps be talking about a field of two to three acres &mdash; and that experienced on a landholding of 200 acres in the midlands or further down by Cork.  In my view, there are grounds for reconsidering the effects and financial impact on the landholders involved and it should be possible to resolve this issue through consultation.</P>
    <P>For a moment I wish to refer to the problems of a constituent of mine, a small landholder who is trying to rear a family, who feels very aggrieved at the current proposal as it affects his 48 acres.  Three years ago the north-eastern pipeline was laid through the field in which his home is located, fairly close to the gable end of his house.  My constituent is still getting over the effects of that, so one can understand the frustration he feels on being informed by Bord Gáis that the current pipeline proposal will run right through the same field and will in fact go even closer to his home.  It seems that my constituent is to be surrounded by pipes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  On top of all that, the plans also affect the only <Col N="1262" /> site my constituent had available on his small holding on which a house could be built for his daughter.  My constituent appealed to the Minister and to Bord Gáis that they take cognisance of his concern and if posible relocate the proposed pipeline.  The reply received was that his objection was frivolous and he would not be granted an oral hearing or an appeal. On behalf of my constituent, I say very clearly that his complaint is not frivolous but reflects a major problem.  I ask the Minister, notwithstanding the issue of CPOs in this respect, to contact Bord Gáis officials with a view to trying to reach some accommodation with my constituent.</P>
      <P>Several points were raised during a recent meeting between public representatives and local community representatives. One issue concerned security, which was referred to earlier also.  I should like the Minister to confirm that there will be ongoing security provisions, particularly for areas of potential risk.  It is a condition that an emergency plan be produced in conjunction with the local authority and emergency services? Will there be an opportunity for involvement of representatives of the local community in the production of that plan?</P>
      <P>I realise that there is to be a release valve provided on land in Ireland.  Representatives have asked what would happen in the case of a leakage between the Irish coastline and Scotland.  With the technology available now, would it be possible to provide a release valve to the pipeline under the sea?</P>
      <P>In relation to the Ballough station, in the past few years there have been complaints about leakage.  In order that the issue may be clarified once and for all, I should like the station to be examined. It would be preferable if all public representatives serving the constituency were informed of such an examination so that the people could be reassured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge and appreciate the support given in recent months by the Ministers of State, Deputy Hyland and Deputy O'Shea to attempts to bring about a realistic pricing structure for the <Col N="1263" /> horticultural industry and the growers in north County Dublin.  An anomaly still exists.  Further compensation to the larger growers would help to resolve the problem and I ask that the matter be dealt with.</P>
    <P>A study of the annual reports of Bord Gáis Éireann shows clearly that great strides have been made in terms of profit. Everyone in the country should be able to avail of the provision of natural gas.  I ask the Minister why natural gas has not been provided to all local authority estates in the growth areas?  Perhaps there is a difficulty but those who live in local authority estates should not be excluded from the benefits of our national assets.  Careful consideration should be given to making that facility available in local authority housing estates.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and I hope it will mean that we can provide for our needs in the short term.  I also hope that at some stage we can export natural gas, if that happened this Bill would indeed have been welcome.</P>
    <P>I also hope it will be possible to provide some facility for the local residents in Loughshinny.  I know contact has been made by Bord Gáis with a view to giving a commitment to the local community to provide some sort of facilities.  I ask the Minister and Bord Gáis Éireann to work with the local residents and Dublin County Council to ensure that this happens.  I look forward to a favourable response to a community which has worked very closely with Bord Gáis Éireann and who have put up with inconvenience.  I hope they will get the response which we, as public representatives for the area, regard as necessary.</P>

    <Col N="1264" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this legislation and I sincerely hope the Government will accept Private Members' Bills which are urgently needed as far as criminal law is concerned.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with outdated legislation in regard to criminal law and this Bill makes a genuine attempt to deal with the problem facing ordinary people every day of the week.  It is not necessary for the Government to produce its own Bill if an Opposition party is prepared to do some of the work and present good legislation. I sincerely hope that the Government, in the true spirit of Dáil reform, will accept this Bill and encourage Opposition parties to act in a responsible way in relation to the criminal law.</P>
      <P>The Opposition should be encouraged to introduce Private Members' Bills which are urgently needed.  I say that in all sincerity because the role of the Opposition is more than just opposing, it has a positive, constructive role to play, particularly in regard to dealing with crime, where there is consensus on the problems facing the people whom we all represent.  The country faces massive financial problems as well as the hardship caused to so many people affected by them.  However, the continuing level of crime and violence is an even bigger problem.  I have always maintained that there is not much point in having a sound economy if people cannot walk the streets in peace without the fear of being mugged.  Old people and widows are literally afraid to leave their homes; I do not want to live in a society where people are afraid to visit their sons and daughters in case somebody breaks into their homes in their absence.  All Members know that many people never leave their homes at night because of this fear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is about time we dealt with these problems in a realistic fashion.  For many years, since coming to the Opposition benches, I have heard various Ministers for Justice justifying the existing level of crime by citing various statistics.  I do not accept those statistics because any Member who attends public meetings in his or her constituency comes across people who are not complaining about <Col N="1265" /> organised crime &mdash; even house breaking &mdash; but about their fear of groups loitering and causing a general nuisance in their areas.  People are afraid to send their sons or daughters for a message because of gangs of youths gathered in various places.  Those fears do not appear in statistics relating to crime and I congratulate Deputy Harney on her attempt to deal with loitering.  Nobody wants a society where the police would move on a person talking to a neighbour.  This legislation attempts to deal with the problem which we all know exists, the general nuisance caused by groups hanging round laneways, open spaces and schoolyards, breaking windows and causing a general disturbance in the area.  We need to give additional powers to the Garda Síochána to deal with the problem.  This legislation attempts to deal with it and I have great pleasure in supporting it.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government will accept this legislation because it is a genuine attempt to deal with the problems which I know concern the vast majority of people whom I represent.  I do not want to hear the same old excuse trotted out, that we must deal with unemployment before we tackle crime effectively.  There is no excuse for children from the ages of ten to 13 years causing a nuisance, smashing windows and intimidating people.  They are not doing this damage because they do not have a job, it is mindless vandalism. I also condemn the parents who consistently ignore their responsibilities and allow children to hang around estates late into the night and early morning. I often wonder what those parents are doing.  How can they think that a 13 year old should be allowed to hang around the streets at midnight or 1 a.m.?  If I had my way those parents would also appear in court because there are different forms of abuse.  Much is said &mdash; quite rightly &mdash; about sexual abuse but it is also an abuse to allow children of ten or 12 years of age to wander on our streets.  It is a form of abuse which I abhor and I will do everything in my power to get rid of it. Unfortunately, we have to deal with the situation as it exists at present and it is necessary to give the Garda the power to <Col N="1266" /> move on people who are loitering and causing a nuisance.  The Bill attempts to deal with this in a very effective way.</P>
    <P>I accept that in many places, particularly in parts of outer Dublin, society has failed to deal with the ongoing problems of lack of facilities in large housing estates.  In addition to giving powers to the Garda Síochána the Government also has a responsibility to tackle this problem.</P>
    <P>The national lottery was set up with the intention of providing grants to sporting and recreational organisations either directly or through the local authorities. It is an absolute scandal that the Government has raided the coffers of the national lottery and is now using the proceeds as an additional form of income for day-to-day public expenditure.  Anybody who plays the lotto on a Wednesday or a Saturday does so voluntarily and is only too pleased to know that if he wins he wins, but if he loses the proceeds go to worthwhile projects.  As far as I can see, the Minister for Finance and his Department seem to regard this money as their own to share out to the various Departments in place of moneys that should come from ordinary taxation, with the result, as I noted in a reply to a parliamentary question, that no allocation has been made in 1993 for amenity and recreational grants.  That is an absolute and utter disgrace.</P>
    <P>In large areas of our towns and cities we are building large housing estates but we are leaving it up to people on a voluntary basis to look after the children who join the football clubs, youth clubs or other organisations.  People are giving of their time on a voluntary basis and they are not getting any assistance from the national lottery.  Indeed in 1993 not one penny is being allocated from the national lottery for amenity and recreational grants.  As I said already, this is an absolute disgrace and I hope that in the coming months we on this side of the House will hound and harry the Minister for Finance to know exactly what he is doing with these funds.</P>
    <P>While acknowledging the additional powers that are given to the Garda Síochána <Col N="1267" /> to deal with the problem outlined in the Bill, we have to recognise the Government's failure to provide additional funds to the Department of Justice to increase the number of gardaí on the beat.  Anyone who tries to tell us that crime is decreasing and that, as a result, we can reduce the number of gardaí, is fooling the public.  The reality is that there are approximately 600 fewer gardaí today than there were in 1986-87, yet crime is increasing.  We cannot tolerate that.  It is all very well to give additional powers to the Garda Síochána but if we do not have the personnel to deal with the ongoing crime what use is legislation?  I receive consistent complaints in my constituency that when an individual rings the local Garda station, he is told &ldquo;I am sorry, we do not have anybody available at present because of such and such an investigation&rdquo; or other special duties.  The person has done his duty by reporting the matter to the Garda station but it can take an hour or even two before a member of the force is available. I fail to see how we can justify dealing with crime with fewer members in the force.  It is all very well to pass legislation but we make a mockery of the law if we do not have the personnel to enforce it.  I think this needs to be highlighted consistently and we must highlight also the failure of this Government and previous Governments since 1987 to bring the strength of the Garda Síochána up to the 1986 level at least.  Let me repeat there are between 600 and 700 fewer gardaí today than there were seven years ago.</P>
    <P>I welcome the section of the Bill which deals with unlawful loitering in public places.  This problem frequently comes up at the public meetings we are asked to attend.  Because of what I perceive as bad planning in large housing estates throughout the Dublin area &mdash; and I am sure it is no different in other cities &mdash; there are numerous laneways where youths can gather on a regular basis and cause untold problems to the residents. This is something which it is extremely difficult to police.  Indeed there are <Col N="1268" /> ongoing requests from the residents to have these laneways blocked off.  I very much welcome the provision in the Bill which empowers the Commissioner to erect surveillance equipment.  In addition local authorities are being given powers to designate certain areas where loitering will not be permitted.  This is an ideal solution to what is an ongoing problem in large estates.  These are practical proposals to deal with real problems.  I sincerely hope the legislation will be passed as quickly as possible in order to offer some hope to those who are affected on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>Drug pushing can occur when groups gather to loiter in an area.  Very often it is difficult for the gardaí to pin something on the groups.  They may be reasonably certain that drugs are being pushed but it is very difficult to prove it.  People are coming and going and even young children may be offered drugs.  These are the practical problems the Garda have to deal with.  It is very difficult for the Garda to deal with such situations when they have not the necessary proof to make arrests.  I think the powers given in this Bill to allow the Garda to disperse the group and move them on will be of great assistance in dealing with the problem of drug pushing, which is very prevalent in many of our cities and towns.  I believe these powers will reduce the problems facing the Garda and ultimately assist in the fight against drugs.</P>
    <P>Racketeering is also very difficult to prove.  People pay protection money out of fear.  One hears stories of premises being burned down and the rumour is that the protection money was not paid. From my experience in the insurance business I know it is very difficult to get fire insurance in certain areas of Dublin because it is known that protection money is being sought and being paid by people because they feel they have no other option.  As a result the insurance underwriters are withdrawing cover on renewal.  This is a huge problem for those in business who are trying to provide a service for the public.</P>
    <P>Those who approach people for protection money are generally not very <Col N="1269" /> friendly and people, because of fear instilled in them, are loath to report such matters to the Garda Síochána and even when such matters are reported, they are difficult to prove.  This type of crime is happening on a large scale, and we are foolish if we do not accept that it is. Whether it is the Provos or ordinary gansters who are involved it is happening. Recent newspaper reports cited incidents in Leeson Street, the problem in regard to the &ldquo;general&rdquo; and people getting shot in the legs if they do not pay up.  This legislation is an attempt to deal with such incidents and would give the Garda power to move in and deal with the problem where they suspect such crime is taking place.  That would alleviate the fear which prevents people reporting such incidents &mdash; and then having to prove that they did &mdash; so that the Garda could take effective action.  The Garda should have reasonable power to move in and deal with these problems and I do not believe they would abuse such power. The Garda, when dealing with the problem of loitering, are not interested in approaching people who are having a quiet chat on the footpath; this legislation would not interfere with a person's civil rights.  However, there are occasions when people know of a group who are up to no good but the Garda do not have the power to intervene.  They should have the power to deal with the problems of such loitering, racketeering and the protection racket where unscrupulous individuals use intimidation to extract money from people trying to run businesses.  As I have said already, whether it is the Provos or ordinary criminals who are involved, it is still the same offence and the Garda should have the power to deal with it.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Deputy Harney and the Progressive Democrats for introducing this legislation.  It is urgently needed and it would be hypocritical of the Government not to accept it.  If the Government wishes to make some technical amendments it can do so on Committee or Report Stages.  The problem of loitering has been dealt with by the Select Committee on Crime and its proposals are similar to those in this legislation.  I do not <Col N="1270" /> see how the Government can improve on what is already contained in the Bill. Therefore, there is no excuse for delaying the passing of this legislation. I am sure if the Government does not accept it we will hear the lame excuse, presented by various other Governments, that it has its own proposals.  I do not accept that. If it is good legislation and deals with problems that we all know exist, the Government should accept it even though it was introduced by the Opposition. That is what I call real Dáil reform and it would encourage all Members to use their talents in introducing legislation. There is nothing worse for an Opposition than to spend a great deal of time and effort producing Private Members' Bills dealing with problems which everybody agrees exist and need to be dealt with and then find the legislation is not accepted because it was not introduced by the Government.  That does not make sense and I hope this Government will change that and that the Minister, at the end of Second Stage tomorrow, will accept this legislation.  As I said already, it can be amended on Committee Stage, if necessary.</P>

I welcome sections 2 to 6 and section 8 in relation to a graduated scale of unlawful assembly to deal with riot, violent disorder, affray and unlawful loitering.  However, those sections do not address the wider context in which the Minister, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, is attempting to look at all aspects of these problems.  The Select Committee on Crime suggested many areas of juvenile crime which needed to be addressed.  In other words, the committee's report on juvenile crime, to some extent, is the <Col N="1271" /> other side of the picture Deputy Harney is addressing in this legislation.  I did not have an opportunity to speak on that debate last Friday, but many of the recommendations in that report should be addressed immediately in a criminal law Bill.  That committee called for non-custodial responses to juvenile offenders and those are the type of responses we could profitably follow.</P>
      <P>There is a large population of juvenile drop-outs between the ages of ten and 16 in housing estates in our cities and towns who are primarily responsible for the problems Deputy Harney has tried to address in this legislation.  There are some proposals in sections 2 to 6 and in section 8 which I would like included in the final legislation the Government might present.  For example, a common problem in my constituency is the consumption of alcohol by juveniles.  It is a constant and irritating problem.  Even now if one were to visit some estates on the north side of the city tonight one would see large numbers of juveniles heading towards the perimeters or to various parks or open spaces carrying alcohol. This is a major problem.  We are all aware that the main supermarket chains and many off-licences are, at times, guilty of selling drink to juveniles.  We should consider some means by which manufacturers of alcohol and the retail outlets are made directly responsible for this problem.  To return to the problem of loitering, if drink is not involved the congregating of such groups does not result in riotous behaviour.  Usually, it is the presence of drink, particularly in ten to 14 year olds that is the key factor in crime.  I would like the Minister to address this matter as we have never dealt with the problem of those who supply alcohol to juveniles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must consider also the problem of the intimidation of certain vulnerable families in many estates in this city.  One of the officials of Dublin Corporation, our chief welfare officer, Michael Kelly, compiled an excellent report on the problem <Col N="1272" /> of intimidation.  Families can be subject to intimidation simply because they are different &mdash; perhaps they may be single parents, are of a different race or simply living in an end house on a large estate.  Two cases which I am dealing with at the moment illustrate how the lives of these people can be made absolutely miserable by both small and large groups of juveniles.  Any future legislation must address the whole area of intimidation. It would be useful to study the work undertaken by Dublin Corporation in this area.  Some of the proposals in this Bill would not have an effect on this issue when there are cases of families having rocks hurled at their front doors, suffering chants of intimidation or obscene telephone calls.  We all know that riotous behaviour takes place and, unfortunately, the only solution seems to be to move either the victims or the offending families from the estate.  This whole area must be addressed.</P>
    <P>With regard to policing, Deputy Barrett made remarks similar to those I had intended to make.  I put down a question today to the Minister for Justice concerning the strength of the police presence in my own constituency, Dublin north-east.  We have three large police stations serving a population of approximately 84,000 &mdash; roughly the population of the greater Limerick area &mdash; comprising 200 gardaí.  This is totally insufficient. My own local station in Coolock would at times have only two dozen officers available, many of whom would be tied up with court work, etc.  and not available for other police duties.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to examine the possibility of creating an auxiliary police force, or police reserves, which exist in many countries.  These forces operate fairly successfully in countries as diverse as Britain, England in particular, and Japan where there is a locally recruited auxiliary police force, which is familiar with its own area and can carry out much of the day to day police work.  This would allow for the main detection work to be carried <Col N="1273" /> out by our skilled professional police force.  We should examine the possibility of recruiting up to 3,000 auxiliary police officers at some stage during the lifetime of this Government.  Northern Ireland, for example, operates such a system but theirs is a particularly difficult society which does not have any relevance to us.</P>
    <P>Regarding the problems referred to in sections 2 to 6 and section 8 of the Bill, they are caused when certain juveniles are released repeatedly by the courts.  I would suggest that when the proposed legislative and security committee is established by the Minister &mdash; one of the four new standing committees &mdash; the possibility of this House vetting all judges to be appointed could be examined.  This has been suggested in the past but is now urgently required.  Perhaps a two-thirds majority of this new standing committee and two-thirds of the Members of this House could be required to veto any future judicial appointments.  It is an area I would like the Minister to consider.</P>
    <P>In relation to the problem of &ldquo;death riding&rdquo;, or joy riding as it is referred to by some people, one of the main problems on the north side is that many of the cars used for &ldquo;death riding&rdquo; around our local estates are not stolen but are bought by juveniles and driven without insurance.  These youths are under 18 years of age and some are as young as ten or 11.  Those cars can be bought for anything between £20 and £50.  In the forthcoming legislation I would ask the Minister to consider the whole area of vendors who sell those cars to juveniles and cause mayhem for whole communities.</P>
    <P>I am supportive of the general intent of the early provisions of this Bill.  I would welcome a broader approach, perhaps along the lines of the United Kingdom's Public Order Act, 1986, which would consolidate the legislation.  I am sure Deputy Harney would be willing to have her proposals considered at that stage.  I also welcome the proposals by the Minister for Justice to abolish all the anachronistic legal rules regarding categorisation of crimes such as felonies and misdemeanours and the other changes <Col N="1274" /> promised under the proposed criminal law Bill.</P>
    <P>Regarding section 7 of this Bill, I applaud the Deputy for introducing the proposal on racketeering.  It is only eight or ten months since a savage gangland assasination of a shopkeeper was carried out in my own constituency in front of shoppers.  This crime was apparently committed on a contract basis and the perpetrators have so far not been found. Local legend has it that the criminals were flying out of Dublin Airport within minutes of carrying out this dastardly deed.  In the past four or five years the purveyors of this type of gangsterism &mdash; true heirs of the Godfather films seen in recent years &mdash; have acquired a certain notoriety.  They are written about and people keep newspaper clippings of their deeds.  We must strike hard to apprehend these criminals.  I deplore the fact that the serious crime squad, which had these people under intense surveillance for a long period of time, have discontinued this.  I would like to see a return to that type of approach.  Many of the ideas in Deputy Harney's Bill could be consolidated into a Bill dealing with profit racketeering.  I applaud the Deputy for bringing forward such proposals.</P>
    <P>With regard to prohibition orders, one of the problems, certainly in Dublin, is the appalling design of many of our estates.  Many estates on both the north side and the west side, as one of the city managers said recently, contain spaces that are not amenity spaces at all.  They are totally indefensible spaces which can be used as areas for civil commotion and trouble-making.  Giving local authorities certain powers along the lines suggested in the Bill must be seriously considered because all spaces should be purely for amenity purposes and of recreational value to communities.</P>
    <P>Regarding the final section of the Bill, in relation to our major streets such as O'Connell Street and Henry Street, there is certainly a need to have surveillance equipment permanently switched on. Last summer some of the local shopkeepers in O'Connell Street showed me, in my capacity as a Dublin Corporation <Col N="1275" /> councillor, a video which had been made of an almost continuous riot situation at the Anna Livia monument where a large group of Italian tourists were trapped in restaurants there for up to two hours until sufficient gardaí arrived to rescue them. In general, I would not wish to have a video camera at every corner because we do not want to adopt a police state approach.  However, for the protection of visitors to the centre of our city and for our tourists in particular, we should make use of some of this technology.</P>
    <P>I applaud the efforts made by Deputy Harney in this Bill.  It is very typical of the Deputy's contribution over the years to this House and to politics.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend any Member of the House who initiates a Private Members' Bill.  It is a thankless job in Opposition but it is a role of parliamentarians that we should defend and, indeed, commend.  From time to time many of us while in Opposition have seen the need to legislate in a particular area that would be of interest to us.  Bringing forward the matter by way of a Private Members' Bill stimulates Government into action to deal with areas such as the one we are discussing.  Deputy Hamey and I are aware that there is a commitment in the Programme for Government to bring forward an appropriate Bill.  That Bill is in the course of preparation. It is appropriate that there is a commitment in the joint Programme for Government to bring forward legislation dealing with this issue and which with the broader area concerns all of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have come a long way, particularly in regard to juvenile crime.  As Members of the Oireachtas, local authorities or community councils we find it necessary to bring to the attention of the Garda, and the Minister, the extraordinary situation that has developed over the years, particularly in regard to crime associated with drug abuse and intoxicating liquor. Children seem to have access to prohibited substances, such as drugs and can obtain intoxicating liquor.  This leads to gangs of children, not alone in the city <Col N="1276" /> of Dublin but throughout the country, gathering together and evil usually results from such a gathering.</P>
    <P>This is obviously a matter of concern for Members of this House, Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council. It is a tragedy that the main street in our capital city is considered to be unsafe for visitors and local people.  In the past it was a pleasure for people, particularly those from the country who visit the city for the day, to go window shopping and participate in the life of the city.  In towns and villages in the country which were peaceful in the past there is now a need for community alert teams, for communities to work in co-operation with the Garda Síochána.  In spite of community awareness robberies are taking place of old people in isolated areas, in parts of rural Ireland where the nearest neighbour is half a mile away.  In these areas people depend on the postman and telephone communication for protection.</P>
    <P>Young people are involved in the evils of joyriding and other activities as portrayed on films and videos. As my colleague, Deputy Broughan, said, people are intimidated by these youths. Adult handicapped people who go to draw their social welfare benefits are intimidated by young people begging for money and threatening them.  They steal their shoping, damage their doors and break their windows.  In spite of the best efforts of the Garda Síochána, who are understaffed, it is impossible to police all of the areas concerned.</P>
    <P>There must be a balance in legislation such as this.  I am particularly concerned about section 5 which introduces a new offence of unlawful loitering and gives the Garda certain powers which, if operated according to the section, could lead to the intimidation of law abiding citizens or trade unionists gathering outside a workplace.  It could be considered that these people are loitering or that this is an unofficial gathering.  Therefore, we must be careful that there is a balance in legislation.</P>
    <P>As a person who prepared a Private Members' Bill in Opposition &mdash; fortunately the Government adopted it &mdash; I <Col N="1277" /> know the difficulties in researching legislation such as this.  This Bill was well researched but not adequately because it does not refer to previous legislation in this area.  My colleague referred to emergency legislation introduced in the UK as a result of race riots and other difficulties there.  Some of the provisions in this Bill are similar to those in that legislation and that concerns me.</P>
    <P>The Bill creates new offences, as in section 2 which deals with riots, without having regard to existing offences.  There is a realisation that these issues need to be teased out rather than creating new offences.  This Bill is quite wide-ranging in its approach to the problem. As my colleague said, street crime is a problem. I am pleased the Government has decided &mdash; it made an announcement in this regard about two months ago &mdash; to legislate in this area.  If such an announcement had not been made there would be no justification for not supporting the Bill on Second Stage.  However, the House would be ill-advised to continue with this Bill when quite an amount of work has been carried out already in this area.  It is an issue about which the public are concerned, as was evidenced during the election.  Legislators should respond to the needs of the community and should not stand idly by when people's rights, property, livelihoods and lives are at risk from those who break the law.</P>
    <P>The Bill is welcome in that it triggers an awareness in everybody's mind that this problem needs to be addressed.  We await with interest the Minister's Bill and the proposals from Government dealing specifically with this matter.  I hope it takes on board proposals and recommendations from agencies such as the Law Reform Commission who were set up to report on such matters.  That body has reported on vagrancy and other matters. This Bill is so restrictive as to be counter-productive.  We must not be seen to introduce jackboot legislation which will impinge on people's freedom to enjoy themselves.  The activities of people who come from the country for football matches and other sporting events could not be considered to be law <Col N="1278" /> breaking.  Admittedly, they create annoyance but certainly they do not go so far as to break the law.  At present the Garda are quite strict in dealing with these people and indeed judges, certainly in rural Ireland, are extremely strict in the application of the law as it relates to drunk and disorderly behaviour, breaches of the peace and so on.</P>
    <P>I compliment Deputy Hamey on bringing forward this Bill.  I know it is difficult in Opposition, even with the expertise of the Progressive Democrats in the area of law, to research such legislation.  As a partner in the Government the Labour Party asks the Minister to bring forward as quickly as possible appropriate legislation to address some of the problems identified by Deputy Harney.  There is a consensus here that we need to look at what is happening in rural Ireland and in the capital city.</P>
    <P>I hope all our efforts will not be in vain and that vandals who break the law will know that there is no escape for them in any court.  The responsibility to react is with the Government.  I am glad that the Opposition parties have put this on the agenda, admittedly in the knowledge that we were addressing it anyway.  There is nothing wrong with that.  It is an appropriate part of democracy.  One of the valuable contributions the Opposition can make is to stimulate debate through the medium of Private Members' Bills.  I commend Deputy Harney for that.</P>

      <P>I understand that Fine Gael are not offering.  I accept what the Chair says.  I have a number of points <Col N="1279" /> to make and I will not take too long to cover them.</P>
      <P>I and everybody else was appalled by the killing of an infant in Liverpool by two young boys.  It is quite appalling that any society should come to the stage where the life of an infant is snuffed out like that, but even more appalling when it is done by children who are not much older than the child they killed.  At times like that society, or the institutions we have, tend to react in panic and seek to find what are largely simplistic solutions for very complex problems.  It has been claimed that it is the fault of video nasties, lack of discipline, schools, teachers and parents.  Everyone has his own theory with regard to why an appalling crime like that should occur.  The most appalling remark I have heard from a politician in relation to that case was the statement made by the Prime Minister of Britain, Mr. John Major, who was quoted as saying that we must understand a little less and condemn a little more.  It is extraordinary that the leader of a state with a population of 60 million, having huge problems, should advocate ignorance as a solution for anything, never mind a solution for what are essentially failings of human beings in relation to how we should order our society.  I heard an echo of that in this House last week when Deputy Briscoe proposed that anyone who was considered to be slightly guilty of criminal offences should be locked up in the Curragh under Army control.  That is the kind of response that we do not need to the problems of crime.  There is little doubt that our laws need to be modernised and updated.  They need to take account of the circumstances in which the people given responsibility to maintain order in our society, the Garda, must operate.  We should always bear in mind that our gardaí are Garda Síochána, peace officers, men and women who are asked by the Dáil and by the people generally to maintain the peace.  As much effort has to go into the area of deterrents and prevention as into the area of punishment and imprisonment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill that the Progressive Democrats <Col N="1280" /> have brought before the House is important.  I have some reservations about it, but by and large it is important that this debate has been brought onto the floor of the House before a crisis such as that which occurred in Britain hits us. A crisis is not the kind of situation in which we should legislate.  We should legislate calmly and with consideration. Indeed, we had a debate in the House last Friday on the report from the Dáil Committee on Crime.  It was a very good and balanced report and I look forward to the current Government taking some steps to have it implemented.</P>
    <P>My main reservation about the Progressive Democrats Bill relates to where it provides for permanent surveillance of public areas by the Garda.  They provide for that with the agreement of local councils, but given the nature of our political system the likelihood is that there would be public pressure in relation to particular areas.  This proposal goes over the borderline between the right of people to be secure and safe, not only in their homes but in the streets, and the invasion of privacy which permanent surveillance of any public area would involve.  I recognise that public houses, clubs and all kinds of shopping centres already have this permanent surveillance in place, but they are private areas and people chose to go into them or not as they see fit and accept whatever conditions prevail.  It would not be acceptable to have permanent public surveillance by the Garda of any particular locality or part of a locality.  This proposal needs to be looked at very carefully.  We can go too far in trying to maintain peoples' right to security to the detriment of the right to privacy. We must have a constant balancing of the two rights.  This proposal goes over the top.</P>
    <P>There is a need to understand the basis of criminal activity, whether juvenile crime or adult crime.  The adult criminal of today was probably the juvenile criminal of yesterday.  We have to produce not only ways of controlling and detecting criminals, but we have to understand more.  We have to put in place policies which can effectively catch a lot of young <Col N="1281" /> people before they enter into a life of crime.  I have a particular point in mind when I speak about this.  I have a file going back to 1987, but in 1988 a proposal from a group of teachers, social workers and psychologists in my constituency wished the Department of Education to establish a youth encounter project in our area.  One was already under way in the area and was working very well.</P>
    <P>The youth encounter project seeks to take in those between the ages of ten and 16 who are incapable for a variety of reasons, whether from domestic difficulties or maladjustment of one kind or another, of fitting into the normal school system and to deal with them on a one to one basis.  It was estimated at that time that about 30 young people in this part of my constituency were in difficulty and had already come in contact with the law in one way or another, they were in institutions or they had come to the attention of the health board or other agencies which care for young people. The idea was to provide a youth encounter project in the area which would save these children from what was potentially a life of petty crime and certainly in some cases leading to a permanent life of crime.  Unfortunately, that project never got underway; the Department of Education long fingered it.</P>
    <P>During the past year the people concerned tried to trace those children to see where they had ended up. It was found that most had been in court, some were in institutions or had spent a short time there and most of those who were not in institutions were unemployed; a number had disappeared, some were addicted to drugs and so on.  The fact is that expenditure of roughly £5,000 per head over four or five years would have saved not only a huge amount of money for the State in terms of the accommodation that has now to be provided at something of the order of £30,000 per head per annum, but would have given these young people a chance in life and their children in turn a chance to live an ordinary decent life. That project was revived last year.  I raised it on an Adjournment debate and <Col N="1282" /> the Minister of State at the time told me the whole system of youth encounter projects was being reviewed.  I wrote to him subsequently and asked if he would let me know when this review would be completed and I got the usual standard reply.  Since then I have heard nothing.</P>
    <P>It is now estimated in this part of my constituency that there are 70 young people seriously at risk who do not fit into the education system and that there are approximately 500 young people in the same area who are at risk in one way or another.  It is pointless for us to come in here and declaim about crime and say we must provide more places for criminals, that we must increase the sentences and explain how we must do this, that and the other in relation to criminals if we do not take steps to try to prevent lives being destroyed in this way by spending money now.  On a purely budgetary approach it would make sense to spend money now to save these young people but certainly from the human point of view it would be important.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote a paragraph from the report which the teachers and social workers prepared which states:</P>
    <P>The nature of the physical, social, moral and medical hazards to which these children are exposed are of great concern.  Without seeking to categorise them specifically one could mention, drug abuse, child sexual abuse, child prostitution, gambling and associated thieving, illiteracy, vagrancy, sexually transmitted diseases like Aids, psychiatric disorder, psychological impairment, etc.</P>
    <P>They are the innocent victims on the fringes of a society which with the passage of time sucks them into the maelstrom of criminal activity.  The cost of any or all of these ultimately becomes a burden on the State.</P>
    <P>A Youth Encounter Project is the stitch in time that could save not nine, but ninety such children...</P>
    <P>That is the main point I want to make in the debate on this Bill.  I recognise fully the intentions of the Progressive Democrats <Col N="1283" /> in bringing forward this Bill. Clearly, in every area there is a concern about many young people, particularly in the Dublin area.  We must bear in mind that close to 50 per cent of the population of Dublin is under 25 years of age so that inevitably many young people will congregate in different places.  In particular parts of my constituency it is inevitable that when they congregate they will do so with bottles of cider and the cheapest wine from which they can derive a kick.  While obviously we have to protect the community and respond to the demands which the community makes in regard to their own security we must also take on board the point that we, as their parents, are as responsible for them.  In many cases the parents simply do not have the skills or the capacity to cope.  If we do not give them jobs, or ensure that there is an economy that can provide jobs for them, and if we deny them any right to benefits and tell them they must leave home in order to qualify for unemployment assistance and if we tell them that the kind of world they live in means that they must buy their pleasure, that there is no question of deriving enjoyment out of anything unless they can put their money on the counter and buy it &mdash; whether it is drink, going to the cinema or any other kind of pleasure &mdash; if we create a culture which is totally dominated by a market approach then inevitably we feed the view that unless a person is successful in terms of jobs, income and unless they have 25 points or 30 points and get into university they are a failure.  If we nurture that kind of society then inevitably we will have alienated youth.  These issues are interrelated and tightening the law will not solve the problem.  We can pass this Bill tonight, we can pass the Government's Bill tomorrow but unless we deal with the areas of social concern where people are poor and where people do not have access to the kind of culture which provides them with a fully developed sense of themselves then we are doing nothing, we will have to come back next year and the year after to tighten up the law again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with great interest to the contributions made by other Deputies this evening.  I agree with virtually everything that has been said. In particular, I welcome the positive attitude adopted by Deputy Broughan and Deputy De Rossa to the proposals contained in the Bill.  I agree with what Deputy De Rossa said about the causes of crime and the social injustices that breed crime and the sense of hopelessness and alienation which are at the bottom of much delinquent behaviour, particularly among young people.  I accept all that and I agree that anybody who thinks that some form of repressive public order legislation is an answer to the problems which our society has at present is deluding himself or herself.  We have to deal with the realities of what ordinary people are finding on the ground in towns and cities in Ireland today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am struck by something which I learned about ten or 15 years ago.  When I was a newly wed in 1979 I went to live in an area of my own constituency which was very near a trouble spot.  When we eventually moved away from that place I was firmly convinced that middle-class people do not suffer most from the deprivation in working class areas; it is working class people &mdash; as Deputy De Rossa would say &mdash; who suffer most.  It is not a question of people coming in here and lecturing from a position of privilege those who are the bottom of our social ladder.  In the area I speak of I found it was the people who had nothing who suffered most from crime and the breakdown of order.  It was the people on the ground floor of a block of flats who could not even have a window on the front room of their flat who suffered.  I am referring to the people who could not even keep a bicycle in the pram shed. There are old ladies who knew when their sons came to visit them with their families on a Sunday that there was a danger that by the time they left the tyres on their cars would be slashed or the windscreen wipers would be stolen.  I am referring to the old ladies whose sons knew they could no longer visit them on a Sunday afternoon <Col N="1285" /> in safety.  It was the people who could never have a visitor at night because their visitors' cars might be wrecked outside the house or stolen.  Old aged pensioners could not go to the shops to buy groceries and the like at night time.  I am thinking of the people &mdash; in particular those in the block of flats to which I referred &mdash; who lived in flats where there were no windows on the shops in the flat complexes &mdash; they were all blocked up.</P>
    <P>Those are the people who suffer most as a result of crime.  It is not a question of a frightened elite in society saying, &ldquo;this is something we cannot bear any more&rdquo;.  If this House is the Legislature for all of the people, it is for those who suffer most as a result of criminality that it has to care for most.  In my view, and experience, it is the people at the bottom of the heap who suffer most from a lack of public order in their environment.</P>
    <P>I have practised criminal law for up to 19 years and I have seen a number of different offences and cases come before the courts.  I have been involved on both sides, and I have often been struck by the fact that the real people who suffer from crime are not the well to do and haves in society but the people at the bottom of the heap.  It is for that reason in particular that I believe something must be done as a matter of urgency.  All the hand wringing and delay there has been for umpteen years in the reform of our criminal law is inexcusable when one looks at what is happening to people who are prisoners in their own homes after dark, people who dare not go to a post office to collect their pensions unless they have company, people who have had their lives destroyed by the threat of disorder and violence in their community.</P>
    <P>We have been told in this House that the Department of Justice, the Minister for Justice, and the Minister of State, have a programme of law reform in relation to criminal law which is about to be moved forward.  What makes me somewhat cynical about those promises &mdash; we have been told that there will be an emergency debate tomorrow on a Bill to make lenient sentences appealable &mdash;<Col N="1286" /> is that when one looks at the actual record of this House, and the Department to which this House entrusts reform of the criminal law, one can see that it is pitiful. For example, the programme for Government, to which Deputy Ferris referred, proposes that there should be a Bill which will get rid of the difference between felonies and misdemeanours, will get rid of the difference between penal servitude and imprisonment and sweep away a whole series of anomalies, changes which people like I who have practised criminal law have always been promised but which we have never seen.</P>
    <P>When one looks at the provisions which are to be tendered before this House soon in relation to those matters one finds that they were first encapsulated in a Bill in 1966.  The Criminal Justice Bill, 1966, which had much work put into it, was withdrawn because of some controversy at the time about some of its provisions in relation to public order, and it has never been re-introduced since.  This is not an isolated example.  I want to refer to a measure which was put through this House last year, a Bill on criminal evidence.  One of the things this Bill was supposed to do was to make it possible to prove business records so that, for example, in regard to serial numbers on the backs of televisions, one did not have to produce the man who put the serial number on the back of the television so that he could say he remembered that that was the television to which he applied a certain number.  That Bill was introduced on foot of a decision called &ldquo;The Director of Public Prosecutions and Myers&rdquo; in England in the sixties.  Once the English realised that there was a hole in their criminal law and that they could not prove cases which involved identifying serial numbers on videos, televisions, cars and the like they changed the law immediately.  This change was introduced in England in 1968 after a 1967 decision and yet, it took approximately another 15 years for this House to respond to that hole in our law.  That is only one small example of the many which I could quote.</P>
    <P>Last year a larceny Bill was introduced <Col N="1287" /> in this House which brought in the new offence of handling stolen property. Apart from a few tiny changes, it was a direct copy of the UK Theft Act, 1967. One has to ask: what is it about Ireland that we have to wait 15 to 20 years for anything to be done which can easily be done in a neighbouring jurisdiction with a similar legal system to ours?  What is it about the Department of Justice that makes it so dilatory in bringing forward proposals which are worked out for it by others?</P>
    <P>That problem does not exist merely in relation to statutes on the criminal law. Approximately 12 years ago Mr. Justice Henchy was asked by this State to chair a committee in relation to criminal insanity.  Recently, there have been a few instances of highly controversial cases where, after killings, people were sent to the Central Mental Hospital in circumstances which gave rise to public disquiet. His report had the Bill necessary to give effect to its suggestions attached to the back of it, to make it so simple for some Minister some day to stand up in this House and say, &ldquo;here is the necessary Bill&rdquo;.  All the provisions of that Bill were drafted by an experienced judge.  That Bill has sat on the shelves of the Department of Justice for more than a decade. I wonder why that is.  I wonder what it is about that Department which makes it so difficult for it to do the workload which this State entrusts to it.  For instance, we do not have such a backward approach from the Revenue Commissioners, where it really matters.  If a loophole was found in the tax law today it would be closed tomorrow if the Revenue Commissioners could do it.  Every year the Minister introduces a Finance Bill which carefully stitches up and darns all the holes which appear in the tax code.  Why is it that the Department of Justice is so ineffectual as an engine of criminal law reform?</P>
    <P>I note that the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, has had the area of criminal law reform expressly withheld from him as a matter of responsibility.  I regret this as I believe <Col N="1288" /> it required a Minister with specific responsibility for reforming the criminal law for reform in this area to be brought into existence.  I am afraid past experience suggests that the Minister's Department &mdash; I do not want to criticise individuals or to be accused of being too tough on them &mdash; is incapable of keeping up adequately with the necessary pace in criminal law reform.  We will be asked tomorrow to enact on short notice a Bill which will allow appeals in respect of unduly lenient sentences.  That is all very well, but how long is it since similar legislation was introduced in England?  Does the Department have to wait until a case is brought into the public arena which excites public controversy before it decides that the criminal law must be improved?</P>
    <P>I am driven to the conclusion that our criminal law is an intellectual slum and that the people who are given the responsibility for upgrading it do not take their job seriously enough.  The Law Reform Commission has produced many helpful reports in this area, including reports on the law relating to dishonesty and various other aspects of the criminal justice system.  The report on the law relating to vagrancy was produced in the mid-1980s but the legislative proposals are still to be implemented.  When I say that I am unimpressed by the suggestion made by Deputy Ferris, and apparently believed by Deputy Broughan, that there will be a major criminal statute in the lifetime of this Government which deals with all these matters, I think I can be forgiven for at least pointing to experience in suggesting that we should take all such good intentions with a huge amount of salt, especially when they come from the Minister of State's Department.</P>
    <P>I listened carefully to the speech by the Minister for Justice in this debate last week.  The arguments advanced by her against this Bill did not convince me.  In relation to sections 2, 3, and 4 she rightly pointed out that they were based on the Public Order Act in England in 1986.  She queried Deputy Harney's bringing before this House provisions similar to those introduced in England in circumstances <Col N="1289" /> of grave public disorder.  I do not believe that the English Act was an emergency response or badly thought out.  We do not have to wait until there is a crisis in order to act.  If one is serious about law reform in the criminal area one gets on with the job, bearing in mind the possibility that some day there may be a riot. There is no point in waiting for a riot before looking to the law relating to it. One must take action in advance rather than wait for something to happen and then rush through emergency legislation in circumstances of great publicity, such as we are to have tomorrow.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggested that Deputy Harney's proposal in relation to unlawful loitering was at variance with the proposals set out in the Law Reform Commission's paper No. 11.  It is true that they found great difficulty in striking a fair balance between giving oppressive powers to the police in respect of young people congregating while at the same time preventing situations which obviously require some form of control. The Law Reform Commission document contains an analysis of the American model penal code and the proposals suggested there, which, I agree with the commission, are somewhat unworkable.  The Minister and the Minister of State should have regard to the experience of ordinary people and they should talk to the Garda Síochána.  Loitering in public places is the parent of delinquent behaviour.  If gardaí cannot move people on and must wait until they see crimes occurring, they know it is too late.  If you live in the end house in a suburban estate outside which people are loitering and intimidating you, it should not be necessary to wait until the window is broken to get those people shifted.  There must be some protection which is prophylactic in nature and saves the person or property before damage is done.  The Constitution is about defending and vindicating the rights of people, not merely doing something about crimes as and when they occur.  The balance is correctly struck in Deputy Harney's proposal in relation to unlawful loitering.</P>
    <P>In relation to the offence of criminal trespass, I laughed last week when the <Col N="1290" /> Minister told the House that the Vagrancy Act of 1824 was quite sufficient to deal with the matter because it states that it is an offence to loiter in any house, outhouse, coach house or stable.  She thought that was adequate for the time being.  How ludicrous that we have a law which deals with loitering in such totally outdated language and applies to situations which existed more than a century and a half ago.  It is completely inappropriate for modern circumstances.  The proposed crime of criminal trespass is necessary.  It should be an offence, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for a person to go into your house to see what is in your desk.  This does not at present constitute the offence of burglary.  It should be an offence to go into a person's house to spy or to leave a bugging device or to go into the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and read the files, as has happened.  The offence of burglary, which is entering as a trespasser with intent to commit a felony, is not appropriate in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney has also proposed an offence of racketeering.  The Minister said in reply that the present law is adequate.  Demanding with menaces is very difficult to prove because one has to prove the demand.  Deputy Harney proposes to get around that so that where persons are hanging around outside a premises in circumstances which give rise to the conclusion that they are there to demand protection money, proof of a formal demand should not be necessary. The Minister in respect of the offence suggested by section 8 said that in her opinion the existing law of conspiracy was sufficient to deal with the matter. She is wrong.  Conspiracy requires that there be more than one person involved. Deputy Harney's proposal would make it an offence for an individual, regardless of whether more than one person is involved, to have, for instance, the layout of a bank or of the inside of a private house or a diagram or sketch showing how to gain entry.  It would make it an offence in certain circumstances to have a disguise which is proposed to be used in some felonious act.  The Minister's <Col N="1291" /> response that the present law of conspiracy is adequate is wrong.  I know of a case where a person was found in possession of material relating to another person's movements in circumstances which gave rise to the obvious inference that it was for the purpose of some unspecified crime.  Yet no offence was committed and that person was allowed to walk free from a Garda station.  That is wholly wrong and requires a reform of the law to deal with it.</P>
    <P>Section 9 deals with special local provisions in respect of order in public places.  Nobody knows better where problem areas are in a town or city than the local authority.  It should be the case that a local authority can designate, for instance, Grafton Street and provide that after 2 a.m. persons under the age of 18 shall not be allowed to congregate or loiter there, specifying bylaws which the police could enforce.  This is an innovative suggestion.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa mentioned surveillance in public places.  I agree that we do not want a big brother-style world where everybody's movements are on video.  The Liverpool incident, to which Deputy De Rossa referred in a different context, shows that two privately-operated video cameras were of assistance in detecting a very serious crime.  One was in a shopping centre, the other was operated by the owners of a builders' providers yard, and both of those provided the basis on which a very serious crime was actually solved, which probably would never have been solved otherwise. I do not believe it would be any intrusion into ordinary peoples' privacy or any draconian step to allow, say, O'Connell Street, Grafton Street, Henry Street, Moore Street and places like that to be the subject of surveillance, because theoretically all a video camera could record would also be recorded if we had policemen standing on every corner with notebooks in their hands.  It is only a matter of practicality; it is not a matter of theory.</P>
    <P>Having heard all of these points made against this Bill I am driven to the conclusion <Col N="1292" /> that the suggestion made in the Whitaker Commission report on the penal system is correct and that there should be a mechanism to keep the criminal law constantly updated.  We need a criminal law review committee as they have in the United Kingdom.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Carlow Unemployment.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny) Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Carlow-Kilkenny</i>): Back in 1926, when the Irish Sugar Company found its feet in Carlow, the problem of unemployment was not very serious because we had other factories there at the time.  Carlow had the image of a place that was well off as far as employment was concerned.  Then we had the arrival of Braun and Lapple, two superb, efficient German-based companies, giving excellent employment to 1,500 workers in Carlow.  They have been caught in the present recession, despite their efficiency, and we hope their predicament will be shortlived.  However, the image abroad is that Carlow is a land flowing with milk and honey and that there is no such thing as unemployment there.  The reality is that Carlow is floating at 2 per cent above the national figures for unemployment for the last 18 months.  Indeed, in December 1992 we had the unwelcome distinction of having the highest unemployment in the southeast. That is something we do not want. Now we have Braun with 300 workers on short time, which I hope will be short term as well.  We also have other factories which are on three-day weeks, plus the 110 job losses in Lapple, which is a very efficient company.  All in all we are adding to our claim of having over 2 per cent above the national average for unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did a calculation on some labour force figures and found that if I eliminated farmers and the self-employed, unemployment for insured workers must be <Col N="1293" /> somewhere around 30 per cent.  The Chamber of Commerce, which is very active in Carlow, has been working very hard to get an enterprise centre where young businessmen could get established. I hope that when it comes to getting help from the Minister he will be very kind to them.  Perhaps the Minister could direct some of the money from unemployment benefits to young people to enable them to serve their time as apprentices and learn the skills that will be useful to them in employment when things pick up again.</P>
    <P>The losses in Digital were a major blow to Galway.  We have every sympathy for the people of Galway and indeed for the workers who have lost very good jobs. However, we are flabbergasted that we have got only the charity of the Minister's silence in Carlow.  No Minister has managed to rise to thinking that Carlow has a problem.  Friends of mine down in Carlow have said that we did not get even false promises about Carlow.  I hope the Minister will assure me that job losses in Carlow count in the Department.  In the past I have been critical of the Minister's position, that in such an important section of Government he has been given the onerous task of reviving his own party.  It is a pity that in a Department of such serious concern for the people of Ireland the Minister's loyalties are divided. I hope the Minister will have some good news for me and for Carlow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. S. Brennan) Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. S. Brennan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully appreciate the Deputy's concern about the impending loss of 110 jobs at Lapple Ireland Ltd. at Carlow.  I also share that concern.  The company currently employs 340 people and manufactures press tools and press parties for the automotive industry.  The company was established in 1974 to service mainly the British car market.  Its current difficulties are due to the changed market conditions in the UK which in turn are consequent on the worldwide recession which has seriously affected the automotive industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that a rationalisation plan <Col N="1294" /> is being undertaken by the company to secure the future of the Carlow plant and that discussions are currently in train with the unions to this effect.  I am hopeful that with goodwill and flexibility on all sides agreement can be reached on this plan.</P>
    <P>Turning now to Braun, matters are a bit more encouraging.  Braun also has an established track record in Carlow where it has been since 1974 on foot of IDA assistance.  Braun, I am glad to say, is now one of the country's largest manufacturing employers.</P>
    <P>The company is a world leader in hair care products, such as hair dryers, hair curlers and electric shavers, and in fact is the only company in the Braun group producing this range.  The company's main markets are mainland Europe and Japan.</P>
    <P>Recession in its principal European and Japanese markets has meant that Braun has placed some 320 persons on a three-day week until such time as the sales situation improves.  I understand that the effect of the sterling crisis has not had a serious impact on the company as its main markets are outside the sterling area.  Devaluation has, however, benefited the company as it has improved its competitiveness.  As already said, the downturn in sales is totally attributable to the world recession.</P>
    <P>The Braun group is itself experiencing a decline in sales due to the recession and a programme of job reductions has been instituted in other Braun plants in Germany, Spain and Mexico.  Ireland, up to now, has only experienced short term working and I am encouraged that the company has not opted for lay-offs, preferring rather to hold staff on short term working pending an up-turn.  This approach has, I understand, been adopted in the past by the company in line with fluctuations in sales and has permitted employment to firm up with an upturn in sales.</P>
    <P>From discussions the company has had with the IDA I am advised it is its objective to maintain long term job levels at over 1,000 people and this is not only encouraging news for Carlow but also a <Col N="1295" /> vindication of Ireland as a manufacturing base.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the difficulties being faced in Carlow today will prove short lived.  Carlow is and will continue to be a key industrial centre in the south east region.  It is strategically placed with excellent communications and transport services to the main cities and ports.  I know the IDA is working intensively with a range of small business companies to encourage them to develop further and that it will continue to market Carlow as a first class location for foreign business investment.  I thank the Deputy for raising the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Aer Lingus crisis and Aer Lingus itself has been of great concern to the public for over 12 months now.  The report and accounts for the year ended 31 March 1992 show that Aer Lingus employs 7,600 persons in Ireland and 13,631 in the group as a whole.  I believe Deputies on all sides of the House are aware of the fears of the workforce and, in particular, the fears of thousands of those workers of being made redundant.</P>
      <P>Aer Lingus has served Ireland well.  It has been a good employer, an efficient and courteous carrier and a major contributor to our tourism industry.  It has added a variety of ancillary activities to its core business of air transport and these activities have contributed to the profitability of the company in the past and cushioned its losses in recent years.</P>
      <P>In the 1992 report, published just 12 months ago, the chairman, Mr. Bernie Cahill, stated, <i>inter alia:</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1296" /> The scale of investment required to enable Aer Lingus to generate additional wealth and jobs will necessitate a significant increase in the equity base of the group.  This is an issue which is vital for the growth of Aer Lingus and its contribution to the Irish economy.  It must be addressed as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>The loss in the core business was then almost £40 million.  It is now, we are told, almost £100 million, or, if we believe the leak to RTE earlier this evening, in excess of £90 million.  Neither the Minister for Transport nor his predecessor acted on a matter which the chairman of the board considered to be of extreme urgency 12 months ago this week.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to answer some questions: does the Minister agree with Mr. Cahill's statement that I have just quoted?  If he does not, will he dismiss the chairman and the board of Aer Lingus?  Does he reject the rescue plan put forward by Aer Lingus to his Department? If he does, does he have an alternative plan, or is the Government bringing in consultants to help draw up such a plan?  Is he aware that the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs has compared the enormity of the problems at Aer Lingus to the problems experienced by Irish Shipping, B &amp; I and ICI combined? Would he agree with this?  Would the Minister like to comment on the surprise expressed by the Tánaiste at the extent of the problems of Aer Lingus, in view of the fact that all relevant information about Aer Lingus was provided to the Labour Party negotiators, Ministers Quinn, Taylor and Howlin, when the Programme for a Partnership Government was being agreed?  Would the Minister like to express a view on this, or is the Tánaiste merely being disingenuous against the background of the absolute commitments made by him to Aer Lingus staff assembled in a hangar at Dublin airport during the election campaign?</P>
    <P>Would the Minister state the Government's intentions?  Procrastination could lead to another catastrophe.  Neither Aer Lingus workers nor the tourist industry <Col N="1297" /> can afford such a catastrophe.  Our national airline has been one of our national symbols.  If the Government walks away from its responsibilities it will never be forgiven.  I want effective action, and I want it now.  I do not want some individual to be made a scapegoat by the Minister.  In this context we are not talking about making scapegoats, we are talking about a plan that will rescue Aer Lingus and preserve the jobs of the workers.  Any attempt to make a scapegoat of one individual and offer him up as a sacrificial victim for the inactivity and incompetence of the Government will be rejected.  We want full answers, Minister, and we want a rescue plan for our national airline.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Noonan for sharing his time with me tonight on this very important matter.  I wish to echo clearly the statements made by Deputy Noonan in the House in relation to the concerns about the national airline in past months.  I wish to put on record my support and that of my Fianna Fáil colleagues, especially those on the north side of the city, for the protection of our great national airline, Aer Lingus, its employees and the families of those dependent on the survival of Aer Lingus. I recognise, as does Deputy Noonan, the excellent role played by its employees in the past 12 months.</P>
      <P>Indeed, there are an awful lot of questions to be answered.  It is my understanding that the answers lie with the responsibilities of those in senior management and those who have made decisions which have brought Aer Lingus into the serious financial difficulties it now finds itself.</P>
      <P>I should be vigorously opposed to any proposals that would affect the survival of our national airline, the further development of the airline and the jobs of the employees within the airline.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to respond to this question on the Adjournment because it enables me to advise the House of an <Col N="1298" /> important decision taken in relation to Aer Lingus.  This evening, following consultation with my Government colleagues, I am announcing that Mr. Bernie Cahill has been appointed as executive chairman of Aer Lingus.  Mr. Cahill has been given executive responsibility to take whatever action is necessary with immediate effect to restore the company to commercial viability.  Decisions to be taken by management and workforce must be evident before the Government can commit itself to any specific level of support.  In that context, both my colleague, the Minister for Finance and I have said that, subject to the constraints in the national finances, which rule out very large injections of equity in the group by the Exchequer, the Government would be prepared to support convincing and visible action.</P>
      <P>I have given the executive chairman absolute discretion in terms of increasing yields, disposing of assets not essential to the core business and achieving savings on the company's cost base.  Some elements of this recovery strategy can be quickly identified and put in place right away.  I have also indicated that Aer Lingus is to maintain a significant presence on the transatlantic routes in the context of the existing policy on the Shannon stopover.</P>
      <P>In the light of this announcement, the House will understand that the Government has no plans to appoint international consultants.  We have had sufficient analysis, now is the time for action.  The executive chairman shares my view that a partnership approach is essential and, with this in mind, the chairman will be seeking a very early meeting with representatives of the employees, and with other interests, to explain the new framework to be developed to ensure the company is restored to viability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In looking to the future, it is vital to recognise the realities of the Single Market in which most Aer Lingus services operate.  Airlines must compete in an open market in which governments can no longer intervene to regulate access to routes or pricing.  This makes it essential <Col N="1299" /> to Aer Lingus' survival that its costs match those of its competitors.  Along with reducing costs, the airline must ensure that its yields are at sustainable levels.  The resolution of Aer Lingus' current difficulties and its future prosperity dictate that its fares must be not only competitive but also economically sustainable.</P>
    <P>I have said before that the Government values the contribution which has been made by Aer Lingus to the economy over the years.  It has provided the critical mass, expertise and range of products which have helped spawn our national aviation industry.  I have also said that the Government wants to see Aer Lingus' contribution continue into the future. Aer Lingus is presently going through a very difficult period in its history.  It is now time for all concerned to work together to resolve the problems facing the company.  The underlying situation of the company is serious but does not warrant panic measures.  It is, however, a time for resolute action.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to express my appreciation of Mr. Cahill's decision to accept the demanding task of executive chairman and the inherent acceptance of the absolute necessity to deliver the required recovery strategy.  While difficult decisions will have to be taken and sacrifices will be called for, I believe that confidence can quickly be restored to the airline.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this matter.  The long running saga of the proposed rationalisation of second level schools in Caherciveen, Kenmare and Rathmore, <Col N="1300" /> County Kerry is now a source of deep frustration to parents, teachers and pupils living in these areas.</P>
      <P>As long ago as 1985 Kerry vocational education committee agreed with the Department of Education that schools would be merged in the towns concerned. Community schools were to be provided at Kenmare and Rathmore and a community college in Caherciveen.</P>
      <P>Eight years later I understand that Kenmare is only at stage 3, or developed sketch scheme stage, and Rathmore at stage 2 or outline sketch scheme.  Difficulties arose with the Caherciveen project because of the insistence of the then Minister for Education, Mrs. Gemma Hussey, on building the college on a confined site.  Strong opposition was expressed by parents throughout the Iveragh Peninsula to this and in March of 1990 the then Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, reversed Mrs. Hussey's decision and decided to establish the college on a greenfield site.  For this she earned &mdash; deservedly &mdash; the eternal gratitude of the people of south-west Kerry.  In 1991 a site of 14.5 acres was purchased at the western end of Caherciveen town.  In December 1991 agreement was reached between Kerry vocational education committee and four school principals regarding the schedule of accommodation.  A letter was forwarded to the Department of Education outlining this agreement and seeking a meeting to discuss the schedule of accommodation. Repeated requests and representations have failed to obtain this meeting and there the matter rests.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile many of the 1,620 pupils affected &mdash; Caherciveen 750, Kenmare 450 and Rathmore 420 &mdash; are catered for in old buildings and prefabs, some of which are more than 20 years old.</P>
      <P>The children receive an excellent education from dedicated and committed teachers.  However, the new schools and college would provide an expanded range of subjects and new alternatives to the leaving certificate.  In addition there would be far greater scope for more vocational and technical subjects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The time has come for the Department <Col N="1301" /> of Education to answer the legitimate concern of pupils, parents and teachers. There is a feeling that adequate information is not forthcoming in relation to the projects and that there is a considerable amount of footdragging. Accordingly, I now ask the Minister for Education to tell the people precisely what is going on.  In particular I would like the Minister to instruct her officials to proceed with all possible haste with stage 3 in Kenmare, stage 2 in Rathmore and arrange for the planning meeting in relation to Caherciveen.</P>
    <P>Obviously, when planning has been completed capital will be required and I urge the Minister to give a commitment that this will be forthcoming in the foreseeable future.  Because of limited employment opportunities the areas concerned are heavily dependent on education. The availability of the new schools and college will provide new opportunities and open up new avenues.</P>
    <P>At the very least the people are now entitled to answers.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  He will be aware that there are three post-primary centres in Kerry and I am sure he is also aware that I met the teachers involved in the three schools to which he referred on a recent visit I paid to Kerry.  Where decisions were taken to replace a number of existing smaller schools, which required new accommodation, with single school developments.  Community schools are to be provided in Kenmare and Rathmore and a community college is to be provided in Caherciveen which will amalgamate the two post-primary schools in Caherciveen and one in Waterville.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to architectural planning of the schools, the following is the up-to-date position: In Kenmare the single school complex, amalgamating the Holy Cross College and the vocational school, is to be developed on the existing Holy Cross College premises.  The planning of the project has reached Stage 3 &mdash; the developed sketch scheme stage.  Currently <Col N="1302" /> this stage of architectural planning which was received on 23 December 1992 is under technical examination in the Department.  As an indication of the Department's commitment to this project, the planning is being undertaken under the shorter procedures.  Accordingly, the next stages, prior to tender, the detail design bill of quantities will be prepared as a combined submission.</P>
    <P>In Rathmore the single school, an amalgamation of the Presentation Secondary School and the voctional school, will be developed on the Presentation Secondary School premises.  The planning of the project is also being planned in line with the shorter procedures.  At present the consultants are working on a combined submission dealing with the first three stages of planning.  The consultants are nearing completion of the second stage of this combined submission and will shortly begin the final part.</P>
    <P>The Department is actively pursuing the possibility of establishing a single school management structure, as an interim measure, in advance of the provision of the building project and this aspect has been formally raised with both school managements.</P>
    <P>In Caherciveen-Waterville the single school development involves the amalgamation of the vocational and Presentation secondry schools in Caherciveen and the vocational school in Waterville. The Christian Brothers school in Caherciveen, which was originally a party to the community school agreement, closed in June 1992.</P>
    <P>It was originally intended that the college would be developed on the existing Presentation secondary school premises. However, in 1990, following a review of the case the then Minister, Deputy Mary O'Rourke, decided that the preferable course to adopt would be to erect the new college on a greenfield site.  The vocational education committee has purchased a site for the college and a schedule of accommodation has been prepared and agreed for the college.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of these projects in the Department's building programme in due course will be considered in the context <Col N="1303" /> of educational planning criteria and in the light of available resources and other commitments and resources.</P>

      <P>I propose to call the Deputies I have selected in the following order: Deputy Byrne and Deputy Deenihan in respect of matters to the Minister for the Marine and Deputy Crawford and Deputy Finucane in respect of matters to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  The Deputies are entitled to two minutes in respect of each matter and their statements will be followed immediately by a two minute reply from the appropriate Minister or Ministers.  However, as the matters raised by Deputy Crawford and the first matter raised by Deputy Finucane are similar it is proposed that Deputies will make their statements and that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry &mdash; or his Minister of State &mdash; will reply to both Deputies.  I now call Deputy Byrne.</P>

      <P>Irish Lights are in the process of decommissioning some and demanning all the lighthouses in Ireland.  This process is common to all these islands and the following is singular to the Irish instance: (1) there are no plans for the development of a back-up coastal service and, as one who lives near the Hook Head lighthouse, the oldest in Europe, I am well aware of what is being done by the principal lighthouse keeper and his assistant.  Indeed they have saved many lives by spotting trouble before it caused fatalities.  This glaring gap will inevitably result in unnecessary fatalities.  The process of building watch towers, which had the particular support of the former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, has been discontinued. Seven watch towers of this kind were built at great cost to the taxpayer and are now obsolete.  The necessity for a manned coastal service has not been addressed; (2) Irish Lights, alone <Col N="1304" /> among the three lighthouse companies on these islands, cannot support itself without subvention.  Since Government support commenced in 1983 it has risen to the maximum level allowed by current legislation.</P>
      <P>Not peculiar to Ireland &mdash; but of particular importance &mdash; is the weight of the shipowners' lobby in this matter.  They claim that they pay too much for the service.  As they pay the piper it seems they also call the tune.</P>
      <P>The Minister should be aware that the system of dues collection he is abandoning is being adopted in mainland Europe.  A narrow-minded concern for finance is outweighing proper concern for the safety of human life.  While I understand heavier ships are using satellites for guidance, it is well known that the number of leisure craft is increasing by the day and they have nothing but the lighthouses to offer them protection.</P>
      <P>Not alone are the lighthouses being abandoned but so are keepers.  Their status as persons who have paid the full rate of PRSI is being exploited on the doubious pretext they are not civil servants. The redundancy being offered may be acceptable to older men but is not acceptable to the younger men.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. G. O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, responsibility for the provision and maintenance of lights services around the coast of Ireland and Britain is vested in three bodies known as the General Lighthouse Authorities, the Commissioners of Irish Lights; Trinity House, and the Commissioners of Northern Lighthouses.  The whole system of lights around the coasts of Ireland and Britain is administered as a single financial unit. Expenditure is met from the general lighthouse fund which derives its income from the collection of light dues in Britain and Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the terms of a 1985 financial agreement between the UK and Ireland, the State contributes to the general lighthouse fund an amount equivalent to the <Col N="1305" /> difference between 50 per cent of Commissioners of Irish Lights costs in the Republic and the income from light dues collected in the Republic.</P>
    <P>Since 1960, the Commissioners of Irish Lights has engaged in an ongoing programme of automating and demanning lighthouses in an effort to achieve a more cost-effective and efficient service.  In 1985, the Commissioners of Irish Lights embarked on the final phase of this programme which will see the remaining nine manned lighthouses automated by March 1997.</P>
    <P>Up to this, the required redundancies have been achieved through natural wastage or lightkeepers leaving the service on a voluntary basis.  I understand 12 lightkeepers have been served with compulsory redundancy notices unfortunately effective from 1 April 1993.  The question of redundancies among lightkeepers is an industrial relations matter which is appropriate for settlement between the Commissioners of Irish Lights and the relevant union or under established industrial relations machinery.</P>
    <P>The report of the review group on air-sea rescue services, which led to the establishment of the Irish Marine Emergency Service considered the question of the establishment of a visual coast watch service involving lightkeepers, and noted that the cost of the proposal would be in excess of £1 million.  The review group considered that mobile watch units would be more effective than fixed watch units, and recommended as a more cost effective solution that the volunteer coast and cliff rescue service be deployed for mobile visual watch when and where required.  This recommendation has been implemented under the aegis of the Irish Marine Emergency Service.  The review group also noted that the recent extension of the Marine VHF 24 hour listening watch to all coasts provided a ready and easy means of alerting the rescue agencies. The coming into force of national and international rules for the carriage of Emergency Position &mdash; Indicating Radio Beacons &mdash; will mean that vessels needing assistance will no longer be dependent <Col N="1306" /> on the sighting of their distress signals.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to put on record my appreciation, and that of the Minister, for the lighthouse service which has served this country for generations.</P>

      <P>Kerry County Council closed Reenard Pier in 1990 due to its dangerous condition.  Closure involved erecting a barrier at the entrance of the pier.  In June of that year the Department of the Marine promised to pay 50 per cent of the cost of repairs provided that Kerry County Council paid a portion of the cost and also that the local fishing interests would also bear a similar portion. Both parties agreed to this arrangement. It was estimated that the total cost of carrying out the repairs would be £150,000.  Statements made in the local newspapers, and in the chamber of Kerry County Council, suggested that a grant of £75,000 was available from the Department of the Marine.  However, no work took place and the pier remained closed in 1990.</P>
      <P>In 1991 a deputation of pier users met the then Minister for the Marine, former Deputy Wilson.  It was also reported in the local media that the then Minister gave a definite commitment to the delegation that the necessary finance to enable repair works to be carried out on the pier would be made available immediately by his Department.  No work was carried out in 1991.</P>
      <P>In 1992 a local Fianna Fáil Deputy announced that the then Minister for the Marine, Dr. Woods, was allocting a grant of £5,000 to enable investigative and design work to commence.  No work took place during 1992.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister of State to make the necessary finance available to enable work to commence immediately on the pier.  Activity at Reenard Pier has come to a halt since the pier closed.  When the fishing boats come into Reenard Pier, local men have to be employed to unload the fish and, in some cases, trans-shipping the fish to other destinations.  Ice, fuel oil, food supplies, mineral water and so forth have to be acquired locally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1307" /> I understand also that the owner of Kerry Fish, a local fish processing company has a potential to create 12 full-time jobs if the pier becomes fully operational in the near future.  I consider it fair to make the point that this is just another example of broken promises by two former Fianna Fáil Ministers for the Marine.  I appeal to the Minister to please not join that group.  I appeal to the Minister of State present to give a definite commitment on the future of Reenard Pier.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. G. O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The pier at Reenard was erected in 1965-66 to cater for the then existing fleet, with an allowance being made or an increase in its size.  It was not designed to withstand severe berthing blows from large steel hulled foreign fishing vessels.  The responsibility for the repair and maintenance of Reenard Pier rests with Kerry County Council, who were requested to undertake the necessary maintenance works in 1981.  The failure to carry out the necessary maintenance works has resulted in a continuing deterioration of the pier to its present state.</P>
      <P>The continuous damage inflicted by large fishing vessels berthing at the pier has resulted in the pier's closure, for safety reasons, by Kerry County Council. The most serious damage inflicted has been to the tie bars.  These bars literally hold the opposite faces of the pier together.  Collapse of the pier is, however, being avoided at present by the sheet piling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the latter part of 1992, the Department of the Marine commissioned a consultant's report on the condition of the pier and the remedial repair requirements and cost.  These remedial repairs, which would involve repairs to the pier deck slab and ring beam, sheet piling, fendering, mooring rings and, most importantly, the tie bars, are estimated to cost £130,000.  As I indicated, the maintenance and repair of this pier is the responsibility of Kerry County Council who would normally be expected to pay <Col N="1308" /> for any maintenance costs.  However, given the nature of the repair works required at Reenard Pier, the Department of the Marine will provide grant assistance to the council towards the costs.</P>
    <P>In view of ongoing development works at other fishing harbours, the priority that has been attached in Valentia Harbour to Portmagee which is more intensively used by local fishing vessels and is the basis of the fishing industry in south Kerry and limited financial resources, the Department of the Marine is unlikely to be in a position to undertake works at Reenard Pier during 1993. However, a new fishery harbour development programme for the 1994-97 period is at present being finalised and the required works at Reenard Pier will be considered in that context.</P>

      <P>I thank the Chair for the opportunity to raise this matter.  I urge the Minister to deploy staff from the livestock offices to the farm development offices.  Tonight I wish to refer to the great difficulties in this respect in my own constituency, particularly in County Cavan.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been notified of the case of a young farmer who has completed his farm development programme and is now awaiting his grant.  The job has been passed by the officer concerned but as there is no one in the farm development office to type the required documentation, the farmer cannot be paid his grant.  At a time of extraordinarily high interest rates this is very unfair to a young farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish also to bring the case of another young farmer to the Minister's notice. This young farmer won first prize in a silage and grass management scheme and he now wants to carry out developments <Col N="1309" /> on his farm.  The plan has been drawn up by the area officer and sent to the office in Cavan, but, because there are no typists there, it cannot be put into operation.</P>
    <P>The person concerned cannot commence the work on his farm until he gets written approval.  If that approval is not forthcoming within the next few days he may not be able to proceed with the work this year.  As the job relates to his farm buildings and the removal of effluent from his silage pit, he will not be able to commence cutting silage in May.  As I said earlier, this young farmer won first prize in silage and grassland production last year.  It is vital that the staff be relocated, that young farmers are allowed continue in business and that necessary and useful employment be created.  If this farmer's plight is not documented he will not be able to run his farm efficiently, the scheme will fall through and jobs will be lost.  At a time of extremely high unemployment, the relocation of staff to Cavan and to other offices throughout the country is vital.</P>

      <P>Many constituents in County Limerick have contacted me regarding the delay in clearing their farm development grants.  They have undertaken the work and urgently require the grants.  Some of them have gone into further debt while waiting for the grants. There are 27 grant claims, involving a sum of £90,726 awaiting approval in the Limerick office.  It is not good enough that the staff involved in this area should be redeployed to the livestock section.  It is difficult to reconcile that decision when more than 300,000 people are unemployed. Surely it is possible to hire personnel, even on a temporary basis, rather than allow the present situation to continue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister indicated that this would be for a temporary period only and that staff would be reassigned to their normal duties at the earliest possible opportunity. <Col N="1310" /> I now want the Minister to give a firm commitment and indicate when staff will be provided to clear the farm development grants which are currently being held up in the Limerick office.</P>

      <P>I raise the issue of group water schemes in the context of Leader funding of such schemes and the frustration felt by many people in regard to such schemes in County Limerick.  I had hoped that adequate provision would have been provided for group water schemes in the recent Estimates. However, a mere £2.5 million was allocated and, with a carry over of £1.5 million from the previous year, only £1 million will be allocated for group water schemes on a national basis this year.  There are already approximately 89 schemes awaiting approval in the Department of the Environment, including those in County Limerick to which I have referred.  Having regard to this financial provision there is no hope for those 89 schemes and the hundreds of others that are in the pipeline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that the Leader programme covers infrastructural projects.  As water is a basic requirement and is regarded as a lifeline in many communities, surely a provision could be made in the Leader programme for group water schemes.  If they depend on the Department of the <Col N="1311" /> Environment for funding, many of the people involved will never have a water supply.  The Cohesion Fund which provides funds for both transport and environmental projects does not make provision for group water schemes; it only covers schemes costing millions of pounds.  I would encourage the Minister, where feasible, to include group water schemes in the Leader programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">

      <P>Leader is the EC Initiative under the Structural Funds which enables groups &mdash; private, public or mixed &mdash; in rural communities to draw up and implement integrated plans for the development of their own areas.  Sixteen groups were selected by the EC Commission for funding in Ireland totalling £35 million on the basis of business plans submitted by them.  The main feature of the Leader programme is that the selected groups themselves take <Col N="1312" /> decisions on the projects to be funded in their areas subject to compliance with the terms of their business plans and EC and national exclusion criteria.  The measures which are eligible for grants include: technical support for rural development; vocational training and assistance for recruitment; rural tourism; small firms, craft enterprises and local services and exploitation and marketing of local agricultural, forest and fishery products.</P>
      <P>The position is that the business plans approved for the various Leader groups do not make provision for grant-aiding group water schemes.  Public funding has been committed to the 16 selected Leader groups on the basis of these plans.  In these circumstances, it would not be open to the groups to provide grant assistance for such works.</P>

    <P>Maidir le Scéim Labhairt na Gaeilge, d'íoc mo Roinnse deontas i leith 3,869 dalta bunscoile sa Ghaeltacht don scoilbhliain 1991/92.  Deontas £10 atá ann ó 1965.  Dá mbeadh £10 i 1965 innéacs-nasctha, tuigtear gur £107.28 a bheadh ann anois.</P>
    <P>Tá athbhreithniú déanta ag mo Roinnse ar Scéim Labhairt na Gaeilge agus tá sé i gceist agam scéim nua a thabhairt isteach ó thús na scoilbhliana 1993/94.  Beidh an scéim nua dírithe ar theaghlaigh seachas ar dhaltaí aonaracha, faoi mar a bhí go dtí seo.  Fógrófar an scéim nua nuair a bheidh na sonraí socraithe.</P>

      <P>The current 1 per cent scheme referred to by the Deputy in her question refers to construction projects of local authorities. There is no doubt that the 1 per cent art scheme has made an important contribution <Col N="1032" /> to the provision of public works of art and I wholeheartedly endorse the objectives of the scheme.  It has been beneficial in creating work for artists and it has also been beneficial to the public in general in that many public works such as roads, bridges, fire stations, libraries, and other public buildings have been enhanced by specially commissioned works of art.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for this scheme as it applies to local authorities rests with the Minister for the Environment.  The scheme currently operates on a voluntary basis, but the Deputy will be aware that the Programme for a Partnership Government provides that local authorities will be required to spend 1 per cent of their budget for capital projects on artistic embellishment; that an arts dimension will be incorporated into every Government building project; that there will be changes in our planning laws which will require incorporation of an arts dimension to different categories of buildings; and that where private sector projects not falling into the categories above benefit from significant tax advantages there shall be a similar requirement. I am happy to give the Deputy an assurance that, in consultation with my colleague the Minister for the Enviroment, I propose to ensure that these commitments in the programme will be met.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that these measures will lead to major improvements in the provision of works of art throughout the regions and will contribute significantly to the improvement of our environment and to the development of the artistic life of our country.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to Article 22 of EC Directive 89/552/EC of 3 October 1989 on television broadcasting activities, the so-called Transfrontier Broadcasting Directive.  This Article provides that member states shall take appropriate measures to ensure that television broadcasts by broadcasters under their jurisdiction do not include programmes which might seriously impair the physical, mental or moral development of minors, in particular those that involve pornography or gratuitous violence.  The provision also extends to other programmes which are likely to impair the physical, mental or moral development of minors except where it is ensured, by selecting the time of the broadcast or by any technical measure, that minors in the area of the transmission will not normally hear or see such broadcasts.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Every capital city will attract to itself major institutions both administrative, political and cultural.  Dublin is no different from other capital cities throughout the world in this regard.  It should be a matter of pride for us all as Irish people, and not just for Dubliners, that we have cultural institutions &mdash; such as the National Museum, the National Gallery, the National Library and the National Archives &mdash; comparable with any similar institutions throughout the world.</P>
      <P>However, notwithstanding the realities that pertain to the status of a capital city, I acknowledge that some imbalance exists in the arts infrastructure of the State.  Implementation of the relevant commitments in the Programme for a Partnership Government, which are primarily the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment will go a considerable way to redress this imbalance and I will be in consultation with my colleague in the matter.  The commitments in the programme provide that funding of the Arts by local authorities will also be on a planned basis.  Local authorities will be required to produce a cultural development plan and they will be encouraged to appoint Arts Officers and to establish an Arts Department with requisite staff.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 61 and 62 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland together with its partners in the European Community has made clear to the Turkish authorities on many occasions the importance which the Community attaches to respect for human rights and to observance by Turkey of its international commitments in this area. A dialogue on human rights issues forms an integral part of relations between the European Community and Turkey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ms. Leyla Zana, to whom the questions refer, is a prominent member of Turkey's Grand National Assembly, of <Col N="1047" /> Kurdish origin.  Both nationally and through the European Community we have particularly stressed to the Turkish side our concern that unrest in Kurdish areas of Turkey should be addressed from the political point of view.</P>
    <P>According to the information available to me, Ms. Zana currently faces judicial proceedings under an Article of the Turkish penal code under which the death penalty can be applied.  Attempts are being made to have her parliamentary immunity lifted.  In a separate process, the political party to which she belongs risks exclusion from Parliament for alleged violations of the law on political parties.  As Deputy O'Keeffe's question makes clear, there are reports that Ms. Zana personal safety is at risk.</P>
    <P>I intend to keep under review the various aspects of this case.</P>
    <P>I share Deputies' concern at the implications of a lifting of parliamentary immunity.  This I understand is also a widely shared view among Turkish parliamentarians. I am equally concerned that the Turkish authorities, in view of the publicity and dangers surrounding this case, should take steps to ensure the personal safety of Ms. Zana.  These concerns will be conveyed to the Turkish authorities.</P>

      <P>The Irish Refugee Council applied to my Department in December 1992 for a grant of £25,000 in order to get out of its financial difficulties. I considered the council's submission carefully but concluded that it would not be possible to accede to this particular request.</P>
      <P>I do, however, attach the highest importance to giving humanitarian assistance to refugees.  The body established by the Government to provide such assistance is the Irish Refugee Agency, which operates under a board appointed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  The agency has most recently been responsible for the reception and resettlement of the refugees from the former Yugoslavia who were admitted to Ireland following a Government decision last July. A sum of £250,000 has been provided for the agency in the Estimates for 1993.</P>

      <P>Ireland remains very concerned at reports of violations of human rights and restrictions of fundamental freedoms in China.  This concern is shared by the other members of the European Community.  The Community has raised these concerns with the Chinese authorities on a number of occasions over the last year, most recently when we raised the fate of certain Roman Catholic bishops who have died, and others whose lives were feared to be in danger.  The Community reiterated its concerns in a statement delivered last week to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva.</P>
      <P>In that statement the Presidency on behalf of the Twelve emphasised our particular concern about measures which threaten the distinct cultural, religious and ethnic identity of persons belonging to minorities, the situation in Tibet, the persecution of religious believers, and the imprisonment of people for expressing their political beliefs.</P>
      <P>The statement also noted with appreciation the recent release of some political activists and it appealed to the Chinese authorities to grant a general amnesty for all those who have been detained because of their commitment to democracy and the peaceful expression of their political and religious beliefs and to guarantee respect for human rights, in accordance with international human rights standards.</P>
      <P>Ireland and our Community partners are co-sponsoring a draft resolution at the UN Human Rights Commission on the human rights situation in China.</P>

      <P>The Main Guard is owned at present by Clonmel Corporation and it is not open to the Office of Public Works to provide funding for any restoration works.  Restoration of the building is, however, included in the programme put forward by the Office of Public Works for the next phase of EC funding.  In the event of such funding becoming available, it is intended that ownership of this national monument, and responsibility for its restoration, will be transferred from the Corporation to the Office of Public Works.</P>

      <P>Mr. Sutherland's proposal was that a limited number of EC countries, of which Ireland would be one, should move to a single currency at a date earlier than that envisaged in the Treaty on European Union.</P>
      <P>As I have indicated in the past, we favour the move to a single European currency.  The Treaty sets out a timetable for achieving this and clearly envisages the possibility that not all member states will be in a position to move to a single currency, at least initially.</P>
      <P>It is by no means clear whether it would be possible to advance the date for a single currency to one earlier than that set out in the Treaty.  A number of issues need to be considered before a single currency can be operational.  For example, the institution to issue and control the currency must be established and there must be convergence between the economies of the countries involved. There is also, of course, the question of whether other member states would be prepared to advance the timetable.</P>
      <P>We aim to join the currency union as soon as it is set up.  Our policies are designed to ensure that we will be in a position to do so.</P>

As part of the Government's policy on national conservation the Commissioners are carrying out a survey of the country with a view to identifying natural heritage areas.

The only capital item included in the 1993 allocation in respect of County Meath is the development of the Boyne Valley Archaeological Park, at Donore.  Work on the new visitor centre is currently suspended pending the outcome of an appeal by the Commissioners to the Supreme Court on an earlier High Court judgment on the application of the Planning Acts to State development.

      <Quest>his views on the suggestion that the black economy in the construction industry is still a matter of major concern; whether further action is necessary to combat the situation where it is claimed that the black economy operators have a 60 per cent competitive advantage; if £350 million yearly is involved in these activities; if there is a consequent loss in legitimate employment to the industry of some 12,000 people annually; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are fully aware of the problem of the black economy and special measures have been taken, particularly in relation to the construction industry to counter this problem.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to estimate the extent of black economy practices in any particular industry.  However, given the extent of direct state involvement in building activity and the level of control exercised by the Revenue Commissioners and other areas of the State over the construction industry it is highly unlikely that a black economy of the size referred to by the Deputy exists.</P>
      <P>In the first instance tax clearance procedures ensure that the vast bulk of construction work involving Government contracts and grants is made available only where the contractors concerned have an up-to-date tax record.  The Revenue Commissioners operate a wide range of measures to ensure that tax obligations are met.</P>
      <P>Regulations governing sub-contractors ensure that tax is deducated by principal contractors unless the sub-contractor has a satisfactory tax record.  The procedure has been strengthened recently by new measures ensuring the identity of the sub-contractor where payments are to be made without deduction of tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners operate on an ongoing audit programme to combat the black economy in the industry. In the calendar year ended 31 December 1992, the Revenue Commissioners carried out 190 self assessment audits in the construction industry area. These audits resulted in a yield of £2.6 million.  Special investigations in relation <Col N="1054" /> to the construction industry were undertaking in 40 cases and yielded £2.2 million in 1992.  In addition to the 190 self assessment audits referred to above the Revenue Commissioners carried out a further 1,971 audits specifically in relation to the Construction Industry Tax Regulations. The total yield from these visits was £9.1 million.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Audit Programme is being reorganised on a sectoral basis with the designation of inspectors to specialise in particular sectors.  The Revenue have identified the construction industry as an area that requires a significant audit emphasis.  In Dublin, two districts are being set up to deal with the construction industry as follows: <i>Construction and Property District 1</i> (Dealing mainly with payment controls).  <i>Construction and Property District 11</i> (Dealing mainly with a property development aduits).  These districts will be operational within a matter of weeks.</P>
    <P>In districts outside Dublin, in addition to the ongoing Construction Industry and Audit Programme, an additional officer is being assigned to specialise in outdoor duties with an emphasis on site visits to detect persons who are not currently registered for tax.  The work of this officer will be supported by another who will be investigating all areas of the black economy.  These developments will lead to better targeting of tax defaulters in the black economy.</P>
    <P>A supporting computer system has been introduced which provides a database of information in relation to principal contractors and sub-contractors and thereby assists in monitoring the use of certificates authorising principal contractors to make payments without deduction of tax.</P>
    <P>Inspections are also carried out by the Department of Social Welfare with a view to ensuring compliance with Social Insurance regulations in relation to payment of contributions and to claims for welfare repayments.</P>
    <P>The measures undertaken by Revenue and Social Welfare are kept under review by the black economy monitoring group, which includes representatives of the <Col N="1055" /> Construction Industry Federation.  That group makes recommendations on measures which might prove useful in combating the black economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The domestic presentation of Irish budget aggregates is not directly comparable with the budgetary constructions in many of the other countries encompassed by the Deputy's question. National budget presentations vary, not only in their distinction between current and capital outgoings, but also in the degree to which data is presented gross or net and in the extent to which the different levels of public administration (Local/Regional Authorities, Social Insurance Funds, Commercial/non-Commercial State Bodies, etc.) are captured in the arithmetic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the OECD publishes a series of data which have been derived under National Accounting conventions <Col N="1058" /> intended to secure comparability of certain statistical aggregates across OECD countries (which include the EC member States).  The first of the attached Tables reproduces Table R13: &ldquo;Total outlays of government as a percentage of GDP&rdquo; in the <i>OECD Economic Outlook</i> which was published in December 1992 and is thus the latest available comparative information on the level of Government spending in these countries.  The data reflect the trend in overall government spending, expressed as a proportion of gross domestic product, in each of the countries covered; similar statistics derived on a GNP basis are not assembled by the OECD.</P>
    <P>The OECD also publish comparative data on the tax revenues of their constituent countries.  The second Table which follows reproduces the relevant extract from the latest edition of <i>Revenue Statistics of OECD Member Countries,</i> which was published by the OECD in Summer 1992.  Again, the data are presented as proportions of GDP with no equivalent presentation in terms of GNP.</P>

      <P>To date five projects located entirely in County Louth have been approved by the various working groups under the INTERREG Programme.  These are expenditure on upgrading the transport facilites at Dundalk bus station, improvements of the Greencore and Hoeys Lane, Dundalk Roads, restoration of the 14th century Dominican Priory and a promotion project by the Dundalk Round Table.</P>
      <P>County Louth will also benefit from a larger number of projects having a wider geographical coverage than the county, such as tourism promotion of the Mourne Mountains, South Armagh and Cooley Peninsula by Newry and Mourne District Council and the Midlands-East Regional Tourism Organisation, or designed to benefit the entire Border region covered by INTERREG, such as the Gulliver All-Ireland computerised reservations system being developed by Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourism Board.</P>
      <P>A number of projects under the various measures are still being considered by the working groups and decisions on them are due to be announced shortly.</P>

      <P>In order to qualify for the reliefs available <Col N="1066" /> under the disabled drivers' scheme, which is established by the Disabled Drivers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1989, applicants must satisfy one or more of the following medical criteria:</P>
      <P>(a)  persons who are wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;</P>
      <P>(b)  persons wholly without the use of one of their legs and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that they are severely restricted as to movement of their lower limb;</P>
      <P>(c)  persons without both hands or without both arms;</P>
      <P>(d) persons without one or both legs;</P>
      <P>(e)  persons having the medical condition of dwarfism and who have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</P>
      <P>Assessment of a claimant is made by reference to the above medical criteria by the Directors of Community Care and Medical Officer of Health in the local health boards.  Persons suffering from multiple sclerosis may qualify for the reliefs available on the same basis as any other disabled person, provided they meet any one or more of the above criteria. It would not be appropriate to make specific provision for multiple sclerosis sufferers, without having regard to the level of individual disability involved.</P>

      <P>Social Welfare recipients who have a special dietary requirement arising from a health condition and whose means are insufficient to meet this need, may qualify for an additional payment under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  Entitlement to payment is determined by the relevant health board.  Normally, the amount of a payment would reflect the additional cost of the special diet over and above the amount a person would be expected to pay for a normal diet from their basic social welfare payment.</P>

    <P>In the Eastern Health Board the payment <Col N="1070" /> of a diet supplement is based on standard costed diets which are reviewed periodically by the board.  The board has advised my Department that there are no plans at present to increase the level of diet supplements in payment.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 87, 89 and 90 together.</P>
      <P>The Workers Protection Act, 1991, did not have any effect on the social insurance status of part-time workers.  In April 1991 I extended social insurance to part-time workers earning £25 per week or more, under the Social Welfare (Employment of Inconsiderable Extent) Regulations, 1991.  It was estimated that, as a result of these regulations, over 26,000 part-time workers were brought into social insurance and can now qualify for the full range of social insurance benefits, including pensions.</P>
      <P>Claims for benefit from insured part-time workers are treated on the same basis as those from full-time workers and there is, therefore, no need to identify part-time workers as a separate group within the social insurance system. Accordingly, statistics on the number of benefit claims from part-time workers are not available.  Applicants for disability benefit are not required to have sustained a loss of employment and are unaffected by section 6 of SI 488 of 1992.</P>
      <P>In my speech on the budget debate I indicated that I have decided to relax the substantial loss of employment condition by providing that claimants in all cases will only be required to lose one day's employment, regardless of the number of days they work in a week.  This change will make it easier for part-time workers to qualify for unemployment benefit.</P>

      <Quest>the reason people are being transferred from the new employment exchange on Mellowes Road, Dublin 11 to collect their social welfare payments at Finglas village post office, Dublin 11 which is, at present not capable of accommodating those who already collect payments there.</Quest>

      <P>As part of a general programme for service improvements there is a <Col N="1087" /> phased transfer of cash payment from my Department's local offices to An Post and other financial institutions.  My Department concluded an agreement with An Post last year which will assist An Post in modernising its counter services and in introducing a variety of new and more flexible payment options for the unemployed.</P>
      <P>Under the new arrangements unemployed persons will be free to select the most convenient post office to receive their payment.  In general, they will be required to attend less frequently at a local office of my Department.</P>
      <P>As the new system develops social welfare customers will have the option of being paid in a variety of more modern ways, including Electronic Transfer to banks and other institutions.</P>
      <P>There are 4,970 unemployed people registered at the Department's new Finglas office which opened in October 1992. From the outset 580 of these clients were paid by cheque and in recent weeks 744 clients were transferred to the post office payment system.  It is intended to increase this number to 1,000 in the coming weeks.</P>
      <P>The cases are spread over six post offices and the Finglas village post office is dealing with 229 of them.  My Department is monitoring the situation with An Post to ensure that the service provided is satisfactory.</P>

The social welfare appeals office will be in touch shortly with the person concerned to give her precise <Col N="1088" /> details of the time and venue of the appeal hearing.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, she will continue to receive old age non-contributory pension at the maximum rate of £66.70 per week inclusive of living alone allowance and free fuel allowance.</P>

      <P>As far as I am aware no one of the people appointed by me is a member of Fianna Fáil or the Labour Party.</P>
      <P>It is a well established practice in successive Governments that a Minister appoints a small number of staff who are considered to have the experience and qualifications needed to assist him or her in carrying out the Government's Programme.</P>
      <P>I trust that the Deputy is not implying in his question that those who participate in the political process do not make an important contribution in serving the public and the democratic process.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Minister of State at my Department that one of the staff appointed by her is an ordinary member of the Labour Party.  The staff member concerned was appointed as her Dáil Secretary on being elected a TD and, on her appointment as Minister of State, was appointed as her Personal Assistant.</P>

      <P>The commission's recommendations on social welfare are directed at reforming the system to more closely reflect women's needs.  The commission advocates that women working in the home receive payments in their own right rather than as dependants of their husbands; that women in the home do not lose entitlement to pensions as a result of periods spent caring for their families; that young lone parents should gain access to training and employment without jeopardising their social welfare payments and that women be better aided in their roles as carers of children and of the elderly.  Possible options for changes in the system in light of the recommendations are being studied by my Department at present, having regard to the extent of the changes which would be required and their financial and other implications.  I will be consulting with interested parties in this regard.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that because free travel passes cannot be used before 9.45 a.m., residents of outlying towns where journeys can be up to 80 minutes into Dublin city centre, may be left with as little as one hour to carry out their business before having to travel home again before the evening restriction comes into force; if he will allow distant pensioners to avail of free travel from 9 a.m. as distant commuters must correspondingly travel much earlier in the morning and so buses are emptier from 9 a.m. in outlying areas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The free travel scheme is intended to encourage elderly persons to <Col N="1090" /> remain active in the community by giving them access to spare capacity on the various public transport systems.  Time restrictions have been a feature of the free travel scheme since its inception and are necessary on city routes because the services concerned are under severe pressure from commuters travelling to or from work or school in the morning and evening and they would be unable to cope with the additional volume of passengers arising if the restrictions did not apply.</P>
      <P>In the case of city bus services for Dublin, Cork and Limerick provided by Bus Atha Cliath or Bus Éireann, free travel is not available from 7.00 a.m. to 9.45 a.m. and from 4.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. each day from Monday to Friday.  Time restrictions do not, however, apply in the case of mentally-handicapped persons, persons attending long term rehabilitation courses or certain other disabled or blind persons.  Furthermore, in the case of Bus Eireann long distance buses, the time restriction is limited to Fridays only from 4.00 p.m. to 7.00 p.m. for up to 20 miles outside Dublin, Cork or Limerick.</P>
      <P>Representations have been made to me from time to time that the current time restrictions should be reduced or abolished altogether.  Any easing in this regard would have significant cost implications for the carriers involved who in turn would be seeking compensation from my Department.  I have no plans to change the current time restrictions at the present time.  Expenditure on the free travel scheme will amount to almost £30 million this year and will benefit some 440,000 people.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 98 and 99 together.</P>
      <P>A bilateral agreement on social security between Ireland and the United States of America was signed by the Minister for Social Welfare on 14 April 1992.</P>
      <P>Under the Constitution the text of this agreement is subject to Dáil approval and I will be moving the necessary motion to seek this approval shortly.</P>
      <P>However, there are also legal and constitutional matters which have to be completed on the US side before the agreement can be brought into force in that country.  I understand that the US arrangements are nearing completion. When they have been completed the agreement provides that instruments of approval, indicating that all constitutional and legal matters have been completed by both sides must be exchanged.  The agreement will then come into operation on the first day of the third month following this exchange. At this stage the likely operative date is 1 September 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the agreement comes into operation it is estimated that in the first year some 1,500 persons will qualify for pensions from the US and from Ireland under its provisions and that this number will increase each year as more people become eligible.  In addition some 3,500 persons who are currently receiving US pensions in Ireland will become entitled <Col N="1092" /> to the free schemes operated by my Department.</P>
    <P>This will be the fourth agreement which I have introduced to protect the social security rights of our migrant workers who have worked or resided in countries outside the European Community. Agreements are already in place with Austria, Canada and Australia.  I hope to sign two further agreements soon.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to a rather lengthy interview given by the Assistant Commissioner DMA to RTE on 27 January last on the crime situation in Dublin.  I have read a transcript of the interview in question and it is quite clear from the content that, while the remark in question was made, what the Assistant Commissioner wanted to convey was that new Garda recruits now undergo a better quality training programme which lasts for two years, instead of the 22 weeks that applied up to 1989, and which better prepares them for their responsibilities than was the case in the past.</P>
      <P>The Assistant Commissioner, mindful of the fact that these particular remarks may have been misinterpreted, telephoned the producer of the programme in question the following morning seeking to have the matter clarified.  Unfortunately this did not happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that it was never the Assistant Commissioner's intention to cast a slur on or offend any member of the Force, old or young and he has confirmed this on a number of occasions since both in the media and to his colleagues. The suggestion that this minor contretemps has generated &ldquo;unprecedented anger&rdquo; throughout the Force is a gross overstatement.  The matter was not even mentioned during lengthy meetings I had last week with the Executives of the Garda Representative Association <Col N="1097" /> and the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors.</P>

    <P>The allocation of Garda manpower as between individual stations is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  The policing of these three areas is augmented by the Divisional Task Force as required. Station strengths are a matter of on-going review by the Garda authorities having regard to local situations.</P>
    <P>With regard to a number of sexual assaults on the Northside of Dublin, I am naturally very concerned that such attacks should occur.  While it is not the practice for the Minister for Justice to comment on the progress of specific Garda investigations, I can say that the investigation into the sexual assaults in this area is being vigorously pursued. Regular conferences are being held by the Garda Officers concerned to review all aspects of the case and the support of the community has been enlisted by local effort and by use of the Crimeline Programme. I am hopeful that these efforts will result in the apprehension of whoever is responsible.</P>
    <P>Provisional crime figures for 1992 for the Raheny, Coolock and Howth areas taken together indicate a significant decrease since 1990, while the indications are that the incidence of unauthorised taking of vehicles in these sub-Districts has fallen substantially in recent years.</P>

      <P>Existing occupational safety and health legislation including the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989 and the recently published Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application) Regulations, 1993, highlight the need to identify hazards at work, to assess the risks arising and to put in place appropriate collective prevention measures.  However, it is also recognised that it may not be possible to avoid or sufficiently reduce risks in all circumstances by technical means of collective protection or by measures, methods or procedures of work organisation. In such circumstances the legislation requires the employer to provide appropriate personal protective equipment for use by employees.  The employer is required to determine the <Col N="1106" /> conditions of use of personal protective equipment on the basis of the gravity of the risk, the frequency of exposure to the risk, the characteristics of the workstation and the adequacy of the personal protective equipment concerned.  The employer must also provide information, training and instruction to employees on the risks against which the personal protective equipment is intended to provide protection and in relation to the use of the equipment.  Employees who are provided with personal protective equipment are required under the legislation to make full and proper use of it in accordance with the instructions which the employer is required to provide.</P>
      <P>The potential hazards and risks of serious head injury in various types of workplaces and work activities have long been recognised as major problems in occupational safety and health.  This has been reflected in our safety and health legislation, including, for example, the Construction (Safety, Health and Welfare) Regulations, 1975.  Such concern is also reflected at EC level in Council Directive 89/656/EEC of 30 November, 1989, on the minimum health and safety requirements for the use by workers of personal protective equipment at the workplace.  The General Application Regulations, 1993, already referred to, give effect to this Directive.</P>
      <P>On the basis of advice available to me from the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health &mdash; the body charged with the day-to-day administration and enforcement of safety and health at work &mdash; I do not propose to alter the current legislative requirements with regard to the provision and use of personal protective equipment where it is required to protect safety and health and where other preventive measures are inadequate or not feasible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question relates to two separate issues, the question of protection under labour law and the question of social welfare entitlements.</P>
      <P>The matter of social welfare entitlements is primarily a matter for the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>Protection under labour law arises under a variety of different enactments which differ slightly in relation to their scope and application.  In general, labour laws attempt only to regulate employer/employee relationships and do not regulate self employment.  The question of whether or not a specific individual's employment relationship comes within the scope of an individual labour law would be a matter for the relevant adjudicative body under that Act.</P>
      <P>It is open to any person who considers that he/she has a grievance under labour law to refer the matter to the adjudicative body under the relevant Act which they feel has been breached.  It will then be a matter for that body to determine if the facts of the employment relationship are such that the worker is covered by the Act in question.</P>
      <P>I do not consider that changes need to be made in labour law to protect the workers referred to in the Deputy's question, in that it is the reality of their individual employment relationship which determines their legal entitlements and not any purported description of that relationship.  If the contract offered to and accepted by the individual is one of self employment then the existing enactments of labour law intended for the protection of employees are not appropriate to them.  However, I would point out to the Deputy that all workers, whether self employed or otherwise, are fully protected in so far as occupational safety and health at the worksite is concerned by the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989 and its associated regulations.</P>

      <P>During the period referred to by the Deputy, enforcement actions in respect of non-payment of awards made under labour law came within the scope of the functions of the Minister for Labour, who had the power to take such actions under the terms of the Minimum Notice and Terms of <Col N="1111" /> Employment Act, 1973, the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, the Employment Equality Act, 1977 and the Maternity Protection of Employees Act, 1981.  In January, 1993, responsibility for the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973 and the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977 was transferred to the Minister for Enterprise and Employment and responsibility for the other three Acts was transferred to the Minister for Equality and Law Reform.  I propose to deal with the Deputy's question in respect of the Acts which come within my area of responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973 and the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977 allow the Minister to initiate, on behalf of an employee who <Col N="1112" /> so requests it, proceedings for the enforcement of the terms of a determination made by the Employment Appeals Tribunal but not discharged by the employer.</P>
    <P>All complaints of non-payment of awards made by the Tribunal are investigated by my Department in the first instance.  If my officials fail to secure payment of the award, the case is referred to the Chief State Solicitor's Office with a view to initiating legal proceedings. Details are set out in the following tabular statements of the number of complaints received of non-payment of awards in each of the years 1989-1992 and the number of cases finalised successfully in each of those years.  I regret that details in respect of years earlier than 1989 are not available.</P>

      <P>The Social Employment Scheme (SES) is the principal manpower intervention aimed at assisting the long term unemployed.  The Community Employment Development Programme (CEDP) which operates solely in the 12 <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> pilot areas is a development of the Social Employment Scheme whereby participants from the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> areas retain their secondary benefits; in addition many CEDP projects provide training for participants. Persons from outside the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> areas can participate in the CEDP if sponsors are unable to fill the approved number of places from within the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> areas. However, such persons do not retain their secondary benefits.</P>
      <P>Recruitment to the Social Employment Scheme and the Community Employment Development Programme is a day to day matter for FÁS.</P>

      <P>At a meeting on 4 February 1993, I advised the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed (INOU) that I was not in a position to give any commitment regarding the provision of funding to the organisation in respect of its on-going running costs.  I also pointed out that it still remained to be decided which Department <Col N="1114" /> is the most appropriate one through which to channel State funds for organisations dealing with the unemployed should the Government decide to make such funds available.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, the INOU will continue to benefit from participation in the Social Employment Scheme, through which it has already received significant funding from the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>Under the Urban Renewal Act, 1986, an area may be declared a designated area where the Minister is satisfied that there is a special need to promote urban renewal within it. When selecting areas for designation, the Minister must have regard to criteria such as the extent of urban decay, need for urban renewal/conservation, potential for redevelopment, regional considerations and the need to redress adverse economic or social conditions.  I have no doubt that many towns can make a claim for designation.  However, in order to maximise the impact of the scheme, designation must be restricted to the most urgent cases.

      <P>Apart from its recommendation that the Defence Forces pension schemes should <Col N="1132" /> be amended immediately to provide for the reckoning of military service allowance in calculating superannuation benefits (which has been implemented), the Commission on Remuneration and Conditions of Service in the Defence Forces considered that any further changes in the superannuation arrangements should be introduced only in the context of a fundamental revision of those schemes.</P>
      <P>The commission recognised that such a revision would be a task of considerable technical complexity and would involve detailed consultations and discussions with both the military authorities and the representative associations.  Thus, the revision is a long term project and will take a considerable time to complete.</P>
      <P>The commission recommended that persons joining the Defence Forces after the introduction of new pension schemes would automatically become members of those schemes but that personnel serving at the time of their introduction should be given the option of joining the new schemes or of remaining in the existing schemes.</P>

    <P>Applications are being assessed by the Department from the relevant technical and scientific perspectives.

    <P>To date, three licences have been granted to three shellfish operators in Dungarvan Harbour.  The licensees are as follows: Waterford Shellfish Ltd in respect of oyster and clam cultivation; Iasc Sliogach Dungarbhan in respect of oyster cultivation; and PKA Ltd in respect of oyster and clam cultivation.</P>

      <P>Land annuities paid by farmers through a bank are receipted by the bank while payments made directly to my Department are receipted only on request.</P>
      <P>The land involved was held by the person named under a Temporary Convenience Agreement from 1982 until November 1991, when the allotment was vested.  At that time the account relating to the land was changed from a &ldquo;rent&rdquo; account to an &ldquo;annuity&rdquo; account to fit in with the changed status of the holding. Due to a clerical error, the payment of £592.20 made by the person named in December, 1991, immediately after the vesting, was lodged to his old &ldquo;rent&rdquo; account rather than to the newly created &ldquo;annuity&rdquo; account.  I regret that as a result, subsequent annuity bills continued to demand the amount already paid.  The matter has now been corrected and the present position is that only one instalment of £592.70 due at November, 1992 is outstanding.</P>
      <P>The accounting system relating to annuity collection will be examined in the context of implementing the annuity package agreed by the Government last year with a view to achieving maximum efficiency.</P>

It shows that visitor numbers for 1992 were up over 4 per cent on the previous year, a little below Bord Fáilte's mid-year projection of around 5 per cent.  Also included are details supplied by Bord Fáilte, who has responsibility for overseeing the national marketing and promotion effort, of marketing expenditure over the same period.  The Bord has yet to finalise the level of resources that it will be able to dedicate to its marketing programme for 1993.  These resources normally come from a number of sources including the grant-in-aid, the EC, and contributions from the industry.</P>
      <P>While the Bord and the industry itself will be taking a number of initiatives for the coming season, the most significant of these will be a special Bord Failte led campaign costing £2 million, to increase business in shoulder and off-peak periods.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 245 and 246 together.</P>
      <P>The Government is anxious to encourage Irish firms to maximise the business opportunities available to them in the domestic market.  While general import statistics are available from the Central Statistics Office, it is recognised that these alone do not give sufficient detail to enable specific market opportunities to be identified.  To help companies identify these opportunities An Bord Tráchtála is currently undertaking the first ever comprehensive sector-by-sector analysis of the competition facing Irish manufacturers in the home market.  This new initiative involves the development of unique import statistical databases from which both short and long term opportunities can be identified with particular focus on areas which display high growth rates and reasonably large import values. I recently launched the first report in the series which identified 40 new product opportunities in the food and drink sector.  A survey of the building materials sector will be published later this year.</P>
      <P>On an ongoing basis, the programmes and services of An Bord Tráchtála's Ireland Division are directed at enhancing the links between Irish sellers and Irish buyers.  They provide business sourcing services to large-scale industry, public purchasers and retailing groups together with matching support for potential Irish suppliers.  Irish suppliers are informed and invited to participate in An Bord Tráchtála's home market activities through direct mail and press announcements.</P>

      <P>The provision of service in any particular MMDS cell is a matter for the franchisee concerned. A number of factors can affect the start up date for providing service such as transmitter site identification and acquisition, planning permission, site development and the ordering and delivery of equipment.  The MMDS franchisee for Carlow was also awarded the franchise for Kilkenny.  The franchisee was required to go through a protracted planning process in relation to the Kilkenny cell and, subsequently, obstruction from local residents at the transmitter site forced a change from the selected site. The delays caused in Kilkenny had knock on effects on the franchisee's ability to develop the Carlow cell.</P>
      <P>I understand that work on the identification of a suitable transmitter site for the Carlow cell is progressing and the franchisee hopes to provide the service there as soon as is practicable.</P>

A major step in meeting this commitment has already been made with the allocation of £11.5 million in 1993 &mdash; an increase of 13 per cent on the 1992 figure.  The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> target of £12-13 million will be achieved in 1994 and it is my intention that it will then be at least maintained at <Col N="1170" /> that level in real terms in subsequent years.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 265, 266 and 282 together.</P>
      <P>Under the Health Act, 1970 medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board are unable, without undue hardship, to provide general practitioner services for themselves and their dependants.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are available to assist Chief Executive Officers in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the Consumer Price Index.</P>
      <P>However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, that person may still be awarded a medical card if the Chief Executive Officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. At present almost 36 per cent of the population hold medical cards.</P>
      <P>Persons aged between 16 and 25 years, including students, who are dependants of a person who is not a medical card holder, are not normally entitled to a medical card except where they have an entitlement under EC regulations or where they are in receipt of a Disabled Person's Maintenance Allowance.  The decision on whether or not a person is regarded as a dependant or as being financially independent is made by the Chief Executive Officer of the health board on the basis of the circumstances of the individual case.  Students who are financially independent are entitled to apply for medical cards and are assessed on the same income criteria as all other applicants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have given the issues raised by the Deputy very careful consideration and I would of course be anxious that every person who is in genuine need of a medical <Col N="1172" /> card should receive one.  However, I do not think that it is justifiable to grant an automatic entitlement to a medical card to any particular group without any reference to their means.</P>
    <P>It is open to all persons, be they parents of children suffering from severe disablement or ongoing medical conditions requiring frequent medication, persons on modest incomes or third level students to apply to the Chief Executive Officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves and/or their dependants without hardship.  I am satisfied that health boards give sympathetic consideration to such applications when the circumstances warrant it.</P>

There are no children in category A, the category of greatest severity, waiting for orthodontic treatment.  Treatment for category A is provided immediately. There are currently 550 children in categories B and C on the board's waiting list for orthodontic treatment.</P>
      <P>The average waiting period for categories B and C is approximately two to two and a half years.</P>

      <P>As I indicated to the House on the Adjournment on 3 March last, I have directed the South-Eastern Health Board to carry out an immediate investigation of the circumstances of this tragic case, in so far as the health services are concerned.  The terms of reference of the investigation team are:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;to carry out an investigation, in so far as the health services are concerned, <Col N="1176" /> of the circumstances surrounding the abuse referred to in the case heard in the Central Criminal Court on 1 March 1993; in particular to establish why action to halt the abuse was not taken earlier, and</P>
    <P>&mdash;to make recommendations for the future investigation and management by the health services of cases of suspected child abuse.</P>
    <P>The investigation team appointed by the South-Eastern Health Board in response to my direction is headed by Catherine McGuinness, Senior Counsel, who is being assisted by:</P>
    <P>&mdash;Martin Hynes, Programme Manager for Community Care Services, South-Eastern Health Board,</P>
    <P>&mdash;Dr. Sheila Ryan, Director of Community Care and Medical Officer of Health, Midland Health Board, and</P>
    <P>&mdash;Brid Clarke, Head Social Worker, Eastern Health Board.</P>
    <P>I expect the investigation team to complete its task within four weeks and to report to me very shortly thereafter.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to publish the findings and recommendations of the investigation team subject, of course, to the need to preserve the anonymity of the victim and the other parties concerned.</P>
    <P>I am concerned to ensure that every measure possible is taken to prevent a recurrence of what happened in this case. Towards this end, I will be discussing the matter with the Chief Executive Officers of the eight Health Boards when I meet them this week.  In particular I will be stressing the necessity to ensure that satisfactory arrangements are in place in their areas for the identification, investigation and management of child abuse cases.</P>
    <P>In the light of these consultations and the results of the investigation being carried out by the South-Eastern Health Board, I shall be reporting to the Government at an early date with recommendations for the introduction of whatever new measures are necessary to improve existing services and procedures <Col N="1177" /> for dealing with child abuse, and for the care and protection of children generally.</P>

      <P>There has been a significant improvement in the level of orthodontic services in the South Tipperary area as a result of the additional moneys made available since 1989.  A total of 264 children are currently receiving orthodontic treatment. A full-time Consultant Orthodontist took up appointment with the Health Board in September 1992 which will result in further improvement in the provision of orthodontic services in the region.  This appointment will enable the board to develop a comprehensive orthodontic service and will facilitate the provision of training in orthodontics for the board's dental staff.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, additional funds have been made available in this year's budget for the development of services for people with mental handicap. This funding will be allocated on a priority basis in line with the recommendations of the Regional Mental Handicap Co-ordinating Committee in each Health Board area.  The needs of people with autism will, therefore, be identified where necessary amongst the priority needs within each region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to say that additional services were put in place in 1992 for people with autism.  Funding was made available to allow for the transfer of six people with autism from Lota, Cork to <Col N="1181" /> full-time residential care in the Brothers of Charity Services, Bawnmore, Limerick. The Cork Association for Autistic Children provided a summer residential scheme for 24 people and weekend respite services for 16 people.  The Western Care Association provided respite care for 20 children-adolescents in Foxford and Castlebar, County Mayo.</P>
    <P>A major development for persons with autism is planned on a site made available by the Daughters of Charity, St. Vincent's Hospital, Fairview, Dublin 3.  This will involve the provision of a workshop for 30 trainees and two houses each providing six residential places.  It is expected that construction will commence shortly and that these facilities will be available in 1994.</P>
    <P>Improvements in the specialist assessment of autistic children are also being facilitated as a result of the expansion of child psychiatric services.</P>

      <P>It has not been possible to include the project in Assumption Secondary School in the 1993 second level capital programme because of other demands deemed to be of a higher priority which had to take precedence.  However the proposed new accommodation is not designed to increase the school's overall capacity but to provide improved facilities to meet long term needs.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to this project and to the increased level of applications for places in the school in September next which would increase the overall pupil numbers in the school in 1993-94 was discussed at a meeting held on Friday last by senior officials of my Department with the school authorities and a number of alternative suggestions were proposed for consideration.</P>
      <P>The main concern of my Department in relation to accommodation needs in urban areas is that adequate places are available in accessible schools which may not always be in the school of first choice.</P>

      <P>The course was developed over a period of eight years by Irish teachers and research officers under a European programme on the transition from school to adult life and introduced in 1984.</P>
      <P>A school must have the prior approval of my Department to offer the programme. It is in operation in 61 schools at present.</P>
