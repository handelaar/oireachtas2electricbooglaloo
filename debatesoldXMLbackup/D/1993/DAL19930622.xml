      <Quest>if, in relation to Annual Service Inquiries conducted by the Central Statistics Office under the Statistics (Service Inquiries) Order, 1993, he will make a statement on the way in which a solicitor is supposed to complete the form without expending a very considerable amount of his time and his accountant's time on the exercise; and the number of solicitors that have been asked by the Central Statistics Office to compile forms of this kind (details supplied).</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The annual services inquiry questionnaire to which the Deputy refers is a short form containing seven questions only.  It requests the minimum information required to compile the necessary statistics on the services sector for national accounts and other purposes.</P>
      <P>The details requested are very straightforward and should be readily available from the set of accounts which solicitors would normally keep for taxation and other purposes.  In fact the form has been deliberately confined to the broad accounting aggregates to ensure a quick response and minimal effort on the part of firms who have been canvassed in this inquiry.</P>
      <P>Approximately 550 forms were issued to a sample of businesses involved in legal services.  In addition, some 8,000 forms were issued to a sample of businesses in a range of other service activities.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister of State accept that to extract the aggregates he mentioned would require a considerable amount of time and effort for individuals carrying on a business and that this is a harsh imposition on people who are finding it hard enough at present to make ends meet in difficult circumstances?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that this is a harsh imposition.  The details requested on the form are straightforward. There are seven headings, two or three of which can be filled in with little effort and the remainder of the information requested is the bare minimum necessary to make this inquiry effective.  All the information, apart from the section dealing with persons engaged in enterprise and one other section, can be filled in very simply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Deputy.  From time to time the State requires information for the good of the entire community.  On occasions we must get the information on a compulsory basis and sometimes on a voluntary basis.  It would not be a good idea to compensate people who supply information on a sample basis.  This is a very straightforward extraction of information from a set of books for taxation purposes which I am sure every solicitor possesses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 56 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has been active in seeking to have the provisions of the code implemented.  The code has been widely circulated to Government Departments, State-sponsored bodies, employer organisations, individual employers, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and individual trade unions with a view to encouraging the adoption of its provisions in employer-trade union agreements, particularly in relation to essential services. Organisations providing essential services were, in particular, targeted by my Department and the Labour Relations Commission with a view to encouraging and assisting them to adopt the provisions of the code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since taking office, I have reviewed the implementation of the code and was very disappointed with progress to date.  I have written to organisations providing essential services, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Irish Business and Employers Confederation highlighting my concern and encouraging the adoption of the code.  I have requested the Labour Relations Commission to continue to monitor the situation and to <Col N="1369" /> initiate follow-up action with individual companies and trade unions.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that adoption of the code is voluntary in line with our system of industrial relations.  The code states that the primary responsibility for dealing with industrial relations issues rests with employers, employer organisations and trade unions.  The implementation of its provisions is ultimately a matter for negotiation and agreement between companies and trade unions.  I would like to take this opportunity to call on all parties to renew their efforts to ensure that agreement is reached on the adoption of the code without further delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that his efforts have been pretty dismal given that in the series of disputes recently the terms of the code of practice were not honoured, particularly with the travelling public in Dublin and around the country?  Does the Minister subscribe to the view of his Minister of State, Deputy O'Rourke and former Ministers, that if a voluntary system of protecting essential services fails consideration will have to be given to some other legislative tool?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed that the efforts that I, and previous Ministers made in this respect did not result in the adoption of this code.  I repeat that there are sufficient provisions in the code to enable aggrieved parties to seek redress without disrupting essential services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>The code is not working.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister be doing something more than writing a circular letter, which is all he appears to have done to date?  Disputes are taking place at the moment and the code of practice is not being observed.  This code is 18 months old and, as I understand it, <Col N="1370" /> nobody has signed on for it.  Will the Minister inject some urgency into this? Will he also bear in mind that under the provisions this is not entirely voluntary. There are clear implications that in adjudicating on cases, failure to commit to the code will be taken into account. The Minister cannot walk away from this and say that it is for others to resolve the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like the Deputy to think that I am walking away from the problem or that the Minister of State has merely written circular letters. We had detailed discussions with different parties to various disputes urging the adoption of this code.  The adoption of the code is voluntary.  Once it is adopted it can be taken into account in the resolution and adjudication of various disputes.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 75 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish Steel, like all other European steel producers, has been affected by the recent downturn in the steel market. With nearly 90 per cent of its output exported, the company has had to follow price trends pertaining in its main markets. Consequently, the company must now operate on very tight margins.  In an attempt to overcome these difficulties and secure employment, the company has made cost-cutting proposals to unions <Col N="1371" /> at the Haulbowline plant.  These proposals are now the subject of discussions between management and workers.  I am confident that management and unions will be able to agree on the actions necessary to maintain employment levels and the future of the plant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach's indication that Irish Steel was on the market for a purchaser represent Government policy?  If not, what approach does the Minister proposes to take to deal with the losses there which amount to £16,000 per worker employed and which, as they now stand, jeopardise employment in that industry?  Will the Minister give some indication as to his strategy for securing these jobs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is well aware, management and unions are currently negotiating in a difficult and fraught situation because of international circumstances and proposals to reduce costs against a very difficult background and I do not think it would be very helpful for us to speculate aloud in this House on the future options for the company.  I assure the House that the future of Irish Steel is of considerable concern to the Government and we will monitor developments currently being negotiated between management and the unions at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister believe that any negotiations between employers and unions can bridge a loss of £16,000 per job?  Is it not the case that the future of this company depends on State policy, perhaps in the context of the Structural Funds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the regime for steel in the European <Col N="1372" /> Community is particularly constrained because of over supply.  I do not think it would be helpful for me to speculate about the strategic options facing this company at present.  If the Deputy tables such a question, I would be prepared to answer it in some detail.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Enterprise and Employment</askee>
      <Quest>if the incentives available to investors here are capable of attracting job creating industry to this country notwithstanding competition for such investment from southeast Asia, eastern Europe and the rest of the EC; if he intends to take any measures to tilt the balance in this country's favour; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>
      </QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 18 together.</P>
      <P>I take it that Deputy Bruton is referring to the IDA cost per job figures for indigenous and foreign industry which I gave him in reply to the question he asked in this House on 18 May.  I am informed by the IDA that the reasons for the difference between the two cost per job figures in question are as follows: first, IDA operates in an intensely competitive world market for mobile investment; second, foreign industry projects tend to be more capital intensive, reflecting a higher level of technology and associated costs and third, all grant offers to foreign firms are based on the minimum amount necessary to secure the project for Ireland.</P>
      <P>The reality is, and this was a point the Culliton report recognised, that the IDA has to pay the going rate to attract foreign firms.  In order to reduce the cost of attracting mobile investment to peripheral regions such as Ireland, we have constantly sought, and will continue to seek, more effective EC restrictions on State aid for industry, particularly in the more developed and centrally located member states.  The control of State aid is central to being able to squeeze the budget for internationally mobile investment.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, I would emphasise that State financial support for inward investment is not given at the expense of support for the development of indigenous industry which is the primary focus of industrial policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Turning to Deputy Durkan's question, I believe that the incentives available to investors here are capable of attracting job creating industry to this country.  Last year, for example, I understand the IDA secured 52 new projects in manufacturing and international services, as well as 41 <Col N="1374" /> projects for the International Financial Services Centre.</P>
    <P>I also understand from the IDA that new opportunities are being created in niche areas such as data processing, environmental protection, specialised electronic components and equipment, health care, automotive components and production automation, and that Ireland offers major advantages for companies involved in these areas.</P>
    <P>However, given the strong competition for mobile investment from the areas referred to by the Deputy, the IDA has informed me that it will be keeping its competitive position <i>vis-à-vis</i> these locations under constant review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister has indicated no policy position of his own in response to this question. Is the Minister aware that the percentage of the industrial grant budget allocated to foreign industries has been increasing in recent years and is now 63 per cent?  Is he also aware that the increment, the higher amount paid to foreign as opposed to domestic industries, has also increased?  The allocation of 66 per cent this year is much higher than the allocation last year.  Is he further aware that the total Irish spend of a foreign company per pound of export is 30p compared with 60p in respect of an Irish company, in other words, that more is paid for jobs which have a lesser impact on the Irish economy?  Would he agree that this policy is not one we should continue to pursue and that we should accept the Culliton recommendation on squeezing the foreign industry budget?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">

      <P>Does the Minister recall that when I asked him to indicate whether the foreign industry budget would be squeezed, as Culliton recommended, he refused to say if that was the case?  Am I to assume that the Minister <Col N="1375" /> has changed his mind and the policy is now to squeeze the proportion of State money allocated to foreign industries?</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Enterprise and Employment</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the increased criticism of the terms of the Industrial Relations Act, 1990, by the trade union movement, and particularly to the motion passed at the recent annual conference of the country's biggest union, SIPTU, seeking a Government review of the legislation; if it is intended to undertake such a review; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Col N="1376" />
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Industrial Relations Act, 1990 was enacted following extensive consultation with the social partners. The purpose of this consultation process was to achieve as much consensus as possible on a package of measures which would provide an improved framework for the orderly conduct of industrial relations.  I am satisfied that the Act achieves the correct balance between the rights and responsibilities of employers, trade unions, employees and the broader public interest.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the views expressed by various parties about the Act and of the motion passed at the recent SIPTU annual delegate conference.  The Act, which did not become fully operational until July 1992, is monitored on an emergency basis by my Department and I consider that a detailed review would be premature and is not warranted at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has referred to the fact that the defects in this Act dominated the annual conference of the largest union, SIPTU.  Despite what the Minister has said about consultation, is he saying that when one of the major social partners points to serious deficiencies in respect of picketing policy, policies relating to the prosecution of a dispute by a single worker and the place of picketing, he would wish to ignore the views of SIPTU and the trade union movement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should restate my reply.  I said I was aware of the views on the Act expressed by the various parties, including the delegates at the SIPTU conference.  I have also had discussions with representatives of congress who have discussed in detail with me their concerns and reservations about aspects of the interpretation and operation of the Act.  I expressed my concern when I shared the same benches as Deputy Rabbitte.  Since the Act only became fully operational in July 1992 a detailed review would be premature and is not warranted at this stage.  That is not to say we are not monitoring all the instances to which delegates at the Tralee conference made <Col N="1377" /> reference and other instances which have been brought to my attention by the industrial relations section of my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to refer the Minister to the close umbilical cord between his party and SIPTU and query whether the union has taken up the criticisms set out in a booklet I co-authored, which had the support of the Labour Party.  Would the Minister agree that what we are talking about in regard to the law on industrial relations is a balance of rights and that it is the view of the trade union movement that that Act has tilted the balance so that it is a factor in causing disputes rather than in resolving them?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is making a statement and I would ask him to ask a supplementary question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question.  Does the Minister agree with the view of the trade union movement that those deficiencies in the Act are facilitating or provoking disputes rather than permitting their resolution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the provisions of the Act, among other things, sought to tighten and clarify the law in relation to picketing, especially secondary picketing, to remove the immunity in worker versus worker disputes, and to remove immunity in disputes concerning only one worker where agreed procedures have not been followed and so forth.  It was the view of many people who have knowledge, perhaps not as detailed as Deputy Rabbitte's, in regard to industrial relations procedures, that once the Act was put in place and the courts were brought into play, as they have been on a number of occasions, various interpretations from various benches could and possibly would give rise to unease and concern.  I am aware of that unease and I am monitoring carefully the legal decisions that have arisen in respect of various disputes, of which I am sure Deputy Rabbitte is fully <Col N="1378" /> informed.  A constant review is being maintained of the implications of those judgments, not all of which are complete in terms of their passage through the courts, and the consequences of those judgments and their impact upon industrial relations will be monitored carefully by my Department with a view to ensuring that there is a correct balance between on the one hand, the rights of workers and, on the other, the rights of employers and the general public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister concerned about the increasing incidence of resort to the courts by employers under the headings we have discussed?  Does he recall that part of the <i>quid pro quo</i> at the time of consultation with the social partners was the abolition of the <i>ex-parte</i> injunction?  If one now considers the period of operation of the Act, there has been increasing resort to the courts to secure injunctions which, in some cases, have had the effect of provoking industrial unrest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be concerned that the legislation as it was framed and enacted in this House, without the support of my party which was then in Opposition, would still attempt to convey, albeit not in a perfect manner, a set of immunities to workers pursuing industrial disputes by way of pickets and other types of activity.  Problems will continue to arise until such time as the law settles in this area.  It is a sensitive and difficult area and it is being monitored closely by my Department.  Whatever action is needed will be taken to restore balance to the interpretation and the understanding of the law as was intended in this House when it was passed through the Oireachtas.</P>

Would the Minister not agree that given a projected State investment in the manufacturing sector of £300 million per year, the apparent cost of £150,000 per job appears extremely burdensome, and in view of that would he consider an alternative strategy to relieve the service sector of the huge burdens it bears from the tax code?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the House is not listening to the reply I am giving.  I have said repeatedly that until such time as we know in detail the extent, location and direction of the spend of the £8,000 million we cannot give the kind of figures which the House is seeking.  Of course we accept the thrust and the analysis that has been prepared by FÁS but it was prepared before the details of the spending of the national plan were set out. Therefore, it would be misleading for me to give opinions or projections to the House at this point.  That information will be available within a short period and when it is available I will make it known to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 19, 20, 30, 48, 59, 69, 72, 74, 108 and 109 together.</P>
      <P>The Department's science and technology budget for 1993 is £43.88 million as compared with an outturn of £27.84 million last year.  This is an increase of 58 per cent in one year.  The 1993 provision includes £23.42 million for a new scheme to assist companies to undertake R &amp; D projects.  Because there is no requirement for matching Exchequer funds, this amount does not appear in the Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1387" /> To enable this scheme to get under way in 1993 we had to re-deploy funds as between different science and technology programmes.  Our priority, in line with Culliton, was to be more focused in applied rather than strategic research. The strategic research budget was reduced by £264,000.</P>
    <P>The Culliton report says that the focus of S &amp; T policy must be on the application of technologies which will help Irish firms to develop new products and improve the competitiveness and quality of existing products.  I would like to assure the House that the Government fully accepts the Culliton view that technological competence is one of the main keys to competitive advantage.  As a corollary of this, I would expect to see a significant increase in the funding for worthwhile science and technology projects under the next operational programme for industry starting in 1994.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a number of research projects have been stopped in their tracks as a result of a change in policy?  Will the Minister explain how his Department's Estimate shows almost 25 per cent cut in State spending on science and technology?  Is it the case that as the EC is willing to offer money the Government cuts back and, therefore, instead of additionality in the area of research and development there is a pruning of the budget by Government in an area which we should be developing?  After all research and development is the seed potato of tomorrow.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that the Government has taken the opportunity of the EC agreeing to a measure, where private money could take the place of EC money, to cut State spending by £6 million?  Therefore, there is a reduction in funding of 25 per cent in the most crucial area for future development of Irish employment opportunities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">

      <P>Does the Minister realise that Mr. Delors, President of the Commission yesterday published figures to the effect that 3 per cent investment is required in research and development? At present Ireland is meeting a dismal target of 0.5 per cent, less than one-sixth of that proposed by President Delors, yet the Minister is proposing to cut State spending by 25 per cent.</P>

Does he accept that the real message given to our foreign competitors is that we will provide the technological manpower for their industries in the form of our young technically trained emigrants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have technically trained students and personnel of whom we are very proud.  I do not accept that overall science and technology spending has been reduced.  The Community has provided a special £23 million budget this year which enabled spending to increase from £27 million to £43 million and that money is going to universities and companies. There is a full commitment to the development of science and technology because, as the Deputy said and was pointed out by Mr. Delors, industrial growth will depend on excellence in that area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The operational regions established by IDA and FÁS pre-dated the setting up of regional structures for Structural Funds purposes.  IDA regions coincided with those of the former planning regions while those of FÁS were designed to try to match population needs while respecting county boundaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1391" /> In two instances the subregional structures of IDA and FÁS coincide with the subregional structures adopted for EC Structural Funds purposes while the SFADCo mid-west region matches the mid-west Structural Funds region.  In respect of the remaining sub-regions used for Structural Funds programmes there are some minor variations from the operational regions adopted by FÁS and IDA.  However, administrative arrangements are in place to ensure that, where appropriate, relevant managers from both IDA and FÁS, as well as officials from the Department of Enterprise and Employment, attend meetings and provide inputs to the deliberations and work of the various sub-regional groups.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree it is ludicrous that three different regional boundaries operate within one Department and that it is impossible to evaluate programmes where the basic data are collected on that basis?  We have data on certain regions but different administrations are used for other regions.  Will the Minister agree that in those circumstances it is difficult to know what is happening?  Does he agree there is a need to establish one set of regions that will apply uniformly throughout the country?</P>

      <P>My Department which is just six months in operation, inherited different boundaries from various Departments.  The establishment of Forbairt, the industrial indigenous agency, a branch of the IDA, will enable us to avail of the opportunity to harmonise if not to integrate fully the regions operated by FÁS and the IDA in the past as well as the structural regions to which the Deputy referred.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Government recently agreed on a regional structure which will be county based.  It is our intention to harmonise, in so far as possible, in line with the recommendations of the Barrington report which was drawn up with reference to local government boundaries in the mid-seventies, to get <Col N="1392" /> some degree of rationality and comparability and to avail of the opportunities to which the Deputy referred.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department, in conjunction with the IDA and FÁS intend to have a single integrated set of regions. That will require a certain degree of study because of regions drawn up by FÁS related for the first time to population demand as distinct from geographical spread of territory.  We have to see if we can reconcile the regions, not for the purposes of having bureaucratic neatness but to ensure that the service to the citizen is of the highest order.</P>

      <P>The EC Fourth Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development has been discussed at a number of meetings over the past 12 months, including meetings of the Council of Ministers, CREST, the Committee for Scientific and Technological Research, the Council Research Group and COREPER.  Ireland has been represented at all these meetings. There have also been a number of bilateral meetings with Commission officials.</P>
      <P>The most recent meeting of the Council of Research Ministers took place on 29 April, 1993 and the next Council is on 30 June 1993.  These are part of the ongoing process of consultation, exchange and refinement which will culminate eventually in a new framework programme.  However, negotiations are, by definition, slow and protracted by virtue of the all-embracing nature of the framework programme, the complexity of the issues involved and the diversity of national interests.</P>
      <P>The process is further complicated on this occasion by the fact that it is subject to new procedures set out in the Maastricht Treaty which has not yet been ratified by all member states.  In view of this, it is possible that agreement on the programme will not be arrived at until later this year or even early 1994.</P>

If there were I would have made it my business to deal with them.  This was a routine meeting which dealt with a number of routine matters.  My information is that not all countries were represented by Ministers. This is routine.  We have submitted detailed views on this programme and it will be the end of this year, if not the beginning of 1994, before we are in a position even to consider formal proposals.

As I indicated in the answer given to Parliamentary Question No. 70 of 16 June 1993, I am concerned at the adverse impact which the present level of liability and motor insurance costs has on the business environment.  The Government is considering means of reducing some elements of personal injury compensation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>While all of us appreciate the high cost of motor insurance, particularly for young people, would the Minister of State comment on the inter-ministerial review which targeted certain safety aspects which might be considered, particularly suggestions by the Insurance Industry Federation that their members would be sympathetic if they felt there was more rigorous enforcement of safety standards?  While appreciating the contribution the Insurance Industry Federation has made &mdash; in excess of £2 million &mdash; towards safety, would the Minister of State comment on that aspect?  In concentrating on capping as what appears to be an obvious target in relation to high personal injuries the Minister may not necessarily be analysing the overall problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of factors which contribute to high insurance costs.  The Deputy is quite right that safety is a major one.  A number of measures have been taken arising from recommendations of the inter-ministerial group.  For example, there has been stricter enforcement in the drink-driving area; more cases have been moved to the Circuit Court with a consequent saving on some legal fees.  In regard to that area in general the abolition of juries and the employment of fewer senior counsel are measures which have been taken, although I personally remain to be convinced of their effectiveness.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister accept that part of the problem is the current litigation climate, which is added to very considerably if one looks at something like, say, the <i>Golden Pages</i> carrying full-page advertisements by solicitors specialising in what they term &ldquo;slip and fall&rdquo; cases which I would describe as &ldquo;dive and sue&rdquo; cases?  Would the Minister consider it is time to question whether competitive advertising for compensation in such circumstances is not undesirable?  In cases where people are awarded huge sums of money, would it not be better to establish a trust fund so that damages awarded in those circumstances would revert to insurance companies rather than devolve on the relatives of the plaintiff should the plaintiff die?  Would it not be sensible to introduce a measure to prohibit courts from awarding damages to plaintiffs where any part of the plaintiff's claim is made dishonestly? I have seen many cases where the plaintiff may run, say, three legs to his or her claim, one of which is proven to be an entire fraud; yet, as the law now stands, such people are entitled to be compensated for the two legs in respect of which they are not found to have been dishonest?</P>

They do not even provide proper legal representation for their own side but appear to drag cases on in the hope that people will eventually drop them.

Would he say also whether he is thinking, on the wider issue of quantums of damages of introducing some general guidelines on the level of settlement for different forms of injury or, alternatively, whether he is considering annuities as a possible form of settlement other than lump sums?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are possible constitutional difficulties enshrined in any proposal to cap insurance awards in the pain and suffering area.  I am at present examining those very carefully. There are divided views on that subject. In regard to the quantum guidelines, this is a very frustrating area in which small companies experience great difficulty in meeting their premiums and some people, particularly young people, having to pay more for insurance than they do for a car.  That simply cannot be allowed to continue.  If I thought a list of guidelines would automatically improve the position.  I would set about going in that direction.  I should like everybody <Col N="1401" /> involved to know that this is a serious issue which will be tackled strongly on this occasion.  For different reasons over many years, we have all played around its edges.  It is a difficult, complex area involving a lot of personal suffering.  We simply must mean business this time.  If I thought the quantum guidelines would work I would gladly travel that road but I am not personally convinced it would make much of a difference.</P>

      <P>I should mention, however, that the Second Commission on the Status of Women has made a number of recommendations on measures to increase flexibility in working life.  The Deputy will be aware that I have set up a working group to advise and assist in implementing those recommendations which come within the responsibility of the Department of Enterprise and Employment.

I welcome the fact that job-sharing has been introduced in the teaching profession in particular but I have received some complaints that the spirit of the recommendation may not be met, given that teachers may be asked to take one class before lunch and one in the afternoon which will not suit anybody.

This Department was one of the first to take the commission's recommendations on board and to seek to bring forward a programme.  I hope the working group will report in about one month.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The publication <i>Employment Through Enterprise</i> sets out clearly what the Government had decided to do on the whole range of Culliton recommendations, i.e. to implement almost every one.</P>
      <P>The agenda for change is not an easy one as those who may stand to lose from a proposed change can identify their potential loss better than those who stand to gain can foresee the potential for gain. It is not, therefore, surprising that there should be some criticism of the decisions to act on the agenda for change.  That has happened, for example, in respect of the recent rebalancing of telephone charges. It has also occurred in connection with the reform of the agencies, taxation, education and other issues dealt with by the Culliton and Moriarty Groups.</P>
      <P>As announced, the Government will implement tax reform to broaden the tax base; to reduce the incidence of tax on the low paid and on those approaching the average industrial wage; to bring about closer co-ordination of the tax and social welfare systems; and to simplify the tax code.  That reform will be along the lines recommended.  However, it has not been and will not become the practice to state now what Ministers for Finance will do in the next or in subsequent budgets. A great deal of progress has been made already in eliminating tax shelters and reliefs, as recommended by Culliton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, the reform of the State industrial development and promotional agencies is being introduced to ensure that the required attention is given to the development needs of indigenous industry. That task is very different from that of attracting foreign investment, as I am <Col N="1406" /> sure the Deputy will acknowledge.  The present arrangements have not been particularly successful in this area and the need for change was clear to all impartial analysis.</P>
    <P>It is for these reasons that the agency structure decided on by Government and for which I am responsible will provide for one agency for promoting inward investment and another for promoting the development of indigenous industry. Local initiative for small business will be further facilitated through the country enterprise board structure.</P>
    <P>The implementation of policy and the co-ordination of all agency actions including overseas marketing, will be overseen by a policy advisory board, FORFAS.  This is in line with the Culliton recommendation that a forum distinct from the executive agencies should be established, to advise my Department on policy.  It will include a number of business people of experience and authority.</P>
    <P>A Bill providing for the establishment of a new structure of industrial development agencies is currently before the Oireachtas.  It will be in line with the target date set by the Moriarty Task Force for enactment of the legislation by July next.  I would hope that both Houses of the Oireachtas will be able to pass all stages so as to meet the target date for enactment recommended by Moriarty.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will gather, I do not accept his reference to widespread criticism. In fact, there was widespread support for the new Government's speedy and comprehensive response to the recommendations of the Industrial Policy Review Group and those of the Moriarty Task Force.  In particular, the Irish Business and Employers Confederation and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions were positive in welcoming the Government's decisions.</P>
    <P>We have set out a practical and detailed time-table for the implementation of the vast majority of the recommendations made and it will be possible for the Deputy and anyone else to measure progress against the commitments that have been set.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  One of his own backbenchers would not have put down such a timely question; I will have to talk to my collegue about how this happened.  Is the Minister not searching for a silver lining in this cloud?  Was there not widespread criticism right across the spectrum of opinion and did the Minister not have time to pause on the question of whether he should plough ahead with various aspects of what is contained in the document? In relation to the Bill to which he adverted, which will be introduced in the House tomorrow, does he agree that it will lead unnecessarily to the creation of excessive bureaucracy whereby we will have new boards, chief executives, headquarters and offices&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>While I wish to reply to the Deputy's questions I do not wish to anticipate the debate that will take place tomorrow.  Let me say succinctly that the thrust of the Culliton report and, subsequently, the Moriarty task force report was that there should be, for the would-be industrialist or a small enterprise wishing to expand, clarity and a lack of confusion as to how they should approach the State for assistance and support, be it in marketing, industrial promotion, product development or research in technology. Having regard to the overall thrust of the recommendations by the Culliton and Moriarty groups and the Programme for Government, I am convinced &mdash; this is a considered response; we will have time tomorrow or during the Committee Stage debate on Thursday to elaborate on this matter &mdash; the structures in place are the best possible ones for dealing with the problems which confront us at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the basic appeal by Culliton was to simplify the system of industrial support? <Col N="1408" /> Does he agree that what we have done is replace one ministerial responsibility with two ministerial responsibilities? Instead of having two industrial agencies, as recommended, we will have three agencies doing the work previously carried out by one agency while the other agencies continue to operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that.  The benefit of the Culliton report was particularly acute where the group spoke on matters on which they were very knowledgeable and for which they were renowned both nationally and internationally. In my considered view, the group was less wise and less authorative when it spoke about some of the matters pertaining to Government, particularly the agency structures.  So far as the individual industrialist or would-be entrepreneur is concerned, following the restructuring of the agencies, as proposed in the Bill which will be taken tomorrow, there will be a dramatic improvement in clarity from the point of view of service and the delivery of support and assistance to those people than previously.  This was the primary thrust of both the Culliton report and that of the Moriarty task force.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the timetable referred to in the question pre-supposed that this House would have adequate time to consider the legislation?  Will he further agree that it is a bit much in the dying days of the Dáil session to introduce a Bill of such complexity when the Joint Committee on Employment was, as we were told, set up to consider such matters?  The Minister of State, Deputy Brennan, referred earlier to company examinerships.  This system, which was introduced as an emergency measure is, even though it was later amended, now showing some defects. Will the Minister agree that such a major Bill, which proposes to put in place the strategy for our employment assistance for the next decade, should be given more than a few hours consideration in this House?  It is a disgrace that the timetable <Col N="1409" /> is being adhered to by simply wiping out the legislative process itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is doing himself a disservice and is doing both Houses of the Oireachtas a considerable disservice by suggesting that a Bill of 21 sections and two Schedules is not capable of being debated during the proposed timetable, particularly as the thrust of this Bill has long since been published and there has been a debate on the Culliton report in the other House.  As no doubt the Deputy is aware, the Bill will provide a mechanism whereby a very orderly re-arrangement of existing agency structures can be brought into place without disrupting or suspending the delivery of services.  Without anticipating the debate, there are very cogent reasons as to why this Bill on agency restructuring should be passed by the House as quickly as possible, particularly, to eliminate uncertainty within the various organisations, including among the personnel, and to clarify the position on how they will function.  I would have preferred a longer committee stage debate through the relevant Oireachtas select committee but if this Bill is not enacted fairly quickly then considerable damage will be done to the various agencies in place at present.</P>

      <P>As the Minister said, we will have an opportunity tomorrow to consider whether it is wise to replace one agency with three new agencies.  Specifically on the dispute between him and the Minister for Tourism and Trade, does the Minister agree that it makes no sense to have broken the focus of the industrial effort whereby An Bord Tráchtála now reports to the Minister for Tourism and Trade rather than to his Department? Does the Minister agree that the time has come for us to require Iveagh House to consider that it is in the latter part of the 20th century, that it is primarily its task abroad, rather than whatever grandiose missions it considers it might have, to take the calls of Ireland's trade to heart, there is no necessity for a Ministry for Trade and the functions ought to be divided between him and the Minister for Foreign Affairs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand and accept much of what the Deputy said but the Department of Foreign Affairs, which carries out a substantially effective role in the area of diplomacy, has agreed, with the consent of the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, to considerably broaden and deepen its commitment to a trade dimension alongside its existing functions which it carries out with such skill.  As part of the <i>Employment Through Enterprise</i> report, accepted by Government, the Department of Foreign Affairs has agreed to changes in the promotional structures whereby for the first time since the foundation of the State persons employed in one of the domestic Government Departments can apply for promotion to vacancies which occur at first secretary, assistant principal, principal officer and consular level within the Department of Foreign Affairs.  This is <Col N="1411" /> due in part to the refocusing of some of the energies of the Department of Foreign Affairs towards the task of trade. I could give additional examples where that refocusing has been considerably encouraged by ambassadors working very closely with the relevant agencies. When the two Ministers of State and I recently visited Ambassador Small in London we saw the best conceivable co-operation between An Bord Tráchtála, the IDA, Bord Fáilte, the commercial attaché and the ambassador.  That is an example of the State getting a very effective response, with limited resources, from &mdash; I am proud to put this on the record &mdash; extremely committed Irish public servants working abroad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 63 and 71 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since its establishment under the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967, the jurisdiction of the Redundancy Appeals Tribunal, known since 1977 as the Employment Appeals Tribunal, has been widened over the years to cater for the coming on stream of the various measures of new legislation.  The tribunal now adjudicates in disputes arising under the following Acts: Redundancy Payments, since 1967; Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment, since 1973; <Col N="1412" /> Unfair Dismissals, since 1977; Maternity Protection of Employees, since 1981; Protection of Employees (Employers Insolvency), since 1984; Worker Protection (Regular Part-Time Employees, since 1991, and Payment of Wages, since 1992.</P>
    <P>However, concerns have been expressed by interested parties regarding the tribunal in respect of perceived excessive legalism in hearings and undue delays in obtaining such hearings.  I have had discussions with IBEC, ICTU and the chairman of the tribunal with a view to responding and resolving the concerns raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister hope to bring forward substantial proposals for reform in the near future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not talking about the structures of the Employment Appeals Tribunal, as these are very satisfactory, but the operation of it.  Complaints have centred on two matters.  First, there is the perceived legalism, the undue reliance on legal representation. This was allowed for under the Act but it was not envisaged that it would be used on such a wide scale and that people should think that if they have not legal representation they will somehow be at a disadvantage.  I am very anxious to dispel these perceptions because they are not in keeping with the spirit of the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  The second matter was the delay in hearings.  I have met all the parties involved and the chairman will report to me with ideas on how these shortcomings can be resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the Employment Appeals Tribunal was set up to provide for an informal speedy means of settling disputes.  However, it will be extremely difficult to turn back the tide of legalism as people want legal representation on issues that are of major concern to them?  I understand the Minister believes the procedures rather than the structures need to be reformed.  As the Employment Appeals Tribunal now <Col N="1413" /> consists of a chairman, and 11 or more vice chairmen each of whom appoints two assessors, all employed on a part-time basis, is it time to consider employing permanent personnel in order to maintain the consistency and standards people have come to expect from it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The concerns the Deputy has articulated have been among those expressed to me by bodies availing of the tribunal.  I have had meetings with IBEC, ICTU and the chairman of the tribunal, who proposes to report to me with his ideas.  It is proposed that all the bodies connected with the tribunal will come together in early September in an effort to resolve the difficulties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>

Would she consider, even at this stage, taking on board amendments that would provide for the improvements she is talking about?  I invite her to outline her well considered opinions &mdash; which I had the privilege of hearing on a previous occasion &mdash; on the fact that the Employment Appeals Tribunal is now the preserve, almost exclusively, of lawyers.

      <P>I am sure the Deputy is not &mdash; this is far from his mind.  The Deputy asked whether the Unfair Dismissals (Amendment) Bill, which we will deal with today is the vehicle to reform the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  I have started the process of talking with the constituent bodies of the Employment Appeals Tribunal and I would prefer to continue on that path.  I hope to reach fruitful conclusions.</P>
      <P>During the Second Stage debate on the Unfair Dismissals (Amendment) Bill I expressed my unhappiness both here and in the Seanad at the ever-increasing use of legal advocates by employers and employees at the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  While the original legislation in 1977 allowed for such representation it was never envisaged that it would be used with ever-increasing frequency.  The spirit of that legislation was that complaints could be heard in an informal but correct atmosphere.  As the Deputy said, that has practically stopped and there is a growing perception that unless one is represented by the legal profession &mdash; and this costs a great deal &mdash; one will not get one's due redress.  This was not the spirit of the Act.  I am trying to resolve this, but I am not clear on how to achieve this.  I intend to continue the talks with all of the bodies and I hope we will reach a fruitful conclusion.</P>

Is it any surprise that an employee will think that he is better off if he has legal representation when he is told that the second part of his case will be heard in five months time?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 26 together.</P>
      <P>My Department's Triennial Review of Industrial Performance 1990 provided that 50 per cent of all financial supports to medium-large indigenous industry be in the form of equity or other repayable or remunerating forms of aid by the end of 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1416" /> I am informed by the IDA, the main industrial development agency for which I have responsibility, that, based on those supports that rank as repayable, a repayability level of 40.56 per cent was achieved by the authority in 1992.  The authority has set a target of 50 per cent repayability for 1993.  SFADCo, the other industrial development agency under my aegis to which this issue relates, is also making significant progress in this area.</P>
    <P>The Culliton proposal for a decisive shift from grants to equity has been the subject of detailed examination by my Department and the Moriarty task force. As the Deputy may be aware the Government, in the context of the recent announcement on Culliton, has accepted the recommendations of the task force in this area.  Full details of these recommendations were published on 3 May in the Government's response to the Moriarty task force on the implementation of the Culliton report.  In essence it was decided that the shift from grants towards equity &mdash; mainly preference shares &mdash; and their repayable forms of finance will continue.</P>
    <P>While the level of equity stakes held by IDA and SFADCo, and the number of companies in which they have invested by way of equity, have increased substantially over the past six years, the intention would be to continue improving on the equity-repayability levels currently being achieved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Moriarty report indicated that the proportion of equity from the IDA budget was not 50 per cent, as he suggested, but 6 per cent?  Is he aware that that is endorsed by the figures provided in the Appendix to their report which shows not only that that is the proportion but that equity is in decline as a proportion of IDA money going to this sector?  Would he not agree that a 6 per cent is far from a decisive shift to equity as recommended by Culliton?  Should we not rethink our policy in this area?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The information I have <Col N="1417" /> received seems to be at variance with the statement made by the Deputy.  I will repeat again that I am informed by the IDA, the main industrial development agency for which I have responsibility, that, based on those supports that rank as repayable a repayability level of 40.56 per cent was achieved by the authority in 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of this is taking the form of preference shares.  The total amount of repayability, including some level of grant, would be as set out in the figures.  Not all the recipients to whom we have made financial grants and packages want to give preference shares and what has been sought is some form of repayability, of which equity-preference shares would be the preferable option.  The critical fact in terms of value for money is the degree of repayability that can be utilised by the IDA instead of grants which once given can never be repaid, as was the case in the past.  It was the thrust of the original criticism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton has put his finger on a very important point and the Minister appears to be taken in by the conventional wisdom and by the IDA's sell on the matter.  If I recall correctly, the table appended to the Moriarty report indicates that the amount last year was £9.58 million.  It is a very small proportion and does not provide for the fact that NADCORP was absorbed by the IDA.  One would have expected that it would have increased by an amount comparable with that lost by NADCORP. Does the Minister agree that it is harmful that a new conventional wisdom has grown up that there has been a radical shift towards equity participation in these companies when in fact that the show and the Government's own figures &mdash; as endorsed in the Moriarty report &mdash; that it is a very small and declining proportion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quoting from the triennial review of industrial performance <Col N="1418" /> of the former Department of Industry and Commerce which recommended that by the end of 1993, 50 per cent of all financial supports, in the firms to which Deputies have referred, should be in the form of equity or other repayable or remunerating forms of aid.  What both Deputies are saying is that in line with the Culliton recommendation that the balance between equity as distinct from either preference shares or repayable loans should be increased.  I am prepared to have a look at that on the understanding that any change in the composition of the financial package would not, in the short term, adversely affect our ability to attract otherwise highly mobile development.  The balance has to be struck.  Moneys given to attract investment should be in a form that is repayable at some stage in the future, in the form of preference shares or ideally in the form of equity that would have prospects for growth with the growth of the company.</P>

      <P>What is the Minister's view on the Culliton recommendation that the State could be much more effective in supporting indigenous industry by taking equity shares?  In some cases he recommended up to 60 per cent equity. Would the Minister accept that a more aggressive venture capitalist role for the IDA is the correct one?  Does he support the recommendations of Culliton for a separate seed capital division and that there should be board representation by the IDA on the boards of some of the companies?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing we have to do is implement the main thrust of the agency's restructuring proposals and give to Forbairt &mdash; the agency responsible for developing indigenous agencies &mdash; its own focus.  I would envisage that the real need for seed capital and specifically for venture capital would be among the first items to be addressed by that body. Deputy Rabbitte will recall that that matter was referred to by virtually every person who came to testify and to give information to the Joint Committee on <Col N="1419" /> Employment.  At this stage I do not wish to prescribe the size and form of that body.  I would prefer to be flexible so as to maximise the take up in relation to financial support from various companies. On occasions when small businesses have approached me &mdash; one, two or three people &mdash; seeking financial support, they specifically ruled out equity in any shape or form and in other cases would only contemplate a comparatively small percentage of equity because they wish to retain control of the company. They certainly would not be prepared to be in a minority position of 40 per cent as the Deputy has suggested.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister undertake to write to the Opposition spokes-persons on the net point raised?  It seems the Minister was under the impression <Col N="1420" /> that the 50 per cent target for equity participation and total repayabilities was arrived at gradually over recent years.  In effect only 6 per cent equity has been achieved to date and consequently the gulf is enormous.  If our interpretation of the figures is correct &mdash; it is something that warrants study &mdash; I would ask the Minister to communicate with us on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to respond to both the Deputies' queries on this matter. I share their concern and I think their analysis, by and large, correct.  The figures are misleading when you take into account the extent of mobile investment which has come into this country.  Many of the recipients did not wish to offer equity participation to the IDA as part of the package having regard to the alternatives they would have had in other countries.  Much domestic industry, given the opportunity, would take equity under certain key conditions.  It would be my intention that the new agency, Forbairt, would address the major problem of the availability of either seed capital and venture capital or a combination of both.  If it is to be in the form of equity in the diverse forms that equity can take, then we will certainly examine it.  As soon as I can I will reply to both Deputies as requested.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Whips have agreed to this ordering of business.  I do not know what item Deputy O'Malley is referring to but the House and the committees are sitting longer hours than normal to try to complete the business before the end of the session.

I wish that all Whips would realise, as she does, that one cannot put through important business of this kind in this way and that it is making this House totally irrelevant.  We can find time to debate all these matters but a most serious event is happening in relation to Aer Lingus and this House can find no time to debate it.  Even a committee of this House which was delegated to debate it is unable to do so because the witnesses from the company concerned refuse to turn up and thumb their noses at the committee and at this House.

On the schedule of business before us for this week we are only allowing 55 minutes for the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill, for instance, which includes a range of new offences, penalties and fines.  That is a grossly inadequate time to debate an important new measure like this.  I am raising this matter so that the Minister, on behalf of the Taoiseach, may review the way in which business is being dealt with this week and next week.

On asking which committee would deal with it I was told it would be the Select Committee on Social Affairs. We were all very happy with that.  On Friday morning I was told that it was to be tabled for this evening so, in contrast to having a reasonable and leisurely opportunity to consider it in detail, we are confined to whatever is left after these shenanigans until 7 p.m. and an hour for Report Stage later in the week.

      <P>There is a problem concerning item No. 10, in that it relates to the Vote which incorporates Aer Lingus.  All Members of the House should have the same information on this subject but it has emerged during the past few days that Government Deputies got privileged access to information on the matter.  We have documentary evidence to that effect in a letter from the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications. Furthermore, it has been suggested that the Chairman of Aer Lingus is prepared to talk personally to a Government Deputy, who happens to be chairman of a committee, and not to the committee.  In fact, the Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies, has been denied the opportunity of examining Aer Lingus on this issue.</P>

This material was sent only to Government backbenchers. It was not sent to all Deputies. I believe that is a breach of privilege. One of the basic elements of privilege in this House is that all Members be treated equally.  Neither the Government nor Aer Lingus have any right to give information on a privileged basis to one side of the House only.</P>

      <P>Items Nos. 7 to 10, inclusive, relate to four different committees which will sit to deal with Estimates and nothing else.  Many Bills on the Order Paper for this week and next require proper debate.  Many of these are quite important and could be dealt with by these special committees but that will not be allowed.  It is regrettable that the only business given to these committees is the consideration of Estimates.  No real improvement has taken place as a result of the setting up of these committees and their future should be reconsidered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1551" /> I tabled a question on this matter to the Taoiseach today and it has been disallowed on the grounds that it is a matter for the House, rather than the Taoiseach, to consider what the committees should do.  I believe the overwhelming view of the House would be &mdash; if it could be freely expressed &mdash; that the committees are a waste of time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I totally reject the view expressed by the Deputy.  It was agreed that the main priority of the committees for this session would be the Estimates. Normally at this time of the year the Estimates would be taken late at night or on a Friday in this Chamber.  The whole format of the Estimates has now changed.  They are much longer, too. Last week, both in the Seanad, where the Estimates for the Department of Finance and for the Office of Public Works were taken, and in the Dáil where the Department of Foreign Affairs Estimates were taken, we had very successful debates.  It has been made clear also that during the summer recess legislation will be dealt with by the committees so they seem to be working successfully.  The number of hours given to debates has been vastly extended and there is agreement also among the Whips that the workings of the committees be reviewed during the summer recess.  To reject the concept of the committees before we get into a full session would seem very unreasonable.</P>

      <P>Deputy Bruton has raised an extremely important matter here in relation to item No. 10.  Before <Col N="1552" /> we agree to this business, can we take it that all Deputies will be given exactly the same information and correspondence that all Government backbench Deputies are receiving?  I do not intend to agree to item No. 10 unless we are given such a commitment.  Does the Minister propose to ensure that there will be a full debate in this House on the question of Aer Lingus following the Government's meeting with Aer Lingus staff today and with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions?</P>

      <P>I wish to clarify that I have a letter from the Minister to the committee chairman in which it is stated that briefing material which had been sent already to Oireachtas Members was being enclosed.  Fine Gael Deputies have not received that information but I presume Fianna Fáil and Labour Deputies have received it.  Therefore, Deputies are not being treated equally in terms of access to information.  I would be grateful if the Minister would look into that matter.  As reference has been made to committees, in the view of my party, committees would work well if Deputies would attend.  There has been an opportunity in committees for Minister to be questioned, a practice which did not exist previously.</P>

      <P>I understand that legislation has been considered by the government in relation to the powers of committees, not just recently established committees but longer standing committees such as the Committee of Public Accounts and the Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies.  It was considered in the past in a Bill, but subsequently withdrawn from that Bill, that committees should have enforceable power to send for persons and papers and that in the event of refusal by a person summoned as a witness by the committee to attend, the committee would have power to have that person brought before it.  The Chairman and the Chief Executive of Aer Lingus have refused the request of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies to appear before it &mdash; the Chairman has done so in a way that is totally unacceptable to the committee.  May I ask the Minister for Finance whether the Government will, in these circumstances, <Col N="1555" /> introduce legislation urgently to enable that committee and other such committees to compel people they wish to interview to appear before them?</P>

Could it be conveyed by the Government to the Chairman and the Chief Executive of Aer Lingus that since this will be law in some months' time, they should observe the spirit of what is about to be law and attend the committee to be examined before it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.&mdash;Where a respondent to a claim for redress under the Unfair Dismissals Acts disputes that the claimant was an employee of the respondent, it shall be conclusive proof that the claimant was an employee of the respondent if it is shown to the satisfaction of the Tribunal that the respondent was responsible at law for deduction of the tax and social insurance contributions of the claimant.&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is to try to dispel some of the confusion that exists in regard to what constitutes an employee following the tests applied by the judges in the case law we have in this area.  These tests have &ldquo;splintered in the hands of the judges&rdquo;. I am seeking to ensure in as far as possible that an employee is covered under the Act.  I am taking the guideline of the rights under the tax and social welfare Acts so that the test is whether the respondent is responsible at law for deduction of tax and social insurance contributions from the claimant.  I deliberately <Col N="1559" /> use the term &ldquo;responsible at law&rdquo;; otherwise there could also be some confusion about that because the employer may not actually be making those deductions. The test ought to be whether he is responsible at law for so doing.  I am seeking to cater on a statutory basis for the case where the person concerned may be deemed to be a contractor or a subcontractor.</P>
    <P>The situation is not conclusive at the moment.  I am aware of contracts being devised expressly for the purpose of circumventing the terms of the Unfair Dismissals Act, where it is included as an express condition of those contracts that the terms of the Unfair Dismissals Act do not apply.  I presume these contracts are the result of professional advice and their stated purpose is to avoid coming under the terms of this Act.</P>
    <P>The Minister may respond that this is already provided for, but in my experience and from the advice I have received from colleagues in the trade union movement it is acknowledged that in order to bring a valid claim under the Act claimants must be able to establish that they are employees for the purpose of the Act. An employee can be straightforwardly defined as someone who has entered into a contract of employment or a contract of service, but the Act defines a contract of employment as a contract of service or of apprenticeship whether it is express or implied and, if it is express, whether it is oral or in writing.  Where the claimant's status as an employee is in dispute the burden of proving that status lies with the claimant.</P>
    <P>The tests which are applied by the Employment Appeals Tribunal to establish the status of the claimant are based on the general legal rules developed by the courts to distinguish between employees and independent contractors under contract for services.  It is difficult to fashion a useful general statement which would distinguish between employees and independent contractors. The courts in essence are attempting to determine whether the worker is working for himself or for someone else.  In the <Col N="1560" /> Ó Coindealbhain <i>v.</i> Mooney judgment, delivered on 21 April 1988, the High Court, for example, considered the issue in the context of a case involving a dispute over income tax liability.  In deciding that the respondent was not an employee &ldquo;Blayney J&rdquo;, having reviewed the authorities, based his decision on the fact that certain features of the contract were inconsistent with its being one of service. There is confusion and a dispute about it.  The old employer-employee relationship is breaking down and has fragmented in many different ways.  As a result there can be confusion and the person who considered that he had this resort in the final instance could find when it is too late that he does not have it.  The third edition of <i>The Worker and the Law</i> said:</P>
    <P>The reader who examines these authorities may end up agreeing with Lord Wedderburn when he wrote that &ldquo;the legal `tests' have splintered in the hands of the judges, leaving them to say that it is `not practicable to lay down precise tests' or a `hard and fast list', that there are `too many variants' so `you look at the whole picture'.  Most Courts now appear to use the `elephant test' for the employee &mdash; an animal too difficult to define but easy to recognise when you see it&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>Will the Minister acknowledge that it is a fact of the structure of the workforce now that many people are employed as contractors and subcontractors, independent in the sense that they do not fall under the old definition of a contract of service, and that it is important that these people are given the protection of the Act?</P>
    <P>Recently in my constituency 22 employees were let go because the company had gone into liquidation.  It sprung up again under a different guise, showing that the Phoenix syndrome is still alive, and 19 of the 22 original employees have been given the option to return to work for the same employer doing essentially the same work, but this time under a contract which expressly provides that <Col N="1561" /> they will not have the protection of the Unfair Dismissals Act.</P>

      <P>I support the general point being made.  My amendment No. 3 simply recommends that in this case the Department of Social Welfare should be the deciding body.  Concern in relation to practices in this area were expressed to me in discussions with the unions.  There is a need for greater clarity and the procedures need to be tightened up.  Deputy Rabbitte suggests that we should have regard to the tax and social insurance contributions of the claimant.  Certainly the social insurance record and the nature of the contributions made would be highly relevant.  Our two proposals overlap to a degree.  Both acknowledge that there is a problem.  Some employers will always seek to get around every protection for employees, but if we can strengthen the employees' protection and clarify the issues it would be a good thing. Those representing workers have issued a clear message that greater clarification is essential and that an amendment along the lines proposed by either Deputy Rabbitte or me may be required.  I do not think this was an issue discussed at great length on Committee Stage in the Seanad.  Perhaps the Minister may have had time to consider it and would indicate her willingness to take on board one or other of these amendments.</P>

      <P>The one worry I would have about Deputy Rabbitte's amendment is that it might extend employment status to people, such as directors of limited liability companies in respect of whom at present PAYE and PRSI obligations are extended by the law.  I would not like to give directors employment status.  I would ask the Minister to consider between now and Report Stage something along the lines of what Deputy Rabbitte proposes, some simple test to determine whether one is in or out.  My overall worry is that employment status should not be conferred on directors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the reasoning behind Deputy Rabbitte's amendment and that in the name of Deputy Flaherty.  Sometimes it is quite difficult to determine a person's eligibility to bring a claim of unfair dismissal.  In such instances, where there is that complexity, the Rights Commissioner or the Employment Appeals Tribunal explore all of the circumstances of the employment relationship before deciding on the identity of the various parties and on the claimant's entitlement. The amendment tabled by Deputy Rabbitte would direct the tribunal to reach a particular decision without allowing it the necessary flexibility to explore all of the circumstances of a particular employment relationship.  I am sure many Members would agree with me that the tribunal has the necessary knowledge and expertise to decide such matters and that to tie their hands &mdash; which would be the effect of Deputy Rabbitte's proposal &mdash; would be unnecessary and perhaps hinder their work.  I accept Deputy Rabbitte's motive in tabling his amendment and its worthiness but I think such matters are best left with the adjudicative body established under the 1977 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I had expected a more considered and detailed statement either of rebuttal or acceptance by the Minister. She acknowledges that it is a serious point.  The old master/servant relationship, as it was defined in law, is fast becoming the exception.  There is a proliferation of contract employment under one guise or another.  If I understood the Minister's reply correctly, other than conceding that it is indeed a phenomenon in the modern workforce, her argument for refusing to take my amendment on board is based on the desirability of the tribunal maintaining flexibility.  I wonder whether that is a principle to which we can all subscribe.  The Minister, like Deputy McDowell and I, has been in the House since the commencement of Question Time, when there was a question <Col N="1563" /> on the efficacy of the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is working.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It is working.  I do not mean any pejorative connotation in saying that, but it is a matter of the efficiency with which it conducts its business. What we are seeking is certainty rather than flexibility so that the tribunal is directed by the law on what is the position and there is certainty about whether one falls within the protection of the provisions of the Act or one does not.  I quoted some authorities to bear out the acknowledgment by academic lawyers that the tests had splintered in the hands of judges, so that certainty does not obtain at present.  When one couples that with the fact that this kind of subcontract employment is proliferating, it is desirable that there should be certainty.  The Minister may be unhappy with my drafting and might prefer to see her Department redraft it in a fashion that is acceptable to her. Perhaps she might provide for the point Deputy Michael McDowell raised.  I agree that directors of private limited companies were not envisaged to be the subject or purpose of the amendment.  I have no particular wish to proclaim the paternity of this amendment if there is some more agreeable form open to the Minister, but the point is an important one.  The fact that the trade unions are not making a big fuss about this is neither here nor there.  It only bears out the point that trade unions, of their very nature, represent people who are in traditional employment.  The most vulnerable category of worker I seek to encompass in this amendment by and large do not have the protection of trade unions.  The trade unions have not managed to organise this category of contract labour.  These workers are more in need of that protection than members of a trade union who can vindicate their rights in the first instance through their union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the wording of my amendment is in any way disagreeable to the Minister, I <Col N="1564" /> would ask that she consider taking it for Report Stage, enshrining the protections which I and Deputy Flaherty seek.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>We may discover a certain breakthrough on that but, to an extent, it is encompassed within Deputy Rabbitte's amendment No. 1 because my amendment No. 3 simply suggests the Department of Social Welfare whereas the other refers to both the welfare and income tax regimes being involved in any decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister suggests that allowing flexibility to the tribunal would afford greater protection to workers.  If we were absolutely satisfied with that I would withdraw my amendment.  Even though I am pessimistic about reducing the legalism that has already entered into the determinations of the Employment Appeals Tribunal, certainly an area such as this is fertile territory for legal argument, for clever lawyers being recruited by employers to argue every possible escape route.  If the definition of &ldquo;employee&rdquo; is causing problems with non-traditional forms of employment becoming much more common, then the Minister must have some case law or evidence from the proceedings of the Employment Appeals Tribunal which would suggest that factors other than those being recommended by me and Deputy Rabbitte would somehow afford greater protection or, in some instance, would allow a person be designated as an employee whereas these definitions would not.  If the Minister can prove that to me I will happily withdraw my amendment. his former colleagues in the trade union movement because it was ICTU that raised this point at my meeting with them as an amendment they would very much like to see.  They consider it would answer <Col N="1565" /> a problem which is becoming more common within the context of cases being decided by the tribunal.  Therefore, I urge the Minister of State to think about the matter again, if not today, before Report Stage, to see if she could be more flexible and accept an amendment along these lines.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>In arguing that there is a need for certainty, Deputy Rabbitte quoted eminent legal opinion, but as soon as a law is made there is uncertainty. I am not a lawyer but common sense tells me that there is no certainty in law no matter how eminent the people who administer it are.  We discussed this matter in great detail last night in the Department and I am of the opinion that the best way to meet the concerns expressed here is to allow the tribunal to send for documents and obtain information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>In looking at the terminology used in Deputy Rabbitte's amendment it occurred to me that one group of people who sometimes have great difficulty in relation to the Ombudsman are the teachers, who seem to be employed by a group of people who do not have anything to do with their salaries in terms of day-to-day deductions.  The Department of Education is responsible for this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the law as it <Col N="1566" /> stands there is flexibility, about which I have spoken.  Yesterday evening and last night we discussed the question of whether in the context of the Employment Appeals Tribunal there was any case law which would bear witness to the import of the amendment put forward by Deputy Rabbitte but we were not able to ascertain this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a good deal of legal comment which shows that there is a lack of certainty.  That is the point I am making.  Therefore, one can quote case law to support either view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>One can quote case law to support either argument, but it seems that it would be desirable to ensure certainty in the law.  I would amend my words, in view of what the Minister of State has said, to say that, as I understand it, the purpose of making laws is to strive for certainty.  We may not always achieve this but we strive for it.  This is a good example of where we should try to achieve it.  I am disappointed that the Minister of State has not agreed to look at the matter again before Report Stage to see if there is a formula of words which would make it acceptable to her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure what Deputy McDowell's point is.  It seems that if the taxpayer is paying the teachers through the Department of Education it is probably correct that they are the employees of the Department of Education, but I take the point that the amendment should include <Col N="1567" /> the words &ldquo;for the purposes of this Act&rdquo;. I am not claiming precision for the amendment but I am trying to highlight a problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>In legislation we strive for certainty so far as we can.  The point I was trying to make was that judgments in whatever form do not often bear out what one tried to do in legislation.  I am sure the Deputy would agree with me on that point.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a) the insertion of the following after `contract of employment' in the definition of `employee': `and includes agency workers or fixed term contract workers&rdquo;'.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was put to me, and it seems to be a reasonable point, that one of the main purposes of this Bill was to provide protection in law for categories of workers which have been excluded to date from the definition of employee by virtue of the fact that they are on fixed term contracts <Col N="1568" /> or agency workers.  It is important that they should be included.  The Minister's intention in relation to this group is clear.  It is a question of ensuring at this early stage that it is stated precisely that they are included.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for tabling this amendment.  Having referred to my own amendment, perhaps Deputy Flaherty will see that we have the one objective.  Section 13 of the Unfair Dismissals (Amendment) Bill, 1993, as originally drafted, which was passed by the Seanad recently and debated here on Second Stage about two weeks ago, extended the scope of the unfair dismissals legislation to include persons employed through employment agencies. For the purposes of the legislation the party hiring the individual from the employment agency was deemed to be the employer.</P>
      <P>This provision was drafted so that the extension of the protection of the 1977 Unfair Dismissals Act to workers placed by employment agencies would apply only to contracts entered into after the legislation comes into effect, that is, 1 October 1993.  We need to be clear on this point as there seems to be confusion. On that basis therefore an agency worker working for a user firm at the time the new Act comes into operation would not be covered until a new placement contract would be made.  On reflection it was considered that this would be unfair. Accordingly, the amendment to the Bill now put forward clarifies the matter that on the coming into operation of the new Act, that is 1 October 1993, existing agency workers will be placed on a par with future such workers in that as and from that date their service shall begin to count towards the calculation of the one year service requirement necessary to obtain protection of the Act.  If Deputies wish, I will circulate the relevant note.</P>

Therefore, if they were dismissed at some stage between now and 1 October they would have the right to commence proceedings after the enactment of the Act and to say &ldquo;I am deemed by the Act to have been employed by this person and, therefore, to be unfairly dismissed&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Yes.  There is a scandalous level of exploitation in a minority of cases.  I very much welcome this amendment for that reason.  With regard to the point raised by Deputy McDowell, is it not the case that we frequently pass Money Bills which take effect on a date preceding enactment?  There are other precedents for deeming provisions of a Bill to take effect from a date preceding its enactment.  We have experience of this.  We are talking about a minority of employers who would exploit the system. It seems that the circumstances posed by Deputy McDowell may well arise.  If we can close that loophole by way of amendment or reconstruction of the Minister's amendment then we should attempt to do so.</P>

      <P>As Deputies will appreciate, it is not usual for a Minister to introduce in the Dáil a substantial amendment to a Bill initiated in the Seanad.  When the matter was brought to our attention we sought legal advice on what we deemed to be the correct formula. Of course, one always wishes to introduce perfect legislation.  As the House is aware, people working for employment agencies were not covered previously and they had no redress. Under this Bill a person employed by a company through an employment agency will be placed on a par with the other workers in the company in that as and from 1 October their services shall be included in the calculation of the one year service requirement necessary under the Bill.  On the question of Money Bills, that is a different issue.  I have been strongly advised that the wording of my amendment is correct, bearing in mind that the Bill has yet to complete Committee Stage and Report Stage and has to be signed by the President.  The provisions of the Bill will come into effect from 1 October next.</P>

      <P>The amendment is an improvement on the Bill as it is currently drafted.  It clarifies when the provisions of the Bill will come into force.  It also clarifies that contracts in place on 1 October will be covered by the Bill.  I understand that prior to this it was not clear whether existing contracts were covered. This Bill will increase protection for employees and employment agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1572" /> In addition to being present in the House for Question Time, I was at the meeting of the Select Committee on Social Affairs all morning.  Therefore, I have not had an opportunity to examine the amendments in great detail; I am thinking on my feet on this matter.  I do not think employers will be given an additional incentive to dismiss employees placed with them through an employment agency before the commencement of the Bill as these employees will only be covered from 1 October 1993.  It is much more likely that the one year contract requirement will be applied before the enactment date of the Bill.  I cannot see that this will weaken the position of employees; indeed it will strengthen it.  I welcome the fact that it is now clearly defined who is an employee and this addresses to some degree the issues raised in my amendment.  IBEC asked for clarity in the legislation and it was its wish that it would apply only to contracts after the section came into effect.  It has got clarity but it has not got, quite rightly, its way in the law applying only to the future contracts between the user and the employment agency.  I think we are going as far as we can, although I am in sympathy with the points being made on taking into account the earlier service of workers.</P>

      <P>I do not understand. If it is deemed to be desirable that people be protected why can their employment status prior to the commencement of the Act not be taken into account in determining their entitlements? In November 1993 why should somebody be liable to be dismissed because his or her &ldquo;quasi-employment&rdquo; is deemed to have started on 1 October? Employees should be protected straight away.  Why are employers being given a period of grace to clear out their temporary employees?  Why does the Minister not adopt a more radical proposition and say that anybody from today or from some other day, perhaps 1 June 1993, who is in this position is deemed to be entitled to protection if he or she is dismissed at any stage after 1 June 1993 before or after the commencement of the Act?</P>

      <P>When one brings forward legislation one seeks to correct ills in the future.  In legislation one seeks to bring in remedial action to combat abuses.  In labour legislation one watches out for peoples' rights.  In this Bill we are seeking to protect individuals in the type of situation to which the Deputy refers &mdash; most correctly in humanitarian terms. We have had advice from what I would call the highest levels of legal expertise and the drafting was done at the highest level.  My objective is to see that the very cases of which the Deputy speaks do not easily obtain in the future.  I do not propose to bring in legislation that would be retrospective and would not stand up to challenge.  The Deputy referred to clogging up the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a great deal of codology talked about retrospective <Col N="1576" /> legislation.  It is prefectly in order and there is nothing unconstitutional in saying that where somebody has had three years' service with an employer through an employment agency at a time prior to the passing of an Act he will be deemed, in cases of dismissal after the commencement of the Act, to have been in the employment of that concern for those three years.  There is nothing unconstitutional about that.  If Mrs. So-and-So has been a typist employed through an employment agency with a company for the past three years, I can see no legal or constitutional objection to saying that her service in that capacity can be deemed to be employment service for the purpose of giving her rights because of her 12 months' service with her employer.  That is the point I am making.  I see no reason that that should be so.  There is a great fear in this House about retrospective legislation.  The Constitution only states that a law cannot be introduced which makes something an offence retrospectively.</P>

      <P>There is no offence here, this amendment is seeking to confer a right.  When you come to look at whether somebody is entitled to protection under the Act, I propose that you should be retrospectively entitled to look at their record of employment through an agency at a time prior to the commencement of the Act in order to determine whether they should be given rights immediately the Act comes into effect.  I do not see that there is anything radical or odd about that.  If I were drafting the Bill I would do it in that way and I would put my money on it that no court would touch it or interfere with it in any way.</P>

      <P>Section 8 of the 1977 Act provides that a rights commissioner or the Employment Appeals Tribunal should hear claims of unfair dismissal brought under the Act.  I understand that it is normal for a rights commissioner or the tribunal to establish at the outset of a hearing that a claimant is entitled to bring in the claim that the person meets the necessary qualification requirements of the legislation.  In deciding on a claimant's entitlement to bring a claim the rights commissioner or tribunal would have to determine that the claimant was in fact an employee within the meaning of the Act and as such entitled to bring a claim.  Deputy Flaherty's amendment appears to propose to shift that responsibility to the Department of Social Welfare. I do not consider such a proposal to be in the best interests of either the employer or the employee or, indeed, of the tribunal.  I consider it is appropriate that the determination of all aspects of a person's eligibility under the Act should rest with the adjudicative authorities. That is more or less what was said on Deputy Rabbitte's amendment.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 4 seeks to bring down the threshold from 12 months to nine months to allow for protection under the Act.  For people encompassed by the Act it has worked reasonably well.  More and more contracts have been devised with the express purpose of avoiding that provision in the Act; in other words, it has now become customary to my knowledge &mdash; and this has been a frequent occurrence &mdash; that people are employed for 11 months, or 11 months and three weeks, or 11 months and one week and then let go for a week and re-employed under the same contract again purely for the purpose of circumventing the Act.  That is unfortunate.</P>
      <P>I accept the Minister's point about the &ldquo;getting to know you&rdquo; period which is typical in most employments where a probationary period is habitually three months, but it can be for six months.  That is a reasonable period from the employer's point of view.  However, once an employee on probation is deemed suitable for the employment it is fair that the cumulative duration of the probationary period should be taken into account.  A total of nine months as the qualifying threshold under this Act is a reasonable reforming amendment.  Employers could not claim that such a period is excessively generous and the arguments Deputy McDowell made in relation to agency workers apply in this case.  In the Seanad, the Minister referred to the position in Great Britain where a period of two years is required under the law.  In my naivety I once compared the Minister to Margaret Thatcher.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy Rabbitte's basic motivation but I oppose the proposed reduction from 12 to nine months.  In that case, it might as well be reduced to six months or abolished altogether.  Section 3 purports to allow the rights commissioner, the tribunal or the Circuit Court, as the case may be, to disregard a fixed term contract if it is believed that the fixed term contract was entered into for the purposes of avoiding the unfair dismissals code. Under section 2 of the original Act if somebody on a weekly contract is dismissed in the eleventh month and re-employed one month later, the question arises as to whether such people are being treated unfairly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

      <P>If I have a three year contract with an employer and when I sue for unfair dismissal it is envisaged that the three year term was applied to prevent me having rights under the Unfair Dismissals Act, it seems unfair that a constitutent of Deputy Rabbitte's who may have worked for a period of 11 months can be dismissed and re-employed one month later because his or her contract was not a fixed term one.  It is unfair that a person can be re-engaged after a lapse of two or three weeks and deprived of protection under the Bill. Why does the Bill not provide the same right to disregard a temporary cut in service <Col N="1583" /> to ordinary open-ended contracts where a tribunal finds that the break in service was motivated by a desire to escape the provisions of the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that all contracts of employment are covered by the three month gap; if a person is re-employed within three months the contract continues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case, the Deputy has made a very valid point.  If a person is returned to employment under the same contract and by the same employer, the protection of this proposed Act should extend to him or her.  I have an open mind in regard to the proposed nine month period.  The trade unions have been seeking a six month period and small businesses, in particular, have suggested that we should consider the British example. As an employer, it is my understanding that in most employments a six month probationary period applies, but a permanent employee with no protection is in an anomalous position.  Such a person might be protected by in-house agreements or union negotiations if he or she had a grievance between six months and one year.  However, people who have completed their probationary period but are not fully protected under the laws of the land are in no man's land.  It is only after a period of approximately nine months that an employer will decide whether he wishes to retain an employee in the long term.  Therefore, this amendment might shorten the time in which an employee proved efficiency.  Very often an employee might not have settled in properly after a period of six months and an extra few months would give them an opportunity to learn the job and prove their merit.  This argument cannot be easily resolved.  I understand the Minister has certain powers to deal with this by way of regulation and it could be appropriately <Col N="1584" /> discussed in relation to a programme for national recovery and consensus reached in that way.  There is merit in Deputy Rabbitte's amendment, but it is not an absolutely proven case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was dealt with at great length in the Seanad.  The Principal Act provides that subject to certain exceptions the Act will apply to employees who have at least one year's continuous service with the same employer.  Deputy Rabbitte's amendment proposes to reduce that requirement to nine months and Senator O'Toole made a similar proposal in the Seanad.  The question of the length of the service requirement was examined in detail when this Act was being reviewed in the context of this legislation.  On the one hand, the employer bodies wanted the service requirement increased to two years while employee representatives wanted it decreased to six months.  I consider that the circumstances that gave rise to the provision of a one year requirement in 1977 have not changed.  Those circumstances include giving to an employer an adequate opportunity to assess the suitability of an employee for the employment concerned and the requirement that an employee serve with an employer for a reasonable period of time before becoming eligible for the significant protections afforded by the legislation. I do not propose to make any change to the service requirement of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regardless of how many months applied if employers to not wish to retain employees they will always apply a period of less than the required period.  If a nine month period applied, employers could apply an eight month period and so on. If an employer wished to get around the legislation he could circumvent the time period and a reduction from nine months to six months could be easily cirant' <Col N="1585" /> cumvented.  The House may wish to note that there is a provision in the 1977 Act allowing the Minister of the day to change by order the length of the service requirement and if, in the course of my duties, it becomes evident that circumstancs have changed in such a manner as to justify an amendment to the service requirement, I would be open to consideration of any alternative arrangement that may be required in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>To answer Deputy Rabbitte, I never did aim to be like nor do I want to be like Madam Thatcher.  The point I was making was that the time limit in the UK is two years.  In a very smart way the Deputy did not mention that I said that the limit in Denmark was also two years. I can see by the Deputy's grin that he has read it.  Denmark, the soul of socialism, has a two year requirement.  Deputy Flaherty made the point that small businesses in the UK were protected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I was opposing it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>That idea was mooted to me, but I do not think it would be right to have one labour law for smaller businesses and another for larger businesses. There are rights for employers and rights for employees and I do not think they would be well served by treating small businesses differently.</P>
      <P>In regard to the amendment put forward by Deputy Rabbitte, I am not disposed to bringing the limit down to nine months because that in turn would be abused.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I note that the Minister did not reply to any of the points I made and perhaps I will raise them again with her.  As I see it, one of the purposes of this Bill is to disregard the fixed term nature of a contract if the tribunal is satisfied that the purpose of fixing a term was substantially to avoid the application of the Act.  That is the purpose of section 3 (b) in this Bill.  I reiterate the objection I have and ask the Minister to reconsider it.  Does it not make sense that the tribunal should have power to disregard a dismissal and a recommencement, quite <Col N="1586" /> apart from fixed term contracts and open-ended contracts, where the tribunal considers that that was done for the purpose of avoiding the application of the Act?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The only reason I raised this was that Deputy Rabbitte was suggesting bringing the 12 month limit down to nine months.  I made the point that the Minister herself made, that moving the goalposts will not stop people scoring goals whenever they want to.  We are here dealing with a different matter and I am asking the Minister now, if she really believes that fixed term contracts should be looked behind in certain circumstances, to reconsider the matter.  It applies equally in regard to Deputy Rabbitte's amendment.  The evil he was looking at should be looked behind as well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>That point is covered under another section.  However, I am free to answer it.  In regard to the Deputy's point about someone who is dismissed after 11 months, that person is not covered by this legislation but can go to the Labour Court under industrial relations legislation.  Let me say something else to Deputy McDowell while I am on my feet.  The Deputy alleged earlier that I was arrogant because I would not agree to take an amendment from him on Report Stage.  The Deputy does not have an amendment down on Committee Stage nor does his party.</P>

To go back to what Deputy Flaherty said, we in this House were told by the Government of which the Minister is a member that committees would handle the Committee Stages of these Bills.

We are in the position of considering a guillotined debate which the Minister voted for here today and which her colleagues insisted on despite the suggestion that it was unfair.  We are having a guillotined debate this afternoon in circumstances where this Committee Stage should be dealt with by a Committee of this House when there would have been plenty of time for everybody to put down their amendments and Deputy Cullen would have been in a position to attend.</P>

He does not know about the year's requirement, etc. It seems that the Minister would have the best of both worlds.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this amendment.  It relates to one of the most important issues not dealt with in the Bill.  I also welcome the amendments conceded by the Minister in this section, the original proposal to include sexual orientation, race and colour and the concessions in relation to age and membership of the travelling community. However, the Bill is incomplete without provision for the concession in this amendment because it is clear that pregnant women experience difficulties in the workplace.  While they cannot be directly dismissed as a result of their pregnancy many restrictions associated with it cause difficulties.  I refer to women working on equipment which is unsafe to use during pregnancy and whether employers are obliged to make efforts, where possible, to find more suitable employment, which is often available, for those women. Catering employees, at certain stages in their pregnancy may find heavy work, for example, waiting on tables unsuitable but employers may not provide more suitable employment for them, which may be available.  There was a high profile case where a pregnant woman who was <Col N="1591" /> employed as a teacher was dismissed because she was unmarried and in a second relationship.  That is a different area but this may be the only opportunity to address such matters and, therefore, we might as well put all the issues on the table.  This amendment is comprehensive. It suggests that neither the pregnancy of the employee nor any matter connected therewith could be used to dismiss a person and, if it was attempted to do so, that the dismissal would be essentially unfair.  The absence of this provision highlights a weakness in the Bill and I hope the Minister will accept this amendment or amendment No. 8 which is similar although it may not be as broad in its definition.</P>

I do not know which amendment the Minister prefers but I am sure she is totally supportive of this amendment.  I cannot conceive of the Bill being enacted without the Minister agreeing to this amendment because the law as it stands is flawed through error or &mdash; although one would be reluctant to say it &mdash; deliberately. Whereas pregnancy is a good defence against dismissal, nonetheless, as a consequence of pregnancy, a women can be dismissed because she is deemed not fit to carry out the functions of her job, that is a terrible oversight in the law. I presume the Minister will give a positive response to one of these amendments.  In addition to there being a flaw in the law as it stands&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The European Community Directive will have to be implemented and incorporated in domestic law to ensure that a woman cannot be dismissed during pregnancy or while on maternity leave.  I would have thought <Col N="1592" /> as the directive was enacted in October 1992 and since we are now dealing with the Bill, that this would be the place to ensure that its import is taken on board.  I have strong views in regard to this matter. Because I had direct experience of women losing their employment for all kinds of trumped up reasons when the main reason for their dismissal was their pregnancy and that their duties involved lifting or physical effort.  Under the existing law it was impossible to establish that the person was dismissed because she was pregnant.  The distinction between being pregnant and being dismissed as a consequence of being pregnant is an area where there must be certainty in the law and I hope the Minister will take on board the import of what we are trying to do here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte referred to the EC Directive.  If one were to take on board either or both of the Deputies' amendments the woman would be worse off.  I will explain the position in this regard.  The EC Directive is due to be enforced in October 1994 and its ratification is the responsibility of the Minister for Equality and Law Reform as laid out in the Programme for Government. The EC Directive provides that where a risk assessment, to which Deputy Flaherty referred, reveals a possible danger to the health or safety of a pregnant worker, that worker must be transferred to alternative duties and if a transfer is not possible special maternity leave, to be paid for by the employer and/or the State, must be granted.  We look forward to October 1994 when the directive is enforced.  A pregnant woman will not have to appeal her case to the Employment Appeals Tribunal if she considers she was dismissed from work because she was pregnant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the debate we heard that following such appeals, many women take their compensation awards and do not return to work, perhaps because of the small intimate nature of Irish business, but that is another area.  Neither of the Deputies' amendments would succeed in <Col N="1593" /> protecting the woman to the same extent as the EC directive.  Their amendments provide that such a position would be automatically unfair, that the woman would have a strong case and be entitled to bring it to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  The EC Directive provides that where a risk assessment reveals a possible danger to the health or safety of a pregnant worker that worker must be transferred to alternative duties and, if a transfer is not possible, special maternity leave, to be paid for by the employer and-or the State must be automatically granted.  It is essential, therefore, that in the interests of women we do not rush to amend the Act without a detailed examination of the new and complex issues raised in the directive as regards risk assessment, transfer to other jobs and entitlements to leave and pay, all of which will provide for the automatic retention of the woman in her job.</P>

      <P>I do not accept what the Minister said.  I do not know how she cobbled that together between the Seanad and this House.  I know this is an embarrassing issue for the Minister and that she must have great difficulty in agreeing to it because as a Minister, proud of her record in this area, she must be anxious to give the protection provided in those amendments to women.  The Minister is trying to make us believe that if we were to enshrine Deputy Flaherty's amendment or mine in law it would stop the directive which will be incorporated in the domestic law and then, I hope there will be no need for those amendments.  I would lay a wager with the Minister that there is no prospect of this directive being law here in 1994.  If it is it will be one of the first law directives in the area of labour legislation to have been implemented on the due date.  It will drag on and on and in the interim, if we are amending the Unfair Dismissals Act, we have an obligation to protect women&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I cannot accept the Minister's argument in this case.  We all look forward to the additional protections provided by the EC directive and I imagine they will be included in the Maternity and Employment Act in this area.  An amendment or clarification of the Unfair Dismissals (Amendment) Bill is required immediately to protect <Col N="1595" /> women in the interim.  It would be required anyway in the long term to clarify that matters associated with pregnancy can never be grounds for a fair dismissal &mdash; in other words, that that would be an unfair dismissal.  Like the Minister, we hope that many women will not face that situation, but in the meantime this issue must be resolved within these Acts.  To suggest that passing this amendment would in any way inhibit wider protection is being less than honest and is covering up for a failure to act under this legislation.  I wish to press this issue to a vote.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is significant and a vindication of the democratic process that an Independent Member is enabled to move legislation in this manner.  It is a particular privilege for me to present to this House a measure which, if accepted in principle in whole or in part, will advance an area of immense public concern and interest&mdash;the welfare of the vulnerable <Col N="1598" /> and defenceless in nature's creation.  It is a measure that will hopefully help bring to an end the medieval barbarity of live hare coursing.  I move this Bill first and foremost in the interests of Animal Welfare, in an attempt to remove the most blatant form of extreme cruelty to a timid and inoffensive animal.  I also move this Bill in the interest of the international reputation of Ireland.  As long as the Legislature permits the appalling cruelty of live hare coursing Ireland's image as a civilised country will be, and is being, tarnished in a most damaging manner.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks important steps have been taken to achieve one of the priority objectives of the Programme for a Partnership Government, that is, to modernise and humanise our laws, and another such step will be taken this week. It is therefore an appropriate time to confront yet a further aspect of Irish society that has been swept under the political carpet for much too long.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not.  Ireland is almost alone among modern democracies that continue to keep in force legislation which gives legal sanction to the torture, mutilation and killing of animals as a public spectacle, what we call live hare coursing.  What I ask in this Bill is for acceptance of what every Member of this House knows to be the truth: that this practice is barbaric, cruel and wrong and that the law must be changed.  I readily accept that many rural Members have come under great pressure to oppose the Bill.  I know that coursing clubs can be powerful entrenched groups in many rural constituencies.  I equally accept that I am not under any such pressure.  What I ask &mdash; it is no small request &mdash; is that Members decide for themselves whether there is need to change this cruel practice. If they decide there is such a need, in <Col N="1599" /> the interests of justice I ask them not to oppose this Bill on Second Stage.</P>
      <P>I want to describe in a little detail what is involved in live hare coursing and I want to be accurate and objective.  While I have been a reluctant observer at coursing meetings, attending on behalf of the Irish Council Against Blood Sports, and while I found what I witnessed to be obscene, I want to avoid encouraging other Members to accuse me of exaggerating or being pejudiced.  I simply wish to state that what I saw strengthened my resolve to do something about coursing. Rather than detail my own observations I intend to quote from published accounts by two reputable journalists who attended the national coursing meeting in Clonmel in 1992.  The first account contains direct quotes from an article by Dick Hogan in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 12 February 1992.  It states:</P>
      <P>The hare is a quiet, shy little animal, that feels pain as acutely as any human being would.  How do I know this? I know it because I have heard the demented screams of hares who failed to make it to the protective barrier at various coursing meetings and who wound up instead in the jaws of competing greyhounds.</P>
      <P>Earlier, they had been competing in the chase for the hare &mdash; that's coursing. Now, they were competing to tear the live animal apart, and that is something else again, something on which the coursing authorities are not inclined to dwell.</P>
      <P>When the dogs catch the hare in this fashion they become frenzied monsters, and only blood and torn flesh satisfy their gaping jaws.  To avoid this, the handlers must try to get in early to deliver the <i>coup de grace</i>, a chop to the back of the hare's neck.</P>
      <P>Usually, though, before this happens, the diminutive animal has experienced such awful, terrorising pain that, in its death throes, it emits a piercing, agonised scream.</P>
      <P>Coursing is a cruel sport, if it is a sport at all, and that, nobody can deny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1600" /> It is so cruel at times, that nowadays the officials who administer it do their level best to ensure that neither the public nor the press will get action pictures of the kill.  They would be embarrassed by such photographs because the sight of the helpless hare in the jaws of two big dogs is not a pretty one.</P>
    <P>Rather, to most people, it is disgusting and offensive to Christian values.  Which is why it would be nice to hear those clergymen who support coursing so enthusiastically explain their position.</P>
    <P>Maybe that is something we should all do.  Mine is that shooting a pheasant, or a hare for that matter, for food, or taking a trout from the river, or eating meat, if that is what you fancy, is perfectly all right, and I would do any of these things without apologising. Neither would I enter into an argument about it because I do not feel I have anything to defend.</P>
    <P>Those who run ferocious dogs after small, inoffensive and terrified animals, like hares, do, however, because that in effect, is torturing creatures who are being used as live bait.</P>
    <P>Those who remain unconvinced should go to one of the two February meetings to see for themselves.</P>
    <P>More specifically, to listen for themselves. Having once heard a hare dying all doubts would be dispelled. </P>
    <P>The second account contains direct quotes from an article by Tom Humphries in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 8 February 1992.  It states:</P>
    <P>Ostensibly the contest is between dog and dog.  For many, including the animals, the contest is between hare and dogs and, as such, seems grotesquely unbalanced.  Greyhounds travel considerably faster than hares and in enclosed coursing are presented with all the advantages, an open field, a long run, a hare that has been in captivity for three weeks and has been trained to run in a straight line.</P>
    <P>Eventually, in the course of an evasive manoeuvre from one dog, the <Col N="1601" /> hare veers almost straight into the jaws of the other.  The dog drives its head down and flips the hare in the air.  The crowd fall silent.  On the TV monitor the commentator announces that &ldquo;the hare has been spotted&rdquo; and the camera flashes away.</P>
    <P>Two dogs fight over their spoil, each tugging away.  Attendants run in from the wings to separate them.  Carried on the wind over the silence, is the appalling agonised bleating of the hare, as the dogs struggle for possession.</P>
    <P>The dogs are difficult to separate from their prey and the scene drags on for several slow seconds after the human intervention.  One dog jogs away with a leg in his mouth.  An attendant is left with another leg.  The rest of the squealing hare is prised from the other dog and another blue anoracked man breaks its neck with a decisive silence-inducing jerk of the arm.  The public address system announces a deadpan: &ldquo;And the winner of that course was...&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Coursing people are a breed under siege.  Faces turn to you with wearied recognition, sizing you up with simmering hostility.</P>
    <P>A small primaeval, shameful quarter of the mind even demanded the spectacle, while the rest objected.</P>
    <P>What truly shocked, though, was seeing the sport in its essence.  Breaking down the components makes coursing hard to justify, intellectually, and morally.</P>
    <P>Capturing hares and keeping them for a number of weeks, training them to run in a straight line and then exposing them to greyhounds whose objective is to kill is an odd sort of pastime. One animal is trained to run straight, while the stronger, faster animals are trained to catch it....  The world is full of obscenities.</P>
    <P>Sports, though, should be free of such bloodstains.  Sport should enhance humanity not degrade it. </P>
    <P>I have quoted from what I consider to be works of exceptional journalistic merit, <Col N="1602" /> but perhaps I should quote briefly the Editor of <i>The Irish Times</i>, Mr. Conor Brady, who in a letter to an anti-bloodsports lobbyist on 8 February, 1993 stated:</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Irish Times</i> is opposed to live hare coursing and has repeatedly said so in its editorial columns.  As a matter of routine we cover some meetings each year photographically in order to remind readers of the reality of what we regard &mdash; and have described repeatedly &mdash; as a cruel and unjustified activity. </P>
    <P>Regarding my attendance at coursing meetings, as an observer, I did not attend high profile premier events like Clonmel and Clounanna.  Instead, I went to isolated local events such as Ballymore, County Westmeath, in November 1991. What I and another observer saw there provoked a letter to the press from which I will quote a short extract.  The letter was in <i>The Irish Times</i> on November 29 1991.  It said:</P>
    <P>During the first half of the event a hare turned towards us and tried to escape between the cars, but two young boys, no more than 14 years old, shouted and shooed the poor desperate hare back into the jaws of the dogs. Both dogs caught the hare simultaneously and tugged wildly at the screaming victim, then one of the dogs succeeded in catching the prize by the neck and ran with it into the field, with the hare desperately working its back legs to get free.  The dog was caught by an &ldquo;official&rdquo; who took the still struggling hare and finished it off with two blows to the head. </P>
    <P>I was very shocked at the reaction of the two children.  I had thought that they would stay silent or would step back and encourage the hare to escape.  Sadly that was not the case.  Exposing children to such cruelty and conditioning them to accept it as normal is very damaging. The Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in a joint leaflet with the Irish Council Against Bloodsports recently pointed out:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1603" /> When young people are allowed to witness such violence towards animals, it is a signal that such violence is acceptable, indeed desirable, since the Irish Coursing Club insists that coursing is actually of benefit to the environment (though they never explain exactly how).  Any exposure to violence in any form is likely to raise the tolerance threshold of those who witness it, making acceptance of further violence easier.  The cruelty of coursing is institutionalised legal violence, endorsed by the Government.  It is no longer acceptable to the overwhelming majority of ordinary, decent people. Unfortunately, coursing has a considerable following among politicians and the clergy.  We are particularly concerned that the clergy is so intimately involved, since young people look to them for moral guidance, and the clear message will be that the abuse of animals for fun is okay. </P>
    <P>A few years ago an American psychiatrist, Dr. Boris Levinson found a strong connection between children's violence to animals and their subsequent violence to people.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Once the barriers that stop you hurting another creature have been broken down&rdquo; says Ms. Christine Donaghy of Children at Risk in Ireland, &ldquo;it's only a short step to killing. And the difference between harming a small child, and going the extra bit that stops the child breathing and kills it, is very slight&rdquo;.  &ldquo;You can't really blame it all on videos or television&rdquo; says psychologist, Ms. Geraldine McLoughlin, &ldquo;It's all about power and control, whether they are torturing animals or other children, a common factor is a complete lack of empathy with the victim.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If we as a society were to promote care and affection for animals and an abhorrence of any form of cruelty we would all be the better for it.  That is why I have moved the Second Stage of this Bill.</P>
    <P>What I have referred to so far is in <Col N="1604" /> the context of live hare coursing being organised in accordance with the rules and standards as set down by law.  Coursing is callous, cruel and indefensible even when the regulations are applied in full, but in recent years, scandal after scandal has disgraced even its most public events. In 1990 half of the greyhounds tested at the showpiece fixtures of Clonmel and Clounanna were positive for prohibited substances.  Put simply, they were doped. The drugs were administered either orally or through injections.</P>
    <P>Coursing clubs have been monitored and prosecuted for taking hares from the wild, outside the open season, without the required licences.  Coursing clubs and events have used small, weak and even sick hares, in breach of licence conditions. At least one such club, the Moate-Tubber Club was banned from coursing for three years as a result.  At the 1992 premier event in Clonmel, 37, hares died &mdash; 20 per cent of those coursed &mdash; and a post mortem investigation established that they were extremely ill suffering from coccidiosis and worm infestation.</P>
    <P>At Clounanna, the same year, a higher percentage, 25 per cent of hares died. The ICC by way of explanation to the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, stated that this was due to &ldquo;adverse weather conditions&rdquo;.  Anyone with even the slightest interest in animals or in coursing knows what happened at Clounanna the following year.  Fortyeight hares died.  Some reports say 51 died.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, stated in the Dáil that &ldquo;this situation is quite unacceptable&rdquo;. His Department ordered a major investigation.  A report on events at Clounanna in 1993 is now with the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>Even the ICC was forced to state publicly that the standard of coursing there was totally unacceptable to the ICC and to supporters of coursing.  This happened at coursing's showpiece, their high profile National Irish Cup meeting.  If standards are so unacceptable at national events under the full glare of publicity, what <Col N="1605" /> goes on at local events?  Indeed, what happens behind the scenes, outside of the publicly organised events?  What happens is called &ldquo;blooding&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Cork Examiner</i> on 11 September 1992 reported the following under the head-line: &ldquo;Two found guilty of blooding a greyhound by using a live hare&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>Two men were convicted in Tipperary yesterday of blooding a greyhound by means of a live hare.</P>
    <P>Joe O'Reilly, Rathmooley, Killenaule, and Willie Denn, Clonagoose, Mullinahone, both pleaded guilty at Killenaule Court to having in their possession a protected wild animal, a hare, on September 9, 1991, at Mountaylor.</P>
    <P>However, they pleaded not guilty to injuring the animal.</P>
    <P>Padraig Comerford, wild life ranger, said he went to the lands of Matt O'Donnell on September 9, following reports of greyhounds being blooded by live hares.  He saw Willie Denn carry a box containing a live hare the length of the track.  Joe O'Reilly put a greyhound into a trap release box.</P>
    <P>Witness realised what was going to happen and ran towards Mr. Denn to try to rescue the hare.  Mr. Denn was holding a live hare on a string.  The greyhound, which had been released by Mr. O'Reilly, got to the hare before witness could.  He heard the hare screech as the greyhound caught it.</P>
    <P>Both defendants were employed by Matt O'Donnell at the time.  The ranger claimed Matt O'Donnell abused him when he went to his house about the matter... Judge William Harnett convicted both men. </P>
    <P>Lest the House think this was an isolated incident I might quote again from <i>The Cork Examiner</i> of 23 February 1989 under the heading &ldquo;Men Fined after Appalling Act of Savagery on Rabbit&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>What was described as an appalling act of savagery, involving the &ldquo;blooding&rdquo; of two greyhounds in County Kerry on October 31 last, was outlined by Garda Inspector Michael O'Neill, at Tralee District Court yesterday.  He <Col N="1606" /> told Justice Humphrey P. Kelleher how a rabbit was savaged by the greyhounds which had been taken to a field on the Tralee-Ardfert road by two men.  The men, Christy Conway... and Michael O'Shea,... were each fined £20 when they pleaded guilty of permitting unnecessary suffering to the rabbit at Bawnboy on the occasion.</P>
    <P>Inspector O'Neill, prosecuting, said that when they reached the field, O'Shea released the rabbit from a bag. One of the dogs pursued the rabbit and caught it.  Both dogs then savaged the animal.</P>
    <P>A local man saw what happened and informed the gardaí who found the two men a short time afterwards.  Gardaí also saw the rabbit carcass and the head had been severed from the body.  &ldquo;This practice is known as blooding greyhounds &mdash; it was a most appalling act of savagery on a defenceless rabbit&rdquo;, stated the Inspector.</P>
    <P>Mr. Donal O'Neill, solicitor, said that the defendants did not realise at the time that they were breaking the law.  A very instructive observation, I must admit.  The article continues: However, they co-operated fully with the gardaí and now realised that what they did was wrong.</P>
    <P>Mr. O'Neill said both dogs were only ten months old.  It was a pity, he went on, that the story, which was not quite accurate, was described in such a way. </P>
    <P>Presumably the Garda inspector was not being accurate.</P>
    <P>He added that the publicity would not do certain parties and sports organisations any good. </P>
    <P>Incidentally, Matt O'Donnell, referred to in my first quotation is a very successful greyhound owner in Tipperary.  When I discussed this case with a leading coursing enthusiast, a Member of the Oireachtas, he told me that such practice is widespread among the coursing community.  I will not name that Member because it was a private conversation but it merely <Col N="1607" /> confirmed the worst fears of all of us who care about animals.</P>
    <P>There is one additional point I might make regarding rules and standards.  The view is promoted that hares are released back to the wild after each meeting and, therefore, are not re-coursed.  However, the evidence, if anything, shows the opposite to be the case.  For example, condition No. 7 of the licence for trapping hares states that &ldquo;the hare may not be coursed more than once on the same day&rdquo;.  Rule 86 of the Irish Coursing Club states: &ldquo;It shall be an offence for a club to course a hare more than once on any day of coursing or trials&rdquo;.  Therefore, the House will see it is not even illegal to recourse the same hares as long as it is not done on the same day.  That is what our laws permit.  In addition, most coursing meetings are not attended by officers of the Wildlife Service so that they do not witness the release of hares.  Is it any wonder there is international revulsion at what is seen to be a backward, uncivilised and primeval practice?</P>
    <P>Throughout Europe and the United States the name of the Irish greyhound industry is being severely damaged on account of its association with coursing which is illegal in most countries.  In fact, the only countries who practice enclosed live hare coursing worldwide are Ireland, Portugal and Pakistan.  In Australia, for example, live coursing is punishable by heavy fines and imprisonment whereas in Canada only drag coursing is permitted. In the United States greyhounds trained on live animals are liable to be barred from racing.  A tough new law introduced in the State of Wisconsin means that no greyhound raised in Ireland will be eligible to compete there.  Therefore, it seems likely that this will become the general approach throughout the United States.  Animal welfare organisations and animal rights groups in Europe, Canada and the United States are advising all their members to organise a tourism boycott of Ireland.  I have received hundreds of letters from branches throughout the United States confirming this; although I do not approve of it, it is a fact that <Col N="1608" /> that is happening.  In addition, President Robinson last year received over 2,000 such letters.</P>
    <P>As awareness of Ireland's association with cruelty to animals spreads, particularly in the United States and Canada, its negative impact on tourism will be significant.  Yet, parodoxically in Ireland, opinion polls have shown that an overwhelming majority of our people are opposed to live coursing.  For example, a 1987 IMS poll showed 79.4 per cent against; 11.5 per cent for and 9.9 per cent &ldquo;do not knows&rdquo;.  The ISPCA is one of the organisations supporting the campaign to outlaw live coursing here.  They say, and I quote:</P>
    <P>We are campaigning against coursing because it involves the killing of animals for fun.  There is absolutely no justification for trapping hares, or any other animal, and using them to provide entertainment for a small minority who, for some unfathomable reason, enjoy seeing them being chased by dogs and fighting for their lives.  It is a one-sided fight which many of the hares lose, to suffer a violent and cruel death.  This is the nature of coursing. </P>
    <P>The chief inspector of the Ulster SPCA, Mr. Norman Henry, stated, and I quote again:</P>
    <P>It is a mediaeval sport, shameful and barbaric, and has no place in this century. It is sheer, unmitigated cruelty. There is nothing as heart-rending as listening to the cries of a hare being pulled apart by two greyhounds.  This is on a par with dog fighting and the sooner it is made illegal the better. </P>
    <P>In the last few weeks I have received dozens of cards and letters from all over Ireland supporting my attempt to change the law, the vast majority from people living in rural areas where coursing is strong.</P>
    <P>I want to avail of this opportunity to pay tribute to the various groups, organisations and individuals who have been fighting a sometimes lonely and seemingly hopeless battle over many years to promote public awareness of and organised <Col N="1609" /> popular opposition to coursing.  I might mention especially the Irish Council Against Blood Sports who have been a great source of inspiration and encouragement. I thank them for their untiring efforts in defence of the animal world.</P>
    <P>I know that this House is deeply divided on the issue of coursing.  However, almost everybody is in agreement that the greyhound industry is an important traditional one which has experienced great difficulty in recent years.  It is my strong view that, if the cruelty and blood lust is taken out of the industry, as has been done in so many countries worldwide, the result will be that our greyhound industry will be enhanced and, perhaps more importantly, its world reputation will undoubtedly receive the major boost it so badly needs.</P>
    <P>There is an interesting parallel in the State of Victoria in Australia where live hare coursing had been regarded as a traditional sport for more than 100 years. However, they grew up in 1965 when they introduced drag coursing &mdash; that is the use of mechanical lures &mdash; which has gone from strength to strength so that live hare coursing no longer takes place there.  Drag coursing there varies in type from track to track.  Most are of a type connected to a wire cable drawn down the centre of the track and returned at the end of each course in front of the slipper.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister might consider sending some of our coursing people to Australia &mdash; I am not suggesting he should leave them there&mdash;but simply to examine the changes a modern, civilised society has implemented successfully. The organisers of Austrialian drag coursing maintain that the system they use has great merits in preparing and sharpening up a greyhound for circle track racing.  The experience there is but one example, worldwide, of the changes that could be introduced and implemented which would give a new and badly needed lease of life to our entire greyhound industry.</P>
    <P>There has been some media speculation about the muzzling of greyhounds as a compromise move and today the Minister <Col N="1610" /> of State said he would eliminate &ldquo;the kill&rdquo; and eliminate the &ldquo;suffering&rdquo;, presumably by muzzling the dogs.  My position is that the use of live hares at coursing meetings is unacceptable.  Hares are a protected species under the Irish Wildlife Act 1976.  Capturing hares from the wild can in itself cause extreme cruelty.  Only today I received a letter from a farming family in New Ross, County Wexford, which shows this to be the case.  The letter states:</P>
    <P>I am wondering if anyone has brought to the attention of the Members of the Dáil who will be voting on June 30th the awful plight of hares when they are being captured for coursing or used for training greyhounds. This happens regularly on our farm, we often find unfortunate hares which have been entangled in nets for some time, some have broken bones protruding, some of these wounds are festering.  The only thing we can do with these animals is to have them humanely destroyed.  We used to enjoy the company of between forty and sixty hares but now there are only three or four.</P>
    <P>I feel that many people perhaps do not consider the number of hares killed and maimed before any of their fellows reach a coursing meeting.  I hope these thoughts might help in the argument against hare coursing. </P>
    <P>Another serious problem arises when the hares are penned in large numbers in enclosed and overcrowded conditions &mdash; disease can spread rapidly among them. This has been a feature of many recent coursing events where post mortems have shown the hares were ill and diseased.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from this, under section 1 (1) (a) of the Protection of Animals Act, 1911, it is an offence to &ldquo;terrify&rdquo; any animal.  Will those who set muzzled greyhounds on hares be exempt from this offence?  If there has to be such an exemption how can the Minister of State substantiate his claim today that he intends to eliminate &ldquo;suffering&rdquo; from coursing?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1611" /> Hares suffer great fear when they are netted and kept in captivity as they are by nature wild, solitary animals.  When trials, as they are known, are held to train the unfortunate hares for coursing meetings what guarantee would there be that the dogs would be muzzled?  The answer is none and the Minister of State will not be able to offer any such guarantee.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from the terror involved, large muzzled dogs can cause injury to a timid little animal like the hare.  What evidence have I got to prove this?  The chief Executive of the Irish Coursing Club, Mr. Gerry Desmond, will probably regret that he was quoted in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> on 20 October 1991 in the &ldquo;Quotes of the Week&rdquo; column as saying:</P>
    <P>There were, in fact, trials carried out by the Irish Coursing Club a number of years ago and it was found that the hares were being damaged by the muzzles.  We felt that it led to suffering by the hares afterwards.  When hares get injured they find it very difficult to recuperate from any form of injury. </P>
    <P>If there is any exception which allows hares to be captured and taken from the wild it opens up the possibility of abuses like &ldquo;blooding&rdquo; and unauthorised coursing events being held without muzzling the dogs.  As I said, muzzling would also terrorise the hares many of whom die of fright from the experience of coursing. The only acceptable civlised alternative is drag coursing where mechanical or scent impregnated lures are used.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank the Members of all parties in this House who have joined with me in calling for a free vote on the issue.  It would be a great day for democracy here if the main parties, particularly Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, consented to a free vote.  The issue is not one of vital Government policy, national policy and, as far as I am aware, party policy.  It is an issue on which there are mixed views and opinions some strongly held by individual members of all parties. It would be a sign of the maturity of Dáil <Col N="1612" /> Éireann if a free vote was granted.  The British Parliament last year granted a free vote on the wider issue of all blood sports. It was truly an example of real democracy in action.  There should be room for the same in Dáil Éireann.  There is still an opportunity to show that maturity.  The tragedy is that if there is no free vote then the desire of a majority of Members of Dáil Éireann for change will be perverted.</P>
    <P>There is one reasonable alternative, that is, that on Second Stage at least the Bill should not be opposed.  That would signify, in principle at least, that there is a need for change.  On Committee Stage, the extent of the change required could be decided or an alternative Government Bill could be introduced.  The Dáil is said to have &ldquo;grown up&rdquo; recently with regard to certain issues.  It is time to grow up on this matter also.  A society that permits and specifically enacts laws to promote cruelty and the torture and killing of animals is something we must leave behind us.  It is no longer tolerable or justifiable as we move towards the end of the 20th century.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the House would be interested to know how our neighbours in the British Parliament and the Northern Ireland Assembly have behaved on this issue. In 1976, the Labour Government in the United Kingdom gave parliamentary time to a Private Members' Bill for the abolition of hare coursing.  The Bill received majorities of more than 100 on each of its Stages in the House of Commons but, unfortunately, the unelected blood sports lobby in the House of Lords managed to delay and defeat the measure.  The minority Labour Government fell before it could invoke the Parliament Act to override the Lords' tactics.  A recent poll of MPs has revealed that of MPs responding 85 per cent would support the abolition of hare coursing. The Labour and Liberal Democrats parties are both committed to outlaw coursing as well as other forms of hunting and killing with dogs and a growing number of Conservative MPs have joined in the campaign.</P>
    <P>In October 1984, the British Government <Col N="1613" /> refused to ban hare coursing in the North despite the fact that the Northern Ireland Assembly twice appealed for an outright ban.  In the two Assembly debates there was unanimous all-party support for a motion to make park hare coursing, that is, enclosed hare coursing, illegal.  My references are the <i>Belfast Newsletter</i> of 11 October 1984 and the <i>Down Recorder</i> of 2 August 1984.</P>
    <P>Last week the annual conference of the Methodist Church discussed the Bill before us.  On 18 June they wrote to the Taoiseach as follows:</P>
    <P>The Conference understands that a Private Members' Bill on the subject of enclosed hare coursing will shortly come before the Oireachtas.  In the opinion of the Conference the practice of enclosed hare coursing clearly involves unnecessary suffering to defenceless animals, and it requests that members of your Party be allowed freedom of conscience in voting on this Bill. </P>
    <P>I would like to quote the following from a letter written by a very special person in her 89th year on 4 March 1967:</P>
    <P>In my letter to the press I invoked the names of my two brothers Padraic and Willie and I was absolutely correct in affirming that they would both have been totally opposed to the inhuman treatment meted out to the innocent little hares at the coursing matches.  At all times during their lives they were kind to dumb animals and Padraic's writings gave many instances of his love for animals and birds.  I am certain that were they alive today they would be foremost in condemning coursing for the sadistic spectacle it is. </P>
    <P>That letter is signed, &ldquo;Yours sincerely, Margaret M. Pearse, Senator&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I wish to conclude by quoting the following from the editorial in today's issue of <i>The Irish Times:</i></P>
    <P>But hare coursing is an issue which does not bear comparison with any other likely to arise in this State.  To allow a free vote on it would not be to <Col N="1614" /> establish a precedent.  Nor can anyone claim to be unaware of the facts of the case: they are brutally clear.  The contest is supposed to be between dog and dog.  In reality, it is between two dogs and a hare; and only the hare can lose, and the penalty for losing is to be torn limb from limb.  To call this a sport is an insult to sport. </P>
    <P>The editorial concluded:</P>
    <P>Irish politics and politicians need not disgrace themselves again. </P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to debate coursing and its relationship with the greyhound industry. Unfortunately, this debate is taking place against a backdrop of very unfair and ill-informed criticism of those involved with greyhounds and the field sport of coursing. It is an absolute injustice to suggest, or imply, as people in some quarters have done, that people who participate in coursing are uncivilised.  This is a totally untrue and unfair reflection on those involved in the sport.  The suggestion that coursing is a blood sport is also a serious distortion of the truth.  In fact, coursing is the only game sport where the objective is not to kill the quarry.</P>
      <P>No one should forget that coursing is about people and a way of life in rural Ireland.  Some very remote rural areas would remain remote if it was not for the coursing club.  People in small rural communities come together over many weeks to organise and run their coursing meetings.  Such meetings often provide a very vibrant focal point for community life.  Preparation for the coursing meeting begins many weeks in advance when hares are netted and brought to the coursing fields.  The hares are treated for fluke and other diseases, their feet are treated, they are properly fed and, above all, they are trained for the coursing meeting.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;with our friends from Northern Ireland and Great Britain?  The coursing fields of Ireland have brought Catholics, Protestants and dissenters together and created friendships and bonds which have never been broken.  It should be remembered that it is not unusual for a person from the farthest point in Northern Ireland to appear at the door of a greyhound owner in, for example, north Kerry or north Cork wanting to buy a pair of greyhound pups or a pair of saplings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coursing clubs, and the people involved with greyhounds, generally are the real hare conservationists as without them the hare population would not be nearly as high as it is today in Ireland. <Col N="1616" /> These people have fought against disease with substantial funding from the Irish Coursing Club, reduced considerably the amount of in-breeding of hares and protected the preserves from unscrupulous people who come out from cities and large towns with anything up to 12 dogs to course hares illegally.  At no stage are the &ldquo;antis&rdquo; around to tackle those people, but genuine local people with a real interest in the sport are there throughout the year.  We should remember also that there are hare shoots in Britain, where up to 1,500 hares can be shot in one day. This is essentially because coursing is curtailed there and alternative forms of sport have taken its place.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote the following long excerpt from a speech made by a former Lord Mayor of Clonmel many years ago:</P>
    <P>Every country has its own distinctive traditions &mdash; traditions in culture, music, literature, the crafts.  Likewise each country has its own tradition of sport which make each country unique and different.</P>
    <P>They have been built up over hundreds of years and any society that discards them lightly, out of hand will not be looked upon too kindly by future generations.  So, too, Ireland is steeped in tradition and one of the great sporting traditions of rural Ireland has always been coursing.</P>
    <P>I specifically mention rural Ireland because only someone from the land or connected with the land at some stage, can normally fully understand the laws which govern nature, where animals are born to hunt and be hunted as naturally as night follows day.</P>
    <P>Without this understanding how can one appreciate the exhilaration and spectacle of a hare in full flight using its natural skill and dexterity to reduce a brace of well fed stout-hearted greyhounds into a mere gasping, stumbling and exhausted pair of animals.</P>
    <P>Sometimes the reverse will happen and the hare will not survive, but that is the pattern through which nature has unfolded since the beginning of time <Col N="1617" /> and man is allowed very little say in its overall plan.</P>
    <P>To try to explain this to people whose only brush with nature is a Sunday afternoon walk through a city park or a motoring trip through the countryside on a summer evening, is tantamount to trying to stem the flow of a raging torrent with a shovel and should not be attempted.</P>
    <P>Coursing people are a breed unto themselves.  You must be born into the fold.  Conversions are not common. </P>
    <P>That long but elegant and eloquent quotation sums up how many coursing supporters feel about their sport.</P>
    <P>Those who say that coursing neither plays nor should never play any part in the greyhound industry have never bred, owned, trained or raced a greyhound and are often totally ignorant of what it takes to bring a dog to the point of racing.  It would appear that some people believe that the greyhound racing industry begins and ends on a Saturday night in Shel-bourne Park.  To suggest that greyhounds are bred to automatically chase the electric lure or a drag is another display of ignorance of the sport.  There are very few dogs, if any, that have not required hunting or coursing in the early months of life or at least before 14-16 months. Dogs are generally coursed after the live hare in order to get them to chase the electric hare on the track.</P>
    <P>The demand for the Irish-bred greyhound is becoming greater every year, in particular, from countries where hare coursing does not take place, including the USA and Australia.  One of the reasons for this is that the dog with the coursing strain or bloodlines is stronger, tougher, faster and has greater stamina. This has increased the demand for dogs with a coursing strain, in particular, Irish dams.  The records show that over the past ten years, 77 per cent of major track events in Britain and Ireland were won by dogs with coursing in their bloodline.</P>
    <P>The importance of the industry to the economy and to employment cannot be underestimated or swept under the carpet by the &ldquo;antis&rdquo;.  An independent <Col N="1618" /> survey has shown that the value of coursing to the economy is in excess of £14 million, notwithstanding the numbers employed as trainers and assistants, veterinary surgeons and their assistants.  The spin-off employment in specialised dog-feed, medication, tonics, collars and leads, covers, car-trailers, and so on cannot be ignored.  Hotels and guest-houses benefit greatly also, particularly as it is in off-season that coursing takes place.</P>
    <P>This is only a very small part of the industry that is clearly identified.  Behind the scene the industry involves thousands of others.  It is estimated that 8,000 people are involved in the industry as breeders, owners and trainers, together with those employed on racing tracks and involved in supplying ancillary services, leaving a total of 10,000 people who derive a livelihood directly or indirectly from the industry.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, the present campaign by the &ldquo;antis&rdquo; is only the thin end of the wedge.  Hunting, fishing, shooting and beagling and other field game sports will be next.  I will now quote an extract from a radio interview on 20 August 1992 concerning angling.  The presenter asked the question: &ldquo;Are you saying then that all angling should be banned?&rdquo; The participant, an &ldquo;anti&rdquo; said: &ldquo;I certainly am because angling is a bloodsport just like foxhunting and shooting.&rdquo; I wonder what Jack Charlton would say to that.</P>

      <P>Those of us from rural areas are well aware that due to the major changes in farming over the years, it is not possible to have as many &ldquo;open meetings&rdquo; as it was 40 years ago. However, even those who run &ldquo;open coursing meetings&rdquo; have encountered serious difficulties with the &ldquo;antis&rdquo; and their fellow travellers.  Landowners were threatened that their haybarns would be burned and their property interfered with if they allowed coursing to take place over their lands &mdash; lands that were coursed for over 100 years.  These threats have been made to landowners who themselves do not participate in the sport but who simply allow the use of their land. Imagine how much more vulnerable landowners would be if there were only &ldquo;open coursing meetings&rdquo;.  There have also been threats to scatter nails and glass over enclosed coursing fields.  This has been threatened &mdash; and there is good evidence to suggest it happened &mdash; without any regard whatsoever for the animals who graze those lands for the other 50 weeks of the year.  I wonder how principled are these people in their positions when they can attract a lunatic fringe of this type.</P>
      <P>The Irish Coursing Club has organised coursing in Ireland since 1916.  They do so on a thirty-two counties basis.  As an organisation they have much to commend them.  However, what happened at Clounanna was an unmerciful debacle condemned by coursing supporters and detractors alike.  The time has come for the Irish Coursing Club to review its own practices to see in what way it can improve the organising and running of coursing meetings.</P>

Having listened to the two previous speakers, I am not sure where I fit in but let me make it quite clear that I hold no brief for either side.  Personally, I would not engage in this activity and a great many hold a similar view.  We in this House have been accused of absolutism, particularly in relation to the abortion referendum and the &ldquo;X&rdquo; case and, with all due respects to the previous two speakers, we have had another case of absolutism, a case of black or white.  I wonder if there is a middle ground.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gregory has taken the opportunity during Private Members' time to introduce this Bill.  I listened to him put his case and he listed a number of successful prosecutions and impending prosecutions against people who have defaulted, abused hares or abused the system.  The fact that he can instance cases seems to indicate that somebody is monitoring the situation and prosecutions are being taken.  It must be acknowledged that the Department of Argiculture, Food and Forestry veterinary inspectors and people involved in the sport are willing to prosecute.  Let me reiterate that I would not engage in coursing but that is my personal opinion and it is the right of every citizen in the country, within the parameters laid down by Members in this Chamber to conduct our affairs as we see fit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is other proposed legislation that some Members in this House may not necessarily agree with but we have certain standards and norms that we should strive to keep.  It is up to us to put our <Col N="1621" /> rules in place and to dictate the type of society we want.  I understand that a very large percentage of the population are interested in the greyhound industry and in coursing and that should be facilitated, but if there is unwarranted cruelty in any shape or form, either to hares or other animals, that should be dealt with properly.  As I said earlier, Deputy Gregory has acknowledged that there have been successful prosecutions and there are impending prosecutions, so a system of monitoring is taking place in the State.  We have often heard: &ldquo;we are damned if we do and we are damned if we do not&rdquo;.  That could be very aptly said in relation to this topic.  Like Deputy Gregory, I received umpteen letters from people who are anti-blood sports but equally I received umpteen letters and communications from people in favour of it.  No matter what we do we are damned but we have a duty to put in standards, norms and rules which are in the best interests and desires of this State.</P>
    <P>I was a member of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies which spent much time debating the greyhound industry.  There were some very difficult topics which we had to examine at that time, one of which was the Sugar Company and all that debacle, but the most divisive debate which took place in that committee was the debate between the various interests not only within the industry but from outside the industry, as opposed to the industry.  The committee produced a report which gives some food for thought.</P>
    <P>Because I know very little about the greyhound industry I made it my business, a number of years ago, to go to a number of meetings.  Like Deputy Gregory, I tried to go without any prior warning to the people organising the meetings.  Those meetings were in my constituency and immediately I arrived I was recognised.  The meetings were in progress when I arrived.  I was on tenterhooks hoping against hope that no hare would be killed.  As it happened, maybe it was a fluke, no hare was killed. I genuinely felt the hare had an advantage over the greyhounds.  Some people may <Col N="1622" /> say, &ldquo;It was because you were there that no hares were killed,&rdquo; but I do not accept that.  The people organising this event did not know I was coming; in fact, I arrived late at both meetings and no hares were killed.  I was very surprised at the type of person who attended the meetings.  I knew most of those people and they did not appear to be bloodthirsty or cruel in any way.  I was impressed by the way in which the meetings were run and particularly by the organisation and how they took care of the hares.  I was shown exactly what they do both before and after the meetings.  That may not happen all over the country and I am not making any boast for my own constituency.  All I am saying is that I made it my business to go to see a hare course meeting, knowing full well that this Bill or some similar Bill would come before the House in the future.</P>
    <P>From the standpoint of virtual ignorance of the sport I asked at the time whether it was possible to muzzle the dogs.  The reaction I got was that perhaps it was but they did not feel the actual chase would be like what it was if the greyhounds were muzzled.  I understand from media reports &mdash; and I have no prior knowledge &mdash; that the Minister is investigating the possibility of muzzling the greyhounds and the coursing club have indicated they are willing to investigate it if they have not already done so.  It may be that there are difficulties involved but it is something that should be looked at.  I speak as somebody who is virtually ignorant of the whole scenario.</P>
    <P>If there are difficulties and if unwarranted cruelty and harm is caused to any animal it should be investigated and if the coursing clubs are not looking after what is proper in all the circumstances then action should be taken and proper veterinary controls put in place.  I ask the Minister and the Minister of State to ensure that whatever legislation they introduce will contain very strict controls in order to ensure that we do not have a recurrence of the incidents mentioned by Deputy Gregory.  I have heard of those incidents and I would be shocked had I been present at any of those meetings.  I <Col N="1623" /> know coursing people in my own locality would condemn it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gregory referred to drag coursing.  This is something about which I do not have a great deal of knowledge, and neither would most people on this island, but it is something that could be examined.  Perhaps the Minister could put it to the main body and the coursing clubs to see whether it could be investigated.</P>
    <P>This is probably one of the most emotive issues which has come before the Dáil for a long time.  Despite the fact that we have grave problems on this island I would ask people not be so entrenched in their positions and that they should accept some middle ground on this issue. Perhaps the Minister's suggestion would be the best.</P>
    <P>We, as legislators, should always be very careful about the way in which our laws impact upon the general public.  Not so long ago a man arrived into my office and asked whether he should apply for a job in a hospital.  He told me that six months earlier &mdash; on 1 January 1993 &mdash; he lost his job in customs and excise as a result of decisions both in this House and in Europe.  He then got another job on the construction of one of the interpretative centres in County Meath.  What happened there?  Because of lobbies and actions the man lost his job again within six months.  He came to me and asked whether it was worth his while to apply for the job in the hospital in view of the fact that the report was that they would be closing the hospital.  I do not say that in jest but when we come in here and talk about indigenous industries and creating employment we may very well &mdash; and Deputy Gregory may acknowledge this &mdash; put people out of their jobs.  If that is the case we should tread very warily.  I prefaced my remarks here by saying that in effect I am in the middle, I am the ordinary five foot eighter; as Deputy Shatter and Deputy Michael McDowell would know, I am the reasonable man, the man on the Clapham omnibus.  I would like to see proper controls and proper monitoring of this sport if it is <Col N="1624" /> being abused by certain individuals on this island.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I tabled a reasoned amendment to Second Stage of this Bill which, I am told, for a series of technical reasons is not in order.  That is a great pity but since the substance is more important than formalities I intend to say what the thrust of the amendment is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment was designed to tighten up the procedures observed at coursing meetings and to provide for a further and deeper reflection on the conduct of such meetings.  It was also designed to discover whether some of the views expressed this evening can be turned into regulations which will, while maybe not meeting the case made by those opposed to this sport, will at least give them the feeling that it has been regulated or controlled as far as possible. Our proposals would provide for the drawing up of licensing criteria for coursing meetings and the banning of meetings where those licensing criteria are not met.  They would also ensure the presence of a wildlife ranger to supervise activities at all meetings.  Before a course takes place and a veterinary report is issued the wildlife ranger could be empowered to ban or stop the holding of a meeting if he is not satisfied with the veterinary report.  They would require also that a study is carried out to determine whether greyhounds used for coursing should be muzzled during a meeting and whether meetings should be open instead of closed meetings or closed park meetings.  We also propose that in the light of all those factors, we should proceed with implementing proposals of that <Col N="1625" /> nature quickly and review the experience of the operation in two years' time to ascertain whether the case is still contentious or whether there might be a view at that stage that coursing should be banned.</P>
    <P>That is our approach and we believe it is a reasonable one.  It is not my intention to demonise anybody and I was pleased that Deputy Gregory avoided the practice of demonising people who hold a different view from his.  However, I have to say to Deputy Gregory and others who support this view that there is always the potential for making a serious error if we adopt an excessively anthropomorphic approach to what we are doing.  While I am not in any way impugning Deputy Gregory's intentions or sincerity, it is a serious mistake to view the world of animals through the eyes of a human and there is an element of that in what Deputy Gregory is doing.  It is time we considered where the balance lies to get a proper perspective of what is involved in any aspect of life in the wild.</P>
    <P>The argument about hare coursing has gone on for longer than Deputy Gregory or I can remember.  In fact, it has gone on for far longer than any Member of this House can remember and the reason is simple.  As far as I am aware human beings have been hunting since <i>homo erectus</i> first appeared on this planet. Hunting took place long before that; it began the moment insectivorous and carniverous animals appeared on this planet. Hunting has been an integral part of the food chain in the natural world since the existence of animals of intelligence on this planet.  The signs are obvious.  Even today animals which no longer need to hunt still do so and there are many examples.  My well fed cat is an accomplished hunter of mice and rabbits and regularly brings home the carcases of such animals, more significantly, she brings live animals home to play with them.  The hunting instinct is well rooted in that animal.  My dog chases hares on a large area of bogland near my home, although he appears to have only the chasing instinct.  He would be baffled if he managed to corner a hare.  That is a <Col N="1626" /> part of the instinctive genetic make-up of many animals and human beings, although I do not intend to go into that aspect of the matter tonight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is nice to know the Deputy keeps two hunters at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a practice in politics in Kildare known as stag hunting to which I am an enthusiastic adherent.</P>
      <P>The hare in the wild must be a prolific animal to survive.  In Ireland the hare has many predators some of them recently imported such as wild mink which have escaped from many farms throughout the country.  The stoat, crows and foxes are all predators of the hare to the point where the proportion of hares in the wild that die of old age is very small.  The hare is not unique in that regard.  It is said that only about 10 per cent of hares in the wild die of old age, the remainder die of disease, predation and many other factors brought about by modern living. Road traffic and farm machinery kill most hares.  Apart from road traffic and farm machinery, the fox is the greatest threat to the hare.  The fox population is flourishing and as it increases, the threat to the hare inevitably increases.</P>
      <P>I have heard hares being taken by foxes.  I do not know if Deputy Gregory has ever heard a hare being taken by a fox.  If not, I recommend that he and others who support his view go for a walk in the countryside on a still summer's evening.  They will frequently hear foxes barking and hares being taken by them, squealing in the way Deputy Gregory described in his quotation from <i>The Cork Examiner</i> earlier.  I do not believe anybody here would go so far as to suggest that we should stop foxes taking hares and if Deputy Gregory heard a hare squealing on the edge of a wood or common in the countryside would he rush to rescue it from the jaws of the fox?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know some people will argue that the fox and other predators take hares from necessity, but that humans do not have to.  That is a fair point, but humans still like to keep and breed dogs and train them for their particular innate abilities. <Col N="1627" /> The logical conclusion of the argument against hare coursing is that we should no longer keep animals that are natural hunters, even the ordinary cat, or try to breed out their hunting instincts.  That would be absurd.  It would be even more absurd to take the next logical step in an anthropocentric way of looking at the world and say that because we do not like to see animals hunted or killed or own animals that hunt or kill, we should breed out their hunting traits and do something about breeding out the hunting instincts of the human species as well.  That is the logical conclusion of the argument and I am sure everybody would agree it does not stand up.</P>
    <P>Hare coursing cannot be compared with many of the other blood sports to which people rightly object.  I do not think, Sir, that hare coursing could be compared with, for example, dog-fighting anymore than pheasant shooting could be compared with cock-fighting. Fighting between male creatures &mdash; and dog-fighting and cock-fighting are fights between males &mdash; is very common indeed, and fighting to the death between male creatures in the wild is not uncommon either.  However, that is most typically either in defence of territory or in competition for mates.  Broadly speaking, that does not happen with domestic animals, except perhaps in the case of household dogs that are allowed to roam free.  There are often cases of males of that species fighting fairly ferociously.  On the whole the circumstances in which fighting to the death between male animals happens in the wild do not apply to domesticated animals and they are not in any way comparable with the circumstances in which dogs kill hares.</P>
    <P>Neither do I think, Sir, that hare coursing can be compared in any way to badger-baiting.  Badger-baiting is usually intended to wipe out the badger population in a given area, an activity for which I believe there can be no possible justification.  I do not agree with the doctrine that is common around our countryside today that we should get rid of most of our badgers.  They are entirely <Col N="1628" /> inoffensive animals.  I know that people link them with bovine TB, but I do not think that destroying whole colonies of badgers is the way to deal with that problem. However, if we feel we have to kill badgers then there are far better and quicker and more humane ways of doing it than badger-baiting.  This is definitely the kind of bloodsport for which there is no need, and it seems there is no breed of dog in this country that has as a natural part of its genetic make-up the hunting of badgers.  There is no comparison between hare coursing and any of the other more objectionable blood sports to which I think virtually all Members of this House would object.</P>
    <P>It goes without saying that the last thing supporters of hare coursing would want is to wipe out the hare population anywhere.  I am not going to argue &mdash; other people may but I am sceptical about it &mdash; that the coursing fraternity are the greatest friends of the hare in that they have an interest in keeping up the hare population.  I do not think people are entitled to claim that as a great virtue on their own part, any more than I think their opponents are entitled to allege against them that they are diminishing the hare population, because they are not.  In fact, if one looks at the effects of coursing, even on the worst estimates we have of it, the number of hares that die as a result of the activities of coursing clubs is only a tiny fraction of 1 per cent of the number of hares that die in the wild from all the other causes I have mentioned.  Especially, they are only a small proportion of the number of hares that die of predation by other species, including the fox.</P>
    <P>Some years ago, Sir, a House of Commons Select Committee looked at a Bill to regulate hare coursing in the UK and it might be worthwhile if we reflected on some of the things they found.  I regret, Sir, that because it is a photocopy I am working from that I do not have the exact reference of the document, but I will provide it for the Official Report. The findings of that Committee were very interesting and I would recommend it as reading to those in this House involved <Col N="1629" /> in this debate.  What I say will necessarily be selective because I cannot quote all of it.  However, as far as I can do it, Sir, I have selected pieces that seem relevant to the debate and that are not loaded.</P>
    <P>On the question of kills and the dramatic photographs that we sometimes see, the committee said:</P>
    <P>The tug-of-war photographs do not, of course, indicate whether the hare is alive or dead.  Nevertheless, since it is admitted by all that between 75 per cent and 80 per cent of the hares killed die instantly, it seems probable that a similar proportion of those carried off or pulled at by the two dogs are dead. From the evidence of kills observed, the Committee are of the opinion that the pickers-up reach living hares and dispatch them within a relatively short time (to be reckoned in seconds) unless the hares are carried away by the dogs. </P>
    <P>That, Sir, puts Deputy Gregory's remarks in a perspective that is not given by the rather artistic and flowing prose he read from one newspaper article.  On the general question of physical suffering the Committee remarked, and again I quote:</P>
    <P>Most wild animals die a violent death, but this does not justify the infliction by man of avoidable suffering even if it is no greater than that which the animal will suffer in the course of nature.  The question is whether the degree of suffering caused by a sport is such as would justify legislation to ban that sport.  The Committee conclude that a hare which dies instantly on being caught by a dog cannot be said to suffer physically, but that a hare which is caught but not killed suffers physically until it is dispatched. </P>
    <P>That again, Sir, puts comments and reports about hares being killed at meetings in a different perspective from the one we get from the reports we normally hear.</P>
    <P>On the question of what might be called mental suffering the Committee said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1630" /> The hare is a prey species, that is to say, it has evolved with the capacity to move with great speed and to escape from its predators by that means and by jinking.  Its flight is a natural instinctive and behavioural response; it is, in fact, a normal state of affairs.  Just as it is biologically necessary for an animal to heed the warnings of physical pain, so also is it biologically necessary that an animal of that prey species should not suffer psychologically by reason of being chased.  If an animal did so suffer, its capacity to escape would be impaired and the species would risk elimination by the process of natural selection.  In addition to these considerations, it must be observed that an animal of a prey species like the hare has also evolved the capacity instinctively to resume, very quickly after the chase is over, exactly what it was doing before the chase began. </P>
    <P>That again, Sir, puts a great deal of what has been talked about here in the perspective &mdash; the proper perspective, I would argue &mdash; of the natural world.  It is interesting to reflect on the conclusions of that Committee.  In its conclusions the Committee stated the following: &ldquo;The Committee do not believe that chasing the hare causes terror.&rdquo; That is in keeping with what was said earlier.  The committee went on to say: &ldquo;The ethical question should in their opinion be for the individual conscience and not for legislation&rdquo;.  That is an important principle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy would be good enough to listen, as I listened to <Col N="1631" /> him, he will hear what I have to say. I think it is an important consideration whether a question of this kind should be for the individual conscience or for legislation.  I will reveal my prejudice immediately.  In any case of this kind where there is an argument as to whether a matter should be dealt with by individual conscience or by legislation, my instinctive reaction is always to leave it to the individual conscience if that can realistically and properly be done.</P>
      <P>Tomorrow night in this House we are going to debate a Bill the aim of which is to take out of the area of legislation a certain area of human conduct and hand it back to individual conscience.  I expect &mdash; though I may be wrong &mdash; that Deputy Gregory is going to support that Bill and a good many other Members of this House, who have the same view that Deputy Gregory has about the issue we are discussing now, are also, I hope, going to support that Bill.  I would recommend strongly that they support it if they had any notions of doing otherwise, but that is another day's work.  That, I think, Sir, illustrates the point that there are some areas of human conduct where, try as we might, the law may not be able to deal with all eventualities and where in any case the law is probably going to make an ass of itself if it tries to go too far.</P>
      <P>I have made the point that the number of hares killed at coursing meetings constitutes only a very tiny fraction of the total number of hares that die in any given year.  I hope, Sir, that I have put it into a perspective that is a little different but more in keeping with the rhythms of nature than we tend to hear during the course of this debate.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 6, to delete lines 30 to 36 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  (a)  The Consultative Committee shall consist of 9 members appointed from time to time by the Minister, of whom two shall be directly appointed by the Minister and, subject to paragraph (b), one each shall be appointed by the Minister on the nomination of&mdash;</P>
      <P> (i)  the Minister for Health,</P>
      <P>(ii)  the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland,</P>
      <P>(iii)  the Veterinary Council established under the Veterinary Surgeons Act, 1931,</P>
      <P>(iv)  one or more organisations prescribed, for the time being, for the purpose of this subparagraph which, in the opinion of the Minister, are representative of persons whose profession or occupation relates to the manufacture, distribution, sale or supply of animal remedies,</P>
      <P>(v)  one or more organisations prescribed, for the time being, for the purpose of this subparagraph which, in the opinion of the Minister, are representative of persons whose profession or occupation relates to livestock farming or the keeping or rearing of animals to which this Act applies or to the use of animal remedies,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(vi)  one or more organisations prescribed, for the time being, for the purpose of this subparagraph which, in the opinion of the Minister, are concerned with the production of food of animal origin or the promotion or development of the food industry, and <Col N="1633" /> (vii)  one or more organisations prescribed, for the time being, for the purpose of this subparagraph which, in the opinion of the Minister, are concerned with consumer interests. </P>
    <P>(b)  Where an organisation or organisations duly prescribed under subparagraph (iv), (v), (vi) or (vii) of paragraph (a) for the purpose of nominating a person to be appointed as a member of the Consultative Committee fail to duly nominate a person, the Minister may, in the place of such a person, appoint to the Committee a person who, in the opinion of the Minister and having regard to the interests involved, would be an appropriate person to have been nominated as such a member for those interests.</P>
    <P>(c)  In this subsection &ldquo;prescribed&rdquo; means prescribed by regulations made by the Minister for the purpose of this subsection.  </P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I undertook to amend this section in order to provide for the appointment of persons to the Animal Remedies Consultative Committee who would be representative of the various groups and interests who may be affected by secondary legislation in this area.  On Committee Stage I did not consider it appropriate to mention the bodies who would make the nominations. This was not because I was in any way opposed to seeking and accepting nominations from the bodies mentioned by the Opposition spokesperson.  It is a matter of procedure rather than a principle. I have already explained that for such an important committee the Minister must be in a position to ensure the Members appointed to represent particular interests are nominated by the most representative group in that area. The difficulty about naming non-statutory representative bodies in primary legislation is that if it is ever necessary to change or replace those bodies it would become necessary to amend the Act.</P>
    <P>A similar committee was established under the 1956 Act which is being replaced by this Bill and I must point <Col N="1634" /> out to the Deputies that many of the organisations which made nominations for appointment to the area consultative committee are no longer with us.  As an organisation concerned was not specifically mentioned in the Act it was possible to call upon suitable replacements.  I am, therefore, providing that the nominating bodies should be named in regulations made under this section.  This mechanism will ensure the desired transparency, coupled with the necessary flexibility, to ensure that an effective committee can be put in place.</P>
    <P>In relation to two interest groups, namely, pharmacists and veterinary surgeons, I am providing specifically in the Bill for the statutory bodies which regulate those professions.  Because they are statutory bodies any change in the Constitution must be provided for by statute and the necessary changes to this Bill can be provided for when this takes place.</P>
    <P>The mechanism for appointing members to the committee is based on that used for the appointment of members to the Environmental Protection Agency.  This House is agreed this method ensures both transparency in the appointment process and proper representation of all legitimate interests.  For these reasons I regret I am not in a position to accept Deputy Dukes' amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I will set the Minister's mind at rest, I do not intend to move amendment No. 2.  The Minister's amendment No. 1 is very satisfactory and I thank the Minister for going as far as he has in his amendment.  In the circumstances, his amendment is a reasonable response to what has been proposed. I note that of the nine members of the committee seven are eartagged so the Minister has some leeway in terms of the appointment of the other two members and I welcome that.  Further, the Minister has provided that those persons will be appointed by regulations and I will not argue with or cavil at the Minister about the form of regulations except to take the opportunity to make the point that it seems the appointment of members of a <Col N="1635" /> committee of this kind is the type of matter which is properly dealt with administratively and, therefore, the type of regulations that need to be made are appropriately ones that do not require an active vote of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  For future reference in regard to future Bills, I ask the Minister to reflect on the difference there is between the appointment of members to a committee like this, undoubtedly an important matter, which can be carried out in a quasi-administrative fashion, and other matters dealt with elsewhere in this Bill which are dealt with by the same type of regulation which I consider is totally inappropriate.  From what I have said, I am sure the Minister will discern that I am broadly in favour of the amendment. I thank him for widening the scope of representation in the committee.  I will not make any other inferences or charges in advance about how those people will be picked because I am aware the Minister will have a completely impeccable approach in that regard.  I hope he will ensure that his successors on that side of the House will have a similar impeccable approach and they would, of course, be beyond question if they came from this side of the House.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Minister accepting the points made by Opposition spokespersons on Committee Stage of this Bill.  The Minister said he would bring forward his own amendment on Report Stage to achieve what Members requested.  His proposals are fully in line with what Deputy Dukes and I sought on Second Stage.  Members of all parties who spoke, supported the amendment we tabled.  Would the Minister indicate what measures he proposes adopting in making his selection between the various organisations which may qualify under the headings he has given?  The Minister in his amendment provided that one representative would represent a profession or occupation relating to the manufacture, distribution sale or supply of animal remedies.  Another representative would be from the area of production of <Col N="1636" /> food of an animal origin or development of the food industry.  The other main interest to be represented would be the consumer interest.  There is a procedure contained in other legislation whereby the Minister places a public advertisement inviting persons who have an interest in being considered for nomination to put forward their proposals or make themselves known.  The Minister does not explain what method he will employ to arrive at the point where he actually selects a person.  For instance, under amendment No. 1 (2) (a) (iv) the Minister states:</P>
      <P>one or more organisations prescribed, for the time being, for the purpose of this subparagraph which, in the opinion of the Minister, are representative of persons whose profession or occupation relates to the manufacture, distribution, sale or supply of animal remedies. </P>
      <P>Could the Minister elaborate a little more on the procedures that he intends adopting in order to arrive at the point where he actually makes the selection?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the fact that the Minister has taken on board the various recommendations from the Opposition.  I tabled an amendment relating to consumers and I am glad that the Minister has provided a framework that will give consumers an opportunity to be represented on this body.  I would like the Minister to reply to two points. First, I raised the question of the accountability of this body and the matter was voted down on Committee Stage.  I do not know whether this can be incorporated into regulations but I still believe there should be some accountability by the body so that members who have been appointed by representative organisations will have some terms of reference to which they can refer if any controversy arises in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, on Committee Stage I raised the whole question of women being appointed to State bodies.  The Government has adopted a blanket approach by stating that there will be a 40 per cent <Col N="1637" /> representation of women on State boards.  However, in relation to my own experience, the County Enterprise Board for my county for example, was nominated and only 25 per cent of the members are women.  The Government's 40 per cent quota of women on State boards is being seen simply as a recommendation rather than a stipulation.  Can the Minister, within his remit, ensure that when he is establishing this State body it will have a 40 per cent representation of women and that that will not simply be an aspiration?  I am disappointed this commitment is not included in the legislation because my experience has been that unless it is enshrined in legislation in some solid form it is simply regarded as an aspiration and nothing more.  If I had known this I would have introduced it as a proper amendment but I was innocent enough to believe that when people said something they intended to stick by it.  If the County Enterprise Boards are any indication, this 40 per cent proportion will not become a reality unless there is some firm commitment to ensure that it will be a reality.  The task force on the needs of travellers contained the proper gender balance without any great difficulty. However, if a difficulty arises in this case I suggest that the Minister request each representative body to nominate two persons, one male, one female, thereby ensuring that the commitment made by the Government to allow women to take their place as equals on these boards will become a reality. We must give women power and input into the decision making process of Government.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank all three Deputies for their constructive response to my amendment.  In keeping with the spirit of this entire debate I responded to requests from the far side of the House to increase the representation from seven to nine so that the views expressed by the Deputies regarding broad representation could be incorporated in the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank Deputy Dukes for agreeing to my amendment and I compliment him and all the Members of the House for <Col N="1638" /> their almost united approach to dealing with what, for all of us and the country generally, is a serious matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy asked about the eventual structure and representation of the consultative committee.  I have no responsibility in that regard.  The Minister for Health will make a nomination, the Veterinary Council will make another and the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland will make their nomination to the committee.  Obviously the farming organisations will be consulted and asked to nominate their representative to the board.  All Deputies expressed an interest in the food industry.  I was extremely anxious that the food sector would have a strong and unified voice and therefore, we will be asking organisations such as CBF, An Bord Bainne, meat processors, co-operatives and so on, to nominate their representative to the consultative committee.  I am doing it on that basis so that when they make their individual nominations, the other constituent organisations within the broad framework will have, say, a conduit into the committee through their representative. That also answers the query by Deputy McManus on accountability.  The nominee from, for example, the food sector would have to report back to the broader constituency base, the various organisations. I hope there will be a great degree of transparency and accountability in relation to the involvement of the various organisations and their official nominee.</P>
    <P>As regards the Minister's two nominees, when all organisations have made their submissions I hope the House will agree that I should have the freedom to take an overview of the committee so that if there is an obvious omission from the broad representation on the committee I can use my two nominees specifically to redress that weakness, if I could call it that.  I sincerely thank the Deputies concerned for their objective comments.</P>

      <P>The Government has made a very clear statement on representation of women on State boards and other subsidiary bodies.  In this instance we are simply asking consumer organisations and constituent organisations to nominate a person for appointment to the consultative committee.  All we can do in those circumstances is to mention in communications with these organisations or in the announcement that it is the wish of the Government, and is part of Government policy, that women should be represented as referred to by Deputy McManus.  It is not possible under this legislation to instruct the nominating organisations and bodies that they must nominate a woman.  If I were to do that I would be restricting the bodies in their freedom to nominate whom I hope would be the person most qualified.  I am sure Deputy McManus accepts that women may be as qualified as men, but that imposition should not be put on the nominating bodies.  I am not in a position to give any specific instructions in this regard except to state the Government's guidelines on the filing of vacancies in State bodies.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 8, to delete lines 11 to 13.</P>
      <P>I tabled this amendment to find out what exactly the Minister has in mind in subsection (3) of section 4.  This subsection provides that certain requirements set out in subsection (1) shall not apply to the importation in bulk of an animal remedy otherwise than in the container or outer wrapper in which it is intended to be put on sale.  There is a link between this amendment and a later amendment which relates to a matter we discussed on Committee Stage.  The Minister indicated on Committee Stage in response to amendments we tabled that he was considering licensing of the wholesale and retail trade in the products we are talking about&mdash;the Minister will have an opportunity to deal in greater detail with that matter when we come to the relevant amendment.  As subsection (3) of this section exempts bulk imports from labelling requirements we are losing the first link in the chain that needs to be put in place in order to track these products from the time they first appear on our territory to the time they are finally used. The Minister agreed on Committee Stage that it would be desirable to have this kind of tracking mechanism for many reasons, not least of which is our concern with health, particularly of humans and also of animals.  If products imported in bulk are unidentified the possibility of tracking these products through the system is weakened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1642" /> This amendment seeks to remove that exemption so that the requirement to state what the product is will exist whether the product is imported in bulk or in broken down packages.  The Minister's amendment No. 4 does not meet my concern.  If amendment No. 3 is not made the Minister's amendment No. 4 cannot have any effect in terms of items imported in bulk.  My concern is left unaddressed.  We still may have products coming in that cannot be identified and, if unscrupulous people get hold of them at that stage, they will work their way through the system without us having track of them.  What is the Minister's response to that fear?</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully understand the Deputy's concern that bulk animal remedies should not enjoy unhindered and unlabelled access to the marketplace.  I share the Deputy's sentiments.  However, I cannot agree that it is reasonable or even feasible to require a bulk product to be labelled in the same way as proprietary products.  I hope the Deputy agrees that I have taken due note in my amendment No. 4 of the concern expressed on Committee Stage.  On Committee Stage I undertook to look at the total exemption from the requirement to disclose the composition of animal remedies in a bulk state.  Having examined the matter, I agree fully with the concerns expressed by the Deputies.  My amendment proposes that the identification and disclosure of the composition of bulk animal remedies, whether by labelling or other means, should be addressed by regulation made following consultation with the consultative committee.  It would not be appropriate in all circumstances to require the exact same labelling requirement to be applied to bulk as to proprietary products.  My amendment will ensure that the bulk product is properly identified in an appropriate manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To satisfy the concern of Members, particularly of Deputy Dukes, in relation to the bulk importation of the products dealt with under this Bill, I assure Deputies that under my amendment all bulk animal remedies imported will bear <Col N="1643" /> a full chemical analysis and composition on the label attaching to that bulk product. The difficulty in relation to extending it any further than that is that it would not be practical or necessary to proceed further by way of quoting the various administrative doses and so forth that would be applied by the farmers or by the veterinary profession.  To deal with the concern expressed by Deputies, I can assure the House that all the bulk importation will contain a clear and accurate description of the contents in terms of chemical composition, the name of the manufacturer and the source of the product. That should meet the wishes of Deputies.  I am sure Deputies will appreciate that it will be easier to do that by way of regulation than by making provision in this Bill.</P>

      <P>In page 11, line 35, to delete &ldquo;for the purpose of slaughtering it&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage the Minister did not seem to be too sure why the offending words are there.  This relates to a provision in section 6 (2) (a) (ii).  It refers to selling or otherwise supplying the animal <Col N="1644" /> to another person for the purpose of slaughtering it.  I wonder why &ldquo;for the purpose of slaughtering it&rdquo; is there. While clearly animals sold in that way for the purpose of being slaughtered need to come under the scope of the provisions here, animals which are sold other than for the purpose of being slaughtered equally should be brought under the provisions of this section.  I am worried that the inclusion of these words would seem to take out of the scope of the application of this section animals which are sold, for example, as stores and not for slaughter. Are we to take it that a young animal sold to a fattener as a store will be regarded as eventually being for slaughter?  It does not seem to me to be the intention of the subsection in the way it is written.  I am baffled as to why that qualification is put in here, particularly since subsection (2) (a) (i) already deals with the question of slaughtering the animal.  It seems that the two parts of this subsection are badly drafted and do not really fit together very well.  They seem to create this uncertainty as to whether we really need to follow up on animals which are being sold as stores rather than ones that are just being sold as cattle ready for slaughter.  On Committee Stage the Minister did not seem to be too sure why those words were there.  I would like to know if perhaps the Holy Ghost has descended upon him in the meantime and if he can tell us a bit more about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>On Committee Stage Deputy Crawford raised the question as to why this subsection related only to animals being sold for slaughter and I agreed to look into the matter.  I have consulted with the Attorney General on this point and it has been explained that the purpose of this subsection is to enable certain presumptions to be made in relation to the slaughter of an animal or the sale or supply of an animal for slaughter.  The availability of these presumptions will, in conjunction with regulations made or deemed to be made under this Bill, place an onus of responsibility on every person who slaughters or sells an animal for slaughter and will <Col N="1645" /> facilitate enforcement of provisions intended to ensure that illegally treated animals do not enter the human food chain.  In this context illegal treatment covers both the use of prohibited substances and the incorrect use of authorised products &mdash; for example, failure to observe a proper withdrawal period. Deputies will be familiar with this in relation to the dairy industry.</P>
      <P>Subsection (1) deals generally with the possession or control of an animal or an animal remedy in contravention of regulations made or deemed to be made under this Bill.  The possession or control of an animal, the slaughter or the sale or supply of which is prohibited under this Bill of regulations made thereunder, is prohibited.</P>
      <P>In subsection (2) we are dealing with where a person has possession or control of an animal for the purpose of slaughtering it or selling or supplying it for slaughter.  In these circumstances the Bill is providing that the person knows certain things in relation to that animal.  The seller or slaughterer is presumed to know that it is an animal which has been treated with an animal remedy and that the animal will be slaughtered for human consumption.  Paragraph (b) draws similar presumptions in relation to an animal from which produce is derived without slaughtering the animal &mdash; for example, eggs, milk and honey.</P>
      <P>Without these presumptions, which switch the onus of proof to the defendant in an action, difficulties would be experienced in instituting proceedings because the party concerned could deny he had knowledge that the animal was treated with an animal remedy or that the animal would be slaughtered for human consumption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy's concerns relate to the possibility that a person in possession of an illegally treated animal may try to dispose of it to an innocent purchaser. The question of sale of animals and fitness for sale is not at issue in this subsection. As I mentioned earlier, section 6 (1) deals with possession or control for the purpose of sale or supply where such a sale is prohibited by other provisions of <Col N="1646" /> this Bill.  Indeed the sale issue is addressed also in section 8 which provides, <i>inter alia,</i> that it is an implied condition in every contract of sale that the animal in question had not been treated with any animal remedy other than in a manner provided for by law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, strictly speaking, it is disorderly of me to say this &mdash; and I will not press the amendment &mdash; but the Minister has not dealt with the question. If one looks at the text of section 6 (1) (a), (b) and (c) and compares it with the text of section 6 (2) (a), (b) and (c) the only real difference of intent between them is the qualification in subsection (2) (a) (ii) which contains the words &ldquo;for the purpose of slaughtering it&rdquo;.  The Minister or one of his successors may have trouble with that later because it seems to restrict the scope of the section, whereas elsewhere it includes animals held, owned or sold for the purpose of slaughtering.  I hope the Minister will not have to return here at a later stage with a technical amendment, because a court decided the words had created a doubt.</P>

      <P>In page 17, to delete lines 17 to 27.</P>
      <P>There was some amusement about this amendment on Committee Stage.  The Minister remarked that if Deputy Crawford or I had our way nobody would ever again be able to advertise a product on a biro.  The question here is the extent to which information will be provided.  The presumption in this Bill is that we are dealing with substances that are basically noxious, harmful or lethal as in the case of clenbuterol and others.  I know there are preparations in which substances otherwise provided for in this Bill will be used for the purpose of making other preparations which are medications or related products or substances that would otherwise be banned from normal use here, if used in different quantities and in different ways, can be medications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I really wonder whether substances of <Col N="1647" /> the kind about which we are speaking are likely to be advertised, for example, on biros.  A very restricted range of products can be advertised on biros.  I have one here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I would be much less inclined to use a biro with the name of a worm or sheep drench on it &mdash; although at a pinch I might use it &mdash; or even indeed one carrying the name of a Senator, which is what I think Deputy Molloy was talking about on Committee Stage.

    </Speaker>
    <P>My concern is whether this provision is necessary in the Bill.  For example, is it necessary to have so many exemptions, although I know they are restricted, and to detract in that way from the force of the provisions of the Bill?  In these matters we should always adopt a restrictive, not a permissive, approach.  I remarked in relation to environmental legislation, that where health is at issue we should never be afraid to press the panic button and worry afterwards.  It is easier to deal with the situation if one does that instead of not being worried at the beginning and then having to escalate one's response because things turn out worse than anticipated. The parallel is not exact but I think the Minister knows what I mean.  When <Col N="1648" /> dealing with substances like these our first instinct should be to be totally restrictive.  For that reason I object to the provision in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 8 (4), which this amendment seeks to delete, is an important element of this Bill.  We are all agreed on the need to control information in connection with the advertising of animal remedies.  Generally speaking, the information provided should not be less than that required to be conveyed on the labelling of the animal remedy advertised. Deputy Dukes made the point earlier in relation to the bulk importation of goods. It must be appreciated that there are different forms of advertising and promotion, with different media and audiences targeted by promotions or advertisements.  I thought I had convinced this House, ably assisted by Deputy Molloy who agreed with my former position on this matter, that certain media and methods of promotion could be exempted from having to convey very detailed information about a product they were promoting.</P>
      <P>I am not advocating a free for all in this area and appreciate that regulations will be drawn up in consultation with the consultative committee.  However, it must be conceded that, to require the entire contents of a package to be reproduced, for example, in radio and television advertising, promotional gifts and on hoardings surrounding football pitches &mdash; to give just a few examples &mdash; and in the arenas of agricultural shows, borders on the ridiculous.  As Deputy Dukes was unable to participate in our deliberations on this matter on Committee Stage he did not have the benefit of this explanation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Indeed they will not even be advertised in the pages of the <i>Irish Farmers Journal</i> We are talking about specialised products and their particular application.

      <P>(b)  requirements as to the suitability of premises for the carrying on of a wholesale or retail trade in animal remedies, including the security of such premises and their fitting for the proper handling of animal remedies, and</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend to spend much time on this.  The Minister said on Committee Stage &mdash; and Members on this side of the House appreciate it &mdash; that it is his intention to proceed differently in a separate context, to deal with the matters in <Col N="1650" /> this amendment, the licensing of all stages of the trade.  I wonder if the Minister of State would indicate if he has given the matter some further thought since Committee Stage and if he is in a position to state when he might proceed along the lines proposed on Committee Stage?</P>

      <P>Again, I thank the Deputy for withdrawing his amendment. We are at the point once again of agreeing in principle about what Deputies wish to do but differ on how it should be done. My objections to this amendment are twofold, neither of which means that I wish to take an easier line on the question of licensing of the outlets mentioned. First, the powers to make regulations to cover these specific areas are covered in this section.  On Committee Stage I gave the House an undertaking to introduce regulations of this nature.  In fact, discussions between officials of my Department and interested parties had commenced before the Bill was introduced. In regulating these outlets the Minister must be able to consider a wide range of issues in deciding on whether to grant a licence to engage in these activities. These considerations, if dealt with by way of regulations, can be regularly reviewed in the light of experience and the prevailing circumstances and the benefit of the experience and expertise of the consultative committee can also be availed of.</P>
      <P>My concern with Deputy Dukes' amendment, which has been withdrawn, is that rather than giving the Minister powers to consider a wide range of issues in deciding whether to grant a licence, which I am sure is the Deputy's intention, the insertion of this subsection may act to prevent consideration of a wider range of issues to determine suitability as is permissible under the general regulation making powers available under the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My second reason for opposing the amendment arises from the fact that the licensing of wholesalers and retailers is required by Council Directive 90/676/EEC in respect of which I gave the House an undertaking on Committee <Col N="1651" /> Stage that the necessary implementing regulations will be introduced within two to three months of the Bill becoming law. It is perferable that we do not have a multiplicity of provisions all requiring us to achieve the same objective.  There is a real danger that such an assortment of legal bases could create the legal loopholes to assist offenders that we are anxious to avoid.</P>

I am delighted that this amendment has been introduced. I am aware that the Minister of State listened to the debate on Committee Stage.  This will be a very useful measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now that the Minister has agreed to include this provision in the Bill, I ask him to follow up the logic of it with his colleagues in Government and adopt the same procedure in relation to other matters. For example, it is not so long ago that there was quite a bad tempered debate in this country about whether a photograph of the licensee should appear on a driving licence.  Suggestions that the same should apply to other forms of identification were regarded by people outside this House as a case of, &ldquo;big brother is watching&rdquo;.  I am delighted that there will be photographs of little brothers and little sisters on these identification cards so that we can be sure that the holders are who they claim to be.  I hope that the seed which has been planted by the Minister in accepting these amendments will lead to further more rational action in other areas where that should have happened long ago.  I sincerely <Col N="1657" /> congratulate the Minister on including this provision in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise one small carping question. I suppose we cannot argue that a definition of the word &ldquo;photograph&rdquo; is needed since it is not included in the definition section of the Bill.  The Minister referred to computer generated images.  I question whether this may lead to some difficulties.  Even though computer generated images are not referred to specifically in the amendment, reference is made to &ldquo;...any other full-face image of the person concerned which is in the nature of a photograph, whether produced electronically or otherwise&rdquo;. Computer generation of images is a very exciting art these days and I caution the Minister about this.  One can do much with computer generation of images which may lead to the production of an image which one may not regard as a mirror image of the original subject.  The Minister has only to look at an article in last week's <i>Irish Farmers Journal</i> about an action taken by the Tánaiste, and for which he claims credit though it was my colleague, Deputy Deenihan, who first raised the matter.  The case concerned a picture of the Tánaiste which is a computer generated image.  It is a picture which was somehow frozen before it got to the stage of final resolution.  It is composed of a very large number of tiny squares.  If one looks closely at the picture one will see that all the outlines are in steps.  That is not the type of image the Minister has in mind.  People do not want to see a computer generated image of the inspector; they want to see a recognisable photograph.  Will the Minister take steps to ensure that these photographs are recognisable and not images which might have been fuzzed, tampered with or enhanced in any way?  Sometimes people like to see the photographs on their identity documents enhanced.  We have all had the experience of having our photograph taken in one of these photographic machines, looking at the photograph afterwards and wondering what it was that startled us to much to make us look so different from the way we normally look.  I caution the Minister about computer <Col N="1658" /> generation, a process which may have its own problems somewhere down the line.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not claim to be an expert in computer technology.  This Bill seeks to protect Irish agriculture and Irish farmers and the advice available to me is that the technology in the area of photography is continually changing and that it is essential that we be forward-looking in this regard in the legislation and include a provision covering these technological changes.  This will enable the composite identity cards for the various officers and officials who will administer this scheme on behalf of the Department to be updated and kept ahead of the various changes which are taking place. This is merely an extra provision in legislation which is both enlightened and forward-looking in terms of the future of Irish agriculture.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for putting down this amendment, in keeping with the promise he made on Committee Stage.  The Minister may recall that we had quite a job getting him to agree finally to include this photographic requirement for identity cards.  I asked that the identity card should carry a recent photograph of the officer named on the card, and I hope that that will always be the case.  I hope this requirement will not be met by way of producing a photograph which does not exactly resemble the person seeking to gain access to a person's private house, for example, a photograph which was taken when the officer joined the Civil Service 35 years previously.  I assume that commonsense will prevail and that recent photographs will be used.</P>

      <P>(e)  any thing used in connection with an animal to which a prohibited animal remedy has been administered or any thing directly used in connection with an animal to which any other animal remedy has been administered,</P>

    <P>Section 25 provides for an appropriate court to order forfeiture of prohibited animal remedies or animals treated with such remedies whereas contraventions can arise in relation to both authorised and prohibited animal remedies.  The purpose of this amendment is to provide for the possible forfeiture of all animals or animal remedies and related matter in respect of which a contravention of the law has taken place.  I am sure Deputies will agree with my views on this matter as not only consumers but pharmaceutical, livestock and food industries can also be threatened by the illegal use of authorised products.  It is, therefore, appropriate that this problem be dealt with in the same way as the use of prohibited products is dealt with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Unless I am mistaken it seems that the purpose of this amendment is to extend and broaden the scope of section 25.  The original section 25 enabled the appropriate court to take action and seize prohibited animal remedies and animals on which prohibited remedies had been used.  The purpose of this amendment is to extend the scope of the section to any animal.  Why is this change being made?  The amendment sets out the way in which the court may go about seizing these products and animals. I am not sure that this is any clearer than it was before.  Why did the Minister find it necessary to extend the scope of this section at this stage?  Why has the entitlement of the court in this respect been slightly changed to its entitlement in the Bill as originally drafted?</P>

As the <Col N="1661" /> Deputy will be aware, many authorised products could also have a serious effect on the food chain if improperly used, for example, inter-mammary injections administered to animals used in the dairy industry.

      <P>Will the Minister reply to a point raised by Deputy McManus earlier, that there be a requirement on the consultative committee to make an annual report to the Oireachtas on its work?  On Committee Stage the Minister gave an undertaking to consider this matter and return to it on Report Stage but even though he was invited to do so by Deputy McManus he has not done so.

      <P>I understood I had responded to Deputy McManus's query on the 40 per cent representation by women on the consultative committee.  I indicated to the Deputy that we would be inviting a wide range of organisations to nominate one person to the consultative committee but it is not open to me to specify to these organisations that they be required to nominate a woman.  I do not have the freedom to do that.  In terms of the formulation of the committee, and the notification attaching to it, I understand we will be bringing to the attention of the nominating bodies the Government's stated position on representation for women.  We have to be practical and we have been so in the debate on this Bill. Even if I had the power &mdash; which I do not &mdash; I do not think I could reasonably suggest to any one of the nominating organisations &mdash; which can make only one nomination &mdash; that it must nominate a woman.  I would like to see the Government's clearly stated position on the percentage <Col N="1663" /> of female representation being achieved.  I understood I had responded to Deputy McManus's earlier query because I do not like to ignore serious questions raised by Deputies on the consultative committee reporting back to the House.  I indicated that because of the constituency structure of the committee the nominee from that broad representation of organisations would be reporting back to the broader constituency organisations and, as a result, there would be an interchange of views and the transparency that Deputy McManus refers to.</P>
      <P>I hope I have not left any serious questions unanswered.  That would be unfair bearing in mind the spirit of the debate since the Bill was introduced.  I take the opportunity to thank Members for their co-operation in dealing with this Bill.  The House has had a major influence on its final shape.  The Bill is better as a result of the amendments made during the course of this debate.  I wish to put on record my appreciation of the positive, constructive and non-contentious manner in which the Bill was debated. Its basic purpose of providing a comprehensive basis to ensure the safe, responsible use of animal remedies and the protection of the integrity and safety of the food chain was fully supported by all Members, regardless of political affiliations.  It truly transcended all political divisions.</P>
      <P>Encouraged by Members' solidarity and support I look forward to bringing this Bill to the Seanad at an early date. In view of the difficulties we face, the early enactment of this Bill is desirable in order to reassure our consumers, and to send a strong signal to those who contemplate the use of illegal substances that they will find no support for their cause among Members.</P>
      <P>This Bill has as its heart the protection of all consumers and the livestock and food industries.  I would like to assure those who have supported it that the legislation when enacted will be vigorously enforced.  This is in everybody's interests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main purposes of the Bill are to implement the new institutional structure of the CSO, including putting both the CSO and the National Statistics Board on a statutory basis; to give the office new co-ordination powers in relation to the statistics of public authorities; to provide for the voluntary and compulsory collection of data; to reinforce the confidentiality provisions while allowing access to non-identifiable data for research purposes; to allow public access to census of population records after 100 <Col N="1665" /> years, and to increase the existing penalties to more realistic levels.</P>
    <P>I am confident that this Bill will provide the appropriate legislative basis for the collection and compilation of official statistics.  The Bill will, when enacted, increase the effectiveness of the CSO in providing for statistical information needs.  This will be of considerable benefit to the Government, the EC, researchers, economists, to the industrial, agricultural and service sectors of the economy, to statistical users generally, and to the public at large.</P>
    <P>I am sure we all appreciate the important role that statistics play in the democratic process.  Our society is becoming increasingly complex, both from the social and from the economic perspectives. In the information age in which we live, it is more important than ever that the Government, the EC, the Oireachtas, businesses, trade unions and other representative bodies, researchers, the media and the public at large have access to accurate, comprehensive and timely data.  This information is crucial in particular for policy makers at all levels to enable them to discharge their functions.</P>
    <P>The main source of official statistics in this country is the Central Statistics Office, or CSO, which was established in 1949 as a separate office under the aegis of the Department of the Taoiseach.  It currently operates under the provisions of the Statistics Acts, 1926 and 1946.</P>
    <P>When the public think of the CSO, they usually associate it with the census of population, the consumer price index or the live register.  However, the office produces a much wider range of statistics on most aspects of economic and social life, including agriculture, transport, industry, building and construction, the public sector, trade, tourism, health and social conditions.  The information is regularly disseminated in releases and publications, and increasingly in electronic form, such as on diskettes, magnetic tapes and Minitel.</P>
    <P>There have been changes over the years in the methods of processing statistics. The CSO was one of the first users <Col N="1666" /> of computers in this country, having been involved with information technology for over 30 years.  The use of this technology has increased considerably, particularly in 1986 when the CSO's extensive on-line computer network was developed.  All of the office's surveys are now processed with the aid of computers.  This has resulted in savings and improvements in the processing, tabulation and dissemination of statistics.  The office will, as a central objective, continue to keep abreast of the latest developments in information technology.</P>
    <P>Since 1973, the CSO has been part of the EC statistical system and is required to compile statistics to the same standard, timeliness and detail as other member states.  Increased EC integration, following from the Single European Act and the Maastricht Treaty, are resulting in further expansions in Community statistical requirements.</P>
    <P>I will now refer briefly to the important provisions in the Bill.  Section 12 provides for the appointment of the director general by the President on the nomination of the Taoiseach.  The purpose of this is to reinforce the statistical independence and objectivity of the post.  This independence is a standard provision internationally, and is in line with the 1985 Government White Paper which stated that:</P>
    <P>The full independence and objectivity of the office in the compilation and publication of statistics will be maintained, made more explicit and further protected by statute. </P>
    <P>This legislation will establish the National Statistics Board on a statutory basis in accordance with the provisions of section 18.  There will be eight members in all: five members of proven ability and experience in relevant fields, one of whom shall chair the board; an assistant secretary or higher grade from each of the Departments of the Taoiseach and Finance, and the director general who shall be a member <i>ex officio.</i></P>
    <P>The National Statistics Board was, in fact, established on an interim non-statutory basis in 1986 with the primary function <Col N="1667" /> of guiding the strategic direction of the office.  The functions set out in the Bill have, indeed, already been fulfilled by the board since its inception.</P>
    <P>The CSO will, together with the board, maintain close and regular contact with the users and suppliers of statistics.  The office already keeps in close contact with the principal users of statistics, such as Government Departments, the EC, research bodies and economists.  It is also in direct contact with the large number of business firms that provide data on a regular basis.  There were also intensive consultations with the main statistical users and data providers for the preparation of the National Statistics Board's strategic plans, involving correspondence with over 200 undertakings and individuals, as well as seminars and specialist liaison groups.</P>
    <P>The board has produced two five-year strategic plans.  The first covered the period 1988-92 and has been successfully completed.  The second relates to the period 1993-97, which was recently accepted by the Government and will be published shortly.  It is designed to meet statistical priorities for the next five years, and was prepared after very detailed consultation with the principal users and suppliers of statistics.</P>
    <P>The Bill, in setting out the functions of the CSO, includes provisions relating to the co-ordination of statistics <i>vis-á-vis</i> public authorities.  This co-ordination role is a particularly important aspect of the Bill, and was one of the principal features of the Government White Paper.</P>
    <P>With increasing computerisation, many public authorities now have comprehensive data bases which are potentially rich sources of statistical information.  In addition, the use of such sources for statistical purposes would avoid duplicating requests for the same data and the high cost of direct statistical inquiries.  It is one of the principal objectives of this Bill that such sources are fully utilised.</P>
    <P>The CSO already extensively uses data from administrative sources.  This occurs, <Col N="1668" /> for example, in the case of national accounts, external trade, registered unemployment &mdash; the live register, motor registrations, planning permissions and in the use of birth, death and marriage registrations for compiling vital statistics. It is quite clear, however, that much more can be achieved in this area.</P>
    <P>The CSO will have the authority to assess the statistical potential of administrative records and to ensure that this potential is realised in collaboration with the responsible authorities.  This is a priority objective of all national statistical services and is in line with the Government policy of reducing the data demands on businesses.</P>
    <P>The co-operation provisions of the Bill will have the effect of strengthening the existing links between the office and other public authorities.  In giving the director general the statutory authority for assessing and developing the statistical potential of administrative records, the Bill explicitly recognises that this authority relates only to developments that are appropriate and practicable, and that public authorities shall comply only in so far as resources permit. The section also places an onus on public authorities to consult the director general when they propose to conduct a statistical survey or to introduce, revise or expand an administrative data base.  This is important because the statistical dimension must be taken into account at the design stage of any new or revised computerised administrative system.</P>
    <P>An important part of the Bill relates to the protection of information.  The Bill defines the term &ldquo;Officer of Statistics&rdquo; to include, <i>inter alia,</i> all staff of the CSO. Each such officer will have to sign a formal declaration binding him or her to the confidentiality obligations in this legislation.  The statutory guarantee in the Bill that all data obtained by the CSO will be used solely for statistical purposes and be treated as strictly confidential is essential to ensure high response rates and the provision of accurate details.  This is standard practice internationally, and the existing national statistical legislation is also very strict in this regard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1669" /> An important change to existing legislation is provided for in section 34.  This will allow the CSO to provide &ldquo;public use data tapes&rdquo; containing completely non-identifiable individual data to persons outside the CSO for the purposes of statistical analysis.  This is not possible under the 1926 Act which provides that individual data, even if non-identifiable, cannot be divulged.  This is a standard practice in many countries, and it has frequently been requested by Irish research workers.  Research workers understandably wish to work independently on the raw data.  This will now be permissible provided that the units to which the data relate cannot be identified.</P>
    <P>Another major change to existing legislation is provided for in section 35. This will allow public access to the forms completed in the censuses of population since 1926, but only 100 years after the date of the relevant census.  These forms will be valuable for genealogical and social research.  Public access to census of population records after a lengthy period is the practice in a number of countries; in the UK, for example, the 100-year rule also applies.  The lengthy period is required to protect the confidentiality of particulars provided by people while they are still living, and to ensure the continued very high response by the public to censuses of population in this country.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the purpose of the Bill is to implement the provisions of the Government White Paper <i>A New Institutional Structure for the Central Statistics Office,</i> which was published in 1985, and to update the legislative basis for the collection and compilation of official statistics.  I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which is the result of a White Paper published by the Government in the mid-eighties to which the Minister referred this evening.  Statistics and the compilation of information based on statistics have been part of all our lives and, indeed, the lives of people for many generations <Col N="1670" /> in various forms.  The census of population is carried out every ten years, statistics on agriculture are carried out annually and external trade statistics and statistics on births, marriages and deaths are carried out on a regular basis.  I suppose one of the most famous statistical compilations was the original census ordered by King Herod at the dawn of Christianity. Obviously, that census and those whom it did not record had a major bearing on all our lives since then.</P>
      <P>On examining the shelves in my office before coming into the House, I was blinded by a myriad of statistics which I doubt the Members of this House have either the time or the ability to examine.  I doubt also if many Members of this or any previous Dáil know where the Central Statistics Office is located or have set foot inside that building.  I assume that one of the driving forces behind the publication of the White Paper in 1985 was the unique and individual insight into statistics of the former Taoiseach and Leader of the Fine Gael Party, the then Deputy Garret FitzGerald. I still supply him with reports from the Central Statistics Office, but very few people are able to decipher or read statistics.</P>
      <P>The Minister outlined six areas in which he considers this Bill is important and I agree with all of them.  It is important that the Central Statistics Office and the Director General of that office are independent and autonomous in their dealings and that the reports produced are accurate, up to date and, where necessary, confidential.  Obviously, anybody with a business initiative or idea must conduct market surveys and projections based on the type, quality and cost of the product which he or she intends to produce.  Statistics form an important part of the setting up of any new business.  Therefore, facilities should be available for any new business entrepreneur, organisation or authority so that such people know what is happening locally and globally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note that the Minister referred to the increased use of electronic forms of information &mdash; for example, the use of diskettes, magnetic tapes and Minitel. <Col N="1671" /> An important aspect of the work of this House relates to the availability of relevant statistics for legislators, who often pass the laws of the land with inadequate facilities and inadequate access to important information compiled by the Revenue Commissioners, Customs and Excise, retailers, major business organisations and so on.  A report for the information of the Joint Services Committee refers to the inadequacy of facilities in the Library research area.  Deputies, particularly those in Opposition who do not have the assistance of civil servants, should at least have at their disposal qualitative and up to date information in either electronic or properly researched form, because many contributions in this House deal with important matters without the use of relevant statistics.  We are all aware of the type of speeches and arguments that can be made depending on the quality of the statistics available. The old expression &ldquo;There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies and statistics&rdquo; tells its own story; one can colour one's argument depending on one's bias and judgement based on available statistics.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the co-operation aspect in regard to statistics.  He stated that public authorities will only comply in so far as resources permit. Most public authorities, particularly local authorities, have had computer systems installed in the past number of years and a myriad of information is available on electronic tapes in such offices.  However, local authority and health board auditors deal with large amounts of money with inadequate resources in their offices to compile accurate relevant statistics that would be useful in the projection of future work for public authorities or in the compilation of a proper audit and judgment of their performance, based on moneys allocated to them.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of confidentiality, I note from the reports on trade statistics, which are published on a regular basis, that it is necessary in certain cases to take steps to ensure that the business of traders is not disclosed by <Col N="1672" /> publication of full data under the appropriate commodity item or partner country. With the competitive forces that exist in business today a business could be wiped out by competitors overnight if too detailed information were made available. I would like an assurance from the Minister that when this Bill is passed into law, the Director General appointed and the Central Statistics Board set up, information that is supposed to be confidential will be absolutely confidential.  In the modern world, with all sorts of devices for acquiring so-called secret information, one wonders if anything is confidential anymore.  There are cases of deliberately leaked documents and information and of deliberately leaked statistics. We have had allegations of people sworn to secrecy on very confidential matters dropping hints or items of information that are picked up, misconstrued or used in a particular form.  It is critical where information is supposed to be confidential that it be confidential, particularly in business, and that there be an absolute guarantee of that.</P>
    <P>In regard to the social aspects of the information contained in the statistics provided through the census of population, 100 years is probably sufficient time after which the relevant census can be open to the public.  I note, for instance, that one third of the Australian population is directly descended from Irish immigrants and Irish deportees and there is a phenomenal interest in genealogy in the context of tourism.  Whether or not it stems from a desire to find one's roots, to know where one's ancestors came from and to know who they were, it is fundamentally important to many families that they have this information at their disposal.  However, there are instances where the acquiring of information like this, even after 100 years, can cause social divisions and splits.  I have in mind instances, for instance, like the famous Maamtrasna murders, which occurred during the last century, which were raised in the House of Commons by Parnell and which had a major bearing on the breaking of the English power base here. Even to this day there would be a certain <Col N="1673" /> amount of anxiety that acquaintances of individuals associated with this type of happening could be identified.  History does repeat itself and taunts and socially inflammatory remarks can be made.  I agree with the limitation of 100 years, but there could be difficulties in particular instances.</P>
    <P>I note that the Taoiseach of the day has an influence on this Bill.  It would be upon his recommendation to the President that the Director General will be appointed and with his <i>imprimatur</i> that people of relevant experience and ability are also to be appointed.  The Minister might tell us why a five year stint for the Director General was decided upon.  He might also indicate, if possible, the extent of the remuneration.  I would like to think in recommending an appointee to the President that ability, experience and gender representation will be taken into account.</P>
    <P>I note that the Statistics Board has produced two five year strategic plans and that the first of these has been successfully completed.  The lessons to be learned from that period should be taken into account by a new board in the 1993-97 report.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the Central Statistics Office being allowed to provide public use data tapes which would contain completely non-indentiable individual data.  The system under which that operates must be absolutely true to this sentiment.  That sort of information must be absolutely non-identifiable.  Perhaps the Minister could clarify that.</P>
    <P>Between-the-lines reading of the statistics gives an up to date position of the social and economic position of our country at any time.  In the past few years, for instance Telecom Éireann have sent out vast amounts of documentation to subscribers in order to complie information. The use of that kind of information given by identified individuals has resulted in many cases in those individuals receiving follow-up documentation from other sources.  In the light of this, public use of data tapes would need to be very carefully monitored. They must be absolutely non-identifiable, <Col N="1674" /> because a huge majority of the population do not want to see this type of literature coming through their letterboxes, literature based on statistical evidence of their age grouping, their economic position, their job or the location in which they live.  While the compilation of the statistics is extremely important, it must be absolutely certain that people are unidentifiable.</P>
    <P>I looked at the Census of 1986, volume 5, which referred to the Irish language. This booklet, produced by the Central Statistics Office, contains an absolute mine of information about every county in the country in the context of a very important aspect of our heritage &mdash; our language and our ability to promote our native language and culture.  Yet very few Deputies, who receive so much information, have actually read this.  Much of the information produced in volumes like this lies wasting on shelves all over the country.</P>
    <P>The wealth and range of statistics in trade statistics reports is mind-boggling. Yet such reports are of fundamental importance to business transactions as well as local authority and public authority projections for business and work. The enactment of laws in this House is fundamental to those offices and businesses. It is regrettable that the legislators who pass Bills into law do not have ready access through this House to the wealth of information contained in those documents.  I note that the report to the Joint Services Committee recommends specialised research units so that Deputies and parties in the House who wish to make meaningful, well thought out and researched contributions may have access to such reports.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Statistics Bill, 1993.  It brings to fruition a recommendation of the 1985 Government White Paper which stated that the full independence and objectivity of the office in the compilation and publication of statistics will be maintained, made more explicit and further protected by statute.  I hope that when the Bill is enacted and the Taoiseach's recommendations regarding appointments are submitted to the President, <Col N="1675" /> that they will be in respect of people of relevance, ability, experience and stature and that people will not simply be appointed because they might have allegiance to a party philosophy.  Following the formal establishment of the board and the appointment of the Director General, I hope we will be in a position to review the progress of the CSO after some time and that if further resources are necessary and if the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance consider that to be the case, such resources will be made available to the Central Statistics Office.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and wish it a speedy passage through the House.  I hope it becomes effective legislation as it is fundamental to the development of all aspects of this country &mdash; political, human, social, economic, agricultural and so on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  It contains a useful set of provisions for the CSO and puts it on a proper statutory and independent basis, which is important for its credibility.  The CSO is highly regarded by all those who from time to time use its services and read its data. However, I have some suggestions to make in regard to some aspects of its work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of all the figures produced on a regular basis by the Central Statistics Office &mdash; this is true also of other countries &mdash; the most important are the balance of payments figures because they are fundamental to the economic position of the country.  It is important that they be accurate and that they be issued as promptly as possible.  Unfortunately, in recent years the CSO had to revise, quite drastically, its balance of payments figures.  I understand this had to be done on two occasions.  It discovered what came to be known colloquially some years ago as &ldquo;black holes&rdquo; in the economy and in its previous methodology it had not been able to pick up the &ldquo;black holes&rdquo;.  I am not certain if it has been able to discover where they were, but it has, hopefully, <Col N="1676" /> determined the results of those &ldquo;black holes&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>One of the consequences was that the positive balance of payments which we were showing for a number of years was overstated.  That is a serious matter.  The balance of payments is made up of a number of factors of which the balance of trade is one, perhaps the most important single factor.  However, it is well known that our trade figures are distorted.  I am not saying they are false in any way or that they are reported wrongly by the CSO, but they are distorted because of the fairly widespread lawful use by multi-national companies in particular, of transfer pricing in this country.  The result is that our exports are overstated and the reality, in economic terms, is somewhat less.  We can only discover that on the balance of payments figures and, therefore, they are more important than the trade figures.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the balance of payments figures are correct, or as near correct as possible, and it is also essential that they are produced rapidly.  I have noted the balance of payments figures are issued a long time after the balance of trade figures here, although in other countries both sets of figures are usually produced simultaneously or within a short period of time of each other. Because the trade figures distort the position, and generally distort it positively, it is important that, if possible, the balance of payments figures are produced monthly rather than quarterly or half-yearly, as tends to be the practice at present.  If such figures, whether they relate to trade or payments, are slow to be produced, their value is diminished by this delay because they go out of date more quickly.</P>
    <P>One has only to consider the last 12 months to realise the international volatility within which we are trading and the necessity to have up-to-date figures.  It is not easy to achieve this and it will be more difficult to do so from this year onwards, for two reasons.  First, exchange controls have been abolished and, second, we are now in the Single Market and do not have the same type of customs statistics in intra-Community <Col N="1677" /> trade as we did in the past.  I do not envy the CSO its difficulty in adjusting to those factors, but I am sure it will overcome this.  It now has available to it many forms of technology which would not have been available in the past.  That will enable it to pick up such matters more rapidly.  It has been a serious matter for this country that the balance of payments figures had to be revised in a major way in recent years.  It may affect the credibility of our statistics generally that such a revision was necessary.  In my view &mdash; and I have been Minister for Industry and Comerce over long periods &mdash; the balance of payments figures are vital, especially as we cannot rely on the trade figures for reflecting economic reality.  Sadly, they do not; they overstate the positive position here.</P>
    <P>One of the other major set of figures which the CSO produces regularly is the consumer price index.  Over the years I have had much involvement with the CPI as Minister for Industry and Commerce when, unfortunately, inflation was running at a very high level and there was tremendous pressure in regard to prices. Our CPI reflects actual expenditure and I am not aware if internationally it is a statistical norm that actual expenditure should be reflected.  However, as an amateur, I would consider there are some drawbacks, where actual expenditure may not give a proper picture.</P>
    <P>One of the consequences of having to reflect actual expenditure in compiling the CPI is the fact that the weighting given to intoxicating liquor is, I think, 10.5 per cent in any given survey.  That is the proportion of disposable income that is expended on that item in Ireland.  If one accepts also that more than 50 per cent of our people do not drink intoxicating liquor, one gets a somewhat distorted view and I am unclear as to how one should weigh this.  An exaggerated view of inflation is given if one fully reflects the expenditure on intoxicating liquor because less than half the population spend any money on it, and it is not an essential item.  Other countries withdraw certain elements of expenditure from their CPI.  Whether that can <Col N="1678" /> be done legitimately or otherwise I do not know but, for example, the British withdrew mortgage interest repayments for a period and ran two parallel CPIs.</P>
    <P>Many years ago the former Minister for Finance, Ritchie Ryan, ran a tax exclusive index which I believe is still in existence but to which not many people pay attention now.  I am not sure whether it was of much value but I would like the Minister of State in his reply to address the question of whether it is valid to confine the index purely to the weighting of actual expenditure or whether one could and should take into account its weighting within the population to obtain a more accurate reading.  Unfortunately, one of the items which is almost guaranteed to increase by a noticeable amount each year is the price of intoxicating liquor.  Indeed, the Minister for Finance has complained about this in recent weeks and months, and rightly so.  I complained about it also, not necessarily because more profit was being generated but because of the effect it had on the CPI.  Of course, that was at a time when inflation was running much higher than the two to three per cent at which it has been running in recent years.  There is an increase almost every year.  Those increases are unjustifiable and they put an inflationary element into our economy which is reflected in unnecessary wage increases.  Some element, however small, of those wage increases would not take place if this overstatement of inflation did not persistently exist for that reason.</P>
    <P>Another of the periodic figures produced by the CSO on a monthly basis is the live register, as it is called.  I rather think that as time goes by the register becomes less live than it used to be because the live element of it is supposed to reflect people who are available for and willing to work.  What proportion of the 300,000 people unemployed come into that category is a matter for some debate.  One of the difficulties is that frequently we are not comparing like with like because the definitions change almost annually.  Would it be possible to give some kind of comparable figures for ten, 15 or 20 years ago that would be <Col N="1679" /> genuinely comparable rather than simply reflecting the various changes that are made, as I said, on an almost annual basis which really renders comparison impossible?</P>
    <P>The census of population every five years is probably the aspect of the CSO's work that is most noticeable and it is carried out with great efficiency given that it is a complex and difficult task.  One aspect that always amazes me is that they can produce the overall totals and the totals per county and county borough within a matter of months but an aspect of the count which is often of vital importance to Members of this House is the count for what are called district electoral divisions.  District electoral divisions are rather remote now and almost academic in nature.  They have no other bearing apparently other than for electoral purposes. However, it takes the Central Statistics Office two years or more to produce the figures for district electoral divisions, even though they are only a breakdown of the figures for a county. Since all this information is on computer anyway and the computer will give the information required almost instantaneously, I cannot understand why the figures for district electoral divisions are not available within a week or two of the general figures being available.</P>
    <P>There is a suspicion on the part of many Members of this House that that information is deliberately withheld by the CSO at the request of the Government of the day.  I say this having been a member of the Government for more than a year and a half after the census was taken.  I simply do not know what the explanation is for not producing those figures.  It would be a different matter if producing those figures required some further study or refinement but it does not.  It only requires the breaking down of a global figure and since the global figure was arrived at by a building up process the computer can give the result in a matter of hours.  I would like to know why the delay in this regard can be as long as two years.  Indeed, we could and should make more use of the data in the <Col N="1680" /> census of population.  I fully agree with the proposal that individual personal data should not be made available.  Some people feel that 100 years is too long but it is probably not when one considers that some people can live a very long time and certainly their children would frequently be alive 100 years after a particular census, and difficult problems could arise in this regard.  While I accept the figure of 100 years, the Minister should make some provision in section 35 on Committee Stage for those records to be made available at least to serious and genuine scholars at an earlier stage with the <i>caveat</i> that they would not abuse them or use personal data from them directly.</P>
    <P>It is an anomaly that from the twenties onwards the 1911 census returns have, apparently, been available to everybody but under this Act the 1926 census will not be available until 2026.  That is too long.  It will mean that people will be required to work off the 1911 census in 2025, almost 114 years later.  That data should be made available to scholars for the purposes of genuine scholarship.  It is far too long a period to deprive them of this information and it will cause problems for scholarship here if this practice continues.</P>
    <P>Another section to which I would like to make particular reference is section 17, regarding the appointment of temporary staff.  Every time the CSO appoints temporary staff, as it does for a census of population which takes place every five years, or an agricultural census which takes place every year, for labour force surveys and so on, allegations are made, particularly in rural areas, of obscure favouritism and disfavour being shown, and they are generally attributed to political reasons.  I do not know whether that is true but it should be made clear in section 17 that appointments are made by the director general entirely on his own initiative and that the words &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister for Finance and under such terms and conditions of service as he may determine&rdquo; relate only to conditions of service, remuneration and so on and the Minister for Finance <Col N="1681" /> does not consent to the persons being appointed.  I hope that is the case and perhaps section 17 would be re-worded to make that clear because it is a cause of agitation, particularly in rural areas.</P>
    <P>The appointment of people in rural areas to do this work is particularly sensitive because very often the person appointed knows everyone he goes to see.  It is very important that the right person be appointed because it is very difficult for some people to give information of a personal nature to people whom they know well.</P>
    <P>In general, I welcome the provisions of the Bill.  It is not an urgent Bill and it is strange that it is introduced at this hour of the night, at this time of the year, but I suppose it is better now than never.  It is founded on the recommendations of a Government White Paper of 1985 which was largely inspired by former Deputy Garret FitzGerald.  I can think of nobody more appropriate than he to have produced that White Paper and to see this legislation through because he is the only man in Ireland whom I know who, when he is drowning in statistics, suffers from some kind of intellectural orgasm.</P>

      <P>I wish to make a few general points on the Bill.  It is obvious that full and adequate statistics are the virtual oxygen of economic and social planning.  Without the detailed statistics provided by CSO economic and social planning would be a shot in the dark and would be very inaccurate.  If we do not know how many children there are in each area we will not be able to plan third level education ten or 15 years down the road and, if we cannot identify population shifts from one part of the country to another, we will not be able to plan for roads, houses or other requirements. <Col N="1682" /> We need an accurate picture of the number of persons out of work so that we can identify the scale of the unemployment problem and, hopefully, take appropriate remedial measures.  In the economic area in particular we need the fullest possible range of statistics if we are to compete with other countries in terms of wage costs, productivity levels, exports, imports and so on.</P>
      <P>The information produced by the CSO is of use only to economists and planners; the annual statistical abstract produced by the CSO provides an astonishing range of information on virtually every aspect of life, ranging from the number of in-calf heifers to the rate of inflation, from the number of people on the live register to the wettest day of the year in Belmullet and from the number of firms going out of business to the number of people found illegally on licensed premises during closing hours.  For anyone who might be interested, the figure for 1990 was 9.946.</P>
      <P>Serious flaws were found in a number of areas in regard to the quality of statistics produced by the CSO in the past.  In February last the CSO disclosed major inaccuracies which had overstated the strength of the economy and seriously understated the level of funds repatriated by multinationals.  At the time, virtually every party stated it did not regard that as a serious matter, but it seemed extraordinary that the figures which for years we were told were fundamental to the health of the economy and which showed a surplus in our trade statistics were suddenly declared to have been in deficit. The argument that that had no bearing on the nature or strength of our economy was probably overstating the case in trying to allay fears about what precisely was the state of the economy.  It indicates to some extent at least the reasons that despite apparent growth and healthy statistics in terms of exports and imports we were not creating the jobs which the figures indicate might have been provided in the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Significant changes in the way in which the live register figures are published by the CSO have had the effect of artificially reducing the real level of unemployment. <Col N="1683" /> I put down a parliamentary question in October 1992 in which I asked the Minister of State, Deputy Dempsey, to indicate the numbers on the live register for September 1992 and to give the figures using the same method of compilation and categorisation used up to March 1990.  The reply was that the number of persons on the live register on 25 September was 287,099, but that figure did not include 5,200 persons who were removed from the register in May 1992 following a statistical review of the coverage of the series, or 14,000 persons on pre-retirement allowance and pre-retirement credits.  The total of all three figures is 306,939.  As far as the public and the media were aware, the number on the live register was 287,099 but the real statistic of people out of work was 306,939.</P>
    <P>The Minister argued that a change was made in the method of compiling statistics in order to comply with changes made in other EC countries, to ensure compatibility between the bases used. However, the reality as far as the public is aware and in terms of planning to deal with unemployment, is that the live register figures no longer accurately represent the number of people out of work, and that is a serious matter.  In allowing the Minister to comply with his obligations and to ensure compatibility with statistics in the European Community, for the sake of accuracy when the live register figures are published the real figures should also be published, including the numbers on pre-retirement and those receiving unemployment assistance as smallholders and so on.</P>
    <P>The provisions in the Bill seek to ensure the confidentiality of information supplied to the CSO and they are particularly important.  People provide information on census forms and commercial enterprises supply information about their business activities.  They have to be confident that the information will remain absolutely confidential. However, a 100 year restriction to be applied to access to completed census <Col N="1684" /> forms is excessive.  Deputy O'Malley felt there may be a good reason for it, but it seems rather excessive, particularly in view of the value of these forms for social and historical research and when one considers the general 50 year restriction that applies to sensitive Cabinet papers. If there is a 50 year restriction on sensitive Cabinet papers surely a similar limit might be more appropriate to census forms.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides for the appointment of the director general by the President on the nomination of the Taoiseach.  The Minister said that the purpose of this provision is to reinforce the statistical independence and objectivity of the post.  I support the need for the independence of that post and the need to ensure that the public perceive it to be absolutely independent.  However, I fail to see how making it a condition that the President should approve an appointment on the nomination of the Taoiseach is necessary.  What would happen if the President declined to approve the nomination of the Taoiseach? If that is not likely to arise, what is the point in the provision?  I do not think the President would create a constitutional crisis by refusing a nomination. This is using a sledge hammer to crack a nut.  Other ways could be found to guarantee the independence of the director general.  There are many procedures for the appointment of civil servants, appointments to various boards and to the planning appeal tribunal, which seek to guarantee the independence of the people concerned.  This provision is nonsensical.  If the appointment was to be by the President on the nomination of the Council of State or something like that, that would be fine but to have it on the nomination of the Taoiseach seems to undermine the intention and to be reaching too high to achieve what could be achieved in another way.</P>
    <P>It has taken eight years for this Bill to be introduced following the publication of the White Paper in 1985.  It is better <Col N="1685" /> late than never.  Apart from the reservations I expressed I support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Batt O'Keeffe.  I welcome the Bill to implement the provisions of the 1985 White Paper.  The State must have the best possible statistics so that the Government can make informed and important policies.  Statistics were gathered even before the foundation of the State.  The Census of Population, with the register of births, marriages and deaths are now an invaluable source of local history.  In the past few years there has been an increased interest in tracing ancestors.  Local historical centres and genealogical research centres have been established to assist Irish people and overseas visitors.  Old records are an invaluable source of history describing social and economic lifestyles of previous generations.  Their continued preservation and collection is to be applauded.  Old records describe in detail people's literary capabilities and their knowledge of the English language.  In many instances only Irish was spoken in the household.</P>
      <P>Statistics in Government Departments are the building blocks to ensure that effective policies can be implemented.  A review of parliamentary questions will illustrate how essential it is for Government Departments to have accurate information to ensure the proper co-ordination and dissemination of statistics.  A range of statistics cover Government and local government activities.  It is only right to have a central authority with responsibility to co-ordinate the flow of information.  The staff employed in this work must be adequately resourced. They are involved in highly specialised work requiring high academic standards. The most modern computerised information systems must be made available to ensure the best possible service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides that the number of staff to be employed shall be determined from time to time by the Taoiseach with <Col N="1686" /> the concurrence of the Minister for Finance and that they shall be civil servants. It also provides that temporary staff may be appointed to established posts declared to be excluded positions for the purposes of the Civil Service Commission Act, 1956.  The staff of the Central Statistics Office must have a wide range of skills.  If the director of the CSO feels that the appropriate range of skills are not avialable to him, this should be remedied.</P>
    <P>As the 1985 report pointed out there are serious difficulties in the recruitment, training and retention of processing staff. The report states that as all recruitment of systems analysts has to be from the Civil Service panels, it takes about two years for the CSO to fully train a new analyst.  Many return to their original Departments or leave the service after a further two years.  Consequently, there are serious difficulties in retaining sufficient numbers of trained and experienced staff.  The CSO is prohibited from recruiting graduates who possess some of the required skills, such as graduates in computer science, into these grades.  The report states that greater flexibility in these areas is vital.</P>
    <P>If the director feels that these problems still exist his office should be properly resourced to overcome them.  Statistics are far too important to be relegated to a second league service.  Statistics should be accurate, informative and reliable.  I question the dissemination of statistics about the number of tourists who come to Ireland each year.  It is part of Government policy to develop tourism.  In the past few years we have been informed that targets have been reached and that increased numbers have come from various countries.  I question the reliability of those figures but I do not question that tourist figures have increased.</P>
    <P>We are also told how much tourism is worth to the country and statistics have been produced as to the average amount spent by visitors from Europe and the US.  How is it possible to establish these <Col N="1687" /> facts with any degree of accuracy?  How does one distinguish a businessman who goes abroad and returns with a plane full of tourists, from the tourists?  Reliability of information is essential so that the people who use the information can take appropriate action in developing their businesses.</P>
    <P>If the information published is not accurate, corrective steps taken by people who provide tourism services, hoteliers, craft manufacturers, holiday or car hire operators may be exaggerated or damaging to them and their employees. Tourism is an ever-increasing element of external receipts, bearing in mind the number of people employed directly and indirectly in the industry.  Every effort should be made to accurately collect statistics which can be relied on so that the tourism industry can take proper decisions, from an investment point of view, for its further development.  I appreciate that the provision of tourism statistics constitutes a very small part of the work of the Central Statistics Office, which covers a whole range of other sectoral interests, such as agriculture, building construction, distribution, public sector services and transport, the labour force, including unemployment, population and other vital statistics on prices, foreign trade, national accounts and balance of payments.  It is important that all such information is made available at the earliest possible opportunity, on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis.</P>
    <P>There are many other aspects of this Bill I have not covered within the general framework of the Central Statistics Office, ranging from the establishment of the National Statistics Board to the nature of information which may be sought from individuals right through to local authorities, indeed to the whole aspect of the confidentiality of information furnished.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I hope the fullest possible resources will be made available, by way of staff and equipment to the <Col N="1688" /> Director General to ensure the full and proper conduct of the excellent work we expect from the Central Statistics Office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. B. O'Keeffe Mr. B. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I must contribute to this debate given that the Central Statistics Office will be relocated in Cork.  The building is near completion, I welcome the personnel who will be transferred to Cork and assure them of a céad míle fáilte.  Cork will be very grateful for the economic boom which will follow their arrival.</P>
      <P>The Bill is long overdue.  This is the age of information and the Central Statistics Office is the primary tool for dealing with quantitative information since the introduction of the micro-processor and the resultant revolution in the scope and extent of data collation.  However, the age of information has brought its problems as well as opportunities, for example, one we witnessed in the past <i>vis-á-vis</i> confidentiality.  Nonetheless, the Data Protection Act should adequately cover that aspect.  All countries must ensure they make the best use of the information available.  Nowadays our difficulty is to discern and abstract the core message because, if we do not do that properly, as an industrial nation we shall suffer.  As a primary arm of Government there must be proper auditing and review procedures.</P>
      <P>The Central Statistics Office has served this country well, its reports &mdash; many of international standard &mdash; issued on a fairly regular basis.  Nonetheless there is always room for improvement.  In that respect I emphasise the functional nature of the operations of the Central Statistics Office, particularly in its presentation of information.  Certainly there is a feeling that the information has tended to be presented in a somewhat bland manner devoid of what one might describe as lively graphics.  I suppose the old cliché of a picture being worth a thousand words could well be applied to some of the reports which emanate from the Central Statistics Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1689" /> There should be greater focus in reports, so that their main elements strike a reader directly.  I question the timeliness of some of time reports, certainly in regard to the last census in relation to which statistics concerning many small areas for 1991 are not yet available.  They include those on employment, housing and educational attainment, which are all essential to local planning.  it is an extraordinary delay and the Minister, the Director General and the National Statistics Board should seriously examine the cause.</P>
    <P>In terms of statistical data, there should be a rationalisation of the efforts made to render such data available.  I am aware, particularly in third-level institutions, that there is a level of excellence in the work proceeding, but there may be a certain amount of duplication between the work undertaken by the Central Statistics Office and third-level institutions. Many universities have now established their own campus companies &mdash; some are in receipt of grant aid from the EC and other institutions &mdash; allowing them to prepare various reports and to make statistical data available.  I know there is a definite feeling within those third-level institutions that there could be much greater liaison between them and the Central Statistics Office.  I hope, when the Director General and the National Statistics Board have been established, that this liaison or co-ordination can be established on a firmer footing.  The provisions of this Bill provide ample opportunity for this. Obviously it is a desirable objective and constitutes another avenue by which this nation could have meaningful statistical data available from another source.</P>
    <P>Revenue gains from sales of the Central Statistics Office material are quite low, yet the cost of providing such material is extraordinarily high.  It is incumbent on each of us to examine the marketability of a product, to ask ourselves whether we are improving market forces or looking at links between producers <Col N="1690" /> and users.  In that respect there is a market waiting to be tapped, perhaps we should focus on something marketable and usable, which would help our economy overall.  Such an exercise would be worth while and we would gain much more in terms of revenue by ordering that type of market focus in the future.</P>
    <P>We hear regularly of the importance of import substitution, that perishable foods are imported here in enormous quantities.  Many statisticians nationwide feel there is an inadequate amount of information available to producers, people in the marketplaces, relating to both these extremely important areas, which can be creators of jobs and wealth both of which could be geared to exports. I am aware also that Córas Tráchtála is making important strides in this area, but the information I obtain from people in the field suggests that much remains to be done.</P>
    <P>Obviously the provisions of the Bill are of a very general nature.  I welcome the fact that the CSO is to be put on a statutory basis.  It will have to make optimum use of the information available and at the same time demonstrate vision and innovation.  It will have an opportunity to do this under the Bill.  For that reason I welcome it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to make one point. I do not know if it has already been made in the debate but it relates to the compilation of trade statistics.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I will be more brief than I had intended.  A few weeks ago I was given permission to raise this aspect on the Adjournment following the announcement of major revisions in our balance of payments figures going back to 1986 by the CSO.  In that submission I coupled that matter with the report produced in December 1992 by the NESC entitled <i>Association Between Economic Growth and Employment <Col N="1691" /> Growth in Ireland.</i> Both points are relevant because for a long time economists have been puzzled in trying to explain our comparatively healthy growth figures in the absence of the job creation that one could reasonably have expected would spring from reasonably consistent growth figures.  The revision of the trade statistics by the CSO helps to partially explain this phenomenon.</P>
      <P>For a number of years it has been the mantra of Government Ministers to say, in trying to cope with the extent of the unemployment problem, that the fundamentals of our economy are sound and that one of these days we will get it right in regard to employment.  It now turns out that the fundamentals of the economy are not as sound as we thought and the CSO has given us information that bears this out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the report of the NESC on the relationship between economic growth and employment growth has serious implications in explaining this phenomenon.  Let me quote one sentence: &ldquo;Huge outflows of profits, dividends and royalities reflect the remarkable structure of Irish industry&rdquo;. The NESC is referring to the role of multinational corporations and the extraordinarily high level of profits repatriated. This relates not merely, as it turns out, to profits repatriated to the country of origin but to enormously inflated charges for research and development, advertising and whatever else one can think of in order to make the maximum use of this country's relatively bening tax regime.  The multinational corporations have been experts at this for many years and we blinded ourselves to it.  I think it was Professor Anton Murphy of Trinity College who first discovered the extent of the black hole and we now find that the healthy current account we thought we had in terms of a trade surplus and its impact on the balance of payments is not so healthy as we thought.  Therefore, the question arises to what extent have we <Col N="1692" /> been fooling ourselves about the performance of this economy when such a significant sector can distort the performance of the economy in terms of the apparent boom in exports and so on.</P>
    <P>It is not all that long ago when the argument was used in this House, as a reason to persist with the extraordinary policy of defending the Irish pound come what may, that the current account surplus was so healthy and buoyant that we could withstand the speculative pressure on the Irish pound, hold out and win; but it turns out that others had an evaluation of the value of the Irish pound which was different from ours and, ultimately, we lost that fight at considerable cost.  Everybody was in favour of taking a stand up to a point; but we arrived at a point where the Minister, in trying to keep his finger in the dyke, was like the little boy who tried to do this with similar spectacular lack of success.</P>
    <P>This is a very important aspect of this debate and I do not wish to comment on any other.  However, if we are going to plan our industrial strategy, our economy and budgets on the basis of a balance of payments surplus which we do not have in reality it is important that we match our expectations and figures with what the economy is producing in reality as distinct from what we think the position is.</P>
    <P>I do not think we have had an opportunity to discuss this revision in the methodology used by the CSO, nor have we had an opportunity to discuss the NESC report, which makes sober reading.  The language used is probably as strong as one could expect in terms of deciding that what we have, in their language, is an unambiguous trade deficit.  It is a long time since we have seen such language used.  The report concludes: &ldquo;There is a sense in which Ireland's trading balance should be calculated net of this profits repatriation.  To do so would show an unambiguous trade deficit for every year between 1976 and 1989&rdquo;.  That is a horse of a remarkably different colour.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1693" /> I was puzzled then and I remain puzzled now as to how the Minister of State, Deputy Dempsey, in reply to my attempt to start a debate on this matter on the Adjournment, could conclude his carefully crafted reply by saying: &ldquo;In conclusion, I want to stress that because of the new surveys the balance of payments current account is now much more firmly based than previously&rdquo;.  It is marvellous how in the English language one can make a virtue out of necessity.  The Minister of State went on to say: &ldquo;There is a strong surplus in the current account since 1991&rdquo;&mdash; not since 1976 or 1986 &mdash;&ldquo;and though the revisions for earlier periods are sizeable they are now fairly historic and they have insignificant budgetary, GNP and growth rate implications and no impact on our reserves&rdquo;. I presume that the learned gentlemen of the CSO were consulted before the Minister of State put that telling rebuttal together.  I could not understand it then and I cannot understand it now.  While I accept they are historic, they are bound to have implications for our growth rate, for budgetary policy and, inevitably, for gross national product and output.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I am no expert in this specific area but I should like to hear the Minister's views in regard to it as it is an area which is absolutely pivotal to the economic health of the country, to achieving our job creation targets and to explaining why we have not created the necessary jobs even though, as everyone keeps saying, the fundamentals of our economy are right.</P>

It is a measure of the independence of the Central Statistics Office that when the method of compiling the live register figures was changed in 1992 it continued to give relevant information on how the figures had been affected by the changes introduced in May.  I make that point to underline the extent to which the Central Statistics Office values its independence.  I think all Members of the House, including the Government &mdash;<Col N="1695" /> this might not suit it at times &mdash; recognise that this independent role is the cornerstone of the Central Statistics Office. No Government should be able to interfere with this independence.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenny referred to the confidentiality of statistics.  This point has been underlined time and time again. There is no doubt that the Central Statistics Office has kept all statistics confidential. To my knowledge no finger has ever been pointed at the Central Statistics Office about a lack of confidentiality in regard to statistics.  Deputy O'Malley referred to a number of things which could happen in the Central Statistics Office.  He was speaking hypothetically rather than factually and I know he did not mean to impugn anyone in the CSO. His point that the Central Statistics Office has to be seen to be above any kind of political interference was well made.  I think all Deputies would agree that that has been the case.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the 100 years rule.  The importance of the confidentiality of information given in a census of population cannot be over-stressed. It is very important that people who give information in a census know that this information will be kept confidential. Deputy O'Malley said that section 35 might be amended to allow serious and genuine scholars access to census figures after a certain period of time.  I think this is covered to some extent by section 33, which provides that people seeking information for serious purposes may have access to it with the written consent of a person, a personal representative or the next of kin of a deceased person.  When the Bill was discussed in the Seanad reference was made to the 100 years rule.  I think, on balance, that the 100 years rule is about the right to protect the integrity of people and ensure that information is kept confidential.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenny referred to the Taoiseach's appointees, the term of office of <Col N="1696" /> the Director General, the remuneration and the level and status of the Director General.  It should be pointed out that the Taoiseach will nominate his appointees on the recommendation of NESC; he will not pluck someone out of the air or appoint a person for particular reasons.  These people will be appointed on the basis of their expertise and on the recommendation of NESC.  No individual nominating body is referred to in the Bill as circumstances may change at some time in the future.  It is important that the independence of the organisation is underlined and that the people who are appointed are of the highest calibre.</P>
    <P>No specific term of office is set for the Director General.  Deputy Kenny referred to a five year term of office.  The Taoiseach can designate a term of office at any time.  The purpose of the Bill is to enhance the status of the Director General and ensure that he has a high status.  This is necessary for his dealings with other Departments.  At present the post of Director General is equivalent to assistant secretary level and he will remain at that level in his new role.</P>
    <P>A number of points were made on the use of non-identifiable information from statistical analysis.  I assure Deputies that it will not be permissible to release identifiable information for any purpose and only non-identifiable information from the statistical analysis will be released.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte quoted what I said on the balance of payments and I will not change one word of that.  It was carefully and accurately crafted and, as the Deputy said, now it is largely historic.  The revisions were necessary because new information obtained directly from the companies showed unexpected large imports of services &mdash; to which the Deputy and Deputy O'Malley referred &mdash; information technology and so on.  The Central Statistics Office recognised that problems were emerging in the balance of payments on a number of grounds towards the middle to the end of the 1980s.  It took steps to ensure that its <Col N="1697" /> information would be more accurate. That information affected the current accounts up to 1991 but since then it has become more accurate and we plan on the basis of what is happening now rather than on the historic information.  I take the Deputy's point that one must have the most accurate information possible.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies raised the question of time limits.  We try to publish the statistics as quickly as possible.  However, we are dependent on firms and businesses supplying information.  For example, last year the CSO undertook on a statutory basis a number of sample inquiries in the services sector &mdash; this was referred to earlier &mdash; covering a representative sample of 6,500 enterprises in certain sectors such as retailing.  Although only a limited amount of information was sought &mdash; of the seven specific questions five related to business and accounts and two of them were more general &mdash; the initial response rate was very disappointing. It took three months to get a 50 per cent rate of return and a great deal of manpower and resources had to be deployed to follow up those who did not respond.  When something like that happens it causes problems and delays in publishing the information.</P>
    <P>As Deputy O'Malley said, the consumer price index reflects the average household expenditure.  I found the Deputy's point fascinating, it never struck me before.  The patterns are determined by the household budget survey and the Government has agreed that a futher survey will be undertaken next year.  The Irish practice in relation to the consumer price index is in line with the international approach and a tax exclusive index is published.</P>
    <P>Delays in publishing the census of population were queried.  The 1991 preliminary figures for more than 200 urban and rural districts were published within three months of the census being taken but the compilation of the final figures has to await the completion of two intensive processing operations which are undertaken <Col N="1698" /> simultaneously.  This applies to the 1986 census.  The area coding operation involves a detailed examination of enumeration summaries, maps and listings with a view to correctly classifying every household and institution geographically. Everything has to be put on maps and, of necessity, this is extremely detailed and time consuming.  It requires clerical scrutiny of the enumerator's maps and other field work documentation. A second operation involves the detailed statistical processing of each of the one million individual census questionnaires. Everything does not go into the computer immediately just the overall figures.  We then have to go through a detailed process before entering further information in the computer.  This is a clerical process and is dependent on the manpower available.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Mally raised the question of employing temporary staff and whether this involves the Minister for Finance.  A general provision applies in all of these cases and the Department of Finance has an overseeing role in regard to pay and conditions and so on in every Department but it has no involvement in the individual appointments.  Frankly, with the number of appointments being made at various stages, politicians are as well out of it.  At interviews, particularly for census staff, a balance has to be struck between candidates with local knowledge and familiarity with a particular area. Deputy De Rossa thought it was a little over the top that the Director of the Central Statistics Office is appointed by the President on the advice of the Taoiseach but this is in line with the appointment of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I do not think this is over the top; it serves to underline the importance of the office and the independence of the office.  Deputy De Rossa is right in some respects that it is largely symbolic in that one could not envisage the President causing a constitutional crisis by refusing to accept the nomination but we all subscribe to symbolic gestures at various <Col N="1699" /> times.  It is important to underline the independence of the role of the director of the Central Statistics Office.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hughes questioned the accuracy of the tourism numbers.  The figures are based on comprehensive sample surveys conducted by CSO staff at airports and seaports.  The passenger numbers are broken down into categories on the basis of the survey results.  I stress that they are comprehensive sample surveys because it would not be possible to stop everybody coming in and going out of the country and ask a series of questions to ascertain whether they are tourists or persons travelling on business.  The CSO try to be as accurate as possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe made two points on how the CSO presents its information and how it markets its services.  The strategic issues in relation to marketing and dissemination of statistical information is considered by the National Statistics Board and, while the statistical quality of the figures must be the overriding consideration, greater emphasis should be given to marketing in order to increase the revenue and improve the CSO's dissemination arrangements.  The board believes that considerable strides have been made in recent years.  Most people find booklets with only tables of figures off-putting and I am sure the National Statistics Board will take into account what has been said both in this House and in the other House.  It may be that it could be presented more attractively, but at the end of the day it is not a matter of how attractive they are; it is more important to ensure that they are independent and accurate.  I think I have covered most of the points made by the Deputies.</P>
    <P>I conclude by thanking Deputies who have remained here late tonight to make their contributions on Second Stage.  The points made have been noted.  Although Deputy O'Malley has said he does not see this as urgent legislation, I assure the House it is time to have out of the way <Col N="1700" /> any legislation which is around since 1985.  With the co-operation of the Whips and the spokespersons we will be able to do that before the summer recess.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>In one of the British national newspapers last week an incredible claim was made by a young Strabane man that for five years he was a paid informer of the RUC while at the same time he was a quartermaster in the IRA. He also claimed he was involved in the killing, in some way or another, of 14 people.  None of us has any way of knowing whether this man was telling the truth but we do know that he was a paid informer and that he was in the IRA. This has been confirmed by Sir Hugh Ansley, the Chief Constable of the RUC. If there is any credibility in this story we will have to accept his confession.  In the words of Sir Patrick Mayhew, if anything approaching this man's claim is true it is wholly unacceptable.  He claims, rightly or wrongly, that he was involved and helped in the killing of 14 people, including one Samuel McClean from Drumkeen, County Donegal, a young man I knew personally, who was in my home many times and who out of a sense of duty, came back to run the farm while his widowed mother was in hospital in Derry having a hip operation.  He should have gone back to the North of Ireland to his RUC station but knew that she was leaving Altnagelving Hospital in Derry on transfer to the general hospital in Letterkenny. He availed of those couple of hours to say hello to his widowed mother who had gone through a serious operation and this gave the IRA their evil opportunity to murder him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1701" /> Among the other things which Mr. Casey claims is that he conducted meetings with other subversives in County Donegal and that he had many meetings in the town of Letterkenny.  I should like to know whether these meetings took place before Samuel McClean was murdered in Drumkeen and, if so, was the Garda aware that he was involved in subversive activities and, if not, why the RUC did not inform them.</P>
    <P>Strabane has many contacts with County Donegal.  I was born and grew up in the town of Lifford.  I always considered myself at home across the Border in Strabane.  In those days I would have known as many people in the streets of Strabane as I would have known in any village or town in County Donegal.  The same would apply in the reverse order; many people in Strabane would consider themselves almost half Donegal people. The reason I mention this is that it would be quite normal for a person in Strabane, such as Declan Casey, to visit County Donegal without being suspected.  If he was a known IRA activist and a quartermaster in charge and if he was a paid RUC informer &mdash; which we now know &mdash; and they knew he was in the IRA, is it not reasonable to ask if the RUC made this information available to the Garda in Donegal?</P>
    <P>We often hear extreme voices in the North from the other side of the two communities on this island talking about non-co-operation on the security front. They believe that on this side of the Border there is collusion between the Garda, or some members of the Garda, and the subversive organisation.  Here is a factual case where Sir Patrick Mayhew, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, openly admits that Declan Casey was an active member of the IRA and Sir Hugh Ansley, Chief Constable of the RUC, admitted that for about five years he was a paid informer.  If this information was not available to the Garda in Donegal, particularly in the immediate inquiries following the murder of Samuel <Col N="1702" /> McClean, I want to know what is happening. The Minister for Justice has to inquire from the RUC and inform the House on this particular point.  I know we have to preserve security.  But I want to be assured, either privately or here in the House, that the information which should have been made available to the Garda was made available to them.  If it was not made available, then I protest in the strongest possible way.  Samuel McClean was part of the east Donegal community, serving in the British security forces, the RUC, as good an Irishman as I have ever met.  I knew him personally and if anyone told him he was not an Irishman he would be deeply offended and insulted.  He was a different type of Irishman from the people who killed him, nonetheless a better Irishman than those who killed him.</P>
    <P>I speak on behalf of the community of east Donegal, his family, whom I know personally, and everyone who stands for truth and honesty and I ask the RUC to explain, if they did not make the information available to the Garda, the reason they did not.  If Mr. Casey becomes available and if there is evidence to suspect that in some way he was responsible for or contributed in any way to the murder of Samuel McClean, I will be asking the Minister to extradite that man to this jurisdiction and make him face trial.</P>
    <P>The statements he made in the <i>Daily Mirror</i> are so incredible and bizarre that one wonders if it is true.  Had we not heard statements from people of the stature of Sir Hugh Ansley and Sir Patrick Mayhew we would dismiss this man as an absolute lunatic, but he has named people who have lost their lives and said he was associated with them.  As a quartermaster in the IRA he must have been at the planning stages of these murders and he would have known a lot more than the ordinary rookie.  This is a very serious situation.  A statement such as that made by him cannot go unnoticed. I am asking the Minister to clarify the position and put the record straight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>Both the Minister for Justice and the Garda authorities are aware of articles which have appeared in the British press alleging that statements have been made by a person claiming responsibility for a number of illegal activities including murder, while he was a member of the Provisional IRA.  I understand that the person concerned was today before the courts in Northern Ireland on charges relating to the murder of a former member of the Northern Ireland Security Forces and possession of firearms with intent to endanger life.  In the circumstances, the House will appreciate that I am constrained in what I can say here this evening.  All I will say is that the Garda authorities have reported that they have appointed a senior Garda officer to investigate certain claims made in the articles in question.</P>
      <P>As regards the murder of Constable Samuel McClean who was shot dead in the Drumkeen area of County Donegal on 2 June 1987, this crime was particularly distressing because the victim was visiting his elderly parents at the time to help out on the family farm.  To date, in spite of an intensive Garda investigation, no one has been made amenable for the murder but the Garda file remains open and any developments in the case will be actively pursued.</P>
      <P>Deputy Harte asked a number of sensitive questions which I will convey to the Minister for Justice who may wish to respond in greater detail at a later stage.</P>

      <P>Is ceist an-tábhachtach í seo.  Tá beatha na ndaoine sa cheantar seo i mbaol de bharr an staid in a bhfuil an bóthar seo faoi láthair.  Tá gá le cinneadh práinneach ón Aire chun an cheist chasta seo a shocrú.</P>
      <P>Tá mé buíoch den Aire toisc gur ghlac sé le toscaireacht ón dáilcheantar an tseachtain seo caite nuair a bhí seans ag muintir an bhaile seo an cheist ar fad a phlé leis agus a mhíniú dó cé chomh tábhachtach agus atá sé agus cé chomh himníoch is atá siad mar gheall ar an mbaol atá ann faoi láthair.</P>
      <P>Tógadh an bóthar nua seo atá ag dul ón baile beag, Uaran Mór, go dtí an bóthar ó Luimneach go Gaillimh gan é a phleanáil i gceart.  Glacann go leor daoine gur droch-phlean é.  Tógadh é sa bhliain 1986 agus tharla an oiread sin timpistí ar an mbealach amach seo go raibh ar Chomhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe teacht thar n-ais agus fógraí móra a chur suas ann ag cur ina luí ar thiománaithe agus ar dhaoine eile go raibh sé dáinséarach agus a bheith an-chúramach ar fad ag dul isteach ann agus ag teacht amach.  Sé an moladh atá anois ag príomh-innealtóir Chontae na Gaillimhe ná an bealach a dhúnadh síos ar fad.  Má dhéantar sin scriosfar Uaran Mór mar go mbeidh an trácht ar fad ag teacht isteach ann agus beidh orthu iompó istigh ann chun dul amach arís.</P>
      <P>Tá dhá scoil an-mhór istigh in Uaran Mór &mdash; meánscoil agus bunscoil.  Tá suas le 600 dalta ag freastal ar na scoileanna sin.

      <P>Tá na busanna scoile, ar ndóigh, ag teacht isteach agus ag dul amach maidin agus tráthnóna leis na daltaí chomh maith le gluaisteáin na dtuismitheoirí.

      <Col N="1705" /> Is príomhbhóthar é.  Is é an tAire a chuireann céad faoin gcéad den chostas ar fáil agus is faoin Roinn Chomhshaoil atá cúram na mbóithre seo.  Cheana féin tá an tAire tar éis £50,000 a chur ar fáil le obair feabhsúcháin de chineál éigin a dhéanamh ar an mbealach isteach seo. Níl sé leagtha síos cad díreach a bhí i gceist ag an Roinn nuair a chuir siad an t-airgead ar fáil.  Ar ndóigh, níl dóthain airgid ansin chun an compal seo a thógáil agus sin é an t-aon leigheas ar an scéal: go nglacfaí leis go gcaithfear compal a chur ann agus gurb é sin an bealach is fearr chun an bealach isteach a dhéanamh slán.  Ar ndóigh beidh tuilleadh airgid ag teastáil chuige sin agus caithfear plean a leagadh síos le haghaidh an chompail nua.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh an tAire in ann a chur in iúl dúinn go bhfuil sé ceadaithe ag an Roinn go rachfar ar agh-aidh leis an obair sin ionas go bhfaighfear amach cé mhéid go díreach a chosnódh sé an obair seo a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Deirtear go háitiúil go bhfuil an talamh ar fáil agus nach mbeadh an costas chomh mór is a cheapfadh an Roinn, b'fhéidir. Go dtí go ndéanfar taighde ar an gceist seo ní bheidh an Roinn nó an chomhairle chontae nó gnáth mhuintir na háite in ann a fháil amach cé mhéid go díreach a chosnódh sé.  Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil a lán iarratas ag an Aire agus ag an Roinn chun bóithre a thógáil ach os rud é go bhfuil sé seo chomh dáinséarach sin, agus go ndéanfaidh sé an méid sin damáiste mura ndéanfar rud faoi go práinneach, tá mé ag iarraidh ar an Aire anocht a chur in iúl dúinn go nglacann sé leis anois, taréis staidéar a dhéanamh ar an gcás agus tar éis an scéal a chloisteáil ó mhuintir na háite, go gcaithfear an compal a thógáil.</P>

      <P>Tá a fhios agam faoin imní atá faoin ngabhal seo, agus faoin gcontúirt atá ann do dhaoine a bhaineann úsáid as an mbóthar ag an áit a thagann an bóthar deisceartach as Uaran Mór agus an príomhbhóthar idir Gaillimh agus Luimneach le chéile.  Bhí deis agam mé <Col N="1706" /> féin éisteacht le tuairimí an phobail áit-iúil nuair a bhuail mé le toscaireacht ó Chumann Fhorbartha Phobal Uaran Mhóir an tseachtain seo caite.</P>
      <P>Tuigim go bhfuil comhartha `STOP' ag an ngabhal bóthair seo agus gur tharla méid áirithe timpistí ann ó d'oscail an cuar-bhóthar timpeall Uaran Mór cúpla bliain ó shin.  Is é an rud a tharla ag na timpistí seo, is cosúil, ná go ndeachaigh tiománaithe a bhí ag teacht ó dheas ó Uaran Mór trasna an stoplíne.  Tharla deacrachtaí ar an bpríomhbhóthar agus ag buaileadh le trácht a bhí ag seachadadh tráchta eile in ainneoin go bhfuil líne bán leanúnach ag an áit seo.</P>
      <P>De réir staitisticí a cuireadh le chéile ó Thuairiscí Timpistí Bóithre an Gharda Síochána tharla dhá thimpiste anseo i 1987 agus arís i 1988.  Tharla cúig cinn in aghaidh na bliana sa dá bhliain ina dhiaidh sin.  Maraíodh duine amháin i gceann de na timpistí agus gortaíodh duine i gceann eile.  Bhí cúig thimpiste ann agus gortaíodh duine i gceann eile. Bhí cúig thimpiste ann nuair a rinneadh damáiste ábhartha agus ba thimpistí beaga iad na seacht gcinn eile.</P>
      <P>Mar gheall ar an imní atá ann faoin sábhailteacht ag an ngabhal seo d'iarr Comhairle Chontae na Gailllimhe ar an Aonad Taighde Comhshaoil, an ERU, tuairisc a chur le chéile faoi i 1990.  Dar leis an dtuairisc seo bhí dearadh bunúsach an ghabhail ceart go leor ach go bhféadfaí feabhas a chur ar an leagan amach ar na comharthaí bóthar agus ar na marcanna a bhí ar an mbóthar. Rinneadh moltaí cuimsitheacha le dul i ngleic leis na fadhbanna seo ach gan cur isteach ar an straitéis agus ar an sábhailteacht fad-téarmach don N18 ag Uaran Mór.  Luaigh an tuairisc dhá rogha fhad-téarmach, is é sin feabhas a chur ar an ngabhal mar atá sé faoi láthair, nó an bóthar a dhúnadh ar fad ag an áit seo nuair a bheadh an obair ar fad ar an N18 ag Uaran Mór críochnaithe.  Dá nglacfaí leis an dara rogha anseo bheadh cead isteach sa tsráidbhaile ar fáil ón taobh ó thuaidh agus ón taobh thoir.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1707" /> I rith 1991 chuir Comhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe na moltaí go léir a rinne an ERU i bhfeidhm, seachas na cinn fhad-téarmacha. Tá an chomhairle ag déan-amh staidéir ar an ngabhal fós, ar iarratas ó mo Roinn féin, le féachaint ar éifeacht na bhfeabhsuithe agus ar an ngá a bheadh ann le tuilleadh obair a dhéanamh nó le réiteach eile a chur i bhfeidhm.  Dar leis na tuairiscí deireannacha a cuireadh ar fáil dom ó Staitisticí Timpistí Bóthair an Gharda Síochána tá laghdú suntasach tagtha ar an méid timpistí a tharla ag an áit seo.  Tuigim, áfach, nach bhfuil an chomhairle sásta ar fad leis na socruithe mar atá siad faoi láthair.  Ach go háirithe tá an chomhairle imníoch faoi iompar neamhrialta na dtiománaithe ag an ngabhal seo.</P>
    <P>Nuair a chas mé leis an toscaireacht ó Uaran Mór an tseachtain seo caite chuir siad in iúl dom go raibh an-chontúirt ag baint leis an ngabhal bóthair seo go fóill agus go raibh siad ag iarraidh go dtógfaí compal ann mar réiteach fad-téarmach ar an bhfadhb.</P>
    <P>Tá mo Roinn taréis staidéar a dhéan-mah ar thuairiscí timpistí a fuair siad ó Chomhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe an mhí seo caite agus d'iarr mé ar an gcomhairle na roghanna go léir a chur os mo comhair, ach iad a bheith inghlactha maidir le stiúradh tráchta, sábhailteacht bóthair agus cumas an bhóthair idir Gaillimh agus Luimneach déileáil le trácht. Tabharfaidh mé aird ar an scéal seo chomh luath agus a fhaighim an tuairisc ón gcomhairle leis na moltaí faoi na roghanna ar fad atá ann.  Cuirfidh mé san áireamh freisin ceist an airgid, ag tabhairt san áireamh an méid airgid a bheidh ar fáil agam agus na héilimh go léir atá orm go ginearálta faoi chlár fhorbartha na mbóithre.  Is fiú a thabhairt san áireamh gur chuir mé £50,000 ar fáil do Chomhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe cheana féin i mbliana agus mé ag súil le riachtanais an ghabhail seo.</P>
    <P>Caithfidh mé a chur in iúl don Teachta go bhfuil mé ag feitheamh go dtí go dtioc-faidh <Col N="1708" /> an chomhairle agus mo Roinn féin thar n-ais chughamsa le réiteach eile a fháil ar an gceist seo.</P>

      <P>I am not going to open it, a Cheann Comharile, because I know you would not like the smell.  It is estimated that 1,120 acres of potatoes have been destroyed as well as 468 acres of cauliflowers, partially grown leeks, parsnips and other vegetables.  Many farmers have been unable to plant next season's crops and so, on top of the loss of the ready-to-harvest vegetables, they face the loss of thousands of pounds worth of seedlings.  One young farmer showed me in his yard £7,000 worth of seedlings which should have been planted four weeks ago.  He will now have to destroy those.  As well as the £7,000, he loses the value of those seedlings which would have become vegetables.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be a great shortage of Irish grown produce in our shops this summer and it will be even greater in the autumn. This means high imports and the risk that some of these farmers that have been hit so badly will be out of business altogether. Conservative estimates of losses <Col N="1709" /> amount to £2.5 million in north County Dublin alone and about £8 million countrywide as well as the costs to other businesses like garden centres that have been very seriously affected by the heavy rainfall.</P>
    <P>Over 10.5 inches of rain fell in 35 days which is unprecedented and this has left crops saturated in the ground and rotting. I call on the Minister to make compensation available in this emergency so that the future of the horticultural industry, which I know is close to the Minister's heart, is secured, particularly in north County Dublin where it is so important to the infrastructure and which is also probably the finest horticultural area in the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister may not be aware of it but the Fine Gael MEPs have tabled an urgency motion in the European Parliament calling for EC aid for flood damage and I hope the Minister will give assurances in the House this evening that he also will take up the case on behalf of the many horticultural farmers both in north County Dublin and in other counties like Wexford, County Meath and areas of County Kildare whose crops have been devasted by the appalling weather.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I also endeavoured to raise this matter on the Adjournment. I would like to thank my constituency colleague, Deputy Owen, for giving me the opportunity tonight, or at least early this morning, to raise this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the last 35 days there has been an unprecedented rainfall of ten and a half inches in the Fingal area which has caused major problems both for farmers and those in the horticultural industry.  We have to acknowledge the role played by the people in the horticultural industry. As I looked at Fingal last weekend, where there should have been 1,200 acres of potatoes, cauliflowers, cabbages etc. there was nothing but acres and acres of water and this was rather distressing for <Col N="1710" /> people who are finding it so difficult to exist.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider this case on its merits.  Every effort should be made to assist these growers.  There are well over 100 growers and all of these, with their extended families, depend on horticultural activities.  The Minister should explore the possibility of getting support from the EC and from Exchequer funding and take on board the requests from Deputies here this evening.  He should meet with representatives of growers and hear firsthand about their plight.  As Deputy Owen mentioned earlier, we are talking of losses of £2.5 million.  The growers in north County Dublin cannot afford that. Although the Minister may not be able to give a direct commitment here tonight, I ask him to look seriously at the possibility of supporting the growers in question in every way possible.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies Owen and Ryan for raising this matter which is of great concern.  Regarding Deputy Ryan's request for a meeting, I will be meeting representatives of the IFA in relation to this matter on Thursday morning and I have informed a constituency colleague of the Deputies, Deputy Burke, of that meeting.  The Deputies are welcome to attend if they so wish.  It will be at 8.30 a.m.  We are early risers in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.</P>
      <P>I fully appreciate the difficulties and sympathise with fruit and vegetable growers who have suffered crop damage due to the excessive rainfall in recent weeks.  I have instructed my officials to investigate and monitor the serious situation which has arisen and I will also be asking Teagasc to co-operate fully in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputies will, no doubt, be aware that from a scientific point of view it is not possible to accurately assess at the moment the long term effects of the <Col N="1711" /> damage caused and any question of assistance is, in my view, premature at this stage.  My Department will be monitoring the overall situation during the coming months, including the weather and its effects, how the crops develop, the market situation and so on.  I should point out, however, that I can give no commitment regarding any possible payment of compensation.  All I can say at this stage is that there are no funds available to my Department out of which assistance could be provided.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  The Department of Equality and Law Reform was created to ensure gender equity, equity for those with disabilities and equity for travellers.  I am aware that the Programme for Government refers specifically to the need for the Government to give a lead by ensuring that the 3 per cent quota for employing people with disabilities is reached in the public service.  I understand the current public sector average for employing people with disabilities is 1.9 per cent, an improvement on the 1.28 per cent which obtained until recently.  The 3 per cent quota principle for the disabled was introduced in 1977, yet by 1993 we have not reached the 2 per cent level.  Very grave difficulties face disabled people who are genuinely trying to obtain employment. It is the Government's responsibility to break down prejudice by ensuring a change in attitude and enforcing the 3 per cent quota rule.  Not only should this be done in the public sector but I would urge the Government to consider how this principle might be operated in the private sector also, perhaps through tax incentives to employers or some such method.  In an ideal society such carrots should not have to be used but, sadly, time has proved that the employment <Col N="1712" /> opportunities for the disabled have not arisen spontaneously.</P>
      <P>The Clare branch of Cerebal Palsy Ireland recently published its paper and findings on employment opportunities in the public service in County Clare for people with disabilities.  I understand the Minister has received a copy of its report. The results of its survey are, to say the least, depressing.  The Minister will note from this report that 21 organisations were contacted.  Out of the 13 organisations which furnished the requested information, the research identified only eight people with disabilities working in those organisations.  According to this survey, the average of those with disabilities working in the public service in County Clare is 20 times less than the present national average.  This, I submit, is a matter which must be considered also in the context of the overall regional policy for the country, as there are great regional disparities regarding the implementation of the 3 per cent quota.</P>
      <P>At present there would seem to be confusion in the quota system arising from the lack of clear criteria for qualification as a person with a disability.  This matter needs to be addressed and clarified without further delay.</P>
      <P>The Clare branch of the CPI, supported by its national organisation, wish to see action taken by this Government on its report to enable those with disabilities to obtain productive employment and ensure their full rights as citizens.  I now ask the Minister to meet a deputation from the Clare branch of the CPI at the earliest possible date so that their suggestions can be adopted to provide immediate practical and financial benefit for the disabled.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 1 March 1977, the Government of the day set down a quota of 3 per cent for the employment of people with disabilities in the public service. It was hoped this figure would be achieved within a five-year period.  The <Col N="1713" /> 1977 decision applied to all categories of employment in the public service, including the Civil Service, local authorities, health boards and semi-State bodies. Exceptions were made in respect of the Defence Forces, the Garda Síochána and the prison service.</P>
      <P>In 1981, following a Government decision of the previous year, a revised order of preference was introduced in relation to the submission of persons for subordinate posts in Government Departments.  This order had the effect of giving priority to people with disabilities applying for such posts.  Also in 1981, special competitions, administered by the Civil Service Commission confined to people with disabilities were introduced. As a result of these competitions, a large number of people with disabilities were recruited to the Civil Service.  Between 1981 and 1983 a total of 236 civil servants were appointed as a result of these special recruitment programmes.  However, despite this very significant progress, it soon became clear that the target of 3 per cent originally envisaged could not be met within a five-year period.  The introduction of the embargo on general recruitment in the public service made the prospect of reaching the target even less likely.</P>
      <P>In the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> negotiated between the social partners in 1991, the Government undertook to increase on a gradual and sustained basis, the number of people with disabilities employed in the public service.  In order to oversee this commitment, a monitoring committee which comprised representatives of public service unions and management was set up. This committee is chaired by a senior official of the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the conclusion of the negotiations on a <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i> earlier this year, the Government has committed itself to eliminating inequality for all groups in society.  This, of course, includes persons <Col N="1714" /> with a disability.  The programme outlined our broad proposals to enhance the rights of persons with a mental handicap and to ensure the full expression of equality for persons with either physical or sensory disabilities.</P>
    <P>As a Government, we have, therefore, undertaken to give a lead by honouring the terms of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> in this regard. We fully intend to see that the 3 per cent quota for employment in the public service for those with a disability will be observed.  The overall percentage of persons with disabilities currently employed in the Civil Service is in excess of 2 per cent.  Government Departments with a low representation of staff with disabilities, are being encouraged to increase that representation wherever possible, taking into account their overall staffing needs.</P>
    <P>Serious consideration is also being given, in consultation with the social partners, to formulating legislation for an employment quota for people with disabilities, elsewhere in the economy. There is no reason for the private sector not playing its part in reducing the unacceptably high levels of unemployment among those with a disability.</P>
    <P>The House can be assured that the Government takes its commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government very seriously, in so far as the employment of people with a disability is concerned.  I am anxious to ensure that people with disabilities receive every possible support during the present difficult employment situation and I hope to have steps taken to improve job opportunities for them.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera can be assured that we have no intention of letting this problem fall by the wayside.  Improving the plight of people with disabilities is central to the work of my Department.  Evidence of this is the recently announced decision to establish a commission on the status of people with disabilities.  I have been heartened by the response so far to my <Col N="1715" /> request for submissions on the terms of reference of the proposed commission.  I am currently examining all the submissions which have been received in my Department.</P>
    <P>Work is, for us all, a basic human desire.  For someone with a disability, work carries the very considerable additional advantage of casting off the role of dependant so often associated with disability in the past.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1716" /> Employment of people with disabilities is, therefore, a high priority of this Government and I intend to try to ensure that despite the very difficult unemployment situation generally, the employment prospects of persons with disabilities will be safeguarded and, wherever possible, enhanced.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 12.30 a.m. until 10.30 a.m.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21, 41, 46, 65, 78 and 117 together.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in reply to previous questions on this matter on 18 May, the remit of the Employment Protection Unit will be broader than that of operating an early warning system in respect of firms experiencing difficulties.  The intention is, as envisaged in the Programme for a Partnership Government, to provide an advisory support service to facilitate the advancement of progressive small companies and to assist companies to surmount marketing, technical, etc., problems or difficulties that may be retarding their progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In its initial phase, the Employment Protection Unit will be involved in assisting companies experiencing difficulties. Experience would suggest that a company's current difficulties may be the culmination of a period of decline resulting from management failure to adapt products and processes to changing market <Col N="1423" /> and technological conditions.  The role of the Employment Protection Unit in such cases will be to determine whether a company's decline can be reversed and whether the company can be put back on a sound footing with the support of the Unit.  However, I would envisage that, beyond the initial fire-brigade phase of activity, the role of the Employment Protection Unit would become progressively more developmental in character in making proposals and recommending initiatives to assist and facilitate well-managed companies to develop long term growth planning based on the identification of market opportunities and the upgrading of products, processes and workforce skills.  Following on from its role in facilitating the development of individual companies in particular sub-sectors of industry, the Unit would be in a key position to advise the Department on appropriate strategies to be pursued in the development of industrial sectors and to identify appropriate State support mechanisms to facilitate sectoral development.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On the face of it the price differential on car parts referred to by the survey is significant and this might be a cause for concern.  I am conscious, however, that there may be particular factors which should be taken into account before <Col N="1426" /> coming to any firm conclusion on the issue, for example the small size of the sample chosen, the stocking policies and stocking location of the particular parts selected for the sample.

    <P>The emphasis of the Government is on the development of competition in every sector of enterprise and encouraging further consumer awareness of prices.  In this regard the Competition Act, 1991 sets down the legal framework which is necessary to protect the market and to promote the principles of free and fair competition in which the market operates.  Consumers also have a particular role here and should be sensitive to the range of prices on offer and purchase accordingly.</P>

      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to Teamwork which is administered by FÁS.  I was aware that there were difficulties with the renewal of projects involved with the care of the handicapped in one particular region. However, I understand that additional funds have been made available within FÁS to the region in question which will enable the renewal of all projects dealing with the handicapped in that region.  It must be understood that such reallocation <Col N="1427" /> can only be done at the expense of other FÁS activities.</P>
      <P>I have to point out that the objective of Teamwork is to provide temporary community based employment opportunities for young unemployed people on projects of benefit to the young people and their communities.</P>
      <P>An Exchequer allocation of £3.5 million has been made available to FAS for expenditure on Teamwork in 1993 which will provide opportunities for about 840 young people throughout the year.</P>
      <P>I am aware that some voluntary groups providing services on a continuing basis at local level, including organisations involved in the care of handicapped children, have come to rely on Teamwork for assistance in providing their services.

      <P>I have asked the Authority to give urgent attention to this case.  The relevant sections of the Act, provides, <i>inter alia,</i> that is, in the Authority's opinion, the arrangements notified have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition in trade in any goods or services in the State or in any part of the State, they do not qualify for a certificate.  Consideration is then given to the question of whether the arrangements qualify for a licence of exemption.  The Act sets out strict criteria which an agreement must satisfy in order to gain a licence of exemption.  A licence is granted for a specific period and may be subject to certain conditions.</P>

      <P>IDA grant payments are linked to the job creation performance of companies in a variety of ways.  In the case of capital grants, all new grant agreements since 1988 provide for a formal annual review of a company's growth and job creation performance <i>vis-à-vis</i> agreed targets.  The release of further grants, or the revocation of grants already paid, is then based on the results of this review.  With respect to employment grants, half of the moneys are paid to the company on creation of the job and half one year later, if the job is still in existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some grants which have been approved by the IDA are never paid out <Col N="1431" /> or are not paid according to the original timescale.  Such instances arise for a variety of reasons &mdash; the project does not start at all, for example, or it proceeds at a slower rate than originally envisaged, the company does not draw down its approved grant aid, and so on.  I understand that, due to the variety of reasons why grants approved might not be paid, the IDA is not in a position to analyse the non-payments which are attributable only to a company not achieving its job performance targets.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35, 111, 113 and 118 together.</P>
      <P>The European Community Charter of Fundamental Social Rights does not cover the question of a minimum wage. It refers to an equitable wage sufficient to enable workers to have a decent standard of living.  The Action Programme associated with the Charter makes clear that wage-setting is a matter for member states and the two sides of industry, and that it is not the task of the EC to fix a decent reference wage.  In this context, the Commission proposes to deliver an Opinion on an equitable wage and this is expected to be finalised in the near future.</P>
      <P>Under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> it was agreed that, during the currency of the Agreement, the Employer-Labour Conference (ELC) would consider all the issues involved (including the operation of the Joint Labour Committee System) In regard to a statutory minimum wage and prepare a report for the constituent bodies of the Conference.  The recommendations and views expressed by the Second Commission on the Status of Women will no doubt be taken into account by the ELC.  I have no proposals at this stage to introduce legislation and I await the outcome of the ELC deliberations.</P>
      <P>I would refer Deputy Ahern to the recent ESRI Report by Brian Nolan entitled &ldquo;Low Pay in Ireland&rdquo;.  A copy of a research project entitled &ldquo;The Economic Effects of Minimum Wage Laws: A Survey of the Evidence&rdquo; by Geary and McCarthy can be made available by my Department.</P>

      <P>There are two methods of determining the level of unemployment in this country &mdash; the Live Register and the Labour Force Survey. The Labour Force Survey is generally regarded as the more accurate picture of employment and unemployment but on cost grounds it is only carried out once a year at the moment.  It usually represents unemployment levels at a few percentage points below the Live Register figure. For example, the most recent Labour Force Survey of April, 1992 indicated that unemployment amounted to 16.7 per cent of the workforce, whereas the Live Register figures were then at 20.8 per cent: that is over 4 per cent higher.</P>
      <P>The Live Register is a count of the numbers of people signing on for payments. The Labour Force Survey is, on the other hand, an internationally agreed, standard statistical method of establishing the numbers at work and not at work according to the declared occupations of people.</P>

      <P>An extension of the area based response will, however, require further consideration on the part of the Central Review Committee of <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> which is charged with monitoring the current initiative, and also by the Government in the context of framing the National Development Plan, 1994-99.</P>

      <P>In framing his question, I am assuming that the Deputy is referring to the implementation of the recommendations of the Culliton Group. The thrust of Culliton was that there needs to be a greater emphasis on the development of indigenous industry while, at the same time, we should seek to reduce the cost of attracting mobile investment to Ireland.  Culliton highlighted the fact that the attraction of inward investment was not a sufficient basis for developing a national competitive advantage in advanced industries which will create increased employment opportunities to raise living standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1437" /> In recommending that industrial policy should be more clearly focused on the development of indigenous industry and that the budget for internationally mobile investment should be squeezed further, the Culliton Group also strongly acknowledged the benefits inward investment has brought to Ireland.  There are now over 1,000 overseas companies operating in Ireland employing in excess of 90,000 people.  Overseas companies spend over £4.1 billion annually in the Irish economy and create significant downstream employment in supplier and service companies. Culliton noted that &ldquo;while the main emphasis of our recommendations is on creating the environment and the instruments to enable Irish-managed firms to grow in efficiency and help replace a dependency orientation with enterprise it will be important not to lose the ability to attract foreign firms.  In order to do this Ireland has to pay the &ldquo;going rate&rdquo; in competing with alternative European locations&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>State financial support for inward industrial development is not given at the expense of support for the development of indigenous industry which is the primary focus of industrial policy.  Provided that support is justified on cost/benefit grounds and adequate security is provided by the promoters, a legitimate economic case can be advanced to seek to gain for Ireland the benefits&mdash;in terms of additional output and jobs&mdash;resulting from investment by overseas companies.</P>
    <P>In so far as indigenous industry is concerned, the Deputy will no doubt be aware that legislative proposals for a restructuring of the State industrial development agencies which will provide for a greater emphasis on the development of Irish industry are currently under discussion in the Oireachtas.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Community Employment Development Programme which incorporates a training element and retention of social welfare benefits by participants and a number of other measures was introduced on a pilot basis in the twelve partnership areas designated under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> strategy to combat long term unemployment.  The pilots are currently being implemented for the twelve areas and strictly for long term unemployed <Col N="1439" /> people in these areas.  The purpose of the measures as indicated in the Dáil by the Taoiseach on 7 October, 1992, is to reduce some of the disincentive effects which attach to the removal of welfare benefits from persons in the areas and categories in question when they obtain employment or take up a training or employment scheme opportunity.</P>
    <P>The operation of the programme will be evaluated in due course to assess its effectiveness in assisting persons who are long term unemployed.</P>

      <P>In relation to ongoing activities, FÁS seeks as far as possible to identify the particular need and skills of the persons with whom it comes into contact, including the long term unemployed. It attempts to assist the long term unemployed to equip themselves to compete more effectively in the labour market, bearing in mind their needs and skills, through the operation, adaptation and development of its various schemes and activities.</P>
      <P>I would also point out that as part of its outreach work to the long term unemployed who do not present themselves to State training services the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> area-based companies have begun a process of close interaction &mdash;through surveys and interviews &mdash; with the long term unemployed with a view to better establishing their particular skills and needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This process will help to improve the tailoring of provision to the long term unemployed in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> areas initially and it is intended that this experience will inform other agencies in their efforts <Col N="1440" /> generally to serve the needs of the long term unemployed.</P>

      <P>The Culliton report recommended that the pursuit of a more focused approach to industrial development should seek to facilitate and assist the establishment of industrial clusters based on existing sources of national competitive advantage.  The report indicated that incipient cluster development was evident in relation to the food industry in the Cork region and aeronautical engineering activity in the Limerick region.</P>
      <P>The fostering of clusters related to established competitive advantage in industrial segments has proved highly successful in other industrialised countries, for example in the development of machinery and process equipment industries in Germany related to its expertise in mechanical engineering.</P>
      <P>The process of identifying a number of industrial segments that might form the basis of successful clusters in Ireland will require a study of the competitive advantage of industrial sectors here and of the potential for building on our existing advantages and strengths.  Work in this regard is on-going.  The appropriate measures to be taken in support of the development of industrial clusters will be determined in the light of the outcome of this work.</P>

      <P>Growth in total demand, including growth in the volume of business done in our export markets, could sustain an appreciable improvement in the numbers at work.  Recently FÁS/ESRI have made projections which indicate an increase of about 60,000 in the total numbers employed outside of agriculture by 1996 as compared with 1992 (based on the preliminary Labour Force Survey for 1992), assuming that certain conditions for demand and output growth, price stability and the consolidation of the public finances are met over the period.</P>
      <P>The impact of an increase in the numbers at work on the level of unemployment is determined by the rate of increase in the total labour force.  Participation rates, migration, etc. have a major bearing on the rate of increase in the labour force.  The assumptions for growth in final demand have important implications for such factors.  Consequently, although the rate of increase in the labour force cannot be estimated with complete confidence, our current expectation is for the natural rate of increase in the Labour Force to be in the region 23,000-25,000 p.a. for the rest of this decade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will take time for medium term structural reform being implemented by this Government to improve the competitive base of the Irish economy.  Among the problems that have undermined the sustainability of employment in business here have been high costs, relative to those faced by competitors, particularly in sheltered sectors like posts, telecommunications, ports, transport, domestic services and the incidence of tax.  These restraints on competitiveness are in the need of, and are receiving, priority attention.  Government policy is directed at achieving improved price competitiveness through programmes of structural reform, investments in upgrading the competitive capacity and performance of the economy and the <Col N="1442" /> achievement of moderate rates of pay increase throughout the economy.</P>
    <P>The criterion for success must be how we can increase the numbers at work. Our performance in the manufacturing industry sector in that regard has been good compared to most other OECD countries particularly since 1987. Between 1988 and 1991 the numbers at work in manufacturing in this country increased by 6.4 per cent.  That was better than the performance of Austria, Denmark, Finland, France, Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden, UK and USA.  In a situation where it is easy to be pessimistic or to under-value achievement, we must keep in mind our undoubted capacity to increase the numbers in employment in broad sectors of business, such as manufacturing, as demonstrated by that comparison. The fact that the total numbers at work in services activities increased by 56,000 between the Labour Force Surveys of 1986 and 1992 also testifies to that.</P>
    <P>In addition, figures available for OECD countries up to the middle of 1992 indicate that whereas in the UK, Canada, Australia, Finland, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland total employment fell, as compared with the second quarter of 1991, in Ireland, by contrast, the numbers at work remained stable over the same period.  We have, therefore, a situation that is better comparatively than many other developed countries, but clearly one that we are intent on improving.</P>

      <P>The number of applicant companies for Research and Development Grants under the new Industry Research and Development Initiative, which is funded from EC Structural Funds, is approximately 190 to date.  Fifty-three projects have been approved for grant assistance totalling approximately £23 million in 1993.</P>
      <P>With regard to the level of research and development by companies in this country, I would have to say that I am not satisfied with the current level.  The most recently available data (1991) shows Irish Business Expenditure on R &amp; D at £176 million or 0.55 per cent of Gross Domestic Product compared to the EC average of 1.3 per cent.  Within the EC, only Spain, Portugal and Greece spend a lower proportion of GDP on Research and Development.</P>
      <P>However, I am heartened by the fact that there has been growing emphasis on R &amp; D by industry in Ireland as evidenced by the level of interest by companies in the R &amp; D Initiative.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's question relates to the proposed EC Directive on the Organisation of Working Time. The Council of Social Affairs Ministers reached political agreement on this proposed Directive on 1 June, 1993. However, before the Directive can be finally adopted, the proposal agreed by the Council must be submitted to the European Parliament for consideration and referred back to the Council for final decision.  This process is likely to take some months to complete and may result in amendments to the existing text of the proposals.</P>
      <P>The proposed Directive, which will apply to most employments, includes provisions on a range of working time issues such as maximum average weekly working hours, annual leave, daily and weekly rest periods and it also includes special provisions in relation to night work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to a maximum weekly working time, the proposed Directive provides that the average working time for each seven-day period, averaged over a four month reference period, must not exceed <Col N="1445" /> 48 hours.  This four month reference period for averaging purposes may be extended to six months by legislation in certain circumstances and, in addition, it may be extended to twelve months by way of collective agreement.</P>
    <P>In relation to annual leave, the proposed Directive provides for entitlement to paid annual leave of at least four weeks.  This represents an increase of one week on the existing statutory entitlement of workers in this country.</P>
    <P>On the question of implementation, the position is that member states will have three years from the date of final adoption of the Directive to implement its provisions.  Member states may, however, extend that three year implementation period by up to a further three years in the case of the annual leave provision.  In addition, member states will have the option not to apply the maximum weekly time provision, subject to a number of specific measures being introduced to ensure, among other things, (i) that an employer may not require an employee to work longer than 48 hours a week on average without his or her agreement to perform such work and (ii) that no worker is subjected to any detriment because he or she is unwilling to agree to perform such work.</P>
    <P>When this Directive is adopted in final form, it is my intention to consult fully with the social partners as regards the formulation of national legislation to implement its provisions.  The time-scale for implementation, within the limits provided for in the Directive, will be one of the issues for consideration at that stage.</P>

      <P>The employment incentive scheme (EIS) is the only subsidy scheme for which recruitment is ongoing at present. Following an in depth evaluation of the scheme by the ESRI during 1988, the eligibility criteria were amended in September, 1989 and the purpose of the scheme as it now operates is to encourage the recruitment of persons who are long term unemployed, early school leavers and other disadvantaged groups.  Since September, 1988 over 7,100 people were recruited through the scheme.</P>
      <P>The scheme is funded by the Exchequer and the European Social Fund.</P>
      <P>The employment subsidy scheme (ESS) which closed for applications on 26 February, 1993 was introduced in February, 1992 for a period of one year only with EC agreement and financial assistance. The scheme provided for the payment of a subsidy to employers to provide full-time employment opportunities for people who had been on the Live Register for at least eight weeks.  The subsidy is for one year provided that those recruited are retained in employment for 78 weeks. About 8,500 unemployed people were recruited under the scheme.</P>

      <P>Expenditure by a company within the Irish economy is, however, of central importance in analysing the effectiveness of industrial development.  The IDA determines the pattern of the expenditure in two ways:</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;an annual survey of Irish Economy <Col N="1448" /> Expenditure tracks the contribution of grant aided industry to the economy.</P>
    <P>IDA's cost/benefit analysis seeks to identify the benefits to the economy associated with IDA expenditure on a particular project.  The aim of this analysis is to determine whether such expenditure of Exchequer funds represents appropriate value for money, and also aims to ascertain the timeframe over which the Exchequer outlays will be recouped in terms of benefits to the economy. A minimum benefit to cost ratio of 4:1 is normally required by IDA's Board. The benefits include in each individual case the amount spent in Ireland on wages and salaries, purchases of Irish raw materials and purchases of Irish services.</P>
    <P>The survey of Irish Economy Expenditure is carried out each year by the IDA.  The purpose of the survey is to collect data on the sales, profits and expenditures on wages and salaries, raw materials/components and various services of grant aided firms with an employment of over 29 persons.  The data is then used to ascertain the proportion of such expenditures sourced from Irish producers or accruing to the Irish economy, and in this way acts as an indication of the employment and wealth impact on the economy of the manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 58 and 62 together as schemes of early retirement and of overtime <Col N="1449" /> reduction are, in their different ways, both forms of work redistribution, or worksharing as it is more commonly called.  Early retirement schemes seek to redistribute work from older workers willing to withdraw from paid employment to younger workers unable to find it.  Overtime reduction programmes aim to redistribute work from those who regularly work in excess of standard working hours to those who do not have the opportunity to work standard hours.</P>
      <P>The Deputies will be aware that the Programme for Government contains a commitment to bring forward proposals for a national voluntary scheme of worksharing for discussion with the social partners. As a first step in giving effect to this commitment, it has been decided to commission a thorough, objective study of the issues and options.  The scope for, and costs and benefits of a scheme of early retirement will be considered in the course of this review as will the potential to reduce overtime working and have work that is currently done in overtime hours carried out instead by additional workers.</P>
      <P>Tenders for this study have been sought from third-level and research institutions with relevant expertise.  It is envisaged that it will be completed by the autumn.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that the participation rate in the labour force of workers aged between 55 and 64 has been in decline in recent decades so that there is already an established trend towards earlier retirement.  This trend has been recognised in the introduction of the PreRetirement Allowance Scheme and the Pre-Retirement Credits Scheme which permit persons aged over 55 who are in receipt of long term unemployment assistance, or who are signing on for credits, to transfer to the above schemes if they consider themselves to be retired. If they do so, they are no longer required to &ldquo;sign on&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I propose to take the answers to Questions Nos. 61 and 68 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of venture capital, of which seed capital forms a part, is, in the first instance a matter for the private sector to provide.  It is considered that <Col N="1451" /> the most effective role for the State is to support private sector initiatives in this area in order to ensure that projects supported have, at least, the potential to meet market-determined commercial criteria.</P>
    <P>Following the publication of the Culliton report, which identified the shortage of seed capital as one of the constraints on the growth of small firms, my Department along with the Department of Finance, has been assessing the needs of the venture capital market, including the provision of seed capital. The scarcity of seed capital was the motivating force behind the establishment of the Business Innovation Fund in 1990 with the co-operation of the Private Sector, the EC Commission and the Government.  The Fund was initially vested with a capital fund of £1 million. With financial support under the Operational Programme for Industry this has now been increased to close to £2 million. Further consideration is being given to the identification of ways in which the seed-capital needs of small-business projects with good development potential can best be provided in the context of the preparation of a new Community Support Framework under the EC Structural Funds for the period beyond the end of this year.</P>
    <P>Measures announced in the Finance Act, 1993 will also contribute significantly to meeting the shortage of funding at the seed stage and at the same time promote the enterprise environment which is so necessary for economic regeneration. Broadly speaking, the new measures provide, subject to certain conditions, that an employee who leaves employment (or an unemployed person) to start his or her own business may claim a refund of tax paid on previous income in respect of his or her investment in the new business.  Tax relief on investments up to a maximum of £25,000 per year will be allowed on a retrospective basis i.e. against income of any three of the preceding five years.  This is a significant initiative which will provide much needed <Col N="1452" /> capital to potential entrepreneurs in the start up phase.</P>
    <P>The Business Expansion Scheme has in the past made a significant contribution to the funding of small business, including finance at the seed stage, and in this year's Finance Act the Government has extended the scheme for a further period of 3 years while at the same time removing the lifetime investment cap on individual investors.  The announcement in this year's Finance Act of the extension of Business Expansion Scheme relief to certain research and development activities is also a significant step forward in providing funds to business initiatives that are at the conceptual stage.</P>
    <P>Arrangements are being made for the establishment of County Enterprise Boards in every local authority area.  The Boards, as part of their remit, will provide financial assistance to small businesses with potential and which are at the early stage of development.</P>
    <P>It will be clear that a number of significant initiatives are now under way which will contribute to meeting the funding needs of business at both the concept and start-up stages.</P>
    <P>I am therefore satisfied that the above measures will make a worthwhile contribution to the provision of seed capital funding.  The availability of seed capital is a matter I will be keeping under review, and if necessary further measures will be considered in the future.</P>

      <P>The 1992 Finance Act (Part I Chapter IX) enables a body to establish a &ldquo;profit sharing scheme&rdquo; under which shares in the company, or in a connected company may, (subject to certain conditions) be appropriated tax free to eligible employees or directors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1453" /> The 1992 Finance Act clawed back some of the tax relief available under this scheme by limiting the amount of relief applicable for any individual participant in any tax year to shares not exceeding £2,000 in value.  Prior to the 1992 Finance Act tax relief had been based on shares not exceeding £5,000 in value in any tax year.</P>
    <P>While not a profit sharing scheme, the 1993 Finance Act amended Section 12 of the Finance Act 1986 which provides for an income tax deduction for an employee who buys new ordinary shares in his or her employing company.  The relief which up to now has been subject to an overall lifetime limit of £750, is intended to provide a means of encouraging greater employee involvement in the business which employs him or her.  The overall limit is being increased as respects shares issued in the year 1993-94 or subsequent years to £3,000.</P>
    <P>Any legislative amendments to either extend existing profit sharing schemes, or to introduce new tax based profit sharing schemes would be enacted through the annual Finance Acts, and as such would be primarily the responsibility of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>While at the present time the Minister for Enterprise and Employment has no proposals to extend schemes of profit sharing, the matter will be kept under review in the future.</P>

      <P>The confidentiality requirements concerning industrial projects are set out in the legislation of the relevant State body and/or in the terms and conditions attaching to employment with that body.</P>
      <P>In the case of the IDA, the Industrial Development Act, 1986 prohibits any member of the staff from disclosing any information obtained while performing duties as a member of the Authority or of any board or committee of the Authority or as a member of the staff of, or adviser or consultant to, the Authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect that by the end of 1994 all the appropriate domestic legislation will be in place to comply with the remaining Community Directives on Insurance.</P>
      <P>Under the first generation of EC Directives on insurance liberalisation increased competition from Community insurers has been a reality in Ireland since 1976 for non-life insurance and 1984 for life assurance.  These Directives allowed freedom of establishment for Community insurers on either a branch or head office basis in Ireland.</P>
      <P>In June, 1991 Regulations were enacted under Statutory Instrument No. 142/1991 implementing the Second non-life services Directive which allows cross-border community-wide freedom of services for most classes of non-life insurance with the exception of third party motor liability insurance.  Regulations were enacted on 20 November, 1992, under Statutory Instrument No. 244/1992, which gave effect to the Motor Insurance Services Directive.  These Regulations enable EC insurers to offer motor insurance cover on a cross-border basis throughout the Community.  I should point out that the special derogations which were available to Ireland for phasing in both the Second non-life services Directive and the Motor Insurance services Directive were waived in accordance with the Government's commitment to the achievement of a single insurance market.</P>
      <P>Regulations will shortly be enacted which will give effect to the Second life assurance services Directive.  These Regulations will, similarly, allow for the cross-border availability of life assurance products throughout the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The single insurance market will be complete once the Third Framework insurance Directives are implemented by all member states, in 1994.  These Directives are the logical progression from the partial liberalisation already achieved under the Second services Directives and the Motor Insurance services Directive. The Third Framework insurance Directives will institute a Community-wide <Col N="1456" /> authorisation system where by overall supervision of an insurance company will be the responsibility of the member state where the head office of the company is located.  Ireland has sought no special transitional arrangements in relation to the implementation of these Directives.</P>
    <P>Overall, I am satisfied that the necessary progress towards the creation of a full single competitive market for insurance has been achieved and I expect that the full opening-up of the market should encourage further competition on price, cover and increased availability of insurance products.</P>

      <P>An important part of the Government's response to Culliton as detailed by me on 3 May includes a new approach to raising the level of skills of those at work.  FÁS and the Department of Education have important roles to play in this connection and there will be close co-ordination between FÁS, my Department, the Department of Education and the Industrial Development Agencies to ensure that the needs of industry are adequately reflected in all training programmes.</P>
      <P>I concur in the Culliton Group's recommendations that training that is specific in the sense that the skills or learning involved is exclusive to the firm and of little or no relevance to any other firm, should not be subsidised.  However, it is very difficult in operational terms to define firm specific training precisely. The overall objective of state funded training programmes should be to balance the need of industry for relevant training with the needs of individuals for training which will allow them mobility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Responsibility for training those at work will continue to rest with employers.  Appropriate Government <Col N="1457" /> agencies will assist and advise employers on their training needs and grants will be available for small and medium sized enterprises to assist them with the cost of providing training for their employees.</P>

      <P>There are, of course, economic gains to be made from an effective competition policy.  An effective policy in this area is promoted by the Government, not on the basis of an attachment to abstract principles, but rather because there are economic gains to be made.</P>

    <P>While attempts have been made by academics to quantify the gains it is a very difficult task.

      <P>As has been stated to this House before, the Government had previously indicated that funding would be made available to enable Shannon Development, in certain circumstances, to participate in a restructuring of the GPA Group.  Shannon Development, having evaluated a proposal to take up the equity option held by Aer Lingus in GPA, had already offered to participate in an equity issue on terms and conditions consistent with a commercial investment.</P>
      <P>I am aware of developments in relation to GPA and the General Electric Capital Corporation involving a $1.35 billion aircraft transaction and a related option for G.E to purchase an equity interest of between 65 per cent and 80 per cent in GPA on or prior to 31 March 1997.</P>
      <P>I understand that GPA are having discussions with its existing shareholders and Shannon Development in order to clarify the proposed offer.  I intend to await the outcome of such discussions and, depending on the nature of any decision taken by the Board of Shannon Development, I would propose to advise the Government in relation to any proposal which emerges.</P>
      <P>However, in the absence of precise details at this stage it would obviously not be possible for me to say whether any investment will be made or the terms which would apply should a decision be taken to invest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1459" /> In so far as Deputy Rabbitte's question is concerned I would confirm that it is Government policy that, where appropriate, equity stakes may be taken in private firms by the State industrial development agencies such as IDA, Shannon Development and Údarás na Gaeltachta.  The circumstances in which this is done, and the terms of investment in individual cases, is a matter in the first instance for the agencies concerned.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of equity in semi-State companies themselves, the Programme for Government makes it clear that investment, including increased equity, will be provided if necessary for the development of viable and profitable State commercial enterprise.</P>

      <P>Since 1976 both Irish and foreign owned companies have been providing motor insurance cover in the Irish market and indeed there are 30 such authorised insurers at present.  These are either Irish owned or foreign owned companies established and authorised in this country on a head office or branch office.</P>
      <P>The Third Non-Life EC Insurance Directive, which will allow non-life insurers, including motor insurers, to provide insurance across the EC on the basis of a single licence from the home member state, will be implemented in 1994.  It remains to be seen what impact this final stage in the opening up of the EC insurance market will have in practice on motor insurance premia in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rates charged by these insurers may vary from company to company depending on their claims and underwriting experience.  Therefore, I would advise drivers to shop around as much as <Col N="1460" /> possible when seeking motor insurance cover.  Might I add that the Competition Act, 1991 prohibits anti-competitive practices and the abuse of a dominant position in the market.  The Act, which applies to all sectors of the economy, including insurance, provides that any person aggrieved in consequence of an anti-competitive practice or an abuse of a dominant position has a right of action in the Courts for relief including damages. The onus is on aggrieved parties to use their right to protect their legitimate interests.</P>

      <P>I am fully aware of the circumstances of the incident of 11 and 12 June to which the Deputy refers and of the on-going difficulties caused to the two elderly ladies by the placing of security barriers on the road leading to <Col N="1462" /> their home.  I can confirm that I have conveyed my concerns about this matter to the British authorities through the Anglo-Irish Secretariat in Belfast, and I have emphasised to them the urgent need for measures to be taken to alleviate the situation.  In raising this matter with the British authorities I have drawn attention to assurances previously given in this regard and have asked that all necessary steps be taken to ensure that incidents such as the one which occurred on 11 and 12 June do not recur.</P>

      <P>The full year cost, estimated by reference to the 1993-94 tax year, of a reduction in the standard rate of income tax from 27 per cent to 26 per cent is estimated at £74 million.</P>
      <P>The full year cost of a £1,000 increase in the single person's income tax allowance is estimated at £400 million.  The answer takes account of the assumption that any increase in the single allowance must be combined with an equal increase in the allowance for widowed persons and with double that increase in the allowance for married persons assessed to tax on the aggregate basis.</P>

    <P>The Finance Act, 1993 provides for a 10 per cent corporation tax rate for the production of a newspaper including the rendering of advertising services in the course of the production of the newspaper and for currency exchange gains connected with section 84 loans denominated in a foreign currency.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that statistics are not available which would enable the information requested on output and employment to be given with the exception of figures on employment in Shannon and IFSC. However, it is tentatively estimated that the adjusted profits for tax of companies which avail of manufacturing relief but which would not be classified as manufacturing companies under standard economic classification came to some £970 million for all companies with accounting periods ended between 1 April, 1990 and 31 March, 1991.  This is the most recent period for which figures are available.  About two thirds of this amount was attributable to companies operating in the international financial services centre.</P>
    <P>Projects approved for the IFSC have so far given rise to direct new employment of approximately 1,300 and, indirectly, to many more additional jobs in the legal, accounting and general services sector in Dublin.</P>
    <P>There are 67 service companies in Shannon employing 2,147 people.</P>

      <P>The Tullamore River is part of the Brosna catchment drainage scheme which was undertaken by the Office of Public Works under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945 nearly forty years ago.  Some flooding occurred as a result of the recent very heavy rainfall which gave rise to an exceptionally large volume of water in the channel, well in excess of the more normal volumes which it was designed to cope with.  Unfortunately, the cost of constructing channels to cope with all eventualities would be prohibitive.  The flooding which occurred on this occasion would have been far worse and of longer duration had the scheme not been carried out and maintained over the years.  Within the resources available to it, the Office of Public Works keeps all channels well maintained.</P>
      <P>The Arterial Drainage Act, 1945 stipulates those aspects of drainage construction works for which compensation is payable.  The recent flooding is not covered by the terms of the Act and accordingly the Office does not have a scheme of compensation available in respect thereof.  Nor does it have any funds available to meet the cost of any such scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>In April 1991, I extended social insurance to part-time employees earning £25 or more a week.  This measure brought 27,000 part-time workers into the social insurance system for the first time and means that they are now insured for the full range of social insurance benefits and pensions.  The vast majority of these workers now have sufficient PRSI contributions to qualify for short term contributory benefits such as Disability Benefit and Unemployment Benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Changes in the benefits system were required to accommodate this group. One of these changes related to Unemployment Benefit.  The purpose of Unemployment Benefit is to provide a replacement income for people who have lost their full-time jobs.  Now that so many part-time workers, some of whom normally work only a day or two per week, are covered by social insurance, it was necessary to review the conditions for Unemployment Benefit to ensure that they were in line with the scheme's objectives. <Col N="1471" /> The new arrangements introduced on January 4 require the claimant to have suffered a loss of employment in order to qualify for benefit.</P>
    <P>Initially, regulations provided that the employment lost had to be at least two days for persons normally working four or more days in the week and one day's loss for persons employed from one to three days.  In March of this year, I reduced this requirement to one day in all cases.</P>
    <P>In the case of the firm referred to a small number of persons have had claims disallowed under the rules requiring loss of employment.  The decision to disallow was based on the view that their normal level of employment had continued.  One of those disallowed has appealed against the decision to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office.</P>
    <P>Any person who is adversely affected by the provisions of these regulations may instead claim Unemployment Assistance for the days of unemployment. From April 1993, I revised the regulations governing the assessment of insurable earnings for Unemployment Assistance purposes to improve the position of workers with earnings from part-time work.  A person can now earn an amount equivalent to the normal daily rate of Unemployment Assistance plus an additional £15 per day for each day worked.  This, for example, means that a married man with two dependent children can earn up to £34.42 per day without affecting the rate of Unemployment Assistance payable for each day not worked in the same week.</P>
    <P>In the case of certain casual workers, I am aware that the new provisions for the treatment of part-time workers may result in a reduction in their overall income when their period of entitlement to Unemployment Benefit is exhausted. I am currently examining this situation with a view to further improving the position of these workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department currently provides a range of measures aimed at improving the market share and employment levels of the services sector.</P>
      <P>The IDA and SFADCo provides a special package of incentives and support facilities for companies involved in internationally-traded services.  The incentives include employment grants, feasibility grants, capital grants, training grants and management development grants.  Equity investments in services firms have been an increasingly used form of support, over recent years.</P>
      <P>The International Services Sector is one of the fastest growing areas in industry. Employment now stands at 11,369 (excluding software), an increase of more than 55 per cent over the past five years.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the international market for computer services will grow to over $100b in Europe by 1994.  Ireland will participate in this growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Strategic Review of the Software Industry in Ireland was published last October.  From a base of 8,000 people employed at present, it is projected that the software industry can more than <Col N="1478" /> double the numbers employed by the end of this decade.</P>
    <P>I am also considering Telemarketing and other Data Processing type operations as opportunities for enhancing employment opportunities in the services sector, on the basis of competitive telecommunications charges.  The recently announced rebalancing of telephone charges will be of some assistance in this connection.  Telecom Éireann and IDA have been asked by the Government to work together on the issues, such as cost and availability of leased lines, in this connection.</P>
    <P>New technologies, new products and new projects are emerging in financial services, applications software, education, music/film, healthcare services and specialist publishing.  Projects continue to emerge from indigenous sources as well as from overseas investors.</P>
    <P>The International Services Programmes of the State agencies recognise (i) the close relationship between manufacturing and services and (ii) that the manufacturing sector is a significant driving force for employment creation in the domestic services sector.  Drawing on data derived from the Irish Economy Expenditures Survey carried out annually, and in consultation with the ESRI, it has been found that in addition to the 220,000 people employed directly in manufacturing, the manufacturing sector spends £10.6 billion in the Irish economy, which in turn supports a further 160,000 first round indirect jobs in the services sector.</P>
    <P>While employment creation in the domestic services sector is in large part dependent on the knock-on effects of the manufacturing sector, the internationally-traded services sector can play a similar role to the manufacturing sector as an engine of growth and employment creation.</P>
    <P>Programmes are being put in place to promote job-creating projects in the priority areas of the information services, back office services, and direct marketing services.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned education services as a rapidly growing area.  Expenditure in <Col N="1479" /> the Irish economy rose from £5 million in 1984 to £72 million in 1990.  Segments believed to offer the strongest possibility include the teaching of English as a foreign language and distance learning.  A special effort is being made to develop this activity also.</P>
    <P>While FÁS does not operate any programmes or schemes which are specifically targeted at the services sector; it does provide support by way of training programmes and employment schemes for persons interested in setting up small businesses.</P>
    <P>The FÁS Integrated Enterprise Programme provides a range of support services including short specific training programmes, advice and finance to individuals, and also to groups, who are setting up new businesses, including services.  The programme is important for enabling small services enterprises to maintain control and &ldquo;good house-keeping&rdquo; in their business and includes business appraisal training during which training allowances are paid, followed by technical training, income support in the form of enterprise payments through the enterprise scheme, enterprise workshops and access to business advice.  The FÁS Community Enterprise Programme (which is part of the Integrated Enterprise Programme) offers community groups and co-operative groups a comprehensive package of advisory and financial assistance to help them become involved in enterprise and job-creation.</P>
    <P>FÁS also operates an employment subsidy scheme &mdash; the employment incentive scheme &mdash; which applies to profit-making and non profit-making enterprises in all sectors with the exception of the public sector, banking, insurance, building societies and similar financial institutions.</P>
    <P>My Department is also participating in the high level task force on jobs in services appointed by the Taoiseach which is due to produce specific proposals by the end of September, for consideration by Government, on measures to significantly increase the number of jobs in the services sector.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>A key role for Government in the economic area is the creation of a favourable environment for industrial and business activity generally. One of the principal elements of the Government's new approach to enterprise policy, as reflected in their recent response to the Culliton and Moriarty recommendations, is the formulation and implementation of an industrial policy which will encompass all areas of public policy which have a significant impact on the creation and maintenance of competitive enterprises in the industrial sector.  These include not only the traditional instruments of policy in the form of direct incentives and advice from State agencies but important areas ranging <Col N="1482" /> from infrastructure and costs of services to inflation, interest rates and exchange rate stability.  Clearly low interest rates are a very important factor in creating a favourable environment to assist Irish industry and create jobs.  It also assists IDA's promotional efforts in marketing Ireland to potential industries overseas.</P>
      <P>The substantial reduction in interest rates which has occurred over recent months is undoubtedly having a beneficial impact on industry and on prospects for industrial development in the short to medium-term.  Reduced interest rates contribute towards greater competitiveness of Irish industry and will help companies recover from the recent currency crisis.  Lower interest rates can also be expected to impact positively on investments through lower borrowing costs to industry to fund projects, stimulate consumer spending and have a beneficial impact for industrial growth and job creation.</P>
      <P>However, the Government recognises that for industry to reap the full benefits of lower interest rates it would be important that current rates be maintained for a substantial period of time.  I can assure the Deputy that the Government will continue to do all it can to ensure that prevailing rates area maintained for as long as possible.</P>
      <P>From my own point of view I recently met with the Chief Executives of the main banks at which they emphasised their commitment to productive investment in Ireland and outlined measures they had recently put in place to give stronger effect to this commitment.  Both sides agreed on the need for improved liaison and communication between the Department of Enterprise and Employment and the banking sector in the interests of all segments of the business sector.  It was further agreed that arrangements be put into place to achieve this improvement by the establishment of a standing liaison group chaired by the Department of Enterprise and Employment.</P>

      <P>The objective of the county enterprise boards is primarily strategic and the funding available to them will provide a new source of such needed support for local enterprise initiatives.</P>
      <P>The enterprise boards will prepare county action plans, their essential focus being on pro-active strategies to tap the unemployment opportunities in their localities through:</P>
      <P>&mdash;identifying and commercially developing local resources;</P>
      <P>&mdash;promoting the creation and development of enterprises from within the local economy, particularly through support for local enterprise groups;</P>
      <P>&mdash;creating and strengthening networks between the local community and State agencies in the interest of mobilising and co-ordinating their energies and knowledge.</P>
      <P>The county enterprise plans will address what specific agreed programme for enterprise development is to be undertaken, by whom and within what time-scale and how the success of the action taken will be measured.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. G. O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of concerns expressed by salmon and trout anglers that farmed salmon and trout can pose disease risks for wild salmonid populations.  I am also aware that, conversely, fish farmers have similar concerns that wild fish carrying pathogens can be a major cause of disease outbreaks on fish farms.  The question of disease transfer between wild and farmed fish is a complex one, with many gaps in our knowledge.  Disease is a naturally occurring phenomenon in both wild and farmed salmonid populations.  Certain diseases appear to be confined to wild fish, others are normally only seen in farmed fish populations.  There are a number of diseases which occur in both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to ongoing national programmes of research into the causes of <Col N="1493" /> and predisposing factors for, disease in wild and farmed salmonid populations, priority is being given to maintaining Ireland's historically high fish health status to ensure that the island remains free of the major infectious salmonid diseases prevalent elsewhere in the Community. Monitoring and testing programmes, together with continued controls on importations of live salmonids, are being implemented, with EC Commission approval, in the context of the internal market and resultant lifting of trade restrictions in live fish.</P>
    <P>The prevention and control of disease is a primary objective for the Irish fish farming industry and disease incidence is being tackled through improved husbandry, stocking densities and treatments as well as research.</P>
    <P>Considerable technical and scientific resources are provided by the Department for the monitoring of fish health and water quality at fish farm operations. In addition to diagnostic and advisory services to the industry, comprehensive monitoring and inspections are undertaken by the Department's Fish Health Unit.</P>
    <P>All licensed fish farm operations are obliged to notify the Department of outbreaks of disease, suspected disease or abnormal mortalities within twenty four hours and to carry out instructions regarding administration of treatments and disposal of mortalities.</P>
    <P>The preventive measures and research programmes currently being directed at minimising disease incident in both wild and farmed salmonid populations will continue to be kept under close review.</P>

      <P>Payments under the 1992 sheep headage scheme are made on the basis of information supplied by a flock owner on his application form.  As the person in question only claimed sheep headage on seven lowland hoggets payment of grants was based on this number initially.  Closer inspection of his application, however, reveals that he declared 38 breeding ewes in the ewe premium schedule and 30 acres of mountain grazing in the lowland grazings schedule and that in these circumstances, he can now be paid 1992 sheep headage on these extra 38 ewes.  Payment will be made within a fortnight.</P>

      <P>The scheme of installation aid for young farmers was introduced under Regulation 797/85 of 12 March, 1985.  The Regulation came into effect on 1 April, 1985.  The Regulation enabled member states to introduce various schemes, many of which were optional, subject to consultation with the Commission and the approval of the EC Standing Committee on Agricultural Structures in regard to technical and financial matters.</P>
      <P>My Department consulted widely on the introduction of the Regulation and in February, 1986 introduced the Farm Improvement Programme (FIP) which gave effect to the first part of the Regulation. The scheme of installation aid, which was an optional scheme under the Regulation was approved by the EC in July, 1986 and with EC Commission Agreement had its operative date set at 4 February, 1986 to coincide with the launch of the FIP.  It is not possible to accommodate situations under the scheme where the Deed of Transfer was signed before that date.</P>
      <P>Under the scheme the date of installation is the date on which the Deed of Transfer is signed by all parties not the date of stamping.  It is not possible to calculate how may applicants, with the appropriate labour requirement and education, may have been effected by the commencement date of the scheme.</P>

      <P>Under the European Communities (Road Passenger Transport) Regulations, all operators of road passenger services for hire or reward in buses equipped to carry more than nine persons are required to hold a road passenger transport operator's licence.  Applicants for these licences must satisfy EC requirments in relation to good repute, appropriate financial standing and professional competence.</P>
      <P>In addition to these requirements, persons wishing to operate scheduled passenger services are required under the terms of the Road Transport Act, 1932, to hold a road passenger licence in respect of each individual route.  Before granting a licence for a particular service, the Minister must be satisfied (a) that the service in question is required in the public interest having regard to existing road and rail services on or in the neighbourhood of the proposed service; (b) that the proposed level of service is sufficient to meet the requirements of the public; and (c) that the organisation and equipment at the applicant's disposal are sufficient to enable the service to be operated in accordance with the conditions which the Minister considers should be attached to the proposed licence.</P>
      <P>It is not departmental policy to publish information on individual operators in the context of these licensing requirements. Operational aspects of the school transport scheme, including the hiring of contractors for the provision of services, are day-to-day matters for Bus Éireann.</P>

      <P>I have already indicated in replying to a parliamentary question on 28 April 1993 that the grant-in-aid to the Legal Aid Board for 1993 was increased by £100,000 and that this additional sum <Col N="1512" /> would be used to reduce the length of waiting lists in existing centres.  The 1993 allocation is not, however, sufficient to allow for the recruitment of additional solicitors or for the opening of other law centres.</P>
      <P>The position continues to be, therefore, that the resources of the Legal Aid Board are not sufficient at present to enable it to open a law centre in County Laois.  It is, of course, open to any person living in County Laois, who wishes to avail of the services of the board, to apply to any of the board's law centres for legal aid and advice.</P>
      <P>The question of further expansion of the scheme depends on the availability of public financial resources and in that context I am endeavouring to achieve the best possible improvement in services under the scheme.</P>

      <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, there is no specified time-limit for the presentation or audit of health board accounts. However, it is the policy of my Department to work with health boards and the Local Government auditor to have audited accounts available within the following year.  Accordingly, my Department has now incorporated in the standards accounting policies for health boards a requirement that health boards must have the accounts of the previous year ready for audit not later than 31 March in the following year.

    <P>The overall aim of this initiative is to eliminate waiting lists in excess of 12 months in the targeted specialties and to set a maximum waiting time of six months in respect of children awaiting ENT or eye treatment.  In relation to ENT surgery in Limerick Regional Hospital, the majority of the patients to be treated will first have to undergo assessment at the out-patient clinic, where there is a very lengthy waiting period, before being referred for surgery.</P>
    <P>I am confident that this programme will bring about a major reduction in the length of time which patients in the Mid-West must wait for hospital treatment.</P>

A site was purchased by the board in June 1981.

This approach was endorsed by the Working Party on Services for the Elderly in their report, <i>The Years Ahead.</i></P>

      <P>I am strongly committed to drug awareness programmes that will be effective in preventing drug misuse and my Department supports many organisations who are making a valuable contribution to this <Col N="1521" /> area.  The health promotion unit of my Department has a range of information leaflets and booklets for parents, young people and health professionals which serve as educational resources in this area.</P>
      <P>The health promotion unit in conjunction with the psychological service of the Department of Education is currently completing the pilot phase of a major substance abuse prevention programme for second level schools.  It is envisaged that these materials &mdash; along with appropriate training where it is required &mdash; will be made more widely available during the coming school year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The health promotion unit has, for a number of years, supported the Catholic Social Service Conference in enabling it to run training programmes in drug education for primary teachers.  In addition it made £5,000 available to the conference in 1992 to support the Leader element of this drug awareness programme. This one-off grant was provided in the knowledge that this programme had the possibility of receiving support from other State agencies and the European Commission.  While my Department was very pleased to be able to support this project last year the health <Col N="1522" /> promotion unit is not in a position to make ongoing support of this nature available to projects of this kind.  The resources have to be used sparingly in the context of many competing demands and the primary function of grants of this kind is to act as seed money to stimulate and initiate but not to provide core funding for ongoing services.</P>
    <P>It is for these reasons that the Department is not in a position to make a grant available for this project again this year.</P>

      <P>A test clearance certificate in respect of asbestos removal was issued by Eolas on 14 August 1992, which indicated that the school was considered as suitable for return to its normal use and occupancy. I would like to refer the Deputy to my response to Parliamentary Question No. 190 of 15 June 1993, in which I indicated that Dunshaughlin Community College was closed by the vocational education committee as a precautionary measure following concern expressed by the staff and not as a result of any significant risk to the occupants having been identified.</P>
      <P>As I also indicated in my reply I have sought the advice of the Health and Safety Authority and I am assured that the occupants of the building were not exposed to levels of asbestos which should be a cause of concern.  I understand from the Health and Safety Authority there is no evidence that exposure to asbestos at the low levels involved in Dunshaughlin Community College would have any adverse health affects and that consequently the risk is considered minimal.</P>
      <P>The role of Eolas during the contract was to carry out air tests on dust levels in the enclosures where the asbestos boards were removed by the contractor.  The Health and Safety Authority was notified by the contractor in accordance with the EC (Protection of Workers Exposure to Asbestos) Regulations 1989.</P>

      <P>Details of my Department's scheme of special consideration were set out in my reply to a question by Deputy Austin Currie on 13 May.</P>
      <P>In the particular case referred to by the Deputy the position is that an application for special consideration on the grounds of a specific learning difficulty was made to my Department on 11 November 1992 by the school concerned.  Samples of the candidate's written work and a report from a psychologist attached to the Association for Children and Adults with Learning Disabilities accompanied the application.</P>
      <P>The application was referred to my Department's psychological service for consideration.  My Department's psychologist considered the psychological report and the samples of the written work.
