      <Qid>1</Qid>
      <asker>Mr. Shatter</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>whether he has received the report or working paper being prepared by the Law Reform Commission on the courts and family law proceedings; when the report will be published; and whether it recommends the establishment of family courts.</Quest>
      <QRef>
      </QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Law Reform Commission, which is an independent body under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Anthony Hederman, works to a programme and the timing of the publication of reports is a matter for the commission itself.</P>
      <P>The commission is currently preparing reports on a wide range of topics, each requiring extensive research and consultation with interested parties.  I understand that work on the Consultation Paper on Family Courts is at an advanced stage.</P>
      <P>While the Attorney General may, from time to time, request the commission to examine particular issues, it would be disruptive and unhelpful to set deadlines for the publication of specific reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that when marriages break down family cases in the courts are particularly traumatic for those involved?  Will he accept that the current facilities available in courts throughout the country are grossly inadequate, that in some cases there is a lack of skill on the part of some members of the Judiciary to deal with such cases and that they lack back-up services?  In that context is the Taoiseach in a position to indicate to the House a date by which it is expected he will receive the report? If it has not already been done, will he ask the Attorney General to request the Law Reform Commission to report on this matter urgently and that it is given priority, as happened in regard to other issues?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's concern in regard to this matter and I assure him that no time will be lost in so far as the Government is concerned.  I pointed out to the Deputy that the timing of publication of reports is a matter for the Commission, not for us.  However, I appreciate the urgency the Deputy attaches to this matter and I will convey his concern to the Attorney General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="228" />
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his helpful reply, although he may not expect me to say that.  In the context of such a communication from the Attorney General's office to the Law Reform Commission, will he and the Government bear in mind that unless a radical overhaul of the courts structure takes place, particularly as it deals with family law and marriage breakdown cases, the courts will be overwhelmed by many thousands of cases brought by people whose marriages have been broken down for many decades if a divorce referendum is held and is successful?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask for brevity at this stage as there is a time limit on questions to the Taoiseach today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>It is particularly urgent that not only should the Government receive this report, but that it should make decisions on it before a divorce referendum is held.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The concerns expressed by Deputy Shatter are the subject of commitments in the Programme for Government and he can be assured they will be carried out to the full.</P>

      <asker>Proinsias De Rossa</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>the number of staff currently employed by the CSO; the number of such staff who have agreed to transfer to Cork: the steps, if any, that have been taken to provide staff to carry out the work of those who do not wish to move to Cork; the estimated cost of recruiting and training such staff; the cost of providing new accommodation for the CSO in Cork; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Dempsey) Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Dempsey)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is as <Col N="229" /> follows: of just 600 staff currently employed in the CSO, up to 400 are being transferred to Cork, including two deputy directors, five senior statisticians and 14 statisticians.  The following activities are being transferred: industrial and building statistics; services statistics and business register; agriculture statistics; labour market statistics; vital statistics; retail and wholesale prices; information technology division; administration division, i.e. personnel, finance, office services, information, printing and library.</P>
      <P>To date a total of 206 staff volunteering to relocate to Cork are in place in the Dublin office; these comprise 76 CSO volunteers, 69 volunteers from other Government Departments, 16 clerical assistants taken from the most recent competition undertaken by the Civil Service Commission, 11 statistician recruits from an open competition and 34 persons appointed to date from promotion competitions held to make-up the shortfall in staff volunteering to relocate in their existing grade.</P>
      <P>Staff are continuing to be appointed for the Cork office through the normal Civil Service volunteer and promotion decentralisation arrangements; a small number of technical and other officers are being recruited directly.</P>
      <P>Staff have been redeployed from other duties within the CSO to serve on interview boards and to process the intake of staff from other Government Departments and their replacement by existing CSO staff opting to remain in Dublin. The additional cost to the CSO and Civil Service Commission of recruitment for Cork is modest and cannot be readily distinguished.</P>
      <P>The staff appointed for Cork are being trained in their new work within the CSO by existing staff.  This on-the-job training is being supplemented by induction and other courses given by the office training services.  An additional £47,600 has been expended to date on external training courses; these mainly relate to information technology and EU training courses for statisticians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of the new CSO building in Cork is being financed under the Office <Col N="230" /> of Public Works Vote on a 20 year leasepurchase basis.  Fitting out costs of approximately £1.85 million were provided for in the £2.11 million allowed for decentralisation costs in the 1993 CSO Vote.</P>
    <P>The main transfer of CSO staff to Cork will be completed on schedule by the end of January 1994.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State indicate the duties and functions of the CSO which are not being transferred to Cork and if the 400 staff who, apparently, have not volunteered to transfer to Cork will be used in carrying out the remaining functions of the CSO in Dublin or in what way will their services be utilised?  How is it that a decision to relocate large numbers of staff and offices from one part of the State to another has not been costed accurately or adequately so that the Minister of State can tell us how much precisely decentralisation is costing us?  Will the Minister of State tell us the precise advantages to be gained in terms of jobs for this country in adopting this musical chairs approach to job creation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The following activities are being retained in the Central Statistics Office in Dublin: the national accounts; balance of payments and foreign trade statistics &mdash; the reason for this is to ensure that they will be adjacent to the principal data sources such as the Revenue Commissioners and the Central Bank &mdash; and demographic statistics &mdash; mainly because of the necessity to temporarily employ and accommodate more than 200 office staff, particularly for the census of population taken every five years.  Staff not moving to Cork will be deployed in the normal manner throughout the Civil Service to fill vacancies that may arise.  This is normal practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of decentralisation, I do not propose to go into the philosophical arguments; this has always been the policy of my party and other parties in Government.  It is not measured solely in terms of money; apart from the economic benefits to be gained in transferring <Col N="231" /> personnel from one part of the country to another there are also social benefits.  The decision is taken on that basis.  Decentralisation has proved to be a boom for provincial cities and towns.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>If a member of the staff who is essential to the operation in Cork decides that he or she does not want to go will they be penalised?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the policy to penalise anyone; the scheme is voluntary. As the Deputy is aware, a number of people have decided that they do not want to go to Cork.  They will be used either within the CSO in Dublin where there will be 130 posts or within other Departments in Dublin.  Therefore, there is no question of discrimination or victimisation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>

      <P>This question could possibly have been tied with the previous one.  That is one of the reasons Fianna Fáil and the Government have been great advocates of decentralisation through the years.</P>
      <P>There is one other statistics in which the Deputy might be interested.  The population of the urban part of Connaught which consists of towns of 1,500 or more increased by 117 per cent in that period while in the rural part it declined by almost 39 per cent.  Even within the boundaries of the provinces there is a huge shift in population.</P>

      <Quest>whether he has received a list detailing the names of 100 women who could be appointed to State Boards and other bodies; the person from whom the list was received; and whether he has also been provided with details of the political affiliations of those named.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received from Deputy Mary Wallace, on behalf of the Fianna Fáil National Women's Committee, a directory containing details of women interested in serving on State boards.  There is no indication of their political affiliations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware it is widely known that Fianna Fáil put together a prospectus of 100 women who could be appropriately appointed to State boards?  Will he agree it is not appropriate for a party-proofed list to be submitted to Government Minister's and that such appointments should be based on merit, not on party affiliations or the imprimatur of any Government party having been first given to such appointments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the question of imprimatur from any party would not arise.  I assure the Deputy that any appointments made by my Department would be strictly on the basis of merit.  It is open to any party to compile such a list if it is minded to do so.  That was done, and if the Deputy's party wish to compile such a list I will be happy to receive it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that this Fianna Fáil-approved list has been submitted to every Government Minister?  In the interest of ensuring equality of representation, not just in the area of gender proofing but to ensure that no preference is shown to any individual based on party affiliation, will he take action to indicate to his colleagues in Government that this list should not necessarily be relied on in making such appointments?  Will the Minister agree it would be far more appropriate &mdash; if such lists are compiled &mdash; that it should be done on a non-party political basis by a <Col N="238" /> body such as the Council for the Status of Women?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I can safely assure the Deputy that the members of the Government are just as able as I to decide what weight, if any, to give to any list of people that may be submitted to them.  I reiterate that it is the practice of the Government and its members to appoint people to State boards on the basis of merit and fitness for the task which they are being asked to carry out and on no other basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate whether any similar list of 100 approved women has been circulated on behalf of the Labour Party?  If not, perhaps he will indicate why, in the context of appointments made to date by this Government, there seems to be a particular bias towards ensuring that those who are appointed to boards, men or women, have connections with either Labour or Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any similar list having been prepared by the Labour Party, nor can I make any comment as to the particular affiliation of any appointee.  As far as I am aware, any appointments are based on the merit of the appointee and on that alone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 26 and 154 together.</P>
      <P>The EC Directive on the protection of pregnant and breastfeeding workers must be implemented by 19 October 1994 and the necessary legislation to comply with this Directive will, I hope, be introduced in sufficient time to have it enacted by that deadline.  While my colleagues, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment and the Minister for Social Welfare, are examining the implications of the Directive for their areas of responsibility, namely safety and health of workers and social security rights, I will bring forward legislation dealing with employment rights.  In this regard I will be seeking to strengthen protection of employment rights of pregnant workers and introduce similar protection for working mothers who are breastfeeding.</P>
      <P>I propose to introduce the necessary changes to the Maternity Protection of Employees Act, 1981, by means of an amending Bill.  The quantification of associated costs of implementing this Directive are currently the subject of interdepartmental discussion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give an assurance to the House that the date by which this legislation must be implemented, 19 October 1994, will be complied with, having regard to the poor record of Governments in this State complying with directives which seek to extend rights to women?  Will the Minister <Col N="240" /> accept, in the interest of equality, that the time has long since passed when it should be recognised that in the context of a child being born there are two parents, father and mother?  Has the Minister any intention of expressly providing for a protected period of paternity leave when children are born, not just so that the father can be at home with the children but is available to assist the mother at a time when she requires assistance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope to have the necessary legislation prepared in sufficient time to comply with the directive and enable it to be in force in law by the date fixed by the EU Directive, namely, 19 October 1994.  There is ongoing work on the preparation of the aspects of the legislation in so far as they refer to my Department.  Only parts of that directive are referable to my Department others are referable to the Minister for Enterprise and Employment and the Minister for Social Welfare, respectively.  Questions regarding those aspects of the directive should be addressed to those Ministers.  The matter of paternity leave is under examination in my Department and is a separate subject not related to this EU directive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 25 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have reviewed the requirements of <Col N="241" /> the Employment Equality Agency in the context of its proposed wider role and the constrained budgetary position.</P>
    <P>In 1994 a sum of £500,000 is to be allocated to the agency in respect of its activities.  This represents an increase of 23 per cent on the 1993 provision and is a major boost to the resources of the agency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Employment Equality Agency will be pleased with the increased allocation, but does the Minister believe that it will be sufficient for the agency to fulfil its wider role when the Legal Aid Board and the family mediation service come under its aegis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Legal Aid Board and the family mediation service will be quite separate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the greater demands being placed on the agency and that to expedite matters in hand it requires the appointment of a research officer?  The post has been sanctioned but the appointment has not yet been made.  Does the Minister believe that the extra allocation will be sufficient to meet the demands for information and research placed on the agency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The substantially increased allocation being provided for the agency in 1994 will be sufficient to enable it meet its targets and carry out its functions in 1994.  I assure the Deputy that legal aid and mediation do not come within the ambit of the Employment Equality Agency.  Separate arrangements provide for those services and the EEA has no role in that regard.  The Deputy is correct in saying that perhaps the EEA will have a wider role in relation to proposed legislation to which I have referred to in the House on previous occasions.  It is difficult to know exactly how the funding will work out during 1994 and the matter will be kept under continuing review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister intend to allow the agency greater autonomy in <Col N="242" /> appointing staff?  I understand one of the agency's great difficulties is that it has no specialist staff.  Will the allocation allow for flexibility in regard to staff?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Once the funds are allocated to the agency there should be no difficulty in securing the staff it requires to carry out its functions.  It carries out those functions in an extremely able, competent and professional manner.  An increased allocation will be provided to the agency in 1994 representing a substantial 23 per cent increase on the 1993 provision.  The inquiries I have made and the consultations I have had with the Employment Equality Agency indicate that those increased funds will enable it to secure all necessary advice, consultancy and research facilities to carry out its functions in its usual competent manner in 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding staffing, does the Minister not agree that there are areas under the aegis of the EEA where it is not sufficient for people to be transferred from other sections of the Civil Service and that there should be flexibility to allow specialist staff to be directly recruited to the agency?  Such a degree of autonomy and flexibility would be a great facility for the agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that from time to time it will be necessary to avail of specialist advice services and, perhaps, employees.  Arrangements are available to provide for that and I believe the necessary funding to facilitate it will be available.  The Employment Equality Agency consults with me on a regular basis and their requirements are reviewed.  I intend to do all that is necessary to ensure that it is enabled to carry out its functions in a proper manner and that the staff it requires, specialist or otherwise, is made available to it.</P>

      <Quest>if he will make a statement on the progress to date of his request to all political parties to indicate their positions regarding the issue of the dual mandate as outlined by the Second Commission on the Status of Women; and the way in which he intends to pursue this reform in the interests of democracy and gender balance in politics.</Quest>

      <P>My programme manager wrote to the political parties on 5 March last seeking their views on relevant recommendations of the Commission on the Status of Women.  To date only the Labour Party and the Green Party have given substantive replies.</P>
      <P>I would urge the other parties to let us have their views as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>If I had known the details of the Minister's reply I would have asked him to be in attendance in the public gallery at a Dublin County Council meeting held yesterday when two hours were allocated to debating this matter.  Does the Minister accept that the recommendation in the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women on the abolition of the dual mandate before the next election suggests that law reform is urgently required to enable parties select candidates before the next election?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not clear from the commission's report whether it advocates a change in the law or merely a change of practice.  If an amendment of the law is required in that regard, that would be the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment.  The views of all parties on this issue will have to be taken into account.  I was interested to read that Deputy Sargent remained a member of Dublin County Council until yesterday <Col N="244" /> when he resigned and he appears to be following the stated practice of his party. I received acknowledgements from the other parties to my correspondence but no substantive replies.  I will send reminders to the parties to ascertain their views.  There are various aspects to the commission's recommendations in regard to the dual mandate.  When I receive the views of all the parties I will consider the matter further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the public confusion on the issue and the need for legislative change rather than unilateral change may be the reason the Minister has not received replies from other parties. That partly explains why the Greens had to work very hard to inform the public about what was happening.  The Minister should not sit on the fence but should lead by example, as he has done in other areas, and bring forward proposals to explain to the public &mdash; who often take more note of what Ministers rather than what backbenchers say &mdash; the need for ending the dual mandate, regardless of whether he receives the support of other parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter which requires consensus if change is to be made in existing practices.  For that reason I undertook consultation with all parties.  I am disappointed that, apart from the Labour Party and the Green Party, none of the other parties has furnished substantive replies.  I would need to know their views before attempting to progress the matter further in terms of local authority and European Parliament membership.  As I indicated, I am quite happy to reopen discussions with other parties and I would ask them if they are yet in a position to furnish substantive replies to the queries raised with them.</P>

Will the Minister say why there is a preponderence of Department officials on the committee?  Does the Minister not believe, particularly in relation to the whole question of equality of women, that the impetus for change has come from women's organisations and voluntary bodies and that their role in that change and in the input into the commission <Col N="247" /> report is not reflected in the make-up of this committee?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>This committee was set up as a monitoring and advisory group.  The actual work was done by the Second Commission on the Status of Women who put forward recommendations in its report.  It was suggested that this committee be set up to consider which recommendations should be put forward to Government for consideration with a view to their implementation.  That is why it is very important to have on the committee representatives of the appropriate Government Departments who will be involved in the implementation of the recommendations.  Other essential groupings such as the Council for the Status of Women, the Irish Countrywomen's Association, the Irish Farmers Association, the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Employment Equality Agency are well represented.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister say why no deadline has been set for completion of the work of the committee?  I return to the question raised by Deputy McManus in that it appears there is a preponderence of civil servants on the committee.  Notwithstanding the Minister's reply, would he not agree that it would have been better to include more women's organisations and voluntary organisations in the make-up of the committee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a fair balance between the associations involved and representatives of the Departments who after all will have the task of deciding which recommendations should go forward to Government for consideration. The question of a deadline does not arise. I would remind the House that there are 210 separate recommendations in the report which covers all matters affecting women's lives.  It will take some time to examine all these recommendations and arrange for their implementation &mdash;<Col N="248" /> many of them have already been implemented.  Having regard to the extensive list of recommendations in the report, it would be presumptuous to try to set a deadline, and there is no intention of doing so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept that it is not sufficient that the committee consider only recommendations to be implemented?  There is a large political element as to the priorities that are set and the dominance of civil servants on the committee will distort the role of the committee.  Will the Minister agree that if priorities are to be set it is more appropriate that they be set by a more balanced committee?  Apart from what can be managed easily through the system, there is also a political dimension which will determine which recommendations are given priority and brought into effect as quickly as possible. No member of the committee has been democratically elected by the people and, apart from one person from the Council for the Status of Women, there is no representation of those voluntary organisations working with women, for example, the various support groups, Women's Aid, the Rape Crisis Centre, etc.  Will the Minister accept that there is a large political dimension to this issue, which he has not recognised in his replies to questions today?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy McManus's suggestion was to be followed up, one could visualise a huge committee of 40 to 50 members which would accomplish nothing.  I agree that there is a political dimension to this issue.  At the end of the day the decision regarding which particular recommendations are implemented at any particular time is a matter for the Government &mdash; it is the Government, a democratically elected group, which decides these issues and has the political input into them.  The setting up of this monitoring committee was recommended in the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women &mdash; its setting up is in compliance with one recommendation.  This committee reviews the position and considers which measues are appropriate at certain time. The Government considers these positions from time to time and decides which of the commission's recommendations should be progressed by way of legislation <Col N="250" /> or otherwise, as may be appropriate.</P>

      <P>I propose, to take Questions Nos. 10, 28 and 32 together.</P>
      <P>The Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, requires an employer to pay to employees, irrespective of gender, equal pay for equal work or work of equal value.</P>
      <P>Under the Programme for a Partnership Government, I am committed to the introduction of broad-ranging equality legislation that will cover a wide range of grounds, including sex, marital or parental status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race, colour, nationality, and national or ethnic origins, including membership of the travelling community.</P>
      <P>The legislation will consist of two Bills, one dealing with employment and the other with non-employment areas, including access to facilities, services and clubs.  I hope to bring forward both Bills in 1994.  This legislation will facilitate our ratification of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions <Col N="255" /> Nos. 11, 12, 16, 22, 34 and 157 together.</P>
      <P>The Legal Aid Board consists of 12 members and a chairperson whose terms of office are due to expire in 1995.  The current members were, with one exception, appointed before I, as Minister for Equality and Law Reform, took over responsibilities in relation to the legal aid scheme.  The Department of Justice representative on the board relinquished his position on 19 October 1993 to facilitate the appointment of a representative of my Department.  I availed of that opportunity to appoint a woman to the board.  I am determined to achieve better representation for women on the Legal Aid Board and I will take steps accordingly when next a suitable opportunity arises.</P>
      <P>Legal aid and advice is available at any of the 16 law centres operated by the board.  There are also 19 other law centres which provide services on a part-time basis and one temporary law centre at Aston House, Dublin for the purpose of the operation of the private solicitor pilot project.  The location of each law centre is set out on the list which I propose to have circulated in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>I have frequently referred in the House to the commitment contained in the Programme for a Partnership Government to the provision of additional funding to facilitate development and expansion of legal aid.  I succeeded in obtaining additional funding this year which has allowed for the recruitment of 12 solicitors. A total of 29 support staff is also in the process of being employed, and, of course, I secured a special allocation of £100,000 for the private solicitor pilot project that is currently in operation. These developments in 1993 represent the first phase of a development programme for the board which has been devised in line with the commitment in the Government's programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have succeeded in obtaining £5 million as grant-in-aid for the Legal Aid Board for 1994, an increase of almost £2 million over the 1993 grant-in-aid.  This will facilitate the next phase of the <Col N="256" /> development programme for the legal aid scheme and it will, among other matters, make possible the opening of a number of much needed new law centres.  The number and location of these new law centres will be announced in due course but in the near future.</P>
    <P>The waiting periods in each of the board's law centres as of 8 December 1993 are set out in a tabular statement which I propose also to have circulated in the Official Report.  The statement includes for purposes of comparison the waiting periods in law centres on 23 July 1993.  The combination of the introduction of the private solicitor pilot project and additional solicitor staff to the law centres in that period has resulted in very significant reductions in waiting times in most law centres.  While the waiting period in the Athlone Law Centre has been only marginally reduced, at this stage, to 13 months the reduction in other centres have been very significant and in some cases are between six and nine months.  As a result waiting lists now in eight centres, namely, North Mall, Cork, Ormond Quay, Dublin, Clondalkin, Dundalk, Galway, Limerick, Sligo and Tralee are down to between one and two months, in four centres &mdash; Gardiner Street, Dublin, Finglas, Tallaght and Castlebar &mdash; they are down to between three and five months.  In the remaining three centres &mdash; South Mall, Cork, Letterkenny and Waterford &mdash; the waiting lists are now between six and seven months.  The further development planned for 1994 should reduce the waiting lists even further and it will make legal aid more accessible to applicants generally.</P>
    <P>The waiting time for each category of case dealt with by the law centres is not available.  However, priority is given to all cases which require early attention such as cases involving child abduction, domestic violence, child care and cases which could become statute barred.</P>
    <P>With regard to equality matters the position is that legal advice in this area is already available under the scheme. Legal aid is only available where court proceedings are concerned.  While the scheme does not apply to cases before <Col N="257" /> tribunals at present there is a commitment in the Programme for Government to examine the possibility of extending legal aid to tribunals.</P>
    <P>I am aware of a study carried out by FLAC on the question of access to the courts in four European countries, including Ireland, which makes brief reference to legal aid in each of the countries concerned.  However, this is not a comprehensive study of legal aid and so far as I am aware there are no official comprehensive studies available on the legal aid systems in the member states of the European Union.  Comparisons between the various systems is difficult because of the differences in the legal system and resources in member states.  I am, however, confident that the substantial funding which this Government has committed to legal aid will make our system comparable with the best of systems elsewhere. Apart from extra funding, the Government programme also provided that the legal aid scheme should be put on a statutory footing.  That legislation is in the course of being drafted and will be introduced as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I have informed Coolock Community Law Centre, at a meeting which I held recently with their representatives, that a development plan for legal services is already in place.  The funding of their centre has heretofore been provided by the Department of Social Welfare through the Combat Poverty Agency and I have indicated to them that that arrangement is the subject at present of an inter-departmental review.</P>

    <P>&dagger;Because of the nature of the service it provides the concept of a waiting list does not apply to the temporary Law Centre at Aston House.</P>
    <P>* Aston House waiting list transferred to Clondalkin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask three brief questions.  What impact does the Minister intend the additional funding that will be available next year to have on the waiting lists and will he accept that waiting lists of anything above three to four weeks for access to a law centre are quite unacceptable?</P>
      <P>Second, would the Minister accept that when a person is required to go before a tribunal, such as a wife appealing against an application for loan parent's allowance or for deserted wife's allowance, the decision made by the tribunal for that woman is just as important as any decision that might be made on a maintenance claim by the District Court or any other court and that legal aid should be extended to such applications?</P>
      <P>Third, is it the Minister's view that the funding for Coolock Community Law Centre should come through his Department so that the annual wrangles over providing funding for that law centre are finally resolved and its funding provided with a coherent overall plan to provide legal aid services?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the additional funding for 1994 is concerned, I consider it will have a major impact in reducing further the waiting period.  As I indicated in my reply, already under the measures which I have put in place in 1993, very substantial reductions have taken place. In four or five law centres the waiting time has been reduced to one month and in some others to two months.  There has been extraordinarily large reductions in the waiting lists in 1993.  Quite clearly, the very impressive increase in funding which I have secured for 1994 in the Estimates, from £3 million to almost £5 million, will have a major impact in reducing even further those already shortened waiting lists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of accessing free legal aid to tribunal representation also, is, as I said in my reply, a matter that is being considered.  The Programme for a Partnership Government provides that that question is to be examined.  Much will depend on the resources available.  I agree with Deputy Shatter that the <Col N="261" /> decisions made by many of these tribunals are equally as important for the people concerned as would be decisions from a normal court.  The question of an examination of that matter is continuing.</P>
    <P>Funding for Coolock law centre, as I said, is the subject of an inter-departmental review and discussions are ongoing.  It would be desirable to clear up the matter once and for all and that is the reason the interdepartmental discussions are taking place.  As soon as the appropriate decisions in regard to the issue have been taken, the relevant decision will be communicated to the trustees of the Coolock Law Centre.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that, despite the additional funding that will be made available in 1994, in fact our civil legal aid scheme is a disaster, in so far as it does not provide a comprehensive civil legal aid scheme nationwide?  Does he not accept that we are in the position in which the scales of justice, as between the rich and the poor, are very unevenly balanced, in fact are not balanced at all and that, unless a totally new approach is adopted, that will continue to be in the position?  Would he agree that all we are doing is tinkering with and adding to what is already a totally inadequate scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Jim O'Keeffe suggests that the legal aid scheme is inadequate, thereby implying that very considerable sums should be expended on it.  That is in stark contrast to the comments of his party's spokesperson on Finance who calls this Government a &ldquo;tax and spend Government&rdquo;.  This Government regards the question of legal aid as a matter of top priority and substantial resources have been put into the legal aid scheme in 1993, with dramatic effects.  I know that Deputy O'Keeffe, and indeed all Members on the opposite side of the House, will very much welcome that achievement.  The increase provided for the Legal Aid Board for 1994 is of an extent never matched by any previous Government since the whole civil legal aid scheme was initiated.  Quite clearly, <Col N="262" /> that increased provision will have a dramatic effect, representing nearly a doubling in resources, enabling new law centres to be opened in parts of the country which badly need them.  In addition, it will enable upgrading of some of the part-time centres and the recruitment of additional staff, which represents a major breakthrough.  We will watch and ascertain how it progresses as time goes on.  I think the Deputy will be pleased and will welcome the achievement of this Government, and the fact that it has put its money where its mouth is on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>To revert to the representation of women on the Legal Aid Board, notwithstanding the fact that the Minister availed of the opportunity to appoint one woman member himself, is it his intention, at the expiration of the term of office of the present board, to ensure equal representation of men and women on that board?  Does the Minister envisage any proactive role to ensure that that might be the case in the interim?  I am sure the Minister would agree that it is vital that equality cases should have the facility for legal aid and that legal aid should be extended to cases heard by tribunals.  Would the Minister say precisely when he envisages these things happening?  Could he give us a projected date within the next few months, at which point we could satisfy ourselves that the long waiting lists, in particular the lengthy waiting period of 13 months, are being reduced considerably, and we could ascertain how the scheme is operating? Would the Minister be prepared to prescribe a date by which we could undertake a review of the system as it will have operated to that point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad Deputy Keogh raised the question of the gender composition of the existing Legal Aid Board.  I might point out to her that when I took office the Legal Aid Board comprised male members only and was appointed by a Government in which her party had two Ministers.  I have had only one opportunity to do something about that.  When a vacancy arose I appointed <Col N="263" /> a woman to fill it.  I can assure the House and Deputy Keogh that the precedent set by her party in Government will not be followed by me, that the appropriate gender balance will be achieved on the Legal Aid Board as soon as I can do so.</P>
      <P>So far as waiting lists at law centres are concerned, I have to admit that the one exceptional case is Athlone, where the delay has been reduced from 14 months of 13 months, quite out of line with all the other 15 law centres, many of which now have delays of as little as one month. Obviously there is some basic problem there.  I have not yet ascertained the reason but have instructed my officials to make the appropriate inquiries.  The waiting lists have been reduced very substantially &mdash; halved in most cases, even more in others.  For example, the delay at Gardiner Street is down from 13 months or five months; at Dundalk it is down from four months to one month and at Limerick down from ten months to one month.  Members will see that substantial progress has already been made in that area, and further improvements will be made when the new money for 1994 begins to take effect and we get the new centres opened up.</P>
      <P>I have already dealt with equality cases extensively in my reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept that, while any reduction in the waiting lists is to be welcomed, it is still a long way from the experience of private clients in consulting a solicitor, who may walk in off the street and obtain an appointment immediately?  There remains a huge gap between that latter experience and that of a person attending a civil legal aid centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the geographic inequity &mdash; about which the Minister is now in a position to do something &mdash; no doubt he is aware that only nine out of 26 counties actually have legal aid centres.  Can he assure the House that he can set a limit to the amount of travel that must be undertaken by people particularly in rural areas, to reach a legal aid centre? Athlone is a good example, because I am <Col N="264" /> sure it covers a very large catchment area involving a lot of travel that many poor women cannot afford.  Does the Minister intend to initiate a plan for the development of mediation services nationwide which would ease pressure on legal aid centres and constitute a much more productive method of resolving family law matters?  In view of the fact that a referendum on divorce will be held next year &mdash; possibly resulting in legislation being introduced &mdash; does the Minister intend also to extend the work of the legal aid centres in relation to tribunals? The Minister has not indicated when that might take place but, if it is the case, surely those two developments will use up many of the additional resources being put into the services and, as a result there will not be a major improvement overall?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy McManus for her somewhat begrudging recognition of the fact that there have been very substantial reductions in the waiting times at all law centres, with the exception of that located at Athlone.  I assure her that the matter of redressing geographic inequities, to which she referred, comprises a key part of the National Development Plan.  As I said in my initial reply, new law centres are to be opened in 1994 with the new funding which has been provided.  The question of their geographic location will be carefully considered. I sympathise with the problems of people travelling to law centres to obtain advice and have action taken on their behalf.  It was for that reason that the pilot scheme on the involvement of private practitioners was introduced.  It has been a great success so far because private practitioners are located in every town.  Already the operation of the private practitioners pilot scheme has enabled many people in remote areas, far away from the next nearest law centre, to obtain legal help virtually on their doorstep.  Indeed, the heads of one or two of the law centres indicated that when they had communications from people living in outlying areas they were able to avail of the private practitioners' scheme by referring them to a solicitor <Col N="265" /> in those remote locations.  That was the purpose for which the private practitioner's scheme was designed.  I understand it appears to be working reasonably well and plays a worthwhile role.  Deputy McManus also raised the question of alleviation service and asked about future plans, but that should be the matter of a separate question.</P>
      <P>I have dealt with the question of tribunals in my main reply in which I said that in the Programme for Government the question of accessibility of free legal aid for tribunals was a matter for consideration. The first priority is to arrange for the new law centres to open, to upgrade the system, have the remaining waiting lists of substance reduced even further and provide a more broadly based service throughout the country.  When that is in place we will consider other aspects of extending the service, depending on what resources may be available from time to time.  I am not in a position to give any specific date in that regard.</P>

      <P>I should like to raise with the Minister the problem regarding the problem of access to free legal advice by rural women.  I represent the constituency of South Tipperary and the free legal aid centre for the area is in Waterford. I support Deputy McManus because, as many women cannot afford to travel to Waterford or to make telephone calls, they are severely disadvantaged. To overcome this problem of geographical location &mdash; a major problem &mdash; will the Minister extend the availability of private solicitors to provide advice or does he have proposals to establish a new legal aid centre in places such as South Tipperary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to indicate at which geographic locations a new centre may be established in 1994.  I confirm that the Legal Aid Board, in consultation with me, will look at areas <Col N="266" /> where there is a geographic inequity in the provision of the service.  That will be a prime consideration in deciding the new locations.  I am sure the representations from Deputy Ahearn will be taken into account in that regard.  An announcement will be made as soon as possible in 1994 when the new locations have been agreed, new premises acquired, staff taken on and so on.  As far as the continuation of the private practitioner's pilot scheme is concerned, a detailed assessment of its operation will be carried out later this year or early next year.  The question of its continued operation will be taken in the context of that review.</P>

      <P>I am certain the Minister was glad of the opportunity to give a long reply to the series of questions tabled to him concerning the legal aid system.  It was a rare opportunity for him to say he had good news.  It applied to Ennis when members of the Labour Party announced that a new legal aid centre would be opened there.  When the Minister has drawn up his new list of centres will he inform all Deputies of his proposals rather than being selective as in the past? I have had numerous inquiries regarding the location of the legal aid centre in Ennis.  Will recruitment be by public competition?  What assistance can be given to people?  I am in the dark; perhaps the Minister would let in some light.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, as I said, I am not in a position to indicate where the new centres will be.  One of the major improvements will be an upgrading of the areas which already have a part-time law centre.  There are two part-time law centres in the Deputy's county, in Ennis and Kilrush and their upgrading is a matter for active consideration by the legal aid board in drawing up its overall plan.  I am sure that what the Deputy really cares about is the fact that the increased service will be provided.  How it is announced or to whom is really a secondary matter. I know the Deputy is concerned about having this facility made available to his constituents and I share that concern. That is the important thing.  The nitty <Col N="267" /> gritty of the announcement is neither here nor there.  The Government, having provided the money, will get the credit for it one way or the other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>My Question No. 34 relates to how we fare in the league of international comparisons.  Will the Minister tell the House how we fare in relation to other member states of the European Union?  Can he name the member states that have a worse system of civil legal aid than we have?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the figures to indicate how we compare with free legal aid systems in other countries of the European Union.  However, we compared considerably better in 1993 than in any previous year and we will certainly fare even better in 1994.  The Deputy will agree the trend is in the right direction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to take up the last point, that the trend was favourable. I remind the Minister, in case it is not within the confines of his portfolio in front of him, when he speaks about new law centres and good news that the centre in Portlaoise opened amid a fanfare of publicity in 1990 and closed shortly afterwards. The reason the Minister specified the centre in Athlone in his initial reply was because it is now catering for far more in terms of numbers than originally reckoned and is dealing with the entire midlands area.  Will Portlaoise be <Col N="268" /> regarded as a new centre or what consideration will be given to it, having regard to the serious problem that exists in the midlands because there is virtually no legal aid system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The locations of the centres throughout the country are being examined in depth by the Legal Aid Board.  It has at its disposal the subtantial new funds which the Government decided to allocate for civil legal aid in 1994.  As I said before &mdash; and it bears repeating &mdash; the new centres will be designed to cater for areas where there is insufficient provision on a geographic location basis.  It should be possible to make substantial improvements having regard to the increased funding being made available. I will certainly draw to the attention of the Legal Aid Board the point made by Deputy Flanagan concerning the closure of a legal aid centre in Portlaoise.  I am concerned about what is happening in Athlone and I will make inquiries in that regard.  I am sure the midlands area will receive the active consideration of the board in fixing the new locations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received a request for financial assistance from the European Centre for Travellers.</P>
      <P>On 18 February 1993, I had a meeting with four representatives of the centre at which the issue was discussed.  I explained that my role as Minister for Equality and Law Reform was essentially a co-ordinating one and that, as such, my Department was not in a position to fund projects of this nature, however worthwhile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I subsequently approached some other Ministers to ascertain whether their <Col N="269" /> Departments might be in a position to provide financial assistance to the centre but I was informed that they were unable to do so.  Unfortuntately, due to current budgetary constraints, the Government is not in a position to provide financial assistance for many laudable projects, such as the centre in question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the confusion in people's minds about his role in the provision of facilities for the travelling community and work in connection with the integration and settlement of the travelling community?  Does he consider that the work being undertaken at the European Centre for Travellers in Tuam is praiseworthy and deserving of support?  Would he agree that it is astonishing that the only funds being made available for this work have come directly from a European Community source and the Irish Government has failed to support its work?  Is this indicative of the Government's opinion on the work being undertaken?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>From the report on the intended project for the European Centre for Travellers, it appears to be very worthwhile.  They are seeking £3.3 million approximately over a three year period for the provision of vocational training workshops, libraries, a museum, a heritage centre, an auditorium and theatre facilities, a social centre, accommodation facilities and administrative expenses.  This major project is very desirable.  My Department, however, in this regard is not a funding Department. The role of my Department in this connection is clearly set out in the Programme for a Partnership Government. The question of direct responsibility for housing, and other matters in relation to the travelling community, rests with the local authorities, but the Departments of the Environment, Health and Education have a role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no provision in my Estimate from which a grant of that order could be made.  The question of the needs of the travelling community is being addressed by a task force on the travelling community <Col N="270" /> under the chairmanship of Deputy McManus.  It will examine all aspects of the needs of the travelling community and the co-ordination between different Departments.  The role of Government agencies, Departments, local authorities and so on come within the ambit of the task force.  I do not wish to prejudge the task force, as it may well indicate that certain rationalisation or co-ordination or variation in areas of responsibility may be appropriate.</P>
    <P>I regret that it was not possible to provide funding towards this very ambitious project in 1993 but perhaps the situation may be different in 1994 and I suggest the Deputy raise the matter with the Minister for the Environment or other appropriate Ministers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed with the Minister's response except that he confirmed that he was aware of the work being undertaken at this centre since February 1993 &mdash; he will recall having had a discussion with me shortly after his appointment and to have received correspondence from me.  It represents a poor response from a Government which claims it would make progress, to find that all the Departments of State which have been approached have refused to give a positive response or indication of positive support which sets back the objectives of the special responsibilities alleged to have been devolved to the Minister in the Programme for a Partnership Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the great interest that Deputy Molloy has had in this project for quite some time; he corresponded with me about it.  I met the promoters of the scheme and they discussed the matter with me.  It is a very impressive scheme but it is regrettable that there has not been funding available for it in 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raised this matter with other Ministers to see whether resources might be made available.  There are many worthwhile laudable projects for the travelling community and other similar projects. This is a very ambitious project and I am <Col N="271" /> sure Deputy Molloy will pursue it with other Departments which might have a role in this area.  My Department, unfortunately, is not a funding Department and an examination of the Estimates for 1994 shows that clearly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that the work of the task force should not be used as an excuse for the lack of action of bodies responsible for the provision of services to the travelling community.  In his role as co-ordinator will the Minister pursue this matter?  I note, for example, he has not indicated whether he contacted the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht as there is a very large cultural component in this application. The project is in a part of the country that the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht knows well.  Although the Minister may not be able to finance this directly surely he has a role to play in setting up a package to fund this centre from various sources.  It would be immensely helpful if action of this type is taken, particularly in view of the work this centre does.  The centre was established without any assistance from Government sources and it is about time the Government supported it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I did take up the matter with the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht but, unfortunately, he did not have funds available in his Estimate for 1993.  I have no objection to taking the matter up again with those Ministers in the context of the Estimates for 1994. Of course, it is open to any Member to raise the matter directly with any of the Ministers by tabling an appropriate question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised this matter with every Minister in the Cabinet from the Taoiseach down and in each case, the response was negative.  I was very disappointed to hear the Minister contradict himself when stating that his is not a funding Department.  In reply to the previous question, the Minister took almost half an hour applauding himself for <Col N="272" /> having succeeded in increasing by £2 million the amount for a scheme in which he has a vested interest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Deputy means by saying that I have a vested interest in the legal aid scheme. That is a matter that comes within the ambit of my Department and consequently I was dealing with it.  The question of funding for projects for the travelling community&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>The Terms of Reference of the Commission are:</P>
    <P>(1) to advise the Government on practical measures necessary to ensure that people with a disability can exercise their rights to participate, to the fullest extent of their potential, in economic, social and cultural life;</P>
    <P>(2) to examine the current situation of people with a disability and the organisation and adequacy of existing services, public and voluntary, to meet their needs;</P>
    <P>(3) to make recommendations setting out necessary changes, in legislation, policies, organisations, practices and structures to ensure that the needs of people with disabilities are met in a cohesive, comprehensive and cost effective way;</P>
    <P>(4) to establish the estimated costs of all recommendations made; and</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="275" /> (5) to report to the Government within a period of two years from the date of its establishment.</P>
    <P>One of the priorities for the Commission will be to examine the adequacy of existing service provision and recommend initiatives in legislation, policy, organisation and structures to ensure that the needs of people with disabilities are met in a cohesive, comprehensive and costeffective manner.</P>
    <P>The Commission will have an annual budget of approximately £75,000.  A small secretariat is being provided to service the Commission.</P>
    <P>The Council for the Status of People with Disabilities will serve as a forum for discussion of all issues affecting people with disabilities and will keep under review progress towards the general improvement in their situation.  My Department will facilitate the establishment of the council and I expect the Commission would also wish to make an input.</P>

On the other hand, the Council for the Status of People with Disability is the mirror image for the Council for the Status of Women, an organisation which monitors progress on a continuing basis.</P>

The Programme <Col N="276" /> for a Partnership Government contains a commitment that the Government will reach the quota for employing those with a physical disability.  Will the Minister go ahead with the commitments in the programme for Government or await the report of the commission and its recommendations?</P>

      <P>There is a question on the Order Paper dealing with the employment of people with disability.  There is no question of holding up any legislation or project because of setting up this commission. The preparation of legislation dealing with disadvantaged categories of people in the context of employment and supplying goods and services is proceeding in my Department.  The legislation will not await the findings of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities but, obviously, there will be an extensive exchange of views and consultation between my Department and the commission to try to hone it and make it effective to advance all aspects of the lives of people with disabilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 158 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 3 per cent quota for employment of people with disabilities in the Civil <Col N="277" /> Service has been exceeded.  According to figures supplied by the Department of Finance in November 1993 3.01 per cent of those employed in the Civil Service are people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the latest information available in the Department of Health and the Environment respectively, the percentage of people with disabilities employed by the health boards at the end of 1992 was 0.95 per cent, while in the local authorities, the percentage was 1.13 per cent.  I have made arrangements for the Deputies to be supplied with details of the latest information available in relation to State-sponsored bodies. There is no information available in my Department in respect of private industry.</P>
    <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Equality and Law Reform earlier this year, with special responsibility for legislating for people with disabilities, I strongly supported the continuation of Government policy in relation to the quota.  I held meetings with the Civil Service Commission, the NRB and the Department of Finance with a view to increasing the recruitment of people with disabilities in public sector employments. I have also raised the matter with the Ministers for Health and the Environment in relation to the position in the health boards and local authorities, respectively.</P>
    <P>In the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, negotiated between the social partners in 1991, the Government undertook to increase, on a gradual and sustained basis, the number of people with disabilities employed in the public service.  To oversee this commitment, a monitoring committee comprising representatives of Public Service unions and management was established.  This committee is chaired by a senior official of the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>Special competitions confined to people with disabilities and administered by the Civil Service Commission are being continued.  Despite the generally low intake to the Civil Service at present, there is no reason such competitions <Col N="278" /> cannot be arranged for all recruitment levels in the service.</P>
    <P>Against the background of encouraging progress in the Civil Service, consideration will be given to ways in which the private sector could make a contribution to the employment of people with disabilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the figure for the Government Departments.  However, will the Minister agree that the figures for the health boards and local authorities are a disgrace when one considers the 3 per cent quota?  I dread to think what the figures are for State-sponsored bodies and private enterprise when statistics are not available.  I can only deduce that they are much worse.  How does the Minister intend addressing the problem?  Will he try to achieve the 3 per cent quota by way of legislation or by persuasion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Deasy that while there is cause for satisfaction in that the 3 per cent quota has been achieved in the Civil Service, the figures for the employment of people with disabilities in local authorities and health boards is totally unacceptable.  I am having ongoing discussions with the relevant Ministers and I will be in touch with the Local Appointments Commission in that regard.  I hope to make progress initially by persuasion, but if that is not successful the question of legislation would have to be considered.  The legislation on anti-discrimination in employment which is in course of preparation in my Department will impact on this matter because it will introduce an important legal prohibition on the application of discrimination in the context of employment.</P>

Before this House adjourns we will have an Adjournment Debate during which a variety of issues will be discussed.

      <P>I would like to raise three matters.  First, if statements are to be made on Thursday morning on the position in Northern Ireland, which <Col N="376" /> would be welcome, the debate on the Bill due to be taken on Thursday would be compressed.  This Bill will be published tomorrow which is not in accordance with the Taoiseach's wish that Bills should be published at least two weeks before they are taken in the House.  On a number of occasions recently Dáil committees requested certain personnel to attend as witnesses to give evidence and information. In this regard will the Bill which will make it compulsory for witnesses to attend be published during the Christmas recess?</P>

      <P>That legislation is in the course of preparation and will be published as soon as it is completed, I hope during the Christmas recess as I indicated to the Deputy last week.  In relation to the other Bill mentioned by the Deputy, I understand it has been agreed between the Whips that it will be taken.

      <P>It has been suggested a number of times that statements are to be made on Thursday on the Summit and, presumably, the Taoiseach's discussions with Mr. Major in regard to Northern Ireland but no official notification has been received in my office.  Questions that I tabled in relation to the Summit were disallowed.  I was not told the reason but I must assume they were disallowed on the basis that it was the intention to have statements. Does the Taoiseach intend to allow questions either during the course of or following the statements, as I do not accept statements constitute an adequate way of dealing with the issues that arise from the Taoiseach's meeting with Mr. Major?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">

      <P>I will follow the well-established practice in this House in relation to statements.  The Government is pursuing a balanced joint declaration with the British Government.  It is not true to say that we have not been in contact with some of the highest people in the Unionist population &mdash; we have. <Col N="377" /> We would like to do much more but others chose not to have such official meetings.  That is not to say that we do not know what their concerns are or that they have suspicions.  These are being taken into account.  I think when Deputies hear the statement they will agree that it is not one way or the other.</P>

Is there a possibility that the statements on Thursday may not take place or may not be as full as they might be if the conversations referred <Col N="378" /> to are not completed?  Is the Taoiseach giving the House an assurance that he will inform the House of progress then and again on Friday if changes are happening so fast?  He should recognise the support he has been getting from Deputy John Bruton and his party, from all the other Opposition parties and attempt, when we raise these questions on the Order of Business, to be as helpful as possible and not always assume that there is some other motivation behind the questions.  We all share his desire to bring about a cessation of violence and a resumption of the talks.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="381" />&ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Let me first set the policy background against which this Bill was drafted.  When I was appointed Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications in January of this year it quickly became clear to me that Aer Lingus was facing a rapidly deteriorating financial situation.  In response to this and following consultation with my Government colleagues, I announced the appointment of an executive chairman and gave him executive responsibility to take whatever action was necessary, with immediate effect, to restore the company to commercial viability.</P>
    <P>Both the executive chairman and I felt that a partnership approach was essential in the difficult task facing him.  In pursuance of that, a special task force was established, with almost 40 consultative working groups, to make recommendations on every aspect of the Aer Lingus system and operations.  In addition, a company-wide open forum consultative process was initiated to facilitate input from staff.  On 13 June last, the board of Aer Lingus presented to the Government, its shareholder, a strategy to return the company to commercial viability, entitled <i>Strategy for the Future.</i> The strategic plan submitted by Aer Lingus in June provided the Government with an accurate and up to date assessment of the scale and nature of the company's problems.  It indicated that there were severe financial difficulties and that operating losses were running at unprecedented and unsustainable levels.</P>
    <P>Group profits of £28 million in the year ended 31 March 1990 have been transformed into losses of £188 million including restructuring costs in the year ended 31 March 1993.  Shareholders' funds have fallen from £443 million to £93 million in the same period.  In the <i>Strategy for the Future</i>, they are forecast to fall to £36 million in the current financial year.  In fact, the group has been losing over £1 million a week.  The annual accounts for the year ended 31 March 1993, published <Col N="382" /> in October, confirmed the picture painted in <i>Strategy for the Future.</i></P>
    <P>The groups's main problems have been in the air transport division which has had significant losses over the past four years.  In addition, the profit performance of the other divisions in the group had deteriorated progressively as a result of increased competition and the international economic recession.  This meant that they were incapable of supporting the losses in the core airline business and the full impact of the airline's losses was no longer cushioned by profits generated elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The judicious disposal of a number of assets, which are not essential to the core business was also an intrinsic element of the strategy.  In keeping with the partnership approach to which I referred earlier, the Cabinet sub-committee on aviation matters met the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on 22 June last to discuss the strategy.  This meeting was a very constructive one.  Both sides recognised that the underlying financial position of Aer Lingus was very grave and unsustainable and that the core airline business would have to be returned to operating viability.  All sides were committed to achieving the essential reduction in employee numbers which this entailed through a voluntary scheme.</P>
    <P>It was agreed that the question of participation by Aer Lingus employees in the future success of the company should be explored as a tangible form of recognition for the additional contribution being asked of the workforce at present.</P>
    <P>Finally, it was also agreed that a special enterprise development unit would be set up right away, to consist of representatives of the unions and Aer Lingus, together with the IDA, Fingal County Council, FÁS and the Department of Enterprise and Employment, to identify new employment opportunities within the Aer Lingus structure.</P>
    <P>On 6 July 1993, the Government decided to endorse the broad strategy set out in Aer Lingus's strategic plan.  I am pleased to say that very substantial progress has been made in implementing <Col N="383" /><i>Strategy for the Future</i> since it was approved by the Government in July.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to the question of Shannon and where it fits into the Aer Lingus strategy.  Aer Lingus and Shannon have grown up and developed together to such an extent that Aer Lingus accounts for 70 per cent of North Atlantic scheduled services through Shannon, despite the advent of other scheduled services in recent years.</P>
    <P>However, for a variety of reasons such as seasonality and intensive competition over London, the economics of a transatlantic operation for Aer Lingus are very difficult.  The company lost £12.9 million on its transatlantic operations last year. Without the changes proposed in its <i>Strategy for the Future</i>, it would have lost a further £20 million this year.  This was clearly unsustainable.  Aer Lingus would have been forced to pull off its transatlantic routes altogether if action had not been taken.</P>
    <P>Without Aer Lingus, the future of Shannon would be very bleak indeed. However, as I have said before in this House, without Shannon, the future of Aer Lingus on the transatlantic route would also be bleak.  Aer Lingus needs Shannon just as much as Shannon needs Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>The Aer Lingus package for Shannon is both imaginative and progressive and has the full support and approval of the Government.  It has that support and approval because it represents a major commitment on the part of Aer Lingus to Shannon.</P>
    <P>For the first time ever Shannon will have its own transatlantic operation based in and managed from Shannon; Aer Lingus transatlantic services will stop and start at Shannon.  There will be a year round daily New York service and a dedicated Shannon-New York service and in the peak summer season.  There will be no change in the current Boston service. Aer Lingus is examining ways of developing new business, including significantly lowering fares from the US, in order to extend the peak summer season and will work closely with local travel and tourism <Col N="384" /> groups in the Shannon region.  In addition, other marketing opportunities for the new low cost airline operation at Shannon will be exploited for other business in all markets, particularly in the off peak period.  Aer Lingus will base an extra aircraft at Shannon to operate a new early morning Shannon to Dublin service, greatly improving the service out of Shannon by providing new connections to six European and three UK-provincial destinations.</P>
    <P>Let me now turn to the renegotiation of the Ireland-US Air Transport Agreement. There has been some criticism that the amendment to the agreement heralded the end of Shannon as we know it.  Such criticism is ill-informed. The opposite is the case.  Had we not succeeded in getting the US authorities to agree to the amendment, there would have been a complete &ldquo;open skies&rdquo; regime between the US and Ireland with no requirement on US carriers to stop at Shannon ever again.  This is because under the previous agreement signed in 1990, once one carrier operated a direct flight to Dublin, all carriers would be entitled to by-pass Shannon.  Thus, if the transatlantic proposals in the Aer Lingus strategy had been put in place without the bilateral agreement having been amended, the Shannon stop would have disappeared completely and Shannon's status would have been eroded.</P>
    <P>It is worth remembering here that the US Government's stated policy is one of seeking &ldquo;open skies&rdquo; agreements with all countries.  When the amendment to the Ireland-US Air Transport Agreement was being signed in 1990, the then US Ambassador warned that, in the next air transport agreement between the two countries, the American Government would insist on abolishing the mandatory stop at Shannon.  This was the position of the US authorities upon entering the recent negotiations.</P>
    <P>No one should underestimate the difficulties which faced the Irish negotiating team in persuading the US authorities to forego the rights they automatically had under the old bilateral agreement.  I personally travelled to Washington to meet <Col N="385" /> the US Secretary for Transportation to impress upon him the importance for this Government of a vibrant Shannon Airport for the mid-west region.</P>
    <P>Following my intervention, the US side agreed to an early resumption of talks, despite its very heavy schedule.  We ended up with an agreement that fully meets the requirements of the Aer Lingus strategy and at the same time provides the basis for Shannon Airport to grow and prosper.  Any US airline which operates a direct flight into Dublin must also put one into Shannon.  It is widely recognised as a sound deal and I am heartened by the constructive attitude of tourism interests in the mid-west region towards the new agreement.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the evident energy and commitment of the workforce in Shannon Airport and the people of the mid-west region will ensure that every opportunity for growth available to the airport and the region under the total Aer Lingus package for Shannon will yield significant benefits in terms of wealth and job creation.</P>
    <P>On the question of alliances, the <i>Strategy for the Future</i> highlights the fact that Aer Lingus operates from a position of market strength on all its core routes. The airline has had discussions with a number of American and European airlines over the past year or so about the possibility of some form of joint venture or alliance.  No proposals have been brought before me to date for a total operating alliance.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus is confident however that, when the route network is restored to profitability, the airline will be in a position to strengthen both its market and financial positions through alliances with other carriers feeding into the Aer Lingus system.  This could be done in a number of ways such as cross-shareholding, costsharing deals or joint ventures.</P>
    <P>Some marketing alliances have already been entered into.  Earlier in the year, Aer Lingus concluded a memorandum of understanding regarding a worldwide interline feed agreement with British Airways on passengers and a similar agreement <Col N="386" /> has recently been concluded on freight.</P>
    <P>While continuing to search out strategic alliances, Aer Lingus believes it may have to wait until the strategy is fully opertional and the airline has achieved the necessary financial targets.  Clearly, this will place it in a much stronger position in seeking a partner.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, any investment by the Government in Aer Lingus must be approved by the European Commission. I indicated in this House last July that I would personally seek, as a matter of urgency, formal clearance from the Commission for the Aer Lingus strategy.</P>
    <P>The European Commission may decide in certain cases that aid may be granted to individual airlines which have serious financial difficulties provided certain conditions are met.  One of these conditions is that the aid must form part of a programme, to be approved by the Commission, to restore the airline's financial health so that it can, within a reasonably short period, operate viably without further State aid.  In other words, the financial assistance must be once-off in nature and must form an integral part of a restructuring programme to restore the financial viability and competitiveness of the airline.  With this in mind, the Government forwarded the formal notification of the proposed investment in Aer Lingus to the European Commission in August of this year. Prior to that, I had met with the relevant Commissioners.  Officials from my Department also had and continued to have a series of meetings with the Commission officials.</P>
    <P>We have repeatedly explained to the Commission, at both ministerial and official level, the importance of having this matter finalised in order to enable the first tranche of equity to be invested before the end of the year.  The Commission has indicated to us that it fully appreciates the urgency of the matter and has assured us that it is doing everything possible to expedite its examination.</P>
    <P>The Commission formally considered the notification at its meeting on 13 October <Col N="387" /> 1993 and, as expected, decided to open the procedures under Article 93 (2) of the Treaty of Rome with regard to the proposed investment.  The Commission invited the Government to submit its response to the Commission's comments on the matter within 30 days.  Other member states and interested parties were invited, by means of a communication published in the Official Journal of the European Communities to submit their comments on the proposed restructuring.  These are now being considered by the Commission.</P>
    <P>The Government remains confident that its investment in the airline will take place within the planned timescale and that Aer Lingus will be able to carry out its future operations in a commercially viable manner as envisaged in the <i>Strategy for the Future.</i> It would be inappropriate for me to comment on the details of discussions between the Government and the Commission. However, I can assure the House that the Government is vigorously pursuing the matter with the Commission with a view to ensuring a satisfactory outcome.</P>
    <P>An integral part of Aer Lingus's strategy is that the airline's annual operating costs must be reduced by £50 million in order to restore it to commercial viability.  The Government made this a condition of providing £175 million in equity.  The Government did not stipulate how the savings should be achieved. We clearly stated that this was a matter for negotiation between the management and unions.  To achieve these cost reductions the strategy envisaged a significant level of redundancies, both in the airline and in TEAM Aer Lingus, as well as other internal cost savings.  Negotiations took place between Aer Lingus management and the unions on the implementation of the cost cutting measures in the strategy.  These negotiations were vigorous and forceful on both sides.  I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the negotiating teams who worked long and hard to achieve agreement in a fair and reasonable way.  I would also like to commend <Col N="388" /> the Labour Relations Commission staff on the very professional facilitation they provided in the negotiation and conciliation process.</P>
    <P>I welcome the outcome of the staff union/ballot which by an emphatic majority accepted the Aer Lingus <i>Strategy for the Future</i> package.  The acceptance of this package provides a springboard for sustained viability and enhanced prospects for additional profitable business.  In particular, I acknowledge the very substantial efforts made by the company and staff to overcome the very considerable difficulties which have confronted them.</P>
    <P>Since the early 1970s, Aer Lingus pursued a strategy of investing in a range of diversified businesses as a means of underpinning the notoriously cyclical airline business.  These businesses had provided profits in buoyant market conditions, However, these ancillary businesses, particularly hotels, have increasingly been subject to the same cyclical downturns as the airline itself, thus weakening their ability to cushion the airline in recessionary times.  They also tend to have large capital requirements which compete with those of the airline and which can no longer be met from group resources.</P>
    <P>In the current circumstances, it is time for Aer Lingus to divest itself of many of these businesses, so that the group can strengthen its currently weak balance sheet and management can concentrate its energies and attention on the core air transport business.  Accordingly, the judicious disposal of a number of assets which are not essential to the core business is an essential part of the <i>Strategy for the Future.</i> This programme of disposal of non-core assets will be an orderly and not a fire-sale one.  I must emphasise that the sale by Aer Lingus of any of its subsidiaries is primarily a commercial matter for the company.  Some subsidiaries, such as TEAM and Airmotive, have considerable synergy with the airline. In these cases, joint venture partnerships, to assist with the development <Col N="389" /> of the companies, are the preferred option of Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>The Bill has three principal objectives: to authorise the Minister for Finance, as shareholder, to inject £175 million equity into Aer Lingus; to organise the group's corporate structure; and to allow for employee profit sharing schemes.</P>
    <P>The Aer Lingus Group does not exist as a legal entity.  Aer Lingus, the airline, comprises two separate legal companies. Aer Lingus plc was incorporated in 1936 and operates air services within Ireland and between Ireland and Europe.  Aerlínte Éireann plc was incorporated in 1947 and operates air services between Ireland and the United States.  Although separate legal entities, the two companies share a common management and board of directors.  The services of both companies are integrated under the marketing name of &ldquo;Aer Lingus&rdquo; and the annual accounts of the two companies are published in combined form.</P>
    <P>The existing corporate structure of the group, with all its subsidiaries, has developed largely for historical reasons. While it may have been convenient in the past, it is now more of an encumbrance which causes confusion.  There are significant disadvantages in the existing corporate structure.  The audited accounts of the two companies, Aer Lingus plc and Aerlínte Éireann plc, suffer greatly from a lack of transparency.  This causes difficulties for the airline in its dealings with financial institutions.</P>
    <P>In addition, there is no rationale for the present distribution of the various subsidiary companies between Aer Lingus plc and Aerlínte Éireann plc. Ownership of the subsidiaries was largely determined by tax considerations at the time each company was established.  The pattern of ownership of subsidiaries has the effect of adding to the confusion about the group structure.  The need to simplify the structure and to make the relationships between the companies in the group more transparent is all the more urgent now due to the present financial difficulties.  In fact, the <i>Strategy for the Future</i> could not be successfully <Col N="390" /> implemented without a corporate restructuring.</P>
    <P>In recent years, an exhaustive examination has taken place of options which would address the serious shortcomings of the present structure with a view to identifying the most appropriate corporate structure for the group.  <i>The Strategy for the Future</i> proposed significant changes in the group's structure.</P>
    <P>The strategy envisages a reorganisation of the group into four separate companies: Aer Lingus, Aer Lingus-Shannon, Aer Lingus Express; and a holding company for support and subsidiary companies.  Aer Lingus will serve Ireland, the UK and Continental Europe.  Aer Lingus-Shannon, based at Shannon, will provide direct services to the US from Shannon directly and from Shannon through Dublin on current routes.</P>
    <P>In keeping with its strategy of competing in all segments of the market, Aer Lingus intends to develop the concept of a low fare-low cost carrier, separately branded as Aer Lingus Express, to compete mainly in those segments of the UK market which are purely cost driven.  I will refer to this later.</P>
    <P>Subsidiary and support companies within the Aer Lingus Group will become independent profit centres responsible for their own cost structures.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides for the restructuring of the group by the establishment of a new company, Aer Lingus Group plc, as a holding company for the Aer Lingus group of companies.  This holding company will be designated as an air company for the purposes of the Air Companies Acts.  The Minister for Finance will transfer his shares in Aer Lingus plc and Aerlínte Éireann plc to Aer Lingus Group plc in exchange for shares in Aer Lingus Group plc.  Aer Lingus and Aerlínte will then be wholly owned subsidiaries of Aer Lingus Group plc.  Aerlínte will effectively become Aer Lingus-Shannon.</P>
    <P>The restructuring will preserve the essential character of the group, including the primacy of the airline business. According to the Memorandum of Association of the new holding company, <Col N="391" /> Aer Lingus Group plc, the first object of the company will be &ldquo;to carry on and foster the business and pursuit of air transportation in all forms, both within Ireland and internationally&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The matter of Aer Lingus Express has been a source of some comment.  There have been concerns expressed that Aer Lingus might use part of the £175 million to establish Aer Lingus Express.  I want to reiterate what I said in this House during Question Time on Thursday last. It is envisaged in the strategy that Aer Lingus Express will be a stand-alone company operating on a fully commercial basis.  The Government will ensure that the Aer Lingus Express operation will be put in place only when the company can demonstrate in full detail, on both costs and revenues, that such a low cost operation can operate profitably in a competitive market.  Aer Lingus will be required to submit a comprehensive business plan as part of the approval procedure.</P>
    <P>I have consistently made it clear that the Government's proposed investment in Aer Lingus is an essential part of a once-off financial restructuring package designed to restore the airline's commercial viability within a short period. There is no question of the investment of £175 million being used to subsidise lossmaking routes.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the Government's proposed equity investment in Aer Lingus.  The Minister for Finance will be authorised to take up shares to the value of £175 million in Aer Lingus Group plc.  As stated, the capital investment will be made on a staggered basis, with £75 million in 1993, £50 million in 1994 and £50 million in 1995.  Section 2 provides that the share capital of Aer Lingus Group plc shall be such amount as may be determined from time to time by the Minister for Finance after consultation with the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.  Section 3 enables the Minister for Finance to exchange his shares in Aer Lingus plc and Aerlínte Éireann plc for shares in Aer Lingus Group plc. It also provides <Col N="392" /> that Aerlínte Éireann's shares in Aer Lingus plc shall be exchanged for shares in Aer Lingus Group plc.  These shares will then be redeemed by the holding company.  Section 4 enables the Minister for Finance to subscribe for further shares in Aer Lingus Group plc up to £175 million.</P>
    <P>The other main elements of the Bill include section 5 which provides for employee profit sharing schemes. Sections 6 and 7 provide that Aer Lingus Group plc shall be an air company within the meaning of the Air Companies Acts, 1966 and 1976, and that Aer Lingus plc and Aerlínte Éireann plc shall no longer be statutorily designated as air companies. Section 8 provides that the number of directors of Aer Lingus Group plc shall be 12 of whom four shall be worker directors elected under the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Acts.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides that the chairman and directors of Aer Lingus plc and Aerlínte Éireann plc and any other such subsidiaries of Aer Lingus Group plc as the Minister may direct, shall be appointed by the Minister or by the Chairman of Aer Lingus Group plc with the consent of the Minister.  This also applies to Aer Rianta which is the second designated air company.</P>
    <P>Section 13 amends the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Acts, 1977 and 1988, to ensure that the provisions of those Acts apply fully to Aer Lingus Group plc.  Provision is also made to ensure that the parts of the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1988, dealing with worker participation below board level, continue in Aer Lingus plc and Aerlínte Éireann plc.</P>
    <P>Section 14 provides for the extension to air companies and their subsidiaries of control on (1) the establishment or acquisition of subsidiaries; (2) the amount of investment in undertakings other than subsidiaries and (3) borrowing, by specifically extending the control to subsidiaries.</P>
    <P>Finally, section 16 provides that all moneys required by the Minister for Finance to meet sums payable under this Bill <Col N="393" /> shall be paid out of the Central Fund. The Bill provides that the money shall be paid to a special account and issued from that account subject to such terms and conditions as the Minister for Finance may determine.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the Government's decision in the matter, the payment of the second and third tranches will be subject to satisfactory progress being made by Aer Lingus on the implementation of the Strategy for the Future. Some commentators have claimed that the equity investment of £175 million is insufficient to secure the future of the airline.  Such claims are unsubstantiated. The figure of £175 million is based on detailed financial projections and market analysis.  It is an integral part of the Strategy for the Future which has been formulated by the management of Aer Lingus and approved and submitted to me by the board.</P>
    <P>As I stated, following a meeting between the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Aviation Matters and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on 22 June 1993, the Government announced that the question of participation by Aer Lingus employees in the future success of the company should be dealt with as a tangible form of recognition for the additional contribution being asked of the workforce.  The employees of Aer Lingus have contributed greatly in the past to building up the airline.  The Government is aware that a stronger commitment than ever before will be required from all of the staff of Aer Lingus, throughout the organisation.</P>
    <P>On 17 November 1993, agreement was reached between the Government, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and affiliated unions representing employees in Aer Lingus on an imaginative arrangement for participation by employees in the company.  Under this agreement, 10 per cent of the profits before tax will be allocated to the employees so that the employees can receive the equivalent of 10 per cent of the issued share capital of the company, split 50:50 between shares and cash.</P>
    <P>The Government has agreed to issue 5 <Col N="394" /> per cent of the shares of the company in issue to the employees up front, on a partly paid up basis in return for a nominal payment.  The balance of the payment for the shares will be paid out of the annual distribution of profits.  At the discretion of the employees, some or all of the 5 per cent cash payment may be used to accelerate the payment of the balance of the share price.  Distribution will cease when the threshold of 10 per cent of the issued share capital has been reached.  The Bill gives effect to this agreement by providing for employee profit sharing schemes.</P>
    <P>The opportunity is being taken in the Bill to provide for the statutory application to the two air companies, that is, Aer Lingus Group plc and Aer Rianta, of controls which it has become the practice to insert in recent legislation establishing semi-State bodies.  These controls are, for the most part, already being applied to the air companies under the guidelines for semi-State bodies approved by the Government.  These relate to the establishment or acquisition of subsidiaries, the investment in undertakings other than subsidiaries and borrowing by subsidiaries.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware from my period as Minister with responsibility for the Labour portfolio of my full commitment to a partnership approach in the governance of our semi-State bodies.  As I said in my opening comments, I felt a partnership approach was particularly important to address the major challenges facing the airline.  I have never believed that either the Government or the management of the company had a monopoly of wisdom.  I am a firm believer that people at operative level have a vital contribution to make on how the company should, and must, meet the competitive challenges in aviation.  I am, therefore, complying in full with the Worker Participation (State Enterprise) Acts of 1977 to 1991.  Section 8 of this Bill provides that at group board level, where all the strategic policy decisions for the business will be taken, the provisions of Worker Participation Acts will apply.  Not only that, but the section also <Col N="395" /> provides that existing worker directors appointed by virtue of the relevant Acts will be appointed to be directors of the group board for the remainder of their terms.</P>
    <P>At the Deputies are aware, the worker participation legislation extends far beyond representation at board level.  I am equally committed to participation within the company and notably effective participation right down to operative section levels.  In my discussions with employee representatives, under the auspices of ICTU, on participation by staff in the equity of the company I specifically undertook that structures for participation by employees within the company would be strengthened.  The work practice changes and flexibility so essential for the development of the company and keeping it competitive will require increasing input by the company's employees.</P>
    <P>Clearly, there must be substantial overlap between the group board and the composition of the main operating company boards. This is important both for consistency of policy approaches and for the necessary continuity required at present in the company.  Even though it is my intention that this substantial overlap in the composition of the boards of the company will apply, it will also allow me the discretion to appoint other members to the main operating subboards and notably professional representatives of employee interests.  I had always intended that representative employee interests would have a part to play on the boards of the main airline operating subsidiaries.</P>
    <P>I want to turn now to the issue of the Government's aviation policy.  The direction of change in world aviation is irreversibly towards greater liberalisation and free trade.  The rate at which this will be achieved is still uncertain.  The general thrust of the Government's aviation policy has been and will continue to be to seek the maximum possible opportunities for Irish airlines to benefit from this movement towards free trade.</P>
    <P>The Government's objectives for Irish <Col N="396" /> aviation have been and will remain fixed for some time.  However, as already indicated, Government policies for achieving them have been continually adapted to changes in the international aviation market.  Further changes will be necessary but these will be implemented within the current consistent policy framework which should allow Irish operators in the aviation sector to plan ahead with some certainty.</P>
    <P>The Government, in adapting and developing its policy framework, will ensure that it is sufficiently flexible to cater for the continually changing needs of the industry's customers and the range of services provided to meet these needs, and provides opportunities for public and private sector operators to earn an adequate return on capital invested, both as a reward for risk taking and to finance the continuous increments in investment needed to maintain the competitiveness of the industry <i>vis-à-vis</i> our competitors.</P>
    <P>As I have stated in this House before, it is in Ireland's interest to have Aer Lingus as a substantial airline to serve trade, tourism and overall national needs.  An efficient system of access transport is so crucial to the economy that we cannot risk becoming dependent on airlines based abroad for air services linking Ireland with our European partner and the rest of the world.  Airlines which are not based here in Ireland are less likely to be willing to provide the services required with a frequency and convenience which could replace a national carrier.  Furthermore we need a critical mass of aviation based in Ireland if the sector is to achieve its full development potential.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish to say that the board, management and staff of Aer Lingus have demonstrated their commitment to the company and their co-operation in reaching agreement on the implementation of the Strategy for the Future.  With this Bill before the Oireachtas, the Government is implementing its commitment to the process. We stated that, once the necessary decisions were taken by management and the workforce, we would support the <Col N="397" /> company in so far as we could contribute. The sum of £175 million represents a major injection of scarce taxpayers' funds.  The Government is, as shareholder, now making its contribution to returning the airline to profitability and helping to secure its long term future.  In doing so, we will be fulfilling our commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to ensure the commercial future of Aer Lingus as part of overall air transport policy.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I thank the Minister for explaining fully the intent of the Bill, setting it in the context of the Government's aviation policy as he sees it and referring to the history of Aer Lingus.  He has brought a Bill before the House which will allow the Government to invest £175 million by way of equity in the company this year, next year and the year after.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am glad the Minister set the Bill in the wider context of both aviation policy and the history of the disaster which almost occurred in Aer Lingus.  This is really an enabling Bill which has been signalled for a long time.  I am sure Deputies will be pleased to hear that I will not be calling a vote at 10.30 p.m. to oppose the Second Reading of the Bill.  I have no objection to the principle of it.  However, on Committee Stage I will tease out in greater detail the implications of some of the sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfortunate that we have arrived at the point today where the taxpayer is being requested again to dig deep into his or her pocket for £175 million.  The crisis in Aer Lingus has been predictable since at least 1989.  A combination of procrastination by Ministers with responsibility for transport and the management of Aer Lingus has brought about <Col N="398" /> a situation where Aer Lingus, if it was a private company, would be bankrupt.  It had accumulated debts of £540 million and the last posted losses for a full year period were £188 million.  That is catastrophic. The Minister has mentioned other unsustainable aspects of the balance sheet also which are equally catastrophic.</P>
    <P>It is worth saying once more that those responsible were the Minister's immediate predecessors and the management of the day of Aer Lingus.  Neither has been held accountable.  If they are not accountable in any real managerial sense, at least they should be brought to book at the court of public opinion.  It should be said again they did not do their job and the inadequacies were both political and managerial.</P>
    <P>When I left the Labour-Fine Gael Government in 1987, Deputy Jim Mitchell had been Minister for Transport. Measures had been taken to rectify some problems in Aer Lingus.  The company was trading profitably and it was a reasonably sound commercial operation. The tradition of political interference in the company had ceased.  It was given commercial guidelines on which to operate and it was running smoothly.  I realise external circumstances changed and that world aviation changed dramatically but there was no response from the Department of Transport when Deputy Séamus Brennan was Minister.  I blame him substantially for what has occurred.  The Minister's immediate predecessor, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, is less to blame; she was Minister for a very short time.  She did begin to take action but then the election was called.  In terms of criticism I am pointing the finger directly at the Minister of State, Deputy Brennan, because I do not think he did his job.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the then management of Aer Lingus did its job either.  This was a company of which we were all proud, a company whose workers had given great service over the years, a company that was almost synonymous with the national identity.  The shamrock on the tail of the plane was as much a symbol of Irish <Col N="399" /> identity as the national flag or the national anthem.  Yet in a very short period of time that company was brought to a position where if it was not supported by the State, and if it had been a private company, there was no doubt the creditors would have foreclosed and it would have gone under.  That is a disaster.  We do not yet know precisely who is ultimately to blame because there has been a kind of tennis match going on between the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications and the then management of the company, each blaming the other.</P>
    <P>The crunch issue was not the transatlantic service, nor the fact that Aer Lingus was over-manned or its productivity was low.  These, of course, were important issues but the crunch issue was that Aer Lingus decided it would operate a monopoly on the Dublin-London route and that it would wipe out its competitors by below cost selling.  It was going to take British Midland and Ryanair out and it operated a policy which made no commercial sense.  There must be a schedule of fares on any aeroplane that leaves the ground.  The company will make a profit on some of the seats and make losses on others but it is not possible to run a profitable air company if every seat on every plane on the dominant route is being sold at a loss.  That is what took place over a significant period.</P>
    <P>It has never been adjudicated by the Minister or anybody else whether it was the management of Aer Lingus or his Department which caused the problem. The then management of Aer Lingus is openly briefing people in this House that the Department would not allow it raise the fares.  The Department is saying the exact opposite and in reply to a parliamentary question last week the Minister said that Aer Lingus got every fare increase requested since 1991 and that it got the bulk of the fare increases requested between 1989 and 1991.</P>
    <P>This matter needs clarification.  I am not looking for scapegoats but when so much money was lost over such a short period of time, when a national asset such <Col N="400" /> as Aer Lingus was put at risk, when the jobs of so many people were put at risk and when so many people had to take a redundancy package, in terms of accountability &mdash; and ultimately a commercial State company must be accountable to this House in one way or another &mdash; somebody must inform the House why this situation occurred.</P>
    <P>Equally scandalous were the promises made, particularly by the Labour Party in the course of the last election, which was only 12 months ago.  I can remember the television pictures of the Tánaiste in a hangar in Dublin Airport assuring everyone who wanted to listen that unlimited equity was available, that there would be no cost cutting, no need for redundancies and that everything in the garden was rosy.  Unfortunately, the Aer Lingus workers, under the stress of the pressure that was on them at the time, believed the promises.  Of course, the promises were never met.</P>
    <P>I complimented the Minister previously for taking action when he realised the seriousness of the problem.  Unlike his predecessors, he did not procrastinate. He at least addressed the matter and appointed Mr. Cahill.  I do not intend criticising Mr. Cahill, who had a difficult job to do, but I would like to compliment the negotiating teams who operated for such a long time and came forward with a result.  That result is, first, large scale redundancies.  People have lost their jobs.  They got a reasonable package but they have lost their jobs and many of them have a long working life ahead of them.  Their families have all the expenses of ordinary families in this city or in Shannon where redundancies are occurring and they have the mortgages, the school fees and so on to cope with.  That should not be forgotten because when we are looking at balance sheets we very often forget the stress and the human tragedies that are behind them.  A huge number of good jobs will go in Aer Lingus.  They were the jobs of hard working, decent, honest citizens.  It is unfortunate that it came to the point where those jobs had to go.</P>
    <P>There is uncertainty about the future <Col N="401" /> of TEAM Aer Lingus and it is a weakness in the Minister's speech today which I hope he corrects when he concludes the debate tonight.  What is the precise future of TEAM?  Are the jobs safe?  Is there sufficient business in the order books to sustain employment?  What does the future hold?  Will the Minister come back in the spring to explain to us that there are difficulties in TEAM Aer Lingus through lack of work and that further action must be taken?</P>
    <P>One of the major weaknesses in the Minister's contribution today is that he almost ignores the position of the subsidiaries in the company.  I signalled to him last Wednesday that I would be raising this matter today and I would prefer to be given better information.  I am not springing this on the Minister, he got a week's notice of my intention to raise the matter.  He said that the package would consist of £175 million of equity to restructure the balance sheet and the cost cutting arising out of Mr. Cahill's plan but also that the ordered sale of the subsidiaries would be an integral part of the package and that the company would not be financially viable without it.  He has developed that today to say that it will not be a fire sale; if it was, it would be over a long time ago.</P>
    <P>What assurance can the Minister give to the people who are working in SRS in Shannon, for example?  What assurances can he give to the people in Cara?  What assurances can he give to the people in the Copthorne group?  Many of them are based in the United Kingdom but the company has a responsibility towards those employees.  The Minister has responsibility for their future.  If we are to adopt a restrictive attitude, many of them are Irish citizens and they need assurances.  It is not enough to be transparent in terms of what has been negotiated for the transport company.  One must be transparent also in what is the intention in respect of the subsidiaries and of those employed in the subsidiaries. That transparency is not in the restructuring plan nor in the Minister's introductory remarks today.</P>
    <P>So far as I can see the Minister has <Col N="402" /> been totally silent on the ancillary services. What is the position with regard to them, on sales and catering and on baggage handling?  I understand that at the end of the day the one group that voted against the restructuring package were the baggage handlers.  Have they now come on side, what arrangements exist, what guarantees can be given that the ancillary services in their entirety will not be tendered out?  I understood from the original terms of the restructuring package that they would stand alone from an accountancy point of view, that their costs and transactions would have to be transferred in a commercial sense.  If I recall correctly, the Minister's promise extended to three years, but that then there was a suggestion that they would have to compete with other service providers tendering in.  What is the position today?  Where does that stand?  Again the Minister was silent on that.</P>
    <P>The Minister was quite lengthy in his explanation of the changes in the status of Shannon.  I consider that whole business to have been politically inexplicable. We know the pressures that had come on from Dublin, we know of the counter pressures from Shannon.  Nonetheless, it is just 12 months since the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, said that, after an economic audit, it was quite clear that the balance of advantage lay with continuing the Shannon status as it was then.  The present Minister, having appointed Mr. Cahill to be the supremo in Aer Lingus, came into the House for an Adjournment debate one evening in May and indicated that Mr. Cahill was to be allowed the full range of action with one exception &mdash; that he could not examine the status of Shannon.  The two commitments frittered away over the summer.  We were left in the position in which the arrangements for Shannon were changed dramatically.  That was unfortunate.  I do not intend going over that ground again.  It has been said, and there is hardly any need to repeat it &mdash; that the changed status was a serious blow to the region I represent.  But, when the Shannon status became part of the range of Aer Lingus activity that Mr. Cahill <Col N="403" /> could examine, the commitment was that one flight in three would go direct to Dublin but, in the negotiation of the bilateral agreement, it ended up being one flight in two.  Therefore, we have moved from a position in which last November the Minister's predecessor had an economic audit undertaken which indicated that the balance of advantage for the country as a whole was to keep the Shannon status as it was.  When the present Minister appointed Mr. Cahill the balance of advantage was still the <i>status quo.</i> Then, some time during the summer, the balance of advantage was to have one flight in three go into Dublin directly but, by the time the bilateral agreement had been negotiated, it transpired that every second flight could go directly into Dublin.  There does not appear to be much consistency of policy in that particular arrangement.</P>
    <P>I note that the Minister today has given a kind of list of half promises to the people in Shannon because he knows, as well as I do, that Shannon has been relegated to the status of a seasonal airport. We know that, at best, it will be a very busy tourist airport for four months of the year and that, for the remainder of the year, there will be no direct flights to the United States from there.  Of course, Shannon depends on Aer Lingus, it is tied to Aer Lingus like an umbilical cord, it would not survive without Aer Lingus, but the tourist industry in the west of Ireland would not survive without Shannon or without Aer Lingus either. Of course, there is another change afoot: as the Structural Funds are being spent on our roads network nationwide it is becoming quite clear that the catchment area of places like Shannon is becoming ever smaller.</P>
    <P>If the direct flight to the United States is from Dublin people will drive from anywhere between Nenagh and Roscrea in the south and embark on the place at Dublin rather than at Shannon.  I am glad the Minister has addressed that matter again but he has not answered any of my questions. There will be another day to rerun that issue but, as far as I am concerned, <Col N="404" /> the status of Shannon has been relegated to that of a seasonal airport. At least I hope the Minister will give sufficient funds to the Shannon Task Force, who have been extraordinarily silent in recent times, to generate new business through that airport, a task which is very difficult at present.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister set this Bill in the context of what is happening in world aviation.  I am sure he is familiar with an article published in the <i>Financial Times</i> of 8 December 1993, under the caption, &ldquo;Dinosaurs on the runway&rdquo;, and above which appeared the following: &ldquo;Small no-frills airlines are forcing the bigger, lossmaking US carriers to rethink their strategy, writes Richard Tomkins&rdquo;.  The article is quite interesting and I should like to quote briefly from it.</P>
    <P>US airlines carried a record number of passengers last year: they also lost more than $4 billion.  In the past three years, the industry has lost nearly $10 billion &mdash; in nominal terms more than all the profits it has made since the Wright brothers achieved the world's first powered flight in 1903.  Despite windfall gains from a recent fall in jet fuel prices, the industry is heading for more heavy losses this year.</P>
    <P>That demonstrates that the losses in Aer Lingus are not unique, when one sees what is happening in the United States and in Europe.  It is also interesting, from an aviation point of view, that the argument being advanced is that the main reason for the losses now and lack of competitiveness with new, small airlines is that the hub and spoke method of air transport is proving to be highly costly and is no longer able to compete with the small carriers who fly kind of shuttles of high frequency on a particular route.  I consider the Minister would be well advised &mdash; if there is an intention of hubbing Dublin Airport &mdash; to take a look again because the arguments of hubbing which were so fashionable over the past four or five years no longer withstand scrutiny.  In terms of the productivity of airline staff, the fact that flights must arrive so close in time to each other and <Col N="405" /> must depart again in different directions, means that the productivity is non-existent. What is now happening is that companies like the very small ones, such as South West Airlines, which operate south of Texas, are whacking the big companies and showing a profit, on a high frequency shuttle where there is no pre-allocation of seats, no pre-purchase of tickets, nothing except peanuts and a glass of 7Up served on the flight, yet getting people there.  These companies are selling tickets at about a third of what their competitors are charging.  If it is the intention of Aer Lingus Express to do likewise, certainly they will be able to take on the competition but I do not believe the restructuring package gets the company to the point at which they can do that in terms of the very few people who would be employed in such an operation.</P>
    <P>It might also console the Minister &mdash; who had a very hard negotiating position in terms of profit-sharing in the company and has capped it at 5 per cent &mdash; to know that the business is in such a bad way in the United States that private air companies have entered into negotiations as well.  Again, I should like to quote from the <i>Financial Times</i> article:</P>
    <P>One strand of the reappraisal common to all carriers is their desperate need to cut costs &mdash; particularly labour costs, which typically account for at least 35 per cent of the total. Some airlines have shown themselves willing to trade massive equity stakes in return for concessions from their employees, as a result of which the labour unions now own 37.5 per cent of Northwest Airlines, 45 per cent of Trans World Airlines, and are negotiating for 60 per cent of United Airlines.</P>
    <P>The Aer Lingus unions are absolute pussycats to settle for 5 per cent against that background.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Of course there was not a State equity injection because they are private companies.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer the Minister to another article that appeared in the <i>Financial Times</i> of Thursday, 2 December 1993 referring to the wise men requested to examine the European air industry and which looks at their report.  As the Minister did in his introductory remarks, the wise men looking at the European airline industry have come out in favour of an open skies policy, irreversibly towards free skies and a free market position. We have witnessed the trouble Air France got itself into.  Anybody casually watching television will have seen the riots on the runway by the workers in Air France, noting that those who favoured liberalisation, centred mostly around British Airways and their allies, seemed to be winning the case with the wise men. Their comments are interesting:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The European airline industry can no longer afford selling a product, produced at European cost levels, at world market prices&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>When summing up, the former Belgian transport minister, Mr. De Croo, said the options are major cost-cutting on all fronts or declare bankruptcy, or to let the taxpayer pick up the bill through state aids.</P>
      <P>The Minister has the major cost-cutting exercise in place and I hope it is sufficient to guarantee the future of the company.  He is also putting a charge on the taxpayer as the £175 million will ultimately have to be picked up by the taxpayer.  I hope he can avoid the bankruptcy of the company.  He may have to go further and get into strategic alliances as other European airlines are doing if he is to secure the future of Aer Lingus as a national carrier in the medium and long term.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Noonan, for sharing his time with <Col N="407" /> me.  He has dealt with a number of points which are essential in this debate.  I want to start my contribution by paying tribute to the staff members of Aer Lingus, Mr. Paul O'Sullivan and the many other trade union personnel who were involved in the negotiations and all the staff.  You would have to be living in the constituency of Dublin North &mdash; the heartland of the employees of Aer Lingus &mdash; to understand the damage the uncertainty about the future of Aer Lingus had done to many lives in my constituency, not only to those working in Aer Lingus but in the many other businesses and services affected in north Dublin.  The area north of the Liffey is one of the areas of high unemployment.  Aer Lingus was an enormously important employer in my constituency and in other north Dublin constituencies.  The pain and suffering endured by the staff will never be understood by people living outside the constituency.</P>
      <P>I am glad an agreement has been reached with the staff and I welcome the fact that a system has been worked out. As Mr. Paul O'Sullivan recently said, they want to share the gain as well as the pain.  I hope that element of the agreement will work for the staff.  There is no point in having a 5 per cent share in nought; a 5 per cent share in nothing is nothing.  It is in everybody's interest that the company becomes viable and remains viable into the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed in the Minister's speech in that he has left many areas still uncertain.  I do not know the answers to the questions that some of the staff of Aer Lingus are asking me as an Opposition Deputy.  The same staff members are afraid or are unwilling to go to members of the Government parties, particularly Labour members, to find the answers, because they know the answers they got prior to the last election.  Without the kind of case made by the Labour Party and by the Minister's party in an attempt to gain votes at the last election the pain would not be as bad.  So many promises were made prior to the election that the staff took them on board.  All that had to <Col N="408" /> be undone.  They had to recognise that they had to sit down with management and work out a strategy for the future of Aer Lingus.  Those staff are coming to me seeking answers.  I do not know the answers.  For example, I do not know what conditions will be attached to the £175 million.  I note from a line in the Minister's speech that the second tranche of subsidy will not be paid unless the Minister is satisfied that the strategy and the plan is working.  That is a slight worry for the staff.</P>
    <P>I do not see any mention in the Minister's speech of his new word, &ldquo;outsourcing&rdquo;. There is nothing in his speech that tells me how to answer the questions of my constituents who are working in baggage handling and catering.  What will happen to their jobs?  Is the Minister saving that for down the road when more equity is needed and the Government will be unwilling to provide it?  Is that &ldquo;outsourcing&rdquo; to be done then so that some money can be saved for the company? I do not know the answers to these questions and the Minister has not given them.  Deputy Noonan is also uncertain about the answers to those questions.</P>
    <P>What about the non-core assets?  The Minister said that those will probably be considered for sale.  People working in companies like Cara also live in north Dublin and do not know what will happen to their jobs if that company is sold off. Will the new buyers be prepared to retain the staff or will they cut down on staff? Despite the fact that agreement has been reached, there are still many unanswered questions.  When the Minister obtains the information from the Commission I hope the conditions, if any, on the giving out of that equity will be such as to allow Aer Lingus to operate competitively and viably in the marketplace.  I hope that the Minister's assurances today about Aer Lingus Express will allay the concerns expressed to me by another group of airline workers in Ryanair and that we will not see the demise of the 500 jobs in that company.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not referred to the Government's policy in regard to having two Irish airlines.  We need to know that <Col N="409" /> the Minister will not do what the former Minister, Deputy Seamus Brennan, did in giving to another company routes Aer Lingus had developed.  Ryanair wants to be sure that business they have built up will not be undermined by this equity payment.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister tell the House how the Government proposes to continue having the two Irish airlines in operation? Do they propose to continue to dictate exactly what airports and which routes those airlines will be allowed to use or will they allow commercial decisions to be made by both those airlines?  I hope the answer is that he will allow them to be commercial, that there will not be undercutting on either side and that the jobs in each of these companies will survive.</P>
    <P>I commend the work put into these negotiations by members of the Minister's staff and by the staff of Aer Lingus.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is crucial that this Bill should mark a new beginning in Irish aviation.  If we cannot introduce an entirely new corporate spirit into Aer Lingus the £175 million proposed in this Bill will be a waste of money.  Aer Lingus will fail without a new corporate culture. There must be great fears that without radical change in Aer Lingus the main impact of this Bill will be to destroy Ryanair and to end the one set of reasonable air fares we now enjoy, those to most parts of Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senior Aer Lingus management were no strangers to this House from 1984 to 1986 when they lobbied for the infamous Air Transport Bill, 1984, which proposed prison sentences and huge fines for those selling airine tickets at prices below those decided by the IATA cartel.  I was happy to lead the Opposition to such policies in this House and I welcomed the major change of heart when the then Minister, Deputy Jim Mitchell, licensed Ryanair to begin operations in May 1986.  Thus a legal measure intended to criminalise and eliminate low cost airline tickets was turned by public opinion and opinion in this House into a measure which has been <Col N="410" /> one of the most successful deregulations in the world.</P>
    <P>From stagnation between 1979 and 1985 when air travel between Ireland and Britain fell by 171,000, we saw it double between 1986 and 1990 to 4.2 million from 2.1 million.  Real air fares between Ireland and Britain fell by an average of over a third.  The rightly criticised then standard £208 fare to London from Dublin can now be obtained for as low as £59.</P>
    <P>Let us remember that a 28 day apex fare before May 1986 cost £95 and the infamous Saturday night fare, of which we heard so much at that time, was £159. Comparing 1985, the last full year before deregulation and 1987, the first full year under the new policy, we see that the increase in traffic on the Dublin-London route was 65 per cent.  The highest increase was in August when 91.7 per cent more people travelled on the route under deregulation in 1987 than under the cartel in 1985.</P>
    <P>The airline cartels were the greatest Government backed threat to the development of Irish tourism.  The great revival of tourism since 1986, including the addition of 31,000 extra jobs, according to the Tansey-Webster report is down to the success of public and parliamentary opinion in changing the 1984 Air Transport Bill.  The Central Statistics Office series on tourism and travel shows that in 1992 we had 1,561,000 overseas visitors to Ireland compared with only 641,000 in 1986.  I question the basis on which some of these figures are calculated but at least I am quoting the same source in both instances so that if they are wrong, they are equally wrong on both occasions.  What is important is not the overall number but the proportion which shows a two and a half fold increase in six years.</P>
    <P>The recent NESC report on a strategy for competitiveness in employment found that Irish tourism receipts in real terms in 1991 were 56.3 per cent higher than in 1986.  The European average was 16.7 per cent and the OECD average was 33.6 per cent, only North America and <Col N="411" /> Australasia-Japan had a higher growth rate than Ireland.</P>
    <P>The reaction of sea carriers to the new airline competitors was most encourging. Stena Sealink introduced new ships and the Sea Cat.  The B &amp; I Line was privatised and became a highly recommended share on the Stock Exchange.  It also introduced new ships.  The entire access transport sector has been revitalised by airline deregulation and the economy has gained hugely.</P>
    <P>In the traditional airline thinking, &ldquo;business class&rdquo; was treated as &ldquo;mug class&rdquo;.  The business passenger paid by far the highest fares.  This obviously suited the mentality of the cartel airlines but was economic nonsense.</P>
    <P>In a small open economy like Ireland business means competitiveness, not running large expense accounts.  Central Statistics Office data indicates that Irish residents made 220,000 outward business trips in 1985.  Under deregulation this increased to 352,000, an increase of 60 per cent.  We do not have any easy formula for converting these extra business trips into jobs but the impact must be significant.  The firms which were blocked out of business journeys abroad would have been the small enteprises.  These are the firms which have the highest rate of job increase.</P>
    <P>We have had a new aviation policy from 1986 onwards and we should now ask how Aer Lingus has responded to it. In view of the huge gains to the Irish economy from competitive aviation, it must be a matter of regret that this Bill is required at all.  We now know that Aer Lingus cut its fares to meet competition but failed to cut its costs in line.  It has run up over £550 million in debts.  Much of the money was frittered away in mindless targeting of Ryanair.  Some £17.5 million of public money seems to have disappeared out of Aer Lingus Holidays Limited without any criminal charges or other sanctions.  Aer Lingus was heavily fined by the EC Commission for its treatment of British Midland.  Recent surveys have shown that the company's productivity is among the lowest in Europe.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="412" /> Aer Lingus' fares on the North Atlantic are frequently as much as $400 dearer than fares via London.  More than half the North Americans visiting Ireland now come via Britain for that reason and not for anything to do with Shannon. The airline made no attempt to revive its Chicago or Montreal routes.  When the Department of Transport negotiated a licence to fly to and from Los Angeles, Aer Lingus delayed so long that it deliberately lost the licence, which was eventually taken up by a small Irish company.</P>
    <P>The Aer Lingus fares to the mainland of Europe are as high as £500 to £600 return for journeys of as little as 90 to 100 minutes.  Where Aer Lingus drove out its competitors from UK provincial routes they usually then contracted the routes by using computer yield programmes and smaller aircraft to reduce the numbers of low fares available.</P>
    <P>Most bizarre of all was the decision to buy the latest aircraft for the London route but to price the seats closer to Ryanair fares on older planes.  This was coupled with the decision to serve food to all passengers because British Midland made service a selling point although the journey was not much more than 50 minutes.  British Midland had a far lower labour cost base than Aer Lingus and the latter should never have tried to match British Midland service and Ryanair fares from a cost base which was too high.  Its losses on the Dublin to London route are estimated at as much as £20 per passenger per flight.</P>
    <P>Last year, the then Minister for Transport. Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, told this House that she had advised the airline not to go ahead with a large aircraft purchasing programme in the expectation of any Government equity.  They foolishly spent over £399 million on the new aircraft between 1990-92.  Why should anyone invest public money in a company with such a track record of ignoring what the sole shareholder, the Government, told it in regard to new aircraft purchases?</P>
    <P>Why is the Cahill-Owen plan for the airline still not published?  The Irish taxpayer <Col N="413" /> is forced to stump up £175 million in a so-called equity injection and the same taxpayer is not even to be shown the prospectus?  Why can we not be told that the money under this Bill is to be used to cut the fare differential between North America and Ireland compared with the better value available in Britain? Why can we not be told that the aid in the Bill will be used to cut the very high fares charged on the routes to mainland Europe?  I would hope that the European Union, the Commission of which has to back this measure if it is to become effective law, is aware that it can be up to ten times the fare per mile to the European mainland as it is to London.  We have no competition to the mainland of Europe and full competition to London.  Why can the aid in this Bill not be tied to reviving traffic on UK provincial routes? Such routes contract and fares rocket upwards when Aer Lingus drives off its competitors.  If the money in this Bill is to be used to fund Aer Lingus Express, then both Ryanair and British Midland will be the targets with the same results as we had before.</P>
    <P>If Aer Lingus succeeds in the Aer Lingus Express proposal we will lose competition to London and fares will rise.  We will still have an excess fares differential on the North Atlantic compared to Britain and our fares to the mainland of Europe will continue to be among the highest in the world.</P>
    <P>By last autumn its management and board had driven Aer Lingus into bankruptcy. Airlines such as Singapore Airlines, serving as small a home base as Aer Lingus, became profitable enterprises. British Airways, widely decried by economists in the late seventies and early eighties, transformed itself to become one of the most profitable airlines in the world.  Other airlines formed global and regional alliances.  Sadly Aer Lingus failed.</P>
    <P>The Aer Lingus response to any crisis was always to lobby politicians.  The equity in the Bill today bought the Labour Party six seats in north Dublin at the last election &mdash; the so called &ldquo;Santry <Col N="414" /> six&rdquo;, the group of north Dublin TDs who promised public money to the airline in return for votes.  The Tánaiste did likewise in the famous &ldquo;sermon on the ramp&rdquo;&mdash; the words of my colleague.  Deputy Ray Burke.  The Tánaiste's famous antiprivatisation speech in Cork made this Bill inevitable.  Private sector finance could have transformed Aer Lingus as it did British Airways, but that option apparently is open neither to Aer Lingus nor the Government now because of the Tánaiste's ideological preferences.</P>
    <P>I note that the EU Commission must agree to this Bill and must hope that the funds it provides will not be used to eliminate competition.  This kind of Bill in Ireland, France, Spain and in other countries can bring little satisfaction to Europeans.  If Europe's state airlines continue their present high cost, high fare operations, no amount of &ldquo;Fortress Europe&rdquo; policies will save Europe's scheduled airlines from an ever falling share of world aviation and loss of market share to North American and Asian-Pacific airlines.</P>
    <P>I mentioned at the outset that what was vital to save Aer Lingus was a change in its corporate culture not just an injection of money and an acceptance of the realities of the commercial world in which we live.  The need for this outlook is recognised in other airlines.  Perhaps the outstanding airline person in Europe today is Jan Carlzon, who recently retired as President and chief executive officer of SAS because that airline's merger plans with other European airlines were thwarted. Writing in the SAS newspaper, called <i>Scanorama</i>, for October 1993, Mr. Carlzon said:</P>
    <P>Those in the airline business who persist in harbouring protectionist leanings will clearly expire and possibly take other potentially competitive airlines with them.  It's only a question of time.</P>
    <P>That quotation admirably sums up the position in Ireland today and the position that exists under this Bill.</P>
    <P>He went on in the same article to say:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="415" /> We need a level competitive playing-field; unsubsidised carriers like SAS cannot compete with European airlines that can still lean heavily on taxpayers' support.</P>
    <P>The European carriers need incentives to re-structure and to cut costs. Continued public funding robs them of this incentive.  We even have to allow bankruptcies in European aviation. There can be no salvation for those who cannot compete, no matter whose flag they carry.</P>
    <P>These views of Mr. Carlzon sum up the current dilemma of many European countries, not least Ireland, where aviation is concerned.  The truth is that the man is absolutely right and if the Government, this House or the European Commission fly in the face of that truth by allowing all kinds of surreptitious crosssubsidies from this taxpayer investment, then we are undoubtedly headed for disaster, both in Aer Lingus and in its competitors. In particular, we cannot have a continuation of the policy pursued since 1986 by Aer Lingus, of a paranoid pursuit of Ryanair regardless of the cost to the Irish taxpayer.  It is in this Bill that the Irish taxpayer is picking up the tab for the lunatic policies followed by the board and senior management of Aer Lingus since 1986 in particular.  Today's Bill is the price which the Irish taxpayer has to pay for that collective foolishness with which Aer Lingus was run.</P>
    <P>Lest the House think that it was only in relation to Ryanair that Aer Lingus sought to maintain its monopolistic outlook and its paranoia towards all competition, it is worth recalling what happened in respect of the award of the sea-air rescue helicopter contract in 1990-91 to operate out of Shannon airport This contract was awarded by the Minister for the Marine to Irish Helicopters' Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Aer Lingus even though a private Irish competitor had, according to the report on the 1992 Appropriations Accounts by the Comptroller and Auditor General, tendered a figure which was £4.7 million <Col N="416" /> lower than Irish Helicopters.  The Irish competitor would have been satisfied with the significant profit which its tender would have given it.  The figure eventually settled with Irish Helicopters before the contract was signed was higher than its original figure by a substantial amount.  The House can well imagine therefore, the magnitude of the profit made by Aer Lingus on this arrangement, which was so cosily come to.</P>
    <P>The result of that huge profit is that, since the award of that contract, no other helicopter company, Irish or foreign, has been able to get any contract in Ireland for helicopter work other than short term <i>ad hoc</i> jobs, because the cross-subsidisation operated by Aer Lingus through Irish Helicopters enables it to quote at or below cost for every contract that comes up, in the hope that all competitors, or potential competitors, will disappear.  The Irish and European taxpayers are paying for this excess profit and this cross-subsidisation just as the Irish taxpayer is paying for the efforts, over many years, to put Ryanair out of business.</P>
    <P>Happily DG VII of the Commission, which is the Directorate-General for Transport, is looking into the matter and in a letter written late in October, it said:</P>
    <P>Following our preliminary examination of this case, it appears that these circumstances could well involve State aid under Article 92 of the Treaty.</P>
    <P>It went on to state that it has begun a thorough examination of the case.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, totally unsatisfactory that up to the beginning of this debate, at least, today, the House has not been informed of the Commission's view on the legitimacy, or otherwise, of the Cahill plan for the restructuring of Aer Lingus. The Minister, in his speech, did not inform us either of the Commission's view, although we learn that the Commission has had this proposal before it for almost six months and has not yet made a decision.  According to the Minister, it is under constant pressure from the Government, both at political and <Col N="417" /> official level, to make that decision.  It seems an extraordinarily long time and it implies that the Commission is having great difficulties with the matter.</P>
    <P>It seems inappropriate to bring in this Bill, that is completely dependent on the agreement of the Commission, if that agreement has not been forthcoming or if it is only forthcoming subject to conditions of which we are not yet aware.</P>
    <P>This Bill makes no reference to the four separate businesses into which it is intended to divide Aer Lingus.  Why is this so?  Why are these four divisions not formed as subsidiaries?  How can they trade and act transparently, without any danger of cross-subsidisation, if they are all lumped together under the heading of Aer Lingus Group plc?  Is there not a virtual certainty of cross-subsidisation, given the record of this in the past, particularly with regard to Aer Lingus Commuter, who never kept proper separate accounts and who flagrantly used the main airline to subsidise its operation, put its competitors off domestic provincial routes in Ireland and off routes from provincial Irish airports to Britain?</P>
    <P>Why is Aer Rianta included in this Bill?  It is an airport company, not an air company.  It is generally accepted as being commercially successful and both the Exchequer and the company would benefit from Aer Rianta being sold off in part or in whole.  Is its inclusion in this Bill an effort to thwart that possibility?</P>
    <P>I find section 5 confusing.  We were told some weeks ago that negotiations between the unions and Aer Lingus and the Government had resulted in an agreement to increase the employee shareholding from 5 per cent to 10 per cent. Section 5 states that the employee shareholding shall not exceed 5 per cent.  On what basis will the shares in Aer Lingus PLC and Aerlinte PLC be exchanged for shares in the holding company?  The existing shares are valueless because the airline owes £550 million.  Will the shares held under section 5 be held on the normal basis of shareholdings or will special privileges be given which will effectively have the result of preventing any other investors coming into the airline? <Col N="418" /> Is that the real purpose of the section?  I have no objection to employee shareholdings.  They are successful in many companies, both for the employees and the companies concerned.  Is that the intention of this section or has it some other purpose?</P>
    <P>Why are the moneys payable under section 4 to be paid out of the Central Fund under section 16 and why are they to be paid into a special account with the Paymaster General?  Why are the general provisions in section 16 necessary?  They do not appear to have been used in respect of other equity investments by the State.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 14 which, strictly speaking, should not be necessary but obviously is, given the history of Aer Lingus and certain other State companies. Equally, I welcome section 11 which enables the Minister to get accounts of subsidiaries.  One is entitled to ask why these were not available before.  I believe the truthful answer is that it was through the use of subsidiaries that various things were hidden within the Aer Lingus Group up to now.  The non-publication of subsidiary accounts made it all the easier for the company as a whole to engage in cross-subsidisation to the detriment of its competitors and the ultimate detriment of the consumer. It made it easier to conceal its real activities and resulted in the company producing for years accounts that were largely meaningless.</P>
    <P>If, under the section 11, the subsidiary of an air company has to produce accounts to the Minister, why has the division of an air company not to do the same if, as we are told in the Cahill Plan, they will all be run independently?  As I have asked before, why are these divisions not formed as subsidiary companies? Is it to allow further concealment?</P>
    <P>When this Bill is passed by the House, the Minister will be given <i>carte blanche</i> to invest £175 million of taxpayers money in Aer Lingus at any time and subject to any conditions he likes, irrespective of how abundantly foolish it might become <Col N="419" /> in six months or a year's time.  The Bill is inadequate for that reason.</P>
    <P>There are those who would suggest that there is a major difference between ordinary Government spending and the voting of this £175 million which we are told is in a different category as it is equity or capital investment.  The reality is otherwise.  Borrowing this money to fund the accumulated losses of Aer Lingus &mdash; because that is all it is, in spite of all the rhetoric &mdash; will, at an average interest rate of 10 per cent, cost the taxpayer £17.5 million a year in perpetuity.  Trade union or other rhetoric does not change that reality.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note the extraordinary concern of the unions and Congress for jobs in Aer Lingus.  They appear to have no concern for jobs in any competitor.</P>

      <P>As the trade union movement gradually contracts into a group of unions that predominantly represent public sector workers, it is easy to understand why it should become so obsessed with what it perceives as the paramount need to retain as many undertakings as possible in public ownership. This may be in the interests of trade unions and their officials, but there is no indication that it is in the interests of the economy or of workers.  Nonetheless, for too long they have been allowed to set the parameters of the debate.  Anyone who disagrees with them is portrayed as being somehow nationally disloyal or at times almost traitorous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nowdays every country in the world is seeking to unload what it does not need to own.  For Ireland once again to bury its head in the sand and to pretend that we are somehow ring-fenced from the realities of the world around us is plainly stupid.  The board and senior management of Aer Lingus did a huge disservice to the company and to its thousands of employees by trying to pretend for years that they could live in the old world of cartels and no competition. <Col N="420" /> They brought the company to its knees and bankrupted it by doing so.  They caused huge concern for their employees unnecessarily and caused 1,000 or more of them to lose their jobs.  They are continuing their disservice to their own employees if they think that a prolongation of that policy will be of any help to them.  Using the taxpayer to put your competitors out of business is not just foolish.  It is also illegal and a corporate culture founded on that misconception of commerce will not succeed.</P>
    <P>As I said in 1984-85, Aer Lingus does not need to have a permanent self imposed inferiority complex.  If it were run properly, and had been run properly in recent years, it could face the world with its head high.  Many of its employees know that well and that is why they are so frustrated by what has been happening. The disaster is not its fault.  Nor is it the fault of the handful of us who told their bosses they were wrong.</P>
    <P>I had hoped this Bill would be a turning point in Aer Lingus's affairs and in its outlook.  Sadly, I am not convinced that will be so.  This House is being asked to put £175 million of taxpayers money into an investment, in respect of which the prospectus has never been published. Most investors would laugh out of court a company, a Minister or a Government who tried to do that.  Sadly for Ireland, that does not appear to be the case here. The unspoken, underlying feeling which we are suppposed to share is that this is not real money; it is only taxpayers' money and therefore it does not matter. What is more, it is only compliant taxpayers' money and does not this Government know well that compliant taxpayers are only fools and that &ldquo;the lads&rdquo; who do not pay up will be looked after by &ldquo;Mighty Mouse&rdquo; Kemmy, Fianna Fáil and the Santry Six&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>It is just over six months since the general terms of the so-called Cahill rescue plan for Aer Lingus were outlined to us.  That included State investment of £175 million, less than half the £400 million the chairman, Bernie Cahill, requested only four months previously. The company was to be restructured, established in the form of four divisions. The Shannon stopover was to cease although that was never stated; it was to be done by the inventive device of putting a Shannon-Dublin leg on what would be, in effect, direct Dublin-US flights.  A total of £50 million was to be saved by cost cuts, 80 per cent of which was to come from the workforce in the company mainly in the form of redundancies; a figure of 1,500 was mentioned at that time.  There was no doubt it was the staff of Aer Lingus who were to bear the burden of the entire package since the bulk of the cost cuts were to come in the staff area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government whose policies, or the lack of them, caused the problem in the first place washed its hands, stood back, and told Aer Lingus unions and management to take the centre of the ring in what many believed would be an impossible and possibly self-destructive industrial relations battle.  Never in the history of the State had any group of employees been asked to take such severe cost cuts or negotiators for employees been asked to negotiate job losses of such a magnitude.  It is to the credit of all those involved in the negotiations that an agreement was concluded. In particular, it is to the credit of the outstanding leadership of the trade union officials who represented the staff in Aer Lingus, the SIPTU branch secretary, Paul O'Sullivan, and the CRC secretary, Joan Carmichael, and their teams of negotiators that they succeeded in negotiating a shareholding in the company for their members for the first time in the history of a State company.  They succeeded in reducing the number of job losses by 500 and gave the company massive cost cuts, in the order of 20 per cent, without any disruption of service or industrial action.  This is in contrast with <Col N="422" /> the position in Air France to which Deputy Noonan referred where a cut of 6 per cent in costs was sought but which according to a report in today's <i>Financial Times</i>, has now been abandoned.</P>
    <P>This Bill is being presented as the final chapter in the Aer Lingus crisis.  The Minister sees it as an opportunity to clap himself on the back while the Labour Party heaves a collective sigh of relief that so far there have been no compulsory redundancies.  However, the Aer Lingus crisis is far from over.</P>
    <P>The only people to emerge with credit from the sorry story of Aer Lingus are the diligent staff and their outstanding trade union representatives.  While the Aer Lingus unions led by SIPTU's Paul O'Sullivan can take credit for having saved 500 of their members' jobs, for having agreed to massive cost cuts and having secured the first ever shareholding for workers in a State company, the Government must hang its head in shame for failing to honour its part of the bargain.</P>
    <P>In his contribution to this debate the Minister told us that this Bill and package is subjected to approval by the EU Commission. It is a remarkable commentary on what is supposed to be a sovereign Parliament that this legislation is subject to approval not just by the other House and signature by the President but also to approval by the EU Commission.  As we discuss this Bill the trade union representatives of the staff in Aer Lingus are in Brussels to petition the EU Commission to lift the restriction that it intends to impose on this package; in effect they are doing the job that the Minister should have done during the past six months.</P>
    <P>The Government is allowing the EU Commission to impose conditions on the Aer Lingus package in such a way as to seriously undermine the agreement negotiated with the unions and open up a new phase of crisis for the airline company. In this Bill the Government is effectively reneging on its understanding with the Aer Lingus staff and unions.</P>
    <P>The EU Commission intends to impose severe conditions on the Aer Lingus <Col N="423" /> package.  These conditions were reported in the EU Official Journal on 28 October last.  As I understand it, the Commission is due to make a final decision on these conditions on Thursday next, by which time the Government will have whisked this Bill through the Dáil.  The debate on all Stages is to be guillotined with the final guillotine at 10.30 p.m. on Wednesday night.  It is the Government's plan to have this Bill through the Dáil before the bad news comes from Brussels that the EU Commission intends to impose seven restrictions, seven severe conditions, on the package before us.  This is remarkable in what is supposed to be a sovereign Parliament.  The best the Minister can do today is to make a Francis Urquhart comment that he may well think it but he cannot comment on what the EU Commision may do.</P>
    <P>The conditions are unprecedented. The £175 million is taxpayers' money. not EU funds.  The EU has never before required a national Government to provide such servile assurances regarding investment of its own money in one of its own companies.  The EU imposed no such conditions on the Governments of Belgium, France or Portugal when these countries injected large sums of money into their national airlines &mdash; Sabena which received £1.1 billion, Air France and TAP.  The Government has failed to protect public investment in its own company, Aer Lingus, from excessive interference by the EU Commission. Indeed, it appears that the EU Commission is trying to impose on the Aer Lingus package its own precedent in relation to liberalisation.  For example. conditions are being imposed in relation to ground handling at a time when a directive on ground handling is under consideration.  What is the reason this condition is being imposed when they could have awaited the emergence of the directive?</P>
    <P>The conditions being imposed put in serious doubt the investment of the second and third tranches of the £175 million equity, set aside the Government's position on Shannon, could effectively <Col N="424" /> prevent the establishment of Aer Lingus Express and undermine the excellent agreement made between the unions and management regarding ground handling.</P>
    <P>The unions in Aer Lingus concluded their agreement with management on the understanding that the Government would deliver on its part of the bargain. The conditions being imposed by the EU Commission mean that the Government is either unwilling or prevented from honouring its side of the deal.  A broken agreement is the cue for a serious industrial relations disaster.</P>
    <P>In relation to the first condition, the achievement of £50 million in cuts, the Commission needs further assurance that the cost reduction will be realised as envisaged.  In relation to the injection of £175 million the Commission would like to see the payment of the second and third tranches subject to the company achieving well specified and quantified targets.  It insists that this should be the last investment in Aer Lingus and questions the policy on the Shannon stop-over. The fifth condition effectively torpedoes the idea of establishing Aer Lingus Express, while the sixth condition refers to ground handling and the seventh to stamp duty and capital duty.</P>
    <P>Some of the conditions, especially condition No. 5, bear a remarkable similarity to the case being made by both Ryanair and British Midland, Aer Lingus's main rivals on the UK route both of whom have been lobbying the EU Commission since the recovery plan was announced last June.  Both British Midland and the Ray MacSharry-led Ryanair have been camped in Brussels since last June pushing for restrictions on Aer Lingus.  It appears that they have won the day.</P>
    <P>Instead of matching the British Midland and the Ryanair lobby Aer Lingus was grounded, apparently instructed by the Government not to engage in direct lobbying of the Commission.  Amazingly, it was not until mid-October that Aer Lingus executives went to Brussels, one week after their own unions had embarrassed them into it having beaten the company to the door of Commissioner <Col N="425" /> Matutes.  Did the Minister instruct Aer Lingus management not to lobby Brussels directly but to leave it to him?  If not, can he explain the reason Aer Lingus gave its rivals a four month head start with the Commission?  If he did instruct Aer Lingus to stay away from Brussels, can he explain the reason Ryanair, apparently assisted by a confidential Government memorandum, was able to have its wishes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Bill itself is remarkable for the restructuring it proposes.  An Aer Lingus holding company has been established and Aer Lingus, the trading company, the company operating the core business activities of the company, is being established as a subsidiary.  The first effect of that &mdash; and a whole page of the Minister's speech was devoted to trying to talk his way out of this &mdash; is to shift the worker-directors of the company.  It puts them on the board of the new holding company&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the subsidiaries of which have the real power but no worker-directors. The subsidiaries of the companies, Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta, the subsidiaries dealing with Copthorne Group and the other various activities of Aer Lingus, will not have worker-directors on their boards under this Bill and they are the bodies that will be making decisions on disposal of assets and so on.  That is a remarkable change from, for example, the legislation in relation to CIE, which guaranteed to worker-directors a position in the subsidiary companies.  The <Col N="427" /> chairman of the holding company, presumably Mr. Bernie Cahill, or the Minister will have the right to appoint the chairman and board members of all the subsidiary companies, including the airline company itself, which under this Bill will be relegated from parent company to subsidiary.  This is concentrating excessive power in the hands of the Minister and the chairman of the holding company. It is a recipe for croneyism, it is a recipe for political appointments.  This Bill, in effect, is doing for Bernie Cahill what the new Russian constitution is doing for Boris Yelstin.  It is remarkable that this Bill not only covers Aer Lingus but also Aer Rianta and the same position will apply in Aer Rianta in relation to subsidiary companies.</P>
      <P>The 5 per cent shareholding for Aer Lingus employees was certainly a welcome achievement by the Aer Lingus unions but it is only a miserable concession by a Government which includes the Labour Party.</P>

The 5 per cent staff share in Aer Lingus contrasts unfavourably with the arrangements which were made in similar circumstances in a number of United States airlines.  For example, United Airlines got 60 per cent staff shareholding; TWA got 45 per cent; North West Airlines got 37.5 per cent; but the best the Labour Party could do for the staff of Aer Lingus is a miserable 5 per cent.  I congratulate the union which managed to secure a breakthrough on employee shareholders generally but I say shame on the Labour Party for being able to deliver so little to the staff of Aer Lingus.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>We must all realise that it is necessary that this survival package should work.  This is a question not just for Dublin North but for the whole of Ireland and it must be seen in that light. My interest in this question is both local and national.  I know many of the Aer Lingus workers, and the pain they are experiencing must be witnessed to be believed.  I have never been called on so late at home as I have been by Aer Lingus workers, particularly those in TEAM Aer Lingus, expressing concern about measures being taken without their knowledge which will end their careers. This awakens particular emotions in many Deputies in Dublin North.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that the rescue must be sustainable, as must life itself, but I must question the Minister's judgment in this regard and ask if this is a sutainable package. Many references have been made to the meagre nature of the subvention, although it is enough money to keep anybody happy for a long time if they were left to spend it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To put the company on a commercial basis there is a need for State support. This is not just a company but a public transport system and that has not been brought home to the public.  One aspect <Col N="429" /> of commercial viability is the removal of political interference, which has been a feature of the airline's sorry history.  I thought the Minister was fully in agreement with this when I met him with other representatives in Dublin North.  The cabin crews suspected that politics may have had a part to play in the negotiations to relocate them to Shannon in spite of commercial aspects they were able to identify which indicated that their relocation was not a very good idea.  The Minister was adamant that it was not a question of politics.  However, reading the Bill, it seems that politics plays a very big part in the workings of the company.</P>
    <P>The Minister is a shareholder of the company.  He takes power to appoint directors to the board and all the subsidiary companies.  I would have thought that the boards of subsidiary companies ought to be answerable to the parent board, but the Minister has retained powers in this area.  The Minister has many other powers, including the right to approve salaries of chief officers.  No company is free to acquire a subsidiary without his approval and, ironically, borrowings must be subject to his consent. However, the history of political involvement in Aer Lingus would indicate that in the past the borrowings were created by political factors, to replace fleets or take money out of the company when it was profitable.</P>
    <P>I welcome the move towards more worker involvement, which is a positive move.  Too often the workers have had to carry the can and they continue to carry the main burden.  They have also the biggest interest because their whole livelihood is at stake.  I sympathise with the workers when I hear about some of the acts that have been perpetrated on the company.  The wild geese come to mind because the search for viability in the past has seemed like a wild goose chase.</P>
    <P>It is important to look at how decisions taken without reference to the needs of a company like Aer Lingus have impacted on the company.  When people were circulated with one-sided information, paid for by the taxpayers, asking them <Col N="430" /> to vote for Maastricht, there was little mention of how EU restrictions would involve us in the convoluted begging bowl type politics in which we are now engaged.</P>
    <P>It is forecast that those involved in agriculture will suffer under the proposed GATT agreement.  Aer Lingus will feel the effects of the Maastricht Treaty on its fortunes.  There is not much point in talking of billions of pounds if in the long run the funding of the company is blocked by sharks in the EU or by British Midland or other lobbies ranged against the company.  It is fine to talk of restructuring if it is proposed to impose a high level of hardship, but I would consider such an imposition obscene.  It is unreal to allocate a certain amount of State aid to a public transport company and then leave it to whistle.  If State aid is forbidden under the provisions of Maastricht, except in the short term, we are asking Aer Lingus to swallow an extremely bitter pill, the effects of which has not been felt yet.</P>
    <P>I know the expertise and resilience of the Aer Lingus staff.  I know many of the staff personally.  I pay tribute to Paul O'Sullivan, Joan Carmichael and members of the unions who have spent many long hours and made many concessions in going along with whatever plans had to be put in place.  They can overcome many of the political botched policies but it behoves the Government to face the facts and make sure, as Deputy Noonan said, that partnership is ensured.  While opportunities in the past were missed, if partnership is not achieved the position of Aer Lingus will need to be reconsidered.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister indicate why the group is not a legal entity?  The Minister referred to synergy and Deputy Owen to outsourcing.  There is a need to provide not only the staff of Aer Lingus but the public, who have a vested interest in the company because it is now proposed to invest £175 million in it, with relevant upto-date information, not gobbledegook. That investment is vital for our economy and is not just a measure to assist one company.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="431" /> Freedom of information has been mentioned in this House as a way of ensuring that environmental law is not hidden from public view.  Freedom of information is badly needed in the area of aviation and public transport generally. The public are not aware of what measures need to be taken or the role played by successive Governments in tolerating management that was far from good for Aer Lingus.  In some cases the measures taken could be described as vandalism especially in relation to how profits were siphoned off, all of which have resulted in the present crisis in Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>Details of information relating to any investment in Aer Lingus should be divulged to the public as well as to members of its staff and the unions who in the past have been kept very much in the dark in relation to decisions affecting the company.  The Maastricht Treaty should not have been ratified by Ireland without the inclusion of amendments which would have afforded some measure of protection for a company such as Aer Lingus.  I hope the Minister will be able to come up with the required remedy to ensure that the negative effects of that treaty, which are becoming more visible, will be countered.  At present Aer Lingus is vulnerable and I hope the Minister recognises its position and informs the public how important it is for that company to flourish.</P>

      <P>Aer Lingus is one of Ireland's leading State companies and has made a major contribution to our national and economic life.  Nevertheless, it is indisputable that the company is experiencing serious difficulties.  The completion of the Single Market in the air transport industry earlier this year, the worldwide recession in the airline industry, the collapse of the GPA flotation, <Col N="432" /> the high cost base experienced by Aer Lingus together with a declining average yield per passenger, have all contributed to the crisis.  Some of those factors could have been predicted and successive Governments and managements must share some responsibility for allowing the crisis to develop.  Nevertheless, I congratulate the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communication, Deputy Cowen, the management and the unions for the cool and calm way in which they have dealt with this matter and on their realistic and positive approach, albeit at the eleventh hour.</P>
      <P>I want to pay tribute to the workforce of Aer Lingus who have now accepted the revised Cahill plan.  The workforce and the unions, despite initially being kept in the dark and living with rumour and uncertainty for many months, have behaved at all times in a responsible and constructive manner.  They have made tremendous sacrifices and that should not be forgotten.  It is regrettable that so many people decided to take voluntary redundancy for whatever reason as this will effect the day-to-day running of the airline.  Those people will be a loss to the airline.  Those remaining in the company have accepted new work practices, income restraint and so on.  Those unprecedented sacrifices should not be lost sight of.  It is entirely appropriate that new arrangements have now been put in place to allow the staff share in the profits of Aer Lingus and I welcome that new and novel development.  In addition, mechanisms to increase the input of employees are now being put in place and this too will benefit the company. As the Minister stated, nobody has a monopoly of wisdom on how to run the company and I have no doubt that the input from employees will greatly benefit the company.  A Government commitment that there will be no compulsory redundancies and that job losses will be kept to an absolute minimum has now been honoured.  The generous voluntary redundancy package played an important role in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The restructuring process, as outlined in &ldquo;Strategy for the Future&rdquo;, is the best <Col N="433" /> chance for the survival of Aer Lingus.  It involves the establishment of four divisions, the reduction of the cost base, the disposal of non-core assets and the operation of transatlantic services in a less restrictive environment.  I have no doubt that Aer Lingus will become efficient and competitive.  It can now focus more carefully on each market segment and adapt quickly to changing environments.  It can now concentrate on its core business.</P>
    <P>In particular, I welcome wholeheartedly the renegotiation of the transatlantic bilateral agreement, which in effect allows direct flights to Dublin from the US.  This decision was made in the national interest.  Our tourism industry can now develop in an unrestricted environment. As a result of this decision there will be increased access to this country, decreased costs, increased marketing activity and, most importantly, more jobs in the country as a whole.  The reports from Bord Fáilte are available to substantiate what I have said.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill particularly in that it enables the Government to inject £175 million into Aer Lingus.  This is a significant step by the Government and the taxpayer and contrasts sharply with rescue packages put in place for some other semi-State companies.  I would like the Minister to tell us if EU sanction will be forthcoming for the equity injection, when such a decision will be made and if conditions will be attached.  This is of fundamental importance and other speakers have also referred to it tonight. It seems from reports that other flag carriers receive more favourable treatment from the European Union.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify whether plans adopted for Air France, Sabena, Iberia and TAP received sanction with no restrictive commercial conditions imposed.  Ireland must fight its corner on this matter, and I have no doubt we will do so.</P>
    <P>Ryanair is concerned about the establishment of Aer Lingus Express.  That company has made a significant contribution to the development of the Irish aviation industry.  Were it not for Ryanair, low fares would not have been <Col N="434" /> introduced on the Dublin-London route. Ryanair proved to be a catalyst in introducing the concept of lower air fares to Ireland.  This fact should be taken into account.  I hope the Minister can assure me that Aer Lingus will operate on a competititive and commercial basis on this route and that EU competitior, rules will prevail.  In addition, will the Minister give an assurance that there will be full cost transparency on this route?  This is a vital question, given that Ryanair directly employs up to 500 people.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister the Government's position on the future of Aer Lingus.  The days of close regulation are gone and we are now moving into an era of airline alliances and domination by mega-carriers.  Has the Government given any consideration to a major joint venture or alliance proposal for Aer Lingus?  The people have a right to know what proposals are under consideration in this regard for the national airline. Now that recovery of Aer Lingus is in sight, this becomes a crucial issue and more public discussion is needed on the matter.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's concluding statement on the strategic importance of Aer Lingus as the national airline and that we cannot rely on other airline companies with no base here.  Other issues which arise under this discussion include the question of employment.  I welcome the establishment of the enterprise development unit.  It would be appropriate that a progress report be given in that area.  I have no doubt that, using the expertise in Aer Lingus, many new jobs can be created in that company.  Some speakers suggested that little reference has been made to TEAM Aer Lingus.  A plan is necessary in this regard so as to establish the role it will play.  TEAM Aer Lingus should be given every encouragement in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish to praise the unions and industrial relations mechanisms in bringing forward a rescue package for Aer Lingus.  The company can look to the future with some hope and I have no doubt the national airline will go from strength to strength.</P>

      <P>During debate on the Private Members' motion on 7 July last I listended to charges and allegations from the Opposition benches regarding the Labour Party position on Aer Lingus. We heard similar allegations this evening from Deputies Owen, O'Malley and Gilmore. These charges are rather hollow given the stated policy position of the Opposition parties.  For example, the Progressive Democrats Party was in Government between 1989 and 1992 when the extent of the problems in Aer Lingus emerged, but no action was taken. The Fine Gael solution was privatisation. The Labour Party put Aer Lingus on top of the political agenda during the last general election, and rightly so.  I and my colleagues promised the workers we would stand by the company and the workforce.  On election platforms and in our party manifesto we promised substantial Government equity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There was no reference to this vital issue in the manifesto of the main Opposition parties.  When speaking during the debate on 7 July I described the Cahill plan as a brutal, heartless prescription and I called for it to be replaced by an agreed union-management strategy. Furthermore, I put down a marker <Col N="436" /> on behalf of my Labour Party colleagues in the north Dublin constituencies that we would never accept compulsion or involuntary redundancies.</P>
      <P>The Cahill plan provided for a concept of privatisation or outsourcing of certain sectors of the company.  This was always unacceptable to me and to my colleagues and we made this known to the Minister and the Government.  The commitments made by the Labour Party that a substantial equity injection would be made into the company, that there would be no involuntary redundancies and no outsourcing or privatisation have been honoured. I am very pleased that the influential role played by the Labour Party in Government and by our Government colleagues has been acknowledged by the trade union officials, shop stewards, negotiators and staff.  The decision of the workforce to accept the plan, particularly given the changes in work practices which were inherent in it, represents a vote of confidence in the future of Aer Lingus as Ireland's national airline and this must be built on.</P>
      <P>The agreement reached between the Government, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and Aer Lingus trade unions for the provision of equity shares for the staff is a very welcome and innovative development.  This will have long term benefits for the staff as it will be taken into account on any future proposals for the company, especially in the event of any future Government or Aer Lingus management putting forward plans for the privatisation of the company.</P>
      <P>Given the difficult negotiations that have taken place, real progress has been made, as has been acknowledged, but there are two outstanding areas that need to be addressed.  The first relates to the Government's submission to Brussels. From media reports the Commission appears to be considering imposing commercial restrictions on the airline.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann, in the light of repeated delays in processing of payments of higher education and ESF grants, calls on the Minister for Education to</P>
      <P>&mdash;instruct all local authorities and vocational educational committees to pay outstanding grants immediately; and</P>
      <P>&mdash;issue the necessary sanction to all local authorities and vocational education committees to make grant application forms available to applicants in the month of April so that, in the future, processing can be completed and first payments made to all qualifying students on their commencing college.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The subject of higher education grants has been a long, unresolved and festering sore.  Over the past two years I, as Fine Gael spokesperson on Education, and my colleagues have repeatedly tried to highlight the injustices of the different aspects of the higher education grant scheme and to impress on this Minister over the past year and on her predecessors over the previous two years the need to inject some element of equity and fair play into a system which is flagrantly flawed and savagely anti the PAYE worker.  Not alone did the previous Government turn a deaf ear to our pleadings, but it proceeded to turn mercilessly on the last refuge left to the PAYE taxpayer when it decided to means test European Social Fund grants, thus introducing into the ESF grants scheme the <Col N="438" /> same biased discredited criteria which have acted so blatantly against middle income families for so long.</P>
    <P>We in this House have tried to remind the partners in this partnership Government of their election commitments to the people of Ireland just over 12 months ago.  The Labour Party, with its shining new agenda, promised higher education grants based on net rather than gross incomes.  The electorate voted for this. Shortly after taking up office, the Minister for Education, at one of her first Question Time, informed the House that this was not a practical proposition.  This is yet another broken promise.  Fianna Fáil, never ones to be outdone when it comes to throwing around taxpayers' money at election time, promised full free third level education.  Of course, that promise will not be delivered upon either.</P>
    <P>This entire issue has been dispatched to a special advisory group announced by the Minister for Education on 5 April 1993.  After eight months of deliberations the members of the group continue to gaze wistfully at the most glaringly obvious and conclusive set of facts one could set one's eyes on anywhere. However, we still await their conclusions, not to mention their solutions.  Fine Gael has tried to entice the Government to introduce a tax free allowance for the hardpressed parents of children who do not qualify for grants.  It would even be prepared to accept this as an interim measure as the nation waits with bated breath for the recommendations which will emerge from the special advisory group.  Again, this proposal was voted down in the House before the summer recess.</P>
    <P>The constant theme running through all of the Government's responses and rejections is that changes would cost too much.  The proposals put forward by Fine Gael tonight cannot be refused on the basis that they would cost too much.  The fact is that they would cost absolutely nothing extra but rather could save money and would certainly save thousands of students from the breadline existence many of them have to endure <Col N="439" /> for most of the first term of their first year in college.</P>
    <P>In 1993, 63,000 students sat the leaving certificate examination, approximately 55,000 of whom applied to the CAO-CAS office for college places.  Their applications had to be submitted before the end of last January.  Yet it was August, seven months later, before the county councils and corporation were permitted to issue the higher education grant forms and, as happened in so many cases, it was December, almost 12 months later, before some of the grants were paid.  This motion has been drafted for some time.  The first part of the motion insists that all the grants should be paid immediately, by Christmas.  One would have thought that even in the most complex of cases this would have been done by now.  However, by sheer chance, last night in Ballina I met the parent of a student, all of whose brothers and sisters had qualified for higher education grants, whose case was relatively straightforward. Yet the first instalment of this student's grant only arrived last Wednesday, 8 December.  This has been the experience of many students.</P>
    <P>College students begin a new phase of the education in September.  Yet the higher education grant application forms only become available a month beforehand, in early August, and do not have to be returned before the end of August. This year saw the introduction of the new all purpose yellow pack grant scheme, the so-called computer friendly higher education grants scheme for 1993-94. This pack contains three documents.  The first document entitled &ldquo;Application Form 1993-1944 Notes&rdquo; contains 11 pages of concentrated information.  The second document entitled &ldquo;Higher Education Grant Scheme 1993-1994&rdquo; contains 16 pages of concentrated information.  Last but not least, the third document entitled &ldquo;Application Form 1993-1994&rdquo; comprises 12 pages of ticks, boxes, Xs, options and choices.  On page 12 of the document there is a check list of 42 items of possible supporting documentation <Col N="440" /> which may be required and supplied by the student in order to qualify for a grant.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the convoluted mind which thought up such a complex system on top of a system which was already complex enough.  The scheme is an absolute jungle of red tape, not simply for the applicants and their families who have to try to wade through the &ldquo;do's&rdquo; and the &ldquo;don't's&rdquo; but also for the staffs of the various local authorities who are suddenly swamped with a monsoon of application forms, some of which are inadequately filled in, some of which are very wrongly filled in and some which are poorly filled in.  Apart altogether from the volume of applications, it is obvious from the complexity of the scheme that the processing of these applications will take a very long time.</P>
    <P>In this motion Fine Gael is asking that the timetables for issuing the application forms and instructions and for processing the grants be brought forward.  It is quite simple to do this.  As I said earlier, students apply for college places in January and by the end of January all the applications for places in universities, teacher training colleges, regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology colleges will have been submitted to the CAO-CAS office in Galway.  Shortly after 31 March the PAYE parents of these students who are lucky enough to find themselves below the magical qualifying threshold for a grant are issued with the P60s.  The parents in other earning capacities will also have their documentation relating to their tax affairs for the previous year, and hopefully these will have been finalised. Parents on social welfare can get a full statement from the Department of Social Welfare on request or, as happens in many cases, from the local employment exchange.  These are the two most important requirements for the processing of the grants &mdash; the application to the CAO-CAS office for a college course and the income details of the parents or guardians.</P>
    <P>The missing part of the jigsaw is the elusive application form and the actual details of the scheme.  If the forms were <Col N="441" /> issued in April each year the county council and corporation officials could commence processing them immediately.  It is recognised also that for some reason administrative staffs of councils have fewer administrative duties in the middle months of the year.  The staffs, therefore, would have a full five months available to them to carry out this work and any inaccuracies could be corrected. Additional time and money should be spent writing to applicants of hastily and badly written forms in order to establish the accuracy of the information provided on them.  If adequate time was allowed for the completion of the forms it would eliminate many of the inaccuracies. Having consulted with five local authorities I believe it would also eliminate and save the taxpayer hundreds of thousands of pounds in overtime payments for the six weeks concentrated processing of the deluge of application forms.</P>
    <P>If the forms become available in April applicants will have access to advice from school authorities, the majority of whom are not available in August due to the holiday, but who are readily available and easily accessible in April, May and June because the schools are still open.</P>
    <P>Any local authority will hold &mdash; and I have been a member of one since 1979 &mdash; that the major question mark in relation to eligibility is the financial eligibility of the candidate's parents.  In regard to academic requirements, the position could not be more straightforward. If a person obtains two honours in the leaving certificate examination he or she qualifies for a higher education grant, a vocational education committee grant or an ESF grant but if people do not obtain two honours, they simply do not qualify.</P>
    <P>On page 8 of the document &ldquo;Application Form 1993-94&rdquo;, section 25 is headed &ldquo;Very Important&rdquo;.  That is an important document.  The &ldquo;Final Course Acceptance Schedule&rdquo; is the application that must be sent back to the local authority as soon as confirmation has been received that one has been given one's final choice.  It is on the point of entry to third level that this document is sent back <Col N="442" /> to the local authority, be it the vocational education committee or the country council.  This is an important document also because it indicates to the local authority the institution and the course that one hopes to attend for the next three to four years.  Therefore, in order to finalise the administrative change that Fine Gael is seeking in this motion, all that one needs to do is to attach one's leaving certificate results for the relevant year to the form and forward it to the vocational education committee or the local authority. Following a simple perusal of the form, which should only take a matter of minutes, there is no reason why approval for the grant cannot be given immediately.</P>
    <P>It is important to spell out in detail the financial reality for a person starting college in September.  Let us consider the upfront costs facing a student who entered University College, Dublin, last September.  The CAO application costs £17, the advance deposit to book college accommodation costs £160, the deposit to secure CAO place costs £889, the advance payment to secure college accommodation &mdash; I refer to campus accommodation - costs £550 and the NUI matriculation fee costs £70.  That is a grand total of £1,686 before a book, an item of clothing or any food is bought. That £1,686 must be found before one can even enter the door of the college for one's first lecture.  For the student who is not in a financial position to contemplate campus accommodation there is the dreaded trudge through the world of flatland to seek the cheapest possible accommodation in that area.  Finally, having managed to secure a flat or a bedsit the average student must still come up with the £17 for the CAO application, £889 to secure the CAO place, £70 for the NUI matriculation fees and £300 &mdash; that is a conservative annual average-rent advance for a flat or a bedsit.  The total in this case is somewhat more modest but it is a fairly prohibitive £1,276.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that for any average middle income family, £1,276, before providing for food, books, clothing or travel, is a huge financial imposition. For most students it means quite <Col N="443" /> simply obtaining a bank loan of approximately £3,000 which must be renewed on a recurring basis.  I met the mother of a student yesterday who told me that she only received her grant on 8 December. Students are expected to start college life on a bank overdaft and we can rest assured that they will complete college life on an even larger bank overdraft. What a way to start college life.</P>
    <P>This is not a hyped up argument for political purposes.  These are the actual validated figures published by the student unions and verified by student welfare officers.  The same welfare officers have reported a dramatic rise in poverty among students this year and last year. It is evident from the welfare officers' reports and from validated statistics that many students have to struggle to survive in college and make ends meet.  Welfare officers also point to the fact that this struggle is affecting the health of many students.  There is considerable evidence also that the academic performance of students is being adversely affected. There is growing evidence of students dropping out of college because they have simply given up the struggle.  Having to wait weeks for the first instalment of the grant to arrive means, in many cases, that lunch comprises of a glass of water and a slice of bread.  College societies, for example, report a drop in membership reflecting not only a lack of finance but also a drop in morale.  Students who are required to fork out £1,686 or £1,200, in addition to clothing and feeding themselves in anticipation of a grant arriving, are finding it an impossible financial burden.  There is a genuine hardship for the large percentage of students waiting for their grants and, of course, for the new poor who do not qualify for any grants and whose parents' incomes are tantalisingly outside the income qualifying thresholds.  However, that is a matter for another day.</P>
    <P>It is now estimated that the conservative student loan figure is approximately £20 million.  Even allowing for the recently reduced bank interest rates, bank borrowing for students continues to <Col N="444" /> be extremely prohibitive.  In spite of all the rhetoric and platitudes about the value placed on education, about the wealth of the nation being its young people and the need for concentration on human resources, the banks have never made the required gesture of a reduced interest rate for students.  At a time when banks continue to report huge annual increases in profits, surely it is possible for banks to introduce across the board special low interest &mdash; approximately 5 per cent &mdash; student loan schemes.  The banks would still make a profit, admittedly a small, reduced profit on each loan. When divided across the different banking institutions, the individual amount would be relativley small but its impact, in terms of providing ease of access to education, would be enormous.  Yet time and time again, apart from tokenism and platitudes on the part of high profile sponsors at various events or competitions, the banks have singularly failed to perceive that they have any social obligations whatever and indeed repeatedly have turned their backs on any properly structured preferential interest rates scheme for students.  Thus the hardship and frustration continues.</P>
    <P>One of the traditional financial cushions for students had been the summer jobs market, which saved many a student and enabled them to keep body and soul together.  That is virtually nonexistent now because of the recession. The botched student work scheme, which was to replace eligibility for student dole, showed a lack of Government awareness and sensitivity to the plight of students. It was a total fiasco.  There is a boiling, seething anger among students that a Labour Party, in a partnership Government, did not murmur a syllable of dissent when the scheme was introduced but jogged merrily along with the decision &mdash; as they have done in so many other policy areas &mdash; which has confounded so many of their erstwhile supporters.</P>
    <P>Jobs overseas, traditionally a major source of income supplement for students, particularly to insulate them from the financial duress of the first few months in college, have dried up.  For <Col N="445" /> those who had no option but to venture abroad this year because of the summer dole restrictions, it was a case of borrowing in order to go abroad and again borrowing, or sending for money, to return home.  The economies of most of the former traditional student-employing countries simply are not in a position to oblige us any more.</P>
    <P>I exhort the Minister to accept this motion.  At least if the grants came on stream early, in the second, third or fourth week of September, two or three weeks after students had entered college, it would ease their problems considerably in that they could plan, project and budget.  There should be no mystery about it.  The whole thing is elementary. If one is entitled to a grant, one is entitled to know one's entitlement in time.  One is entitled to be paid on time and not late, as has happened year after year since the scheme was introduced.  One is entitled to receive a grant on the spot, not in dribs and drabs, with a student from one county looking enviously at his lecture hall neighbour from an adjoining county whose cheque arrived three or four weeks ago while his remains stuck at the end of this very long pipeline.</P>
    <P>The only way of ensuring that grants will be paid on time is to ensure that they are approved in time.  That can only happen if the process of approval begins on time and if the application forms are issued and returned in time.  I have already shown quite clearly how that can be done.</P>
    <P>The classic &ldquo;out&rdquo; for a Minister when urged to introduce a change is to defer any decision until some advisory committee or group carry out the usual comprehensive examination of the entire issue or scheme.  The advisory group the Minister established on higher education grants has been in place for the past five months.  I am sure their findings will be worth while whenever they arrive &mdash; at least we have been assured they will be.</P>
    <P>Next month the application forms for college places will flood into the Galway CAO/CAS office.  If the simple procedure to streamline the early issue and processing of applications for 1994 is to <Col N="446" /> become operable, then it has got to be put in place now.  The forms will have to be prepared in time and got ready for processing, with the minor amendments or modifications being put in place.  The relevant local authorities would need to be notified also that the process is being rolled back from August to April.  It is a move that is eminently possible and would be very worthwhile.  If the Minister did this she would have the gratitude of the student population.  Certainly it would eliminate, at least in part, some of their tortuous financial experiences.</P>
    <P>When the Minister's advisory group reports let them adopt this change as an integral part of any overhaul or reform of the scheme.  I urge the Minister not to halt the process simply because it is somebody else's idea.  I ask her not to condemn the class of 1994 to the same dismal fate of drudgery and delays as was the lot of the class of 1993, 1992, 1991 and 1990.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion before the House this evening is concerned with a very controversial element of the third-level grants system.  I refer, of course, to the unacceptable and appalling delay in the payment of grants by many local authorities and vocational education committees. I hope the Minister clearly understands this causes extreme hardship and stress to students and anxiety and despair on the part of their parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion confronts the Minister with a major challenge, one I had hoped she would accept with enthusiasm, displaying a caring, considerate attitude. However, my hopes have been dashed by what I would regard as a useless amendment tabled by the Minister which does nothing but commend what has been done while failing to refer in any way to the issues raised by our motion. It takes an extraordinary degree of harshness to blatantly ignore the terrible dilemma in which students find themselves because their higher education grants remain unpaid.  It shows a further extraordinary degree of dismissiveness to discard positive and helpful proposals that would result in the more efficient <Col N="447" /> administration of that higher education grants scheme.</P>
    <P>Sadly, this evening's debate will bring cold comfort to the numerous students, helpless in their misery, who are innocent victims of a poorly organised administrative system.  This could be very easily corrected if only the will and interest to do so obtained.</P>
    <P>I am proud to say that no party has shown greater consistency or determination to improve the entire scheme of higher education grants than the Fine Gael Party.  I am satisfied that our persistence coerced the Government to deal with a few of the many inequities within the system, by increasing the threshold limits but not the level we had requested, by giving recognition to additional family members in college and by the extension of grants to mature students.  Unfortunately, discrimination against PAYE workers and their families continues and the exclusion of modest income families from third-level grants has not ended. While accepting that some improvements have been effected, they have not been nearly enough.  The entire scheme is in need of total overhaul.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to address seriously the issues we raise.  We are all aware that there is a major difference in the timing of grant payments by various local authorities. This is a very serious problem for students, many of whom are forced to begin their college careers on a bank draft and must take out extensive loans to survive in those first crucial weeks. This practice is unacceptable and must end.  Students cannot afford to wait for grants, the vast majority having no resources or harbour to which to return in those first weeks.  In exceptional cases, the pressures caused by money shortage have resulted in some students taking the very unfortunate decision to leave third level education and others suffering severe physical and mental stress.</P>
    <P>It is all too easy to blame the relevant local authorities and vocational education committees, but we must remember that they are tied to the system within which they are obliged to operate.  I want <Col N="448" /> the Minister to explain to the House why her Department does not refund local authorities higher education grants until January when such payments are due in October.  This causes severe financial difficulties for all grant-awarding authorities. For example, in South Tipperary the financial outlay in higher education grants is £1.3 million, paid in three instalments. In order to meet this outlay the local authority has to increase its overdraft so that students can be paid during their first term.  If local authorities delayed payment until funds were made available by the Department of Education, students would not receive their grants until January.  This is an appalling situation and the Minister must accept responsibility for a major delay in grant payments.  This is the most important element.</P>
    <P>In South Tipperary the cost of the overdraft to meet grant payments was £100,000 in interest, as shown in the estimates for 1993.  In other words, the Minister's Department is starving South Tipperary County Council of over £100,000 because it fails to make finance available to the county council to pay the grants in the first term of college.  This is a financial loss that local authorities cannot afford.  All over the country many local authorities have to make cutbacks to enable them to pay out grants for the first term.  I take this opportunity to congratulate the local authorities who do not withhold grant payment because of cash shortage.  This situation is ridiculous and one which the Minister's Department must address.  The Minister cannot expect the local authorities to pay her bills &mdash; at an enormous cost to themselves. In addition, the local authorities pay maintenance grants in the last term. This comes to approximately £400,000 in South Tipperary and is not refunded until the following January.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education should pay the local authorities in three phases to meet payment without incurring interest charges.  The local authorities should be able to make those payments without incurring such expense.  Bearing in mind that there is no funding for the <Col N="449" /> administration of the grant system by the Department of Education, surely it is not much to expect the Minister to pay her bills to the people who operate the system free of charge.  I hope the Minister will bear this point in mind, which is fresh in my mind following the recent discussion on our estimates in South Tipperary.</P>
    <P>It is incredible that the application forms and all details in relation to the scheme are not made available until mid-August. As Deputy Higgins has said, there is simply no explanation, no logic, no justification for operating the scheme in this manner.  I can accept that, perhaps due to constraints, the Minister is unable to deal with the issue in 1993, her first year in office, but I will accept no reason that it cannot be changed for 1994.  This is the kernel of the entire problem. Because of the late availability of application forms there is little time for applicants to apply, little time for parents to prepare accounts, which, in turn, imposes enormous pressure on council staff to expedite the processing of grant applications.</P>
    <P>There is no reason whatsoever for this confusion and pressure.  There is no reason details of the grant scheme could not be made available in April and allow the processing of applications throughout the summer months.  Unfortunately, under the present system the joy of getting a place in college is soon quelled by the trepidation and fear of the grant application.  All of us being human, we must accept that the time following the leaving certificate results is a time of enormous pressure for parents and students, with some students waiting to find if they have been successful in obtaining a third level place, others waiting to have their papers re-checked and still others who have to wait until final places are allocated.  This is no time for dealing with grant applications and due to so much pressure many applicants find it difficult to cope with all the requests for additional information.  I hope the Minister will address this problem for the 1994 scheme and accommodate both applicants and local authorities by making all the information available in <Col N="450" /> early spring.  I am confident that this will result in faster decisions and speedier grant payment.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, I must also address several additional difficulties with the system that need urgent attention.  I believe that accounts submitted for income tax purposes should be acceptable for assessment for eligibility for higher education grants.  It is confusing, to say the least, that capital allowances are allowed for income tax assessment but not for higher education grants.  Purchase of land and property is allowed for income tax assessment but not for higher education grants.  This leads to a cumbersome system, requiring people to spend extra money in order to produce two sets of accounts.  It imposes an additional expense on the self-employed. There is a strong argument for simplifying the entire system, which would make the processing of grant applications more efficient, and students would not then have to suffer the effects of a cumbersome assessment system.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Jim Higgins, I believe the decision by Deputy Noel Davern, while Minister for Education, to means test ESF grants has added to the inefficiencies of the system.  That decision was negative, short-sighted and extremely unjust. It makes no social, educational or economic sense.  As a result we now have two grant awarding authorities dealing with numerous applications and causing further confusion.  Many applicants do not know to which authority they should apply.  Many apply to both and parents in some cases have to produce two sets of accounts if they have children applying to each authority.  This can be described as nothing other than crazy and totally cumbersome.  We should have just one grant awarding authority to deal with applicants for all colleges.  This would be more efficient, more effective and more consumer friendly.  Just as all applications for college places have been centralised, it would now be a major step forward to amalgamate the local authority and the vocational education committee into one authority to deal with all grant applications. In the interests of the applicant, <Col N="451" /> of the parents and of a more effective administrative system, I urge the Minister to consider this proposal very seriously.</P>
    <P>When discussing this subject we must not forget we are speaking on behalf of students, for their benefit and wellbeing. Their future depends on our decisions. For that reason I totally reject the Minister's amendment, which ignores the many difficulties that students face.  We must accept that their task is more difficult than ours.  Surely, we must be prepared to give them a fair and equitable chance of a worth-while future.  For their sake I had hoped the Minister would be prepared to accept the proposals put forward here this evening.</P>
    <P>The Minister must accept that the system is unfair, unjust and inequitable. The eligibility limits are based on gross income, which is totally irrelevant; rather they should be based on net income.  The thresholds are still too low.  Thousands of lower middle income and middle income families are still automatically debarred because the bulk of their income is upfront.  We must still accept that teachers, gardaí, nurses and the vast bulk of civil servants are wasting their time applying for a third level grant because they simply will not qualify.  For those students who are successful with their grant application it is still a struggle caused by the delay in assessment and the delay in grant payment.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to have the commonsense to tackle the issues we have raised this evening.  If so, she will succeed in giving some peace and assurance to the many students who, unfortunately, have been forced to face dinner time without a dinner, forced to register without the fee and forced to face a bank manager without resources.  The Minister will be taking a very positive step &mdash; one in the interests of students and parents which would have been taken long before now &mdash; if she addresses the issues we have put forward this evening.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann notes</P>
      <P>&mdash;the improvements and extension of the Higher Education Grant Schemes,</P>
      <P>&mdash;the increased number of students who are now eligible for the various grants schemes and</P>
      <P>&mdash;the increased volume of activity in this area</P>
      <P>and compliments the Minister for Education on the setting up of an expert advisory group to examine, among other matters, the administration of the grants schemes&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am happy to speak on this motion as it affords me an opportunity to review the development of the higher education grants scheme and of the third level student support system generally.  I also wish to outline current developments in this area referring in particular to arrangements for the organisation and delivery of the system.  In the 1992-93 academic year nearly 46,000 students were in receipt of awards under the various student grants and scholarships schemes, compared to just over 12,000 students ten years ago.  Overall, in the third level area, well over half the total enrolment of 80,000 students in 1992-93 were in receipt of student support compared with a quarter of all students in 1982-83.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Total student support for fees and maintenance provided by the State in 1993 is about £84 million an increase of £9 million or 12 per cent on the 1992 figure.  The higher education grants scheme was introduced in 1968 &mdash; exactly 25 years ago &mdash; following the enactment <Col N="453" /> of the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Act, 1968.  As Members of this House are aware, the administration of the higher education grants scheme is entrusted under statute to the local authorities.  Each year my Department prepares and issues a specimen scheme for the guidance of the local authorities; it also recoups them their expenditure in respect of grants awarded under the scheme.  Each local authority prepares a new scheme for each year and, under the existing legislation, this has to be submitted to the Minister for Education for approval.  It is generally acknowledged that a highly complex scheme has evolved over the years.  This complexity arose from developments in third level education, social changes, and related improvements and amendments to the scheme.  As things stand, there are three different third level student grants schemes in operation.  I shall return to this aspect of the matter but, first, I would like to outline briefly a number of the key changes made in the higher education grants scheme since its introduction in 1968.</P>
    <P>In 1972-73, grants were divided into separate fee and maintenance elements for the first time.  In 1973-74, four grade Cs in any four subjects of the leaving certificate examination were accepted, in place of in four matriculation subjects as had been the case.  In 1974-75, grants under the higher education grants scheme became tenable at the regional technical colleges for the first time.  In 1978, the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Act, 1978, was enacted. This amending Act enabled a broader range of courses to be recognised for grants purposes.  The means test income limits and fee maintenance grants were periodically revised.  In 1982-83, the poor law valuation system was found to be unconstitutional.  New means testing arrangements were introduced for farmers and the self-employed generally.  In 1983-84, a new provision was introduced whereby courses in Northern Ireland were recognised.  In 1985-86, tapering of lecture fee grants was introduced as a result of more gradual tapering of eligibility <Col N="454" /> limits.  Until the 1985 scheme there was no provision for awarding less than the full fee.  Grants also became tenable in colleges of education.  In 1990-91, the requirement for grants for four higher level leaving certificate grade Cs was reduced to two.</P>
    <P>Before I go on to talk about the improvements which were implemented in 1992 and in 1993, I wish to refer briefly to the other two elements of the third level student support system as it exists, elements which have evolved over a considerable time.  I am referring to the vocational education committee scholarship scheme and to the European Social Fund training grants scheme.  The vocational education committee scholarship scheme was establised in 1971 to provide assistance to students following courses at certificate or diploma level in the regional technical colleges.</P>
    <P>Until 1981 vocational education committees scholarships were awarded on a competitive basis and subject to meeting the requirements of the means test.  In 1981 the conditions were changed to provide that vocational education committee scholarships would be awarded to those who achieved specified minimum results in the leaving certificate &mdash; five grade Ds or higher on ordinary papers &mdash; and who also satisfied the requirements of the means test.  The number of vocational education committee scholarship holders in 1981 was 3,394.</P>
    <P>Because an increasing number of scholarship holders were going on to further education beyond diploma level, the scholarship scheme was gradually expanded to cover courses in other institutions. In 1983 the minimum academic requirements were raised to two grade Cs on higher paper plus three grade Ds on ordinary papers.  Grade A on an ordinary paper may be accepted in lieu of the grade C in a higher level paper.</P>
    <P>In recent years the number of scholarship holders has dropped due to the expansion of the European Social Fund scheme.  In 1992-93 the number of scholarship holders was approximately 1,800. The vocational education committee scholarship scheme now covers courses <Col N="455" /> in a variety of insitutions, in addition to the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>
    <P>When I examined this scheme after becoming Minister for Education, I must say I was struck by the extent to which many of the courses now covered are also covered under the higher education grants scheme, and that this pointed to the need for rationalisation.  European Social Fund training grants scheme commenced in the mid-70s.</P>
    <P>The essential purpose of the European Social Fund is to assist in the solution of employment problems, basically by helping to provide skills for the benefit of those who would not otherwise be able to obtain good and stable employment. Certain vocationally orientated courses in the education sector qualify for assistance under the terms of the fund.  The scheme covers the vast bulk of national certificate and national diploma courses in the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology.  For training purposes, those courses are grouped into two distinct programmes. Since 1992 the ESF maintenance grants scheme for those pursuing national certificate and national diploma courses has been means tested and the scheme istelf is administered by the vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>I shall now return to the major improvements which were implemented in the student grants area in 1992 and 1993.  A further package of major improvements in the higher education grants scheme and related student support schemes was implemented in 1992.</P>
    <P>The assisting of mature students to return to formal education has been identified as a key policy objective in both the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and the education green paper. As a result of the enactment of the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Act, 1992, two special provisions for mature students were put in place in the student grant schemes from 1992 onwards.  Mature students who secure a place in third level institutions are automatically considered to meet the <Col N="456" /> academic requirements for the award of grants.  Mature students are now means tested for grants by reference to their own incomes (and, if applicable, their spouses' incomes) rather than on their parents' income which had previously been the case.</P>
    <P>Over 800 mature students were awarded grants under the 1992 higher education grants scheme and the 1992 vocational education committee scholarship scheme.  The 1992 Act also enables us to accept other school terminal examinations in place of the leaving certificate examination.  This relates to school leavers going on to third level education and is mainly directed towards the relatively small number of Irish nationals residing in Border areas and attending second level schools in Northern Ireland.  It also enables us to consider cases involving school terminal examinations which were sat outside Ireland and a number of such cases are currently under examination in my Department.</P>
    <P>The principal improvement in 1992, and the one which was most widely welcomed as it affected the biggest number of people, was the substantial increase in income eligibility limits &mdash; an increase of 40 per cent.  Other improvements which were introduced in the 1992 schemes and contained in 1993 were: the income limit for families is increased by £2,000 for each additional child after the first child attending third level education; income is now assessed for the year in which the student actually enters third level and by reference to the income limits for that year.  This is a significant improvement because the family income is now assessed at the time the student is entering third level; lone parents welfare payments and the lone parents allowance scheme are now excluded from the assessment of income; in 1992 tuition fee grants were increased in line with increases in third level fees; in order to further strengthen the equity and fairness of the income assessment process the Revenue Commissioners are, since 1992, involved in the process of income verification.</P>
    <P>In 1993 I maintained the process of <Col N="457" /> improving and reforming the third level student support systems.  Income limits were increased by 3.4 per cent in line with the average increase in industrial wages.  The maximum tuition fee grant limit for courses covered under the higher education grants scheme and vocational education committee scholarships scheme was increased to £2,200 for the 1993-94 academic year.  This has ensured that a number of courses which were not fully covered in 1992 are fully covered under the 1993 schemes.  In response to representations from various sources, the sworn declaration in the application form may be witnessed either by a commissioner for oaths or a peace commissioner. Prior to this only a commissioner for oaths was acceptable.</P>
    <P>The awarding bodies have discretion, for the first time in 1993, to renew grants and scholarships for repeat years, in exceptional circumstances, in cases of certified serious illness.  This is an issue which a number of Deputies had raised in individual cases.  The terms of the 1993 higher education grants scheme and vocational education committee scholarships scheme which apply to students progressing for the first time from ESF-aided certificate and diploma courses to approved courses for the purposes of those two schemes have been simplified and improved.  Payment of grant/scholarship is not now subject to students obtaining an exemption in the courses to which they are now progressing. This caused considerable hardship in some cases where the student was required to fund any period of attendance for which an exemption was not given by the third level institution.  This problem had been raised frequently with me in representations.</P>
    <P>Under the 1993 schemes students progressing from ESF-aided courses are eligible for grant assistance from whatever year they commence their degree course provided they are otherwise eligible in accordance with the terms of the scheme.</P>
    <P>My Department carried out a thorough review of all the relevant scheme documentation. The schemes were redrafted <Col N="458" /> and simplified and the application forms and explanatory notes were redesigned and standardised.  Complaints in relation to the difficult nature of the text of previous years' schemes were taken on board.  An emphasis was placed on ensuring that the 1993 schemes would eliminate many of the complexities evident in earlier schemes with the object of making the whole process as user friendly as possible.</P>
    <P>The 1993 application form was designed with the object of ensuring that a single fully completed application from a person would suffice for all three schemes.</P>
    <P>The 1993 reforms which I have just outlined were carried out after detailed consultation with the vocational education committees and the local authorities. This type of process is by its nature time-consuming, but my Department did everything possible to have the new 1993 schemes available to students as soon as possible.  The fact that the relevant information was not available until August is an indication of the extremely cumbersome nature of the present system.</P>
    <P>I would now like to advert to those wider organisational problems in the administration of the schemes of student support.  Currently, in addition to my Department there are three sets of agencies involved in delivering the third level grants system.  They are the local authorities who are statutorily entrusted with the administration of the higher education grants scheme, the vocational education committees who administer the vocational education committee scholarships scheme and do the means testing for both that scheme and the ESF maintenance grants scheme and the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology who make the maintenance payments under the ESF maintenance grants scheme.</P>
    <P>As I previously stated in this House the need for simpler and more efficient organisational arrangements for the delivery of student support has been a constant theme in representations to me, and I am well aware of the difficulties <Col N="459" /> and the frustration being experienced by students and parents.</P>
    <P>I am committed to urgent action in this area.  Not only must the general terms and conditions of the schemes be improved &mdash; much has already been achieved in that regard &mdash; but their actual delivery has also to be streamlined.</P>
    <P>In March 1993 I set up an expert advisory group on third level student support with a following terms of reference: (a) to recommend appropriate criteria for assessment of eligibility on grounds of means, with reference to equity and the financial capacity of parents and applicants. In so doing the group would examine the application of the criteria for assessment of eligibility on grounds of means in the existing third level student support schemes; (b) to examine and make recommendations for the most effective and efficient organisational arrangements for the administration of the schemes, including rationalisation of the existing schemes.</P>
    <P>In preparing its report the group worked closely with and drew on the expertise of Department officials and invited submissions from all interested parties.</P>
    <P>I received the report of the expert advisory group a few weeks ago.  I am giving very careful consideration to the detailed findings and recommendations and I expect to be in a position to publish the report in February next, as well as to set out my intentions with regard to its conclusions and recommendations.</P>
    <P>In that regard I hope to be in a position to address shortcomings in the administrative arrangements which continue to be a source of irritation and complaint. In particular I have in mind the existence of three separate schemes with a considerable degree of overlap, the multiplicity of agencies involved in administering the system, late issue of the specimen schemes which creates difficulties later on in relation to processing applications, advising students of their eligibility and making grant payments in good time and the unsatisfactory appeals system. <Col N="460" /> My major priority for 1994 in relation to administrative arrangements will be to ensure that the specimen scheme and related documentation issue on or before 1 May to ensure a more timely and enhanced service is made available for students and that grant payments, as a result, will issue in good time.</P>
    <P>I have attempted in the debate on this motion to outline the major improvements that have been made in third level student support over the last 20 years and more particularly in recent years.  I am aware of the shortcomings that still exist and am committed to address these, drawing upon the findings and recommendations of the expert advisory group report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Higgins for putting down a motion which is of relevance to the House and to all who are involved in local authorities and vocational education committees.  I welcome the remarks made by the Minister and her tracing of the genesis of the present cumbersome system, indicating the various <i>ad hoc</i> developments that took place over the last 20 years and the various sources of funding, not just from the Exchequer but ESF funding.  Third level education in the past was largely in universities but has moved into regional colleges, the Dublin Institute of Technology, DCU and LCU which have become universities.  The Minister outlined all the developments in that area and the agencies, including the local authorities and vocational education committee's which have been established to deal with scholarships and higher education grants.  It is a cumbersome system and the Minister's run-down of the manner in which it has developed during the past 20 years or so is welcome.  I particularly welcome the fact that she proposes to examine the recommendations of the expert advisory group which she set up in March with the intention of putting the scheme into operation at the earlier date of 1 May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure Members read the 1991 OECD report which indicated that until recently Ireland had been behind its <Col N="461" /> European partners in regard to the provision of educational facilities.  We are at the bottom of the list in regard to pupilteacher ratio, Turkey being the only country below us.  That matter is being addressed by the Government specifically at primary level where the school population is on the decrease but, instead of saving those resources for other areas they will be ploughed into improving the pupil-teacher ratio in disadvantaged areas.  Comparatively speaking, we have a better resourced system than many European countries in respect of third level education.  Obviously, any Government concerned about the welfare of its people must start at the bottom and ensure that resources are provided first in disadvantaged areas at primary and secondary levels.</P>
    <P>The developments that took place in 1992 are welcome, for example, the extension of third level grants to mature students.  The increase in eligibility levels from £11,000 to £15,000 per annum, a 40 per cent increase, represents a major development.  Nevertheless, a large number of middle class parents in the £15,000 to £25,000 per annum bracket who are reaching the higher earning levels of their careers and may have a number of children at third level but lose out because of the £15,000 cut-off point.  I would like the Minister to examine those categories, some of whom were mentioned by Deputy Ahern, for example, teachers, gardaí, civil servants and so on. The Minister should increase the lower eligibility level from £15,000 to, say, £20,000 on a phased basis during the term of office of this Government and she should give priority to that.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept the motion as tabled. The first portion is simplistic &mdash; I do not mean that in a derogatory sense.  In my vocational education committee area, out of a total of 656 applicants, 381 ESF grants and 36 scholarships were awarded this year.  Of those applicants 141 were not eligible for various reasons; 24 of those eligible cancelled and 74 are outstanding because we are awaiting replies to queries.  Within a few days of the information <Col N="462" /> being received by the vocational education committee or the local authority the money is sent out, but we have not received that information.  Therefore, we could not proceed along the lines of this proposal and pay all outstanding grants immediately.  The second portion in regard to forms being made available to applicants at the end of April or the beginning of May is relevant and the Minister agreed to that.</P>
    <P>Many proposals must be dealt with in the context of the expert advisory group. First, we must phase in an increase in the eligibility level from £15,000 even though we increased it by 40 per cent last year. Second, we must consolidate the present system.  The Minister indicated how the various agencies, county councils, city councils, the vocational education committees, the Dublin Institute of Technology, the regional technical colleges and the Department of Education, have a role to play.  We have consolidated our CAO and CAS system in regard to access to third level institutions.  Likewise, we must consolidate our system for processing scholarships and higher education and ESF grants in a much more expeditious manner.  Third, we must examine the ESF maintenance funds.  A student attending college in Northern Ireland is covered, but a student attending college in England can receive only the tuition fee, not maintenance funding. There should be a reciprocal arrangement with our European colleagues, not only with Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>There are many comments I would like to make about the system if I had time. I am delighted the findings of the expert advisory group are being examined by the Minister.  She has given us an indication of the direction she is heading and I am satisfied we will have a streamlined system within a short time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the detailed exposition of her attempts to reform and improve what most people admit is a cumbersome and inefficient system.  She showed great frankness this evening in accepting the difficulties experienced by people during <Col N="463" /> the past year, particularly in September and October, in regard to late grant payments and incredible bureaucracy. However, some of the difficulties in regard to local authority servicing of this area resulted from outstanding cutbacks under previous Governments and the difficulties associated with transferring from one funded scheme to another through the vocational education committee or ESF and into the university system.</P>
      <P>I welcome the measures adopted by the Minister.  She was in office only a few weeks when she set up the expert advisory group to advise on reform of the system, following which she increased the income eligibility and maximum tuition limits significantly to include a reasonable number of the working people, those referred to by Deputy Costello earning between £15,500 to £19,500 per annum. She also introduced a number of other measures in relation to mature students and lone parents.  It will be a hallmark of this Minister's tenure in office that the central problem of education, that of access, will have been addressed.  My colleague reiterated the necessity to intervene at pre-primary and primary levels where significant inequalities exist especially in areas of high unemployment. That was illustrated in the recent Combat Poverty Agency response to the Green Paper on Education.</P>
      <P>During the Minister's term in office I ask her to examine the entire area of third level education.  It grew up willynilly from a position 25 years ago when we had approximately 20,000 students and four or five colleges to a position now where it is the policy of my party to give every citizen access to third level education should they so desire.  In such circumstances it is essential that we get the student support system right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is notable, for example, that one can go right through a street in many areas of Dublin city and county and not find a single third level student.  This is unacceptable. The reason students fail to reach third level is that they fail at either primary or second level.  The Minister was therefore right to make it a priority <Col N="464" /> of the Government to intervene early to ensure that the children of the unemployed and the low paid will have equal access to third level education.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I echo the comment made by my colleague that when the advisory group reports in February the Minister should consider the possibility of streamlining the support system along the lines of the CAO-CAS, which appears to be working so well.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to support the motion tabled by Deputy Higgins.  There is an old phrase which soldiers are supposed to have used: &ldquo;It is easy to sleep on another man's wound&rdquo;. This means, in effect, that if one does not experience the pain it is not real.  That is the case in relation to the grants paid to qualifying students when commencing at college.  This year, as in other years, many students have had to hang about and await the payment of their third level grant.  Many have said: &ldquo;So what, it is only a delay&rdquo; but, as we have heard, it causes untold misery, disruption and cost.  It also impoverishes and distracts students and, above all, indicates that students, the prime focus of the educational process, are regarded as being of minor importance.  The fact it has happened before makes it worse because we are proving that we learn nothing from recent history.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year, as in other years, few local authorities have provided students with the money they are entitled to receive at the start of term.  If all students came from wealthy families who could support them easily this would not be a major issue; and if all students had private means or had the good fortune to secure well paid jobs during the summer &mdash; we know that is not the case &mdash; it would still be an issue but would not be the source of major hassle.  In real life the majority of students do not come from wealthy families with money to burn.  We do not have students who can draw on trust funds and the few thousand pounds saved from a summer job.  The vast majority in third level education after a tough summer have no discretionary spending <Col N="465" /> money in their pockets.  They need the grant to be paid as early as possible, as soon as they register.  When the grants are not paid they face problems that no student should have to face at the beginning of the academic year.</P>
    <P>For a start they face uncertainty.  For many of them this is the first time they have to come to terms with the reality of budgeting.  It is at this time that they find that they do not have access to the money they are entitled to receive.  This is not the right way to learn financial management. It is the education version of &ldquo;live horse and you will get grass&rdquo;: live student and you will get grant when it suits the system, not the student, who is only a user of the system, which is much more important than human beings with needs.</P>
    <P>The most obvious challenge that students face as the summer dies away into autumn is to find accommodation, which is not easy even if they have money in their pocket.  When they do not have money in their pocket this is downright impossible.  I am aware that some students when they find themselves in this position pass up good accommodation, as they wait for the grant to come through, which is taken by someone who is lucky enough to have the money to cover the sizeable deposit requested.  Some students have to take out bank loans and find themselves coping with interest payments that they never thought they would have to cope with so soon.  We are all aware of the difficulties students experience in this regard.</P>
    <P>The position in 1993 is that students in the first stressful weeks of college are compelled by the State to attend college without money to which they are entitled. I would not have thought that a Labour Party Minister would have allowed this to happen because we knew what the Labour Party stood for when fighting the last election.  Unfortunately, the message in more recent times has been different. Let me give a specific example.</P>

      <P>I did not heckle the Deputy; he should please listen.  In common with many other Deputies, I wrote to the Minister for Education, who has referred to this matter on foot of requests from various student organisations to raise this vexed issue.  Let me make it clear that I do not think I was elected to do this.  I take the view that if a person is entitled to something they should not have to rope in Opposition politicians to engage in special pleading on their behalf. However, like many other Deputies, if there is a problem I try to solve it.  Therefore I sat down and put pen to paper to alert the Minister to this problem &mdash; I was not the only person to do so &mdash; in the expectation that I would receive a fast and effective reponse.</P>
      <P>I must confess that I am a slow learner but I thought at the beginning of this year, when this Government took office with an overwhelming majority, that it would do things; that it was like a 600lb. gorilla with lots of energy and power, that while one could argue with such a gorilla, one had better stand out of its way when it got going.  However, the other side is that it is well known that if one walks hand in hand with a gorilla, one will end up walking where he wants one to go.  The point I am trying to make is that I am still waiting for this Government to get going, especially in the area of education, unfortunately, I have not seen the movement that I genuinely believed earlier this year I would have seen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my letter I drew the Minister's attention to the plight of students caused by this administrative hiccup &mdash; as someone said to me, one person's administrative hiccup is another person's double pneumonia. In due course I received a reply which was most unsatisfactory &mdash; everyone received the same letter &mdash; in which she said that in preparing the 1993 schemes her Department had carried out a thorough review of all documentation. That is a relief; it would have been shallow and short-sighted to deal with the financial problems only.  The Minister explained that this thorough review covered the application form and the <Col N="467" /> explanatory notes.  Could one carry out a thorough review without looking at the application form and the explanatory notes?  This was not done for pleasure, as the Minister also informed me in her reply to my letter, but the objective was to make the process as user friendly as possible.</P>
    <P>I have to hand it to the Minister.  When she wants to carry out a review it will be thorough and will have a purpose.  In this case the purpose was to make the system more user friendly.  Because the Department follows through on reviews, action was taken.  The schemes were redrafted and simplified; the application form and the explanatory notes were redesigned and standardised.  This was a relief, or was it?  As Deputy Higgins said, there is a jungle of red tape still in existence. I am not being facetious.  The Minister informed us that these improvements were welcomed by the local authorities and the vocational education committees and that students viewed them in a positive light.</P>
    <P>This might give the innocent bystander the impression that something momentous was happening but this is a passing impression.  The Minister accepts that the grants process is cumbersome and that the arrangements for the making of grant payments to students are less than satisfactory. What did she decide to do?  She said that she was committed to achieving improvements in the student grant process and that the terms of reference of the expert advisory group on third level student support which she set up earlier this year included the making of recommendations for the most effective and efficient organisational arrangements for the administration of the scheme, including the rationalisation of existing schemes.</P>
    <P>When I wrote to the Minister she was looking forward to receiving the advisory group's recommendations.  We heard this evening that she has received them. While all that was going on the students went to college and tried to survive their initial cash flow crisis.  There are a few sharp points to all of this.  I am not, by <Col N="468" /> nature, an adversarial politician.  I do not take pleasure in singling the Minister out and criticising actions or inaction on her part.  However, this is an area where she should rightly be criticised by the Opposition. In the beginning I had a great belief in this Minister.  My own background is in education, and the early indications were that she did not come to the job with a solidified set of convictions that she wanted to apply to every issue. I believed that she was prepared to consult, to listen and to create openings for discussion.  This was all very helpful until it went on and on.  There is a time for listening and a time for policy-making. There is a time for discussion and a time for action.  The Minister needs to act.  It is fair to ask if this Minister has a vision for education, if she has a sense of direction, or is there to be a continuum of discussing green papers, discussion fora and advisory groups?</P>
    <P>While all this consultative process was going on, action could and should have been taken in quite simple ways.  For example, one thing the Minister could have done to ensure that students got their grants on time was to make the grant application forms available to applicants earlier.  Deputy Higgins suggested that the forms be made available in April. That is a sane suggestion and the Minister agrees with that now.  She could go a step further and issue them at the same time as the CAO forms and that would lead to rationalisation of the process.</P>

      <P>Local authorities were blamed for the late payment of grants. The volume of new grant applications has grown enormously over the last number of years; it has trebled in the greater Dublin area.  In fairness to the local authorities, it should be stated that there are factors which have contributed to the delays in the processing of grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1993 the Department of Education issued the higher education grant scheme and details of maintenance grant level renewals for existing students on the latest date ever in any year, 16 August, <Col N="469" /> so work could not start on the processing of the grants.  In 1992 the then Minister for Education extended the closing date for receipt of applications from 31 August to 14 September and this was done without any consultation with local authorities. In 1993 the Minister extended the closing date for applications to 6 September. Despite the short time available, local authorities were either unwilling or unable to divert sufficient staff to deal with the workload as quickly as was necessary.  For some authorities it was well nigh impossible.  The end result was that students did not receive their entitlements at the beginning of the term when they needed them.</P>
    <P>It was not necessary for an advisory group to tell anybody what had gone wrong there.  I suggest that the Minister avoided a straightforward remedy.  I do not know how she could justify waiting for an advisory group's recommendation on that aspect of grant aid.  She has stressed the urgency of action and I believe her good intent in that regard. However, she now tells us she has had the report of the advisory group for weeks and she expects to publish it in February. This is not action &mdash; it is inaction.</P>
    <P>I will wait to see what happens, but, going on the time-scale we have had to date, I have no great confidence in the Minister.  Maybe I should wait and see, but for many students it is far too late. They waited and waited, but they did not get their grants on time.</P>
    <P>We should deal with the serious inadequacies in the existing third level grant scheme.  Children in the PAYE sector in particular are seriously discriminated against under the present system.  Comprehensive reform of the third level grant system would mean greater social equity in the distribution of grants and a fairer distribution of grants in terms of occupational status of families.  There should be equity and transparency in the operation of the third level grant scheme. Assets should be taken into account when determining income and eligibility for grants.  Why not examine the idea that net rather than gross income be taken into account?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="470" /> When we were in Government we were successful in helping to have the eligibility ceiling for third level grants raised and that resulted in a 21.5 per cent increase in the number of students eligible. It brought the number of qualifying students up from about 15,200 to about 18,500.  It was a step forward but it does not tackle the fundamental discrimination against the PAYE sector whose income is an open book to the authorities.  That is not the case for other sectors who get a disproportionate share of third level grants for their sons and daughters.  My colleague, Deputy Quill, would agree with me when I say that parents who engage in creative accounting have, in the past, managed to establish eligibility for their children to get to third level education whereas children of people in the PAYE sector &mdash; teachers, nurses, gardaí and civil servants &mdash; have not had that advantage.  Low-income families are excluded from third level education because the income thresholds are too low and this certainly should be addressed.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note the socioeconomic disadvantages.  I agree with Deputies who said there should be greater openness and greater access to third level education.  It is interesting that at a recent conference in Ballymun the initial success of three pilot projects for expanding the involvement of what were described as working class students in third level education is seen as boosting the likelihood of direct Government funding for such programmes.  It is extraordinary that direct-intervention schemes seem to be a way of enabling students to attend our regional technical colleges, but is it not incredible that these are the lengths we have to go in order to achieve such a breakthrough?</P>
    <P>What we are discussing is one relatively small issue, except for the thousands of young people at a pivotal time in their lives.  What we are addressing is so obvious, so unfair and unjust and so easily solved that, on its own, it is an indictment of the Government's approach to education.  This approach kowtows to the interest bodies and consults <Col N="471" /> with them but it regards the consumer, the student, as little more than an irritant.  One gets the feeling that the powers that be think that education would be grand if one did not have to deal with actual students.  Students and the families they come from are the central issue in education and the Government would do well to remember that.</P>

      <P>This is a simple motion.

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two difficult issues that need to be addressed in the context of this Bill, one being the Government's submission to Brussels. Media reports reveal that the Commission appears to be considering imposing commercial restrictions on the <Col N="472" /> airline.  Those restrictions must be rejected as the Commission has already approved major investments for national airlines of other member states in recent years.  A total of £1.28 billion was allocated to Sabena Belgian World Airlines. The total investment approved to date for Iberia Airlines of Spain is £620 million and £700 million has been allocated to Air France by the French Government. In many of those cases money was invested in the national airlines before an application was submitted to the Commission. Having regard to the vote of confidence by the staff in Aer Lingus, it would be catastrophic if the Commission, on the basis of possible political pressure, now intends to apply commercial restrictions. All carriers, including Aer Lingus and Ryanair, must be allowed to operate on a level playing pitch.  Having regard to the seriousness of this matter and the need to make a decision in regard to the company in the next few days, the Minister and the Taoiseach should travel to Brussels to make a case on behalf of the Irish Government and our people to highlight our concern about this matter and our opposition to the imposition of restrictions in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill does not provide for representation or for worker participation on the boards of subsidiary companies of Aer Lingus.  That is a major defect in the Bill and I ask the Minister to reconsider this matter on Committee Stage.  As a firm believer in industrial democracy, I consider the proposed Bill represents a rolling back of the progress made in that area.  The Minister admitted that there will be a substantial overlap between the membership of the group board and the composition of the main operation boards.  Furthermore, he stated that it was his intention that representatives of employees' interests would have a part to play on the boards of the subsidiary companies of the main airline.  Now that an unprecedented level of agreement has been reached with the staff of Aer Lingus, I appeal to the Minister to give statutory effect to that agreement by providing, on Committee Stage, for worker representation on the boards of the subsidiary <Col N="473" /> companies.  A precedent in that regard exists in the operation of CIE.  I am referring to the transportation business where decisions are made on a day-to-day basis.</P>
    <P>The restructuring plan and the negotiations with TEAM Aer Lingus have not got off the ground yet.  I hope it will be possible to conclude an agreement that will ensure the future security of the existing workforce and also provide the opportunity to expand the business and maximise the skilled employment opportunities in the Dublin area, particularly north county Dublin, an area which has been devastated in recent months. Regarding the corporate structure of the company, how does the Minister envisage the interconnection between the holding company and its subsidiaries will operate?  Hopefully, the workers will be represented on the board of the holding company.  I compliment all those involved, the workers, their representatives, management and the Minister, in bringing the restructuring plan to its current stage.  Notwithstanding the comments that have been made tonight, the Labour Party has given a commitment to Aer Lingus which has been realised.  The Labour Party and myself are committed to supporting the company in the future.  I do not have a magic wand but I hope we can put together a plan that will secure the future of Aer Lingus, enable it to prosper in the next century and, in the process, protect the maximum number of jobs.</P>

      <P>I listened with interest to the contributions made in support of this Bill and to contributions by speakers on this side.  I detect certain complacency on the Government's side where Members, having applied their energies to securing a major redundancy package, believe the problems of Aer Lingus have been more or less resolved.  A more honest and sincere approach could have been adopted by the Government parties if, prior to the general election, they had objectively considered the problems of Aer Lingus and announced that there would be almost 1,000 redundancies.</P>

The banks pulled the plug on the financial difficulties experienced by Aer Lingus.  It is painful that the Minister's speech is not changed on the word processor. The Minister makes a similar speech on each occasion he talks about Aer Lingus.  He was interviewed on Clare FM today and he gave the same recital. Tonight he said:</P>
      <P>Let me first of all set the policy background against which this Bill was drafted.  When I was appointed Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications in January of this year it quickly became clear to me that Aer Lingus was facing a rapidly deteriorating financial situation.</P>

    <P>One only has to look back at the history of aviation policy to see the way the whole question of air transport has been dealt with by successive Governments.

      <P>As a western Deputy the Minister should not be consoling himself that this is all that will happen.  Politically speaking, many of these matters will come home to roost.  The effect of Deputy Killeen and Deputy de Valera denying themselves the Whip has been to dampen the debate.  There is no debate in the mid-west about the rights or wrongs of the amended Cahill plan or whether tourism in the west will receive a magnificent boost.  I was a little puzzled at Deputy Haughey's statement that the plan will reduce costs and bring more tourists into this country.  I am concerned about the mid-west region.

In those circumstances it is the tourists who would have to pay the increased costs.  I appreciate that Deputy Haughey wants to see American tourists on the streets of Dublin and perhaps more theatres opened up there, but in doing so many good hotels and guesthouses would be closed in the west.  As a result of this plan much of the economic infrastructure in the west will be transferred to the east.</P>

      <P>The real difficulty, that is the accounting system operated by semi-State companies, particularly the Aer Lingus Group, has not been faced up to. The whole future of semi-State bodies depends on how transparent the system is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dispute between Shannon and Dublin was highlighted when certain learned economists wrote in national newspapers about their knowledge of the cost in terms of transatlantic losses and so <Col N="478" /> on.  These people were geniuses because they were able to work out the Aer Lingus accounts, which nobody else was able to do.  I do not know where they got the figures.  The question of the Aer Lingus accounts is a puzzle and if it is not dealt with in this legislation when we have the opportunity to do so it will not be dealt with for a long number of years.</P>
    <P>I do not know what controls the Minister intends to introduce &mdash; he did not mention this matter in his speech.  Does he intend to provide for internal auditing? Will there be some mechanism which will anticipate the difficulties that may arise in companies such as Aer Lingus Holidays, or dare I say anything about that company?  I think it was Deputy Brennan as Minister who commenced examination of that matter, but the House has heard nothing about it since.  I do not know whether there is any intention to report on this matter.</P>
    <P>When replying, the Minister should indicate the exact position in relation to Aer Lingus workers.  In 1987-88 no internal audit took place in Aer Lingus. Why did management not introduce an auditing system?  Why did the Department, who was represented on the board, not insist that internal audit systems be put in place so that some of the difficulties that arose would be reported?</P>
    <P>The immense losses suffered by Aer Lingus did not suddenly creep up on the Government &mdash; they were signalled for a long time beforehand.  It should be remembered that these problems were brought about by the Government, who failed to take decisions on the matter. The former Taoiseach, Charles J. Haughey, must have known that Aer Lingus was going down the tubes, yet he did nothing about it.  I feel very aggrieved about this matter because when we put forward a solution to the problems which have been allowed to evolve in Aer Lingus we were told by the Labour Party that we were attempting to privatise the company.  This proposal was never put forward; we merely put forward a solution to save the company from extinction.</P>
    <P>The taxpayer is now being asked to <Col N="479" /> save Aer Lingus, a public company.  If Aer Lingus was a private company it would have been closed down long ago. It would have been declared bankrupt and the banks would have moved in. However, because the Government has been there to back the company and give it a letter of comfort it has struggled on. The threat by the banks that they would pull the rug out from under the company on 1 September if agreement could not be reached was wrong.  An agreement should have been reached between the management and unions upfront and should not have been brought about as a result of threats or the circuitous route used &mdash; getting certain people involved and asking them to put forward proposals, including the number of redundancies required.  The people in Aer Lingus have been very fair to the Minister. I suppose they have some admiration for the so-called pragmatism of Fianna Fáil.  However, it should be remembered that this pragmatism has resulted in huge redundancies.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan referred to the impact this blight of redundancies will have on north County Dublin.  This blight will not affect that area this year; rather it will affect it next year when there is no dole and the following year when the children of these workers have nowhere to go. Redundancy is a terrible thing.  I do not know how many Members of this House have worked in companies where there have been huge redundancies and experienced the trauma this has caused for families. I have been down that road twice and I know that most of the people in management do not really care about the workers who are left on the sideline.  I am very sorry for the workers in Aer Lingus caught in this trap who were told last October that the jobs were secure and that this semi-State company would receive what was virtually a blank cheque from the Government.</P>

The Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Cowen, cannot claim a first in this area.  He said that Aer Lingus's transatlantic services will stop and start at Shannon.  Having regard to the Dublin stop-over, this certainly will be a first.  The Minister said that there will be a year-round daily New York service and a dedicated Shannon-New York service in the peak summer season and that there will be no change in the current Boston service.  Most of <Col N="481" /> the people flying to Boston get on at Shannon.  If these flights were to fly from Shannon to Dublin, even Mr. Cahill could not wave his magic wand to get over that one.</P>
      <P>I am particularly interested in the Minister's claim that Aer Lingus is examining ways of developing new business.  Why could the company not do that previously? What magic wand does Aer Lingus now have which enables it to examine ways of developing new business?</P>

      <P>Aer Lingus complained about the Aer Rianta landing charges.  I <Col N="482" /> understand from the people working in Aer Rianta that landing charges amount for 3-4 per cent of airline costs.  Why did Aer Lingus complain about the landing charge at Shannon?  Why was it such a burden on the company?  Will the company be given some kind of relief on this charge in the future?  Will the Minister help Aer Rianta to lower this cost on the airline?  It is possible that the Minister might do this &mdash; he referred to an integrated aviation policy.  Will the Minister help to subsidise the Aer Lingus Shannon-New York service by waiving the landing charges?  I do not know how such a proposal would be greeted by Aer Lingus's competitors.</P>
      <P>Under the package proposed by Aer Lingus, for the first time ever, Shannon will have no direct daily flights to New York.  That is the worst blow in the Cahill plan.  I think people were expecting an explosion, so to speak, in the mid-west region about the decision to do away with the Shannon stop-over.  The people in this region are very disappointed.  The uncertainty about the status of Shannon has gone on for three and a half years and I do not want to add to it.  I had hoped that the Minister would outline today some definite future role for Shannon. However, all he gave was some mythical solution to the airline's problems. I cannot accept the package outlined by the Minister as a ready solution to the problems in Aer Lingus.</P>

      <P>At the outset, I wish to support the statement made earlier by my Labour Party colleague, Deputy Seán Ryan.  This Bill has three main objectives, the principal one being to provide the £175 million of equity for Aer Lingus. It represents the final stage in the commitment given by the Labour Party in the last general election to provide equity for the company as part of a strategy to ensure the return to viability of the airline. <Col N="483" /> I am proud that the Labour Party has honoured this commitment made at the meeting in Dublin Airport last November.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley referred scathingly to the &ldquo;Santry Six&rdquo; but I think the Deputy could be referred to as one of the &ldquo;Shannon Seven&rdquo; because his policy with regard to Shannon tends to run completely counter to his political and economic philosophy on every other matter. Therefore, I think one is entitled to make that comment when he refers to others.</P>
      <P>As a Deputy elected last year for the first time to this House and representing a constitutency on the northside of Dublin, I welcome this Bill.  It is an expression of confidence in the future of Aer Lingus and in Dublin Airport which will now be open to direct flights from North America.</P>
      <P>Deputy Carey referred earlier to Shannon and stated that this was a Dublin versus Shannon argument.  I reject that, it is a divisive argument and it is not what the people in Dublin, who support Dublin Airport, are fighting for.  If additional flights are allowed into Dublin it will result in additional tourism and business for the country generally, but that should not be done at the expense of a particular region.  I am opposed to the view that one region is in conflict with another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome also the outcome of the recent Aer Lingus workers' ballot which had a decisive and emphatic outcome in favour of the Aer Lingus strategy for the future.  This outcome is a tribute to the negotiating teams, both the management and unions, and to the Labour Relations Commission which toiled long and hard to reach his agreement.  I would like to pay tribute also to Minister Cowen for his open approach and his commitment to achieving a solution and resolving the difficulties in Aer Lingus.  I believe Aer Lingus and its staff are now confident that when its route networks return to viability the airline will be in a position to strengthen both its markets and financial position through alliances with other carriers <Col N="484" /> feeding into an expanded Aer Lingus system.</P>
    <P>Having said that, one is conscious that this agreement was not achieved without some pain.  It did not, however, involve compulsory redundancies, it involved a voluntary employee reduction scheme of approximately 800 jobs.  The contribution made by those workers to the survival of Aer Lingus must be commended and in this context I welcome also section 5 of the Bill which allows for an employee profit-sharing scheme.</P>
    <P>As we are all aware, the injection of equity requires European Commission approval.  I hope this approval will be forthcoming with the minimum of restrictions and with the maximum commercial freedom to allow Aer Lingus and its subsidiaries expand and grow in the international air travel market.  EC approval has recently been given for equity injections to Air France, Sabena Belgian Airlines and Tap in Portugal, on a far higher scale.  Aer Lingus should not be required to face restrictions additional to those applied to these national airlines.</P>
    <P>Section 8 deals with worker participation and the appointment of employee representation to boards.  In this section it is proposed to confine worker representation to Aer Lingus group only.  I would ask the Minister to give serious consideration to providing for employee representation on the operating subsidiaries, Aer Lingus plc and Aerlínte plc, now and in the future.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Ryan, referred to what took place in Córas Iompair Éireann in 1986 when that company was divided into three operating companies and a holding company.  In that case, the elected worker representatives on the main board also have representation on the subsidiary boards which allows for continuity between the boards and greater involvement in the running of the companies.  I would ask the Minister to seriously consider that option when he is replying to the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity of speaking on this Bill. Listening to the remarks made by Deputy <Col N="485" /> Carey, I could only describe him as a prophet of doom for Aer Lingus who saw nothing positive and had no proposals to put forward in relation to how we would deal with the very serious problem with which Aer Lingus is confronted.  There is no point in simply giving a pessimistic analysis of the problem unless one is prepared to put forward positive proposals. That is what this Government has done. It has grasped a very difficult nettle that had not been grasped in previous years and it has dealt positively and comprehensively with this issue.</P>
      <P>I do not like this issue degenerating into one of the regionalism as my colleague, Deputy Kenny, has mentioned, because that is a blinkered approach. When this whole problem came to the fore, I remember Sligo County Council putting forward a motion seeking an open skies policy in relation to Ireland because it felt it was poorly served by the Shannon stop-over and that it did not benefit the north-western region in any way.  I believe we must examine the overall approach&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It is one thing to look at these issues in a blinkered, regional fashion and it is another to look at it in terms of the future of the air industry, which is what we are examining here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By and large, I welcome the proposals <Col N="486" /> in the legislation.  I welcome also the restructuring proposal before us in terms of the establishment of a new holding company and also the proposals for the establishment of subsidiaries.  This is part of a package which will bring about a profound transformation of Aer Lingus and the air transport industry in this country.  It is a package that has not been implemented without a considerable degree of pain and trauma but I believe it will result in considerable benefits in the long term.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to make major changes without a number of people being hurt in the process but if the situation had continued indefinitely I have no doubt the end result would have been much worse and might have come too late to save the industry entirely.  It would have been swallowed up and we would have lost a very substantial asset to this country.</P>
    <P>These changes have taken place with the hard work and goodwill of all the staff in Aer Lingus who faced up to a crisis and who, one could say, took it on the chin.  Together with the Labour Relations Commission, the management and this Government, a package of proposals was put together that involved voluntary redundancies. It must be emphasised there were no compulsory redundancies despite the prophets of doom from the Fine Gael side of the House.</P>
    <P>Work practices changed and it must be remembered that it is not easy to change work practices either.  It is difficult, particularly when it involves a fine industry that was operating on the international scene.  When radical work practices have to change it requires a considerable degree of psychological examination.  One's livelihood and one's parameters of activity, family life and so on, must be taken into account.</P>
    <P>The elimination of the Shannon stopover has been another substantive change.  It would be improper for me to dwell on that decision only.  Nonetheless we must recognise that the market warranted a greater degree of flexibility and, within the context of deregulation, that <Col N="487" /> was something we had to face up to.  I do not believe for a moment that this decision will mean the deathknell of Shannon since already we have observed further industries being attracted to the south-west.  Rather I predict that Shannon will receive a new lease of life.  The commitment to base a certain number of crew there, ensuring its use as a regular base, is a mark of goodwill in that direction.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus have now put together this restructuring package. This will turn around what had become a £50 million operational loss and lead to its eventual elimination in future years.  It is a tremendous mark of support for the people who worked so hard in compiling the restructuring package and ensuring its success. Those were the difficult decisions taken. On the other side of the coin is what Aer Lingus can obtain in return.  Aer Lingus workers will receive 5 per cent equity, plus 5 per cent profit-sharing, giving them a foothold in the company and a say in its future direction.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus is receiving an injection of £175 million by Government, the major shareholder, not a huge amount of money in international terms but nonetheless a substantial equity injection on the part of taxpayers.  We should remember that every penny invested in Aer Lingus has to be paid by taxpayers through their money hard-earned.  Then there are the new structures placed before us: the holding company that has been established, in addition to the subsidiary companies to be established to deal with the various operational aspects of Aer Lingus, entailing a corporate reorganisation.</P>
    <P>That takes me to what I consider to be the most serious element of that restructuring package, that is, the manner in which the board of the holding company and any of its subsidiaries will be constituted. It is essential that there be worker directors serving on the boards of the holding company and likewise of any subsidiary established.  We must remember what has been said about the enormous pain and suffering endured within <Col N="488" /> the company by its employees, the decisions that have been taken, some too late, and the agenda that must be drawn up for the future.</P>
    <P>If we are to ensure that Aer Lingus does not fall into crisis again it will be the people at the cutting edge, workers and management, who must have control and the ultimate say in what will happen to the company.  The only way in which that objective can be achieved is through the participation of workers in all the relevant subsidiary companies having a decisive and strategic say in the future direction of Aer Lingus.  I am concerned to note that there will be 12 members serving on the board of the holding company, four of them worker directors, the remainder to be nominated by the Minister. That excludes any worker participation in the existing Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta boards.  This means we are losing worker participation in some boards while not gaining participation in any of the subsidiaries to be created by the Minister in the future.</P>
    <P>We must examine some decisions taken in the recent past.  Deputy Carey referred to Aer Lingus Holidays.  There are questions to be answered there &mdash; and I should like to see them answered &mdash; ascertaining who was responsible for a considerable loss of money in that area. There was the question of the purchase of the two 767 jets lying idle on the runway at a cost of £10 million per annum.  That decision was not included in a proper package, thereby precluding the deployment of those aircraft.  They were bought in advance without the requisite strategic decisions having been taken.</P>
    <P>Questions also remain to be answered about how a loss of £50 million was allowed to accumulate.  People in high places should not have failed to foresee that the &ldquo;open skies&rdquo; policy beginning to emerge in Europe would lead to the deregulation and liberalisation of air travel.  This should have been acted on at an earlier stage.  We must remember also that if approximately 1,000 personnel have opted for voluntary redundancy, that places an additional responsibility <Col N="489" /> on the staff remaining, an extra responsibility they are taking on in good faith in order to run an airline that will be at least as strong and which will continue to expand.  Therefore we must ensure that the workers and their colleagues have a very definite say in and responsibility for the running of the airline so that the mistakes of the past will not be allowed recur.</P>
    <P>A good analogy would be that of CIE when that company was restructured.  My colleague, Deputy Sean Kenny, knows all about that, having worked in that company. He knows precisely how CIE was restructured.  It is divided into three separate subsidiaries &mdash; Iarnrod Éireann, Bus Éireann and Bus Átha Cliath &mdash; each of which has two worker directors.  This was specifically written into the relevant legislation, the Transport (Reorganisation of Coras Iompair Éireann) Act, 1986, section 11 (3) of which said:</P>
    <P>The directors to be appointed to each company shall include two persons elected from the members of the board...provided that such persons are willing to accept office.</P>
    <P>That was the parallel restructuring that took place in the case of that former State body, which meant that there was worker director participation in the strategic operational subsidiaries.  I believe that is the direction in which we should be moving.  I want to see the Minister take that concept on board and I would hope he would introduce tomorrow on Committee Stage an amendment acceptable to all sides of the House, ensuring that such worker director participation is introduced.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to refer to the Government equity injection of £175 million into Aer Lingus, which, as I have said, is peanuts in international terms, a very small amount of money, particularly when one observes the amounts of money injected into say, Air France, Sabena or Iberian.  Yet for the first time the European Commission is expressing concern that Aer Lingus should receive their equity without restrictions.  The European Commission is now seeking to <Col N="490" /> impose restrictions and conditions rendering it difficult for Aer Lingus to obtain that equity and then compete in an open skies market on a competitive basis.  It is a sad irony that many of the problems that confront the international aviation industry have been caused by liberalisation and deregulation.  Then suddenly we have the European Commission saying we must regulate Aer Lingus, that it will not allow Aer Lingus to compete in an open skies market.  I have no doubt that this latest pronouncement on the part of the European Commission is against the stated intention of Aer Lingus to establish Aer Lingus Express to operate a no-frills schedule between Dublin and London, the second busiest route in Europe.</P>
    <P>I would be concerned that undue pressure would be brought to bear on the Commission because up to now the Commission saw no problem.  I would be worried that people who have influence in Europe might use it on behalf of one or other airline.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot let the opportunity of this historic Bill pass without making some comment in view of the fact that when I was my party's spokesperson on transport some years ago I was aware of the acute difficulties Aer Lingus faced. Former Ministers, Deputies Seamus Brennan and Geoghegan-Quinn, refused to acknowledge, steadfastly ignored them and are, in no small way responsible for this emergency legislation.  My colleagues, Deputies Noonan and Carey, have outlined our general approach to the Bill.  We are not opposed to this injection <Col N="491" /> of capital, although it represents a very substantial transfer of resources from the taxpayer and is something that should not be taken lightly by any State company.  We wish the plan, this legislation and the equity injection every success for not only those working in Aer Lingus but for those dependent on Aer Lingus as an access transport carrier in and out of the country for tourism, freight and for developing and marketing Ireland's goods and services abroad.</P>
      <P>I do not think this plan will work. There is optimism about this plan but I believe that in three or four years time Aer Lingus will face another crisis.  It is important that someone puts that on the record.  Economists involved in aviation to whom I have spoken are extremely doubtful of the economics of what is proposed for the transatlantic route.  They believe that because of the global changes taking place in aviation it is likely that Aer Lingus could become a regional carrier. While strides have been made in some type of crisis management to arrest the decline and the losses the fact is that even if there is a stop to the haemorrhage of £1 million per week it does not mean the company will be guaranteed into the future.</P>
      <P>I wish to comment on the transatlantic route.  If we are trying to establish any consumer service we must have certain matters on which we wish to trade, for example, price, quality or frequency of service.  I do not see how Aer Lingus will be able to compete and win against the transatlantic carriers operating out of the UK.  They cannot offer flights as frequently or as cheaply and they cannot greatly improve on the quality of service. I am aware that 58 per cent of people who fly from America to Ireland come other than by direct routes.  I have yet to be convinced that this plan will work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must face the issue of the fleet replacement on the transatlantic route. The three ageing 747's have not been replaced.  If the company could not make money on the transatlantic route with free depreciation, it is difficult to understand, when writing down leased or purchased <Col N="492" /> planes at a cost of the order of $100,000 a month, how those economics will work.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to justify to the Irish taxpayer how they should be so heavily involved in the hotel business.  The balance sheet of Aer Lingus shows borrowings of £500 million; the great majority of which are for hotels.  I do not know why the taxpayer should be so heavily involved in the hotel business abroad.  We have moved away from our direct involvement in the Great Southern Hotel group.  If we have to keep a fundamental access transport service in operation some major surgery is required in regard to the hotels.</P>
    <P>Some international trends in transport cannot be swept under the carpet.  Aer Lingus is the only carrier in Europe that is not part of cross-shareholdings and an amalgamation of other airlines.  For example, Lufthansa, KLM and British Airways all have cross-shareholdings in each other.  Every day these cross-shareholdings are becoming more intricate, more interdependent and Aer Lingus has, to a great extent, missed the boat. The recent RTE programme, &ldquo;Tuesday File&rdquo;, was very significant in this regard because they tracked down all the potential carriers that considered Aer Lingus and looked away.  I have no doubt that what we are seeing is the development of oligopoly, where we will have ten to 12 mega carriers that will control world aviation. In any line of business the level of losses now being incurred by world aviation can only be sustained if the competition can be wiped out in the process. It is a very familiar cycle.  The start is made by having competition from deregulation and then there is extra capacity.  The airline managers say they need to get the backsides on the seats and, as they cannot have empty seats, they sell below cost to fill them.  What follows is, in effect, a fare war, an airline company closes down and goes into Chapter 11.  Airlines then have consolidation and amalgamation and settle down to a level of competition, usually on a hub and spoke basis, focusing on key routes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="493" /> If Virgin Airlines or British Airways decide to pick off Aer Lingus they could say that they do not care and will carry the loss.  If we got into that situation I do not see how the taxpayer, going to that poker table, will have the resources that other international mega carriers will have.  That is a very serious problem.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with some of the political aspects.  I was transport spokesman in the late 1980s for my party.  It is fashionable now to blame most of the problems of Aer Lingus on Mr. Mullan and Mr. Acton &mdash; the top two executives in the company.  The story goes that they are responsible for 767s lying on the tarmac, for trying to put Ryanair out of business and failing, for not alerting the Government to the losses in time, for ALH and many other problems.  Some of that criticism is justified.  What is conveniently forgotten is that after the 1987 election the former Taoiseach, and others, went out of their way to make Government policy central to aviation policy.  The policy was to double tourism numbers at all costs.  When Aer Lingus applied for fare increases on critical routes they refused, particularly in regard to short-haul routes.  That is part of the problem because their most profitable route, Dublin-London, started to lose in the order of £18 million per year.  The former Minister, Deputy Seamus Brennan, knew in part about those difficulties and refused to sanction fare increases simply because it would interfere with the projected growth in tourism numbers.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party, which was going to put trust into politics and justice into economics, lectured us from the highways and byways and in the hangar in Dublin airport.  They contended that those of us who were saying that Aer Lingus had to get a partner, that costs needed to be cut and the balance sheet put right were Thatcherite monetarists who were anti-Aer Lingus.  Now we find that even more harsh measures are required.  For example, the cabin crews have had to make the most extraordinary sacrifices in relation to their work, pay, condition and prospects.  To listen tonight <Col N="494" /> to the Labour Party saying it is proud of its honourable role and that it has honoured all its promises makes me wonder whether it is downright deceit in trying to shift the goal posts of its response to the pressure.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party promised there would be no job losses and also access to unlimited equity.  It made promises that should not have been made.  Labour Party popularity enjoyed an unprecedented increase and it swept all before them in north Dublin and captured two seats in constitutencies where it had none.  All other parties suffered from this tidal wave of Labour Party support.  I have been at functions and luncheons in north Dublin recently and the people's hostility and bitterness to the Labour Party is palpable. People feel a sense of betrayal, a sense of being left in the lurch by the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>The prospect of worker shareholdings in Aer Lingus is something that I support. Some trade unions, particularly in the private sector, have not supported the concept of worker shareholding in a profit bonus or incentive basis, but the level of sacrifice made by the workers justifies their long term stake in the company. However, it would be wrong to mislead the workers into thinking that the shareholding would have a particular worth.  I fear that will not be the case.</P>
    <P>The question must arise whether the £175 million equity injection is enough. It is enough to keep the banks away from the door for a while, given the borrowings of £500 million, but unless something is done to reduce the debt-equity ratio in a meaningful way, the burden of debt will continue to make Aer Lingus unprofitable.</P>
    <P>When I was spokesperson on transport I did not comment on events in Aer Lingus Holidays Limited because I was advised that legal action was being taken by Aer Lingus against a firm of accountants and against people involved in Aer Lingus Holidays Limited.  I was advised also that there was a file with the DPP and this led one to believe that if one made a comment it would be prejudicial to any subsequent proceedings.  As we <Col N="495" /> now know, the Aer Lingus Holidays Limited debacle came to a head in 1987-88 and now, some six years later, no proceedings, either civil or criminal, have been taken.  There will have to be an inquiry by either a committee of this House or some other appropriate body into how £17 million of public money could have been defrauded in this way.</P>
    <P>Like other Deputies, I have received correspondence from employees of Ryanair who have expressed grave concern about the Aer Lingus Express proposal. They feel this is designed to put them out of business and that having experienced enormous sacrifice their taxes are now being used to subsidise the company who will try to put them out of business.  I cannot adjudicate on the fairness of that allegation but at the time that Aer Lingus and British Airways operated a cartel, particularly on the Dublin-London route, we saw the effect of Ryanair coming on stream.  Passenger numbers doubled over a two-year period and the consumer got a wide range of options at cheaper fares.  It would be wrong to solve one problem by creating another.</P>
    <P>I believe that Ryanair is not a real competitor to Aer Lingus in the context of where it can operate from.  I do not believe it is profitable for Aer Lingus to operate from many of the regional airports, whereas the cost structure in Ryanair is such that it could, particularly on a seasonal basis.  The regional airports are experiencing enormous difficulties and I notice in the Book of Estimates that their marketing budget is being cut again.  I hope that a happy co-existence can be arranged.  I believe that Ryanair will be a small niche operator.  It is much more important that Aer Lingus strengthen its hold on other routes rather than to get that monkey off its back.  I believe it has been looking in the wrong direction.</P>
    <P>An independent appraisal of the Aer Lingus balance sheet indicates two problems. It is losing £1 million each week, a total of £50 million a year, principally in air transport.  It needs to increase its revenue and its yield and to cut it costs <Col N="496" /> to deal with this.  I believe it would not be in a strong position should a competitive war break out on any of its principal routes arising from EC aviation deregulation.  The proposals for the transatlantic route are not soundly routed in economics, particularly when the cost of fleet replacement is added.  The frequency of services will mean that it will still be outmanoeuvred by larger hub airports. Very serious political responsibility rests with the three preceding Ministers for Transport.  They did not want to hear about the crisis in Aer Lingus when Mr. Mullan and Mr. Acton were telling them and their officials in the clearest terms possible that the manure was going to hit the fan specifically because of the lack of approval for fare increases.</P>
    <P>The only future for Aer Lingus, as more than a regional carrier is to be part of a mega carrier.  Discussions should start immediately in phase 2 of the Cahill plan to get a partner.  The whole purpose of the plan is to restore Aer Lingus to a position where it can be part of a larger group.  That will fundamentally secure the future of Aer Lingus because if anyone decided to put it out of business it would have to take on a group which is big enough to fight it off.  Competitive wars are nothing more than a war of resources and whoever has the deepest pocket wins the war.  It is the same in the supermarket business.  Ben Dunne and Quinnsworth got a grip of the market because their pockets were deeper and they were able to do more below cost selling for longer periods than anybody else and people could not afford to shop elsewhere.  The same is happening in aviation and if an airline is not part of such a mega carrier, it simply has no future.</P>
    <P>I wish Aer Lingus well.  I acknowledge the sacrifices the workforce have made and I hope for the sake of tourism and Ireland Incorporated that it succeeds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this important legislation which will put in place the measures required to put Aer Lingus on the path to profitability.  A number of months ago I spoke in this Chamber on a Private Members' motion introduced by the Opposition.  Since then, the unions and management at Aer Lingus have put together a development plan which will put in train the measures needed to put the national carrier firmly on its feet and ensure its future.  The development plan has now been put in place.  I praise all the union negotiators, the management and particularly the staff for their efforts in securing such an agreement.  It is important also to recognise the efforts of the Minister in putting together a plan to secure the future of the company. Tremendous sacrifices have been made by all concerned in putting this package together and it will breathe new life into the company at a time when the company desperately needs such a boost.</P>
      <P>On the foot of the deal the company will receive an equity injection of £175 million from the Government.  I dread to think how much equity the company would have received if Fine Gael or the Progressive Democrats were in Government. The Fine Gael-Progressive Democrats answer to the problems of Aer Lingus is to privatise.  They would not have given Aer Lingus a single penny whereas the Government has put its money where its mouth is and we have lived up to our commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier today the former leader of the Progressive Democrats, Deputy O'Malley, made a feeble attempt to criticise the Labour Party record in regard to Aer Lingus.  I shudder to think what Deputy O'Malley would have recommended for the company if he had a seat at the Cabinet table.  Let there be no doubt about it, he and his ilk would have sold the company down the Swanee.  Deputy O'Malley made a side swipe at the trade union movement and I take grave exception to his remark.  Throughout the last 12 months the Aer Lingus unions have acted responsibly.  Indeed, they were the main driving force in ensuring that the <Col N="498" /> plan was put in place and they deserve the praise and respect of the House.  They do not need cheap, snide remarks from the ex-leader of a moribund party, a party which is not represented here tonight. The Labour Party gave the company a commitment to equity and have delivered on that promise.  We gave a commitment to avoid compulsory redundancy and we have delivered on that promise too. However difficult times may be at the moment, Aer Lingus staff are in no doubt that their greatest friends and their best allies are in the Labour Party.  They are all well aware of how much better off they are faring with a Labour Party in Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is reassuring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;rather than Fine Gael or the Progressive Democrats.  This Bill will put in place the measures that will turn the company around.  I am proud to be a member of a party and of a Government which has stood by Aer Lingus.  However, the Bill requires suitable amendment to ensure full worker participation on the boards of all Aer Lingus subsidiaries.</P>
      <P>The Bill outlines an appointments procedure whereby the Minister for Transport and Communications and the chairman of Aer Lingus will appoint directors to all subsidiaries of the new Aer Lingus group holding company.  In recognition of the sacrifices made by the workers I appeal to the Minister to ensure that there will be strong worker representation on these boards.  The Minister would enhance the stature of the company by providing for worker representation on all the boards of the subsidiary companies.  The workers deserve some gain through increased particiation at board level.  I appeal to the Minister to accept on Committee Stage amendments designed to ensure stronger worker representation on the boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also call on the Minister to ensure that Aer Lingus is not put at any commercial disadvantage by the European Commission. The terms which apply to State equity injections in the case of Air France <Col N="499" /> and Sabena should apply to the Irish Government plan to restructure Aer Lingus by the injection of £175 million in equity.  Any restriction or the threat of any restrictions from the Eurpean Commission on this rescue plan must be strongly resisted and Aer Lingus should be unhindered in developing new routes and new commercial enterprises to ensure its future.  I urge the Minister to make the strongest possible representations to the European Commission to ensure that the company is able to develop these new routes.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to all the people at every level of the company who showed strong commitment to their own company.  The unions, management and workers of Aer Lingus deserve praise for working out an agreement which we sincerely hope will secure the future of the company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Shortall for sharing her time with me.  In the last 12 to 18 months I have seen the most traumatic time ever faced by my constituents during the nearly 21 years I have been in the Dáil.  The progress in the development of our major employer, a company that has returned profits for many years, has been turned upside down by the losses which have taken place. Families have gone through periods of anxiety and despair.  There have been nearly 1,000 redundancies from the parent company.  Despite the establishment of an enterprise development unit, which I hope will be successful, men and women in their fifties have been made redundant with little hope of future employment.  The remaining staff in Aer Lingus have gone through the trauma of coping with major changes in work practices, their income and in their expectation of promotion.  The workers deserve the heartfelt thanks not only of this House but of the nation for what they have done to develop the company and for the sacrifices they have made to keep the company going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill to authorise the injection of £175 million in equity into the company to organise the group's corporate <Col N="500" /> structure and to allow for the employee profit-sharing scheme. However, without the loyal workforce the company will go nowhere.  The loyal workforce voted by a massive majority to accept this tough medicine including redundancies and changes in work practices. They deserve the support of the Government.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that sections 8, 9 and 14 of the Bill do not fully recognise the role and the commitment of the staff, with the watering down of the rights of worker directors, the position of worker directors in the future structure of the company and the right to appointment to the ancillary boards.  After all of their sacrifices the workers' position is not being fully recognised and appreciated. The Minister should reconsider that matter before Committee Stage and I have no doubt he will.  I hope the injection of £175 million is enough.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why we as a small country with a national airline should have to accept the conditions imposed by the EC outlined in its document published in October.  Those conditions are being imposed on Aer Lingus but not on Sabena, Air France or other airlines.  We are unique in that following the opening of the Channel Tunnel we will be the only island nation in the European Community. From an industrial development, commercial and tourism point of view it is important that we have our own State airline.  Aer Lingus is having conditions imposed on it which are not imposed on other European companies.  If that happened to the French they would send a letter to the Commission merely acknowledging its existence and proceed to ignore it.  Aer Lingus want to be treated in a similar manner to other airlines. Why should it be treated differently?</P>
    <P>I do not accept the ruling that no further equity injections can be made in the company.  If the directors, investors and shareholders of British Midland, one of Aer Lingus's main competitors, want to invest money in that company there is no rule which states they cannot do so, but because Aer Lingus is owned by the State <Col N="501" /> the EC claim it can have only one bite of the cherry.  I do not accept that.  Aer Lingus and other State companies should be treated as fairly as those in the private sector and allowance should be made for a further equity injection if it is needed.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to bring politics into the debate, but I could not allow my colleague, Deputy Shortall to speak of the Labour Party as the only friends of Aer Lingus.  In the fifties when Aer Lingus had few friends and the Labour Party was in Government, it was busy selling aeroplanes.  Some of us have long memories.  Prior to the last election the Labour Party promised those in Aer Lingus the sun, the moon and the stars and no redundancies, but Fianna Fáil told them the truth &mdash; that we would inject equity.  This matter is too serious to play politics with and Aer Lingus has had too much politics played with it in the past.  I do not wish to do that tonight, but I do not want Deputy Shortall's comments to go unanswered.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus has been profitable through the history of this State.  Through no fault of its own, it went through a difficult period during the Gulf War when there was a downturn in the world economy. That also affected its ancillaries which had enabled it to operate profitably. As a group it made massive profits and it is not asking a favour from the taxpayers or the EC by allowing it to have an equity injection.  It is only right and proper that we should support Aer Lingus, which returned massive profits to the Irish taxpayer, provided employment and paid taxes for many years.  If one added the taxes and PRSI payments of Aer Lingus employees down through the years, the figure of £175 million would pale into insignificance.  The company and its workers served this country well and will do so again.  I would caution against speedy sale of the ancillaries which have served the company and this country well.  They are a group and should be recognised as such.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus will go from strength to strength in the future, but we should not be ashamed to say that if it requires an injection of equity in the future it will <Col N="502" /> receive it.  We must be prepared to support our own; this company is our own and we should be proud of it.  The staff of Aer Lingus and their families have accepted many sacrifices and should not be left in any doubt as to their future by the imposition of EC conditions.  They must receive our unreserved support. The Minister fought hard for this and I congratulate him in his absence for what he has achieved so far.  He should keep up the fight.  This is a company worthy of our support.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also reconsider the position of worker-directors.  It would be a mistake to ignore the position of workers and the right of the staff to be represented on the various boards in the companies.  The provisions in sections 8, 9 and 14 are a retrograde step and the Minister should reconsider the matter.</P>
    <P>In general, I welcome the Bill as a major step forward.  I congratulate the Minister on his achievements and, please God, we will see Aer Lingus and its shamrock flying high and profitably for many years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Nevertheless, I am sure I will be forgiven for reminding the House that this is a political arena in which it is no harm to reflect occasionally on how politics work.  I smiled when I heard a number of speakers from the Government side criticising Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats for allegedly suggesting privatisation for Aer Lingus when in fact we suggested a partner.  It is rather cynical that this should be mentioned now, given that the only partner that 1,000 of the workforce in Aer Lingus will have tonight is the dole queue.  That is a very serious reflection on what was said by a number of speakers in this House in this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="503" /> When one considers a partnership one normally considers taking somebody on board who will add to the company and as a result make it stronger, bigger, better and more efficient.  That is what a partnership means.  Amazingly, and for some unknown reason with remarkably little negative criticism, that has been transformed into a partnership with social welfare. A total of 1,000 of the workforce of Aer Lingus have been unloaded onto the Minister for Social Welfare.  That is a far cry from what was told to many of those people prior to the general election and repeatedly during recent years when it was clearly stated that the only people Aer Lingus or any such company could look to for a secure future was the Labour Party and perhaps Fianna Fáil.  It is ironic that those two parties should now be in Government busily jockeying and ushering 1,000 of that workforce into the redundancy market.  That is rather peculiar, especially as some of those people suggest that those who requested a partnership were in some way disloyal.</P>
    <P>Surveys highlight that public confidence in politicians has waned in recent years, one of the main reasons being that politicians no longer do what they say they will do.  It is particularly relevant to note that this is more noticeable when one compares what politicians say before an election with what they propose to do after an election.</P>
    <P>The 1,000 people who have lost their jobs must be reflecting in their homes tonight in north County Dublin, north County Kildare, south County Meath and other areas on what they were promised.  I wonder what answer they would give if they were asked in a survey whether they have confidence in politicians and their promises.  Based on their experiences I have no doubt they would say they have little confidence in politicians. It is grossly unfair of Government politicians, having made false promises which they had no intention of keeping and which they knew they could not keep, to point the finger at the Opposition parties and attempt to blame them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="504" /> Will the public listen to these people in the future and accept their promises or will they ask serious questions?  Instead of asking politicians during election campaigns what they will do for them, will they ask a more relevant question such as whether they will stand by their promises and fulfil their obligations?  The public have lost a great deal of confidence in politicians and the sooner the better we recognise that this shadow boxing and showmanship serves no useful purpose for the Members of this House and for those who have to reap the bitter rewards of the false promises made by politicians.</P>

Indeed, we thought there would scarcely be an organisation in the country which would not have been given the paltry sum of £175 million that is now being given to Aer Lingus.  I expected the billions of pounds to be stretched to cover every <Col N="506" /> sector of transport and, indeed, every other service also, and that we would not now be talking about the paltry sum of £175 million for Aer Lingus.

Some months ago in this House I predicted that our once proud national airline would be dismantled and I was not too far wrong. This package was known as the Cahill plan when no one on the opposite side of the House wanted it; it was as if a villain of the piece was brought in to take responsibility.  Now they are supportive because they have been told that is all Aer Lingus is getting and the two great parties can do no more.  This is a sad state of affairs.</P>

    <P>If the national airline is to be viable, vibrant and able to face competition it will have to transport the entire population of the country in and out as fast as it can and to as many destinations as <Col N="507" /> possible.  It is obvious therefore that it will have to seek an outside partner.  My party has been advocating this for a number of years.  If we look at the profit and loss graphs for Aer Lingus we will see that group profits of £28 million for the year ending 31 March 1990 have been translated into losses of £188 million, including restructuring costs, for the year ending 31 March 1993.  It must have been obvious that there was a downward trend and it would have been pertinent to say that we should look at the matter before it got worse.  This did not happen.  Instead disaster struck and there was a crisis, with the result that the Government said that 1,000 members of the workforce would have to go on the dole.  That is the Christmas box for the workers in Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>In recent times various world financiers have had their eye on subsidiaries of Aer Lingus.  The Government has denied that there is any intention to sell any part of them.  This rings hollow to the 1,000 workers in Aer Lingus who have been made redundant.  We do not know what is going to happen to any of its subsidiaries at this stage.  I am sure the Minister and the members of the Fianna Fáil Party would like to know the answer.  I am sure the Members of the Labour Party who are not now evident in the House would like to know also.  I am quite sure, too, that the remaining workforce in Aer Lingus would like to know all of these things.  Unfortunately, we have taken dramatic action when it is too late, when a little action at an earlier stage could have resulted in a much better restructuring of the company with the retention of many more jobs and a much expanded radius within which our airline could operate.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to competition. Nobody can expect to be in business in the future without being up against competition, but it must be fair competition. The Ryanair employees have written to most Deputies pointing out that their company has survived against competition without any great assistance.  I hope it is not the object of the Government <Col N="508" /> parties to see them out of business with a view to doing something else.  That would not prove anything, because if Ryanair are put out of business the competition will be provided by another much more powerful company and we must recognise that.</P>
    <P>A number of other speakers referred to the European Union approval or lack of approval of a package of this nature. We are an island nation.  We depend on transport.  The Minister referred to an integrated transport policy, for which some of us have been asking for a long time.  I do not know what the Minister means by an integrated transport policy. The revitalisation of Aer Lingus does not sound to me like an invigorating process. Therefore I am not too sure what the Government means.  If it means that the transport policy on air, sea or road puts us in touch with the rest of Europe and the rest of the world in such a way that we can compete throughout Europe, then it will be successful.  But if we think we can remain in a little cocoon of our own and isolate ourselves from outside competition, then we are wasting our time.</P>
    <P>I strongly support the idea of worker participation.  It is desirable and necessary to obtain maximum worker participation in any company of that nature in the future, particularly a company likely to face stiff competition in the years to come.  I hope my worst fears are not realised.  I hope that in a few years' time somebody does not have to salvage what remains of Aer Lingus when this Government has finished.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would first like to thank all Deputies who contributed to this debate for the very constructive manner in which they have approached it.  There is a temptation in debates such as this to score cheap political points against various parties <Col N="509" /> involved and particularly the Government. I am grateful that no Deputies succumbed to this temptation.  The level of contribution to the debate so far has been not only constructive but incisive.  I wish to continue in this vein and will attempt to address the substantive and legitimate queries which Deputies have raised.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan and other Deputies raised the issue of EU Commission approval.  Let me clear up a point of confusion about an important principle. This Bill is not subject to EU Commission approval, so the question of sovereignty does not arise.  What is subject to approval is the Government's investment in Aer Lingus under the State aid rules of the Treaty of Rome.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley asked why the Strategy for the Future, which formed the basis of the Government application to the EU, has not been published yet.  This was a confidential report prepared for me, containing much commercially sensitive information.  I did make available to Members of the Oireachtas a briefing document on the strategy.  I can assure the House that there is nothing sinister in the non-publication of the report; it is merely to protect the interests of Aer Lingus.</P>
      <P>Deputies O'Malley and Sargent raised the issue of blame for the present situation in Aer Lingus.  It is not my practice to apportion blame.  I prefer to start from where we are and go on from there. However, whatever about management deficiencies, I feel it incumbent on me to put on the record of this House that the company also had bad luck.  Deputy Haughey correctly and relevantly raised the issue of GPA.  The collapse in this company's share price wiped £113 million off the Aer Lingus balance sheet.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley queried the delay in the Commission reaching its decision on the Government's investment in Aer Lingus.  There has not been a delay.  On the contrary, the whole procedure has been fast-tracked from day one, with the result that I believe it will be the speediest State aid case of its type.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Owen and others queried the <Col N="510" /> type of conditions that the Commission might impose.  My officials have had numerous meetings with the Commission. I have also been extensively involved.  I have met Commissioner Matutes on three occasions in the past two weeks alone.  We are doing everything to ensure that the Aer Lingus case is treated properly and in a fair and reasonable manner.</P>
    <P>On the question of conditionality, it should be remembered that the Government's investment in Aer Lingus is the first State aid case to be considered by the Commission since full liberalisation of European Union air transport came into effect on 1 January 1993.  It is also untrue to suggest that no conditions were attached in previous state aid cases in the air transport sector.  For example, Iberia had to give an undertaking not to acquire additional capacity in Europe, while in the case of Sabena the Government had to give an assurance not to give preferential treatment to the airline at Belgian airports.  I could give other examples if time permitted and I would be pleased to provide additional information to any Deputy who wants it.</P>
    <P>Finally, on this point, I have to take issue with Deputy Gilmore's allegation that the Government prevented Aer Lingus management from lobbying the Commission.  The opposite is the case. We not only positively facilitated Aer Lingus management in this but actually arranged specific meetings for them.</P>
    <P>Deputies Noonan and Gilmore raised the issue of the level of equity given to staff in certain US airline rescue packages in contrast, they claim, to the employee share participation agreement negotiated in Aer Lingus.  I would simply make the point that in none of these cases did the airlines concerned benefit from Government equity investment.  There are other significant differences which I do not have time to go into.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan also raised the issue of the subsidiaries of Aer Lingus and in particular TEAM.  Other Deputies raised similar concerns.  The Strategy for the Future was quite explicit on TEAM.  Like the airline itself, it must reduce its costs <Col N="511" /> if it is to have a viable future.  The workers in TEAM have in the past shown their willingness to adapt to changes in the market place.  I am confident that they will do so again and thus ensure the future of the company, which provides very highly skilled and well paid jobs for the north Dublin area.  This is an area to which the Government is as committed as any other party in this House.</P>
    <P>Both Deputies Owen and Noonan referred to outsourcing.  This is an emotive issue which inevitably evokes emotive and ideological responses.  I am not in that game.  My philosophy and that of the Government is pragmatism and flexibility for the creation and maintenance of jobs in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I am on the record of this House on many occasions as stating that the £50 million reductions proposed in the Aer Lingus plan were not cast in stone.  The bottom line was and is that £50 million in cost reductions had to be taken out of the company.  How that was to be done was a matter for negotiation by the trade unions and Aer Lingus management.  I gave them the flexibility to negotiate. Within this flexibility, both sides reached agreement on cost reductions in the areas of catering, baggage handling and cleaning services.  So the question of outsourcing does not arise.  The Government endorsed these agreements.  Contrary to what has been implied, neither party in this Government had any ideological commitment to outsourcing.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley raised the question of whether the operating structures below the holding company would be divisions or separate companies.  They will be four separate stand-alone companies. This will ensure greater transparency between the operations of the companies.  It will also ensure against cross-subsidisation to which a number of Deputies referred tonight.</P>
    <P>I would like to comment on another point made by Deputy O'Malley.  He said that the Government's equity investment of £175 million is to pay for past losses. That is not correct.  The purpose of the investment is to assist Aer Lingus's <Col N="512" /> restructuring programme mainly by restoring the company's balance sheet through a reduction in debt, no part of which will be used, as suggested by Deputy Yates, to drive Ryanair out of business.</P>
    <P>I join Deputies who specifically praised a number of members of the trade union movement.  I would like to put on record that there were many other trade union officials, not named tonight, who contributed to the successful outcome. They should be complimented also as should the new management team in Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies raised the issue of alliances.  With the progressive liberalisation of the airline industry worldwide many airlines with relatively small domestic markets, such as Aer Lingus, have sought alliances with stronger cariers or groups of carriers.  In some cases, these involve cross-shareholdings while in other cases alliances are confined to marketing arrangements.  In considering proposals for the future development of Aer Lingus, the board of the company will no doubt wish to consider alliances. The proposed form of any such alliance is a matter, in the first instance for the board of Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>Let me put on the record of the House our position.  The Government has in the past encouraged and will continue to encourage Aer Lingus to develop strategic alliances.  We will seriously consider, on their merits, all proposals from Aer Lingus for such alliances, including cross-shareholding agreements and additional equity investments, if these are judged to be in the best interests of the company.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus has just come through the most traumatic year in its history.  It has faced the worst financial crisis and has had to take the toughest decisions since its foundation.  However, all the main stakeholders in our national airline, that is, the employees, the board, management and the Government as a shareholder, have all faced up to the challenge with courage and determination.  We have taken the measures necessary, however painful, to ensure that Aer <Col N="513" /> Lingus not only has a past that we, the Irish people, are proud of but it was the capability also of having a future in which we can take equal pride.  That future must be based clearly on competitive commercial success.</P>
    <P>The new year will signal the start of a new era for Aer Lingus.  It will be a slimmer, fitter Aer Lingus but one which will show the shamrock, if not the flag to which Deputy Noonan referred.</P>
    <P>The collective courage and commitment to the future of the company that has been evident over the past few months must not be allowed to wane. We must harness those qualities, because with them Aer Lingus can achieve that competitive commercial success which, as I have already said, is so vital and which will make all the hard work and sacrifices of this year worthwhile.  Let me avail of this opportunity to again pay tribute to all involved in reaching the stage we are at here tonight.  Management and unions have worked long and hard to reach agreement on the cost cutting measures which are a necessary part of the &ldquo;Strategy for the Future&rdquo;. The Labour Relations Commission, the adjudication tribunal and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions all had a vital role to play and I thank them for it.  So, too, have my officials as Deputy Owen graciously acknowledged and which I acknowledge tonight.</P>
    <P>This Bill copperfastens the Government's commitment to the commercial future of Aer Lingus.  We have said at all times that we were prepared to play our part, once the necessary decisions had been taken by management and the workforce.  We are now making our contribution.</P>
    <P>In the Government's view, Ireland's geographic location within Europe and the international trading and tourism needs of our economy require that we have at least one substantive, domestically based and financially viable airline capable of competing in international air transport markets.  Ireland also needs <Col N="514" /> a critical mass of domestic aviation activity in the country if it is to attract new aviation-related industries to locate here.  Aer Lingus has provided this critical mass for most of the last 50 years.  It is the Government's intention that this will continue.  This Bill, when passed by the Oireachtas, will be the first and most significant step in ensuring that it does.</P>
    <P>In that regard I thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate.  Their contributions were constructive and incisive in regard to the issues that face the company.  The Bill provides a restructuring corporate framework which, subject to EU approval, will in the first instance allow an equity injection to be made to the company, which forms part of an overall plan for its future economic viability.  It is the beginning and not the end.  The corporate culture of the company must be such as to face the competitive challenges that a liberalised air transport sector now presents for all carriers, be they private or State owned.  We can look forward to a detailed Committee Stage debate when all the issues and further detailed queries of Members from all sides will be teased out.  They have shown a great interest in this matter during the many months it was deliberated on in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  We will have a further opportunity to tease out other issues which will concern Deputies as we proceed to pass this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: <Col N="515" /> That Dáil Éireann approves the terms of the Basel Convention on the control of transboundary movements of hazardous wastes and their disposal, copies of which were laid before Dáil Éireann on 30 November 1993.</P>
      <P>The Basel Convention was agreed under the auspices of the United Nations Environment Programme in 1989.  The convention, which was signed by Ireland in January 1990, represents an important global agreement for the regulation of waste movements, particularly between the developed and the developing world.</P>
      <P>Ireland has been anxious to complete its ratification of the Basel Convention, which came into operation in May 1992. However, regulation of waste movements within the European Union was already the subject of a number of complex Directives.  The view taken by the European Commission was that this complexity of existing union laws, and the integrity of the internal market, effectively required participation by EU member states in the Basel Convention to be supported by a new regulation.</P>
      <P>Drafting and agreement of this regulation were protracted and have delayed ratification of the Convention by Ireland and most other member states beyond our earlier expectations.  The earliest date by which the Convention can be ratified, consistently with the EU Regulations, is 6 February 1994.  This motion is presented at this time so that Ireland's instruments of ratification can be deposited at this earliest possible date.</P>
      <P>The generation of hazardous wastes has been a major, and an environmentally problematic, consequence of industrial development.  Most such wastes come from industries that are among the most important to the growth and maintenance of a modern industrial society, such as iron and steel, non-ferrous metals and the chemical industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we do not have a legacy of heavy industrialisation, Ireland is nevertheless a modern economy with a wide range of <Col N="516" /> manufacturing industry, including food production and the chemical and pharmaceutical sectors.  We produce a range of hazardous wastes, currently amounting to more than 66,000 tonnes per annum.</P>
    <P>Current Irish policy in relation to hazardous wastes rests on the strict enforcement of relevant EC and national legislation, in accordance with special waste management plans prepared by local authorities.  There is already in place a range of regulations dealing with different aspects of waste management, namely general waste controls, toxic and dangerous waste controls, trans-frontier shipment of hazardous wastes, and controls relating to the management of specific hazardous wastes, for example, waste oils, polychlorinated biphenyls or PCB's, and asbestos.</P>
    <P>The Government accepts, however, that Irish waste legislation needs to be developed on an even more comprehensive and systematic basis.  It has recently approved my proposals for a waste Bill and this is now being drafted as a matter of urgency.  Other important aspects of national waste policy are also being developed.  My Department is at present engaged in a public consultation process with regard to waste prevention and promotion of clean technologies, the development of a national recycling strategy and of course the management of hazardous wastes.  The Environmental Protection Agency is also being mobilised and I intend that in time the agency will play a major role in relation to hazardous waste management.</P>
    <P>On the most recent completed statistics, Ireland generates some 66,000 tonnes of hazardous waste annually. Some 54,000 tonnes, equivalent to more than 80 per cent, is dealt with domestically, mostly by way of recycling.  We rely however on export in relation to about 18 per cent, or 12,000 tonnes of our most difficult hazardous wastes, most of which are either incinerated or recovered at approved and well regulated <Col N="517" /> facilities in Finland, the UK and Belgium.  Considerable incineration of hazardous wastes takes place at a number of in-house incinerators attached to Irish industrial plants: in fact about two-thirds of all Irish hazardous wastes destined for incineration is disposed of at Irish plants. Two further points are worth noting. According to OECD data, apart from Luxembourg.  Ireland generates the lowest volume of hazardous wastes in Western Europe.  The second point is that not even the most environmentally advanced European countries are totally self-sufficient in waste recovery and disposal; for instance, Austria, Switzerland, Denmark and the Netherlands export, respectively, 17 per cent, 23 per cent, 12 per cent and 13 per cent of their national hazardous waste arising for recovery or disposal abroad.</P>
    <P>There are of course aspects of hazardous waste management with which I am not satisfied.  I have already been frank and open on this point.  Hazardous waste planning, currently the responsibility of local authorities, requires improvement.  Facilities for the segregation and disposal of some specific types of wastes &mdash; for example, certain lights and batteries &mdash; are inadequate. Waste statistics are not fully up to date or satisfactory in terms of coverage.  These deficiencies must be addressed in the context of the various legislative organisational and infrastructural initiatives now under way.  They must not however detract from a number of well managed and creditable aspects of Irish hazardous waste management which I have also described.</P>
    <P>Estimates of the growing volume of hazardous wastes generated worldwide are difficult to determine, but range from 350 million to 400 million tonnes per annum upwards.  It is estimated that the European Union generates some 30 to 35 million tonnes of hazardous wastes annually.  As waste has increased, so has the transboundary movement of these wastes.  Over the past decade, in response <Col N="518" /> to growing concerns, there have been a number of international or regional initiatives to control movement of hazardous wastes.</P>
    <P>When the European Community began legislating on waste in 1975, there was no international regime controlling cross-border movements of waste, apart from some international regulations dealing with transport safety.  Primarily in an attempt to control the considerable volume of waste moved internally within the Community, and in the wake of the 1982 scandal over waste missing from Seveso, Council Directive 84/361/EEC, usually know as the Transfrontier Directive, introduced a harmonised system for control of waste movements within, into and out of the EC.  This Directive represented a significant legislative advance in so far as it introduced a system of pre-notification to the authorities in a receiving member state so that a prior informed judgment could be made as to whether a waste consignment was acceptable. This concept has been carried through into all subsequent international measures to properly control transboundary waste movements.</P>
    <P>In a wider international forum, the OECD, between 1983 and 1990, adopted a number of decisions on transfrontier movements of hazardous wastes, though these were overtaken by the preparatory work on the Basel Convention which began in 1987.</P>
    <P>Controls on the movement and disposal of hazardous wastes was not of course an issue just for the developed world.  With the continuing export of many waste problems to the developing world, opposition to unregulated waste movements grew also from within many developing countries.  The 1989 Fourth Lomé Convention between the European Community and African, Caribbean and Pacific countries provided for a ban on EC exports of hazardous and radioactive wastes to ACP countries, and an equivalent ban on imports by those countries.  However, both the EC and <Col N="519" /> ACP regimes were in the nature of regional agreements.  By the late 1980s, the transfrontier movement of hazardous wastes was rightly perceived as a global issue, requiring the development of stricter controls on a worldwide basis.</P>
    <P>The Basel Convention, developed under the auspices of the United Nations Environment Programme, was designed to provide this global response.  The Basel Convention is intended to reduce transboundary movements of hazardous wastes to a minimum, consistent with their environmentally sound management; prevent and minimise the generation of hazardous wastes; support movement towards national self-sufficiency in hazardous waste disposal; establish the sovereign right of every country to ban the import of hazardous wastes; prevent trade in hazardous waste to or from a non-party state unless the movement is regulated by an agreement which stipulates provisions no less environmentally acceptable than those provided by the convention; and ensure the environmentally sound disposal of hazardous wastes.</P>
    <P>Central to the Basel Convention is a procedure of prior informed written consent as a condition for hazardous waste export.  An importing state must be notified of a proposed movement and of the site where such waste will be treated. The waste cannot be exported until the importing state has given its written consent. The importing state can reject the proposed consignment if it believes that the stated treatment and disposal facilities are not suitable.  If a waste shipment cannot be disposed of according to the original agreement, or in an alternative environmentally sound way, the exporting state is required to re-import the waste.  Any movement of waste that does not conform to the convention is regarded as illegal traffic, which must be prevented and sanctioned under the domestic legislation of contracting states. Parties are also free to make more stringent <Col N="520" /> bilateral or multilateral agreements on hazardous waste movements.</P>
    <P>The convention recognises that control and regulatory procedures are not of themselves sufficient.  The development of national technical and legal infrastructures in developing countries needs to be undertaken, along with measures to enhance training, education and public awareness.  Parties are requested to cooperate in technology and information exchange in relation to good waste management; the convention recognises that developed countries have a particular responsibility to developing countries in this respect and provides for appropriate funding mechanisms.</P>
    <P>From the outset Ireland has supported the Basel Convention and pressed for the early introduction by the European Union of the necessary enabling legislation so that all member states of the Union could give full effect to the convention. The delay in EU ratification, which has attracted justified criticism, has been largely due to the technical complexity of preparing the necessary EU legislation in a manner that respects the requirements of both the convention and the internal market.  The relevant Council Regulation, No. 259/93, published in February 1993, has now been adopted and there is political agreement that the European Union and member states should ratify the Basel Convention at the earliest date consistent with this regulation, that is, 6 February 1994.  The convention would come into force within the Union a whole three months after this date, that is, from 6 May 1994, the date on which the EU regulation enters into force.</P>
    <P>This EU regulation is, as such, directly applicable in all member states; in principle, further transposition into national legislation is not required.  However, in order to ensure full effect for the regulation, I intend to make limited national regulations dealing with consequential matters such as designation of competent authorities, powers of enforcement and <Col N="521" /> penalties.  These regulations will be in place well before 6 May 1994.</P>
    <P>As I have stated, Ireland fully supports the principles involved in the Basel Convention and the related EU regulation and no special difficulties are envisaged with regard to their implementation.  I have already spoken of various policy initiatives already taken or under way to improve hazardous waste management in Ireland.  National infrastructural requirements will be addressed in the context of the operational programme for environmental services now being prepared.  In addition, Trinity College, Dublin, in conjunction with my Department, will hold a public conference on hazardous waste management options early next month with a view to informing public debate on these issues.</P>
    <P>Whatever the final decision of the Government on the provision of appropriate hazardous waste infrastructure in Ireland, it will continue to be necessary to export hazardous wastes from Ireland in the short to medium term.  It will also be necessary for Ireland to export certain hazardous wastes on an indefinite basis&mdash; for example, polychlorinated biphenyls, PCBs and certain heavy metals which require highly specialised final disposal facilities.  This is a legitimate and responsible practice which is consistent with the terms of both the Basel Convention and EU Regulation 259/93.</P>
    <P>The convention specifically provides for the transboundary movement of hazardous wastes if the state of export does not have the necessary facilities, capacity or suitable disposal sites in order to properly dispose of the wastes in question, subject of course to their eventual disposal in an environmentally sound manner.</P>
    <P>This provision is also reflected in the EU legislation.  This empowers member states to take measures to prohibit generally or partially, or to object systematically to shipments of waste, in order to implement the principles of proximity, priority for recovery and self-sufficiency <Col N="522" /> at Union and national levels. However, the regulation explicitly provides that these provisions do not apply in a case where hazardous waste is produced in a member state in such a small overall quantity that the provision of new specialised disposal installations within that state would be uneconomic.  I might add that this provision is of direct consequence not only to Ireland but also to Luxembourg, Portugal and Greece.</P>
    <P>Obviously, we cannot rule out the possibility that, in light of political or other developments in receiving countries, other member states of the EU may wish to curtail imports of hazardous wastes from Ireland.  Ultimately, however, I believe that the regulation provides a fair framework with adequate safeguards for our interests.</P>
    <P>Questions have been raised as to whether the Basel Convention and the EU regulation go far enough in protecting developing countries from waste trafficking.  The regulation actually goes beyond the convention in the restrictions it imposes on waste exports.  EU exports for disposal are limited to EFTA countries, which are also parties to the convention, while exports for recovery are limited to OECD countries and to other countries with which there are appropriate bilateral, multilateral or regional agreements.  All exports to the 69 ACP countries are prohibited, in accordance with the Lomé Convention.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding this more stringent regime, there has been criticism of the EU approach on the basis that it should go further and prohibit all exports of hazardous wastes from member states to developing countries, as well as pressing for an appropriate amendment of the Basel Convention to extend this prohibition to all other developed countries. I have considerable sympathy with the concerns which have been expressed. The European Commission is currently considering the possibilities for such an absolute prohibition and Ireland is prepared <Col N="523" /> to support any appropriate initiative for EU action in this regard.</P>
    <P>The motion comes before this House because of the requirements of Article 29.5.2º of the Constitution, under which the State shall not be bound by any international agreement involving a charge on public funds unless the terms of the agreement have been approved by Dáil Éireann.  Ireland, as a signatory of the Basel Convention, has for some years made a voluntary annual contribution towards the convention budget.  This year's Environment Vote contains a provision of £5,000 for this purpose.  Similar annual contributions will in future arise on a mandatory basis.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I know that the House will share my view of the importance of the Basel Convention as a major first step on the global control of transboundary movements of hazardous wastes and their disposal.  It is urgent that we ratify the convention in February 1994 along with other member states of the European Union and, with the approval of the House, we will be in a position to do this.</P>
    <P>I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting to note that the only reason we have an opportunity to discuss the Basel Convention is because Article 29.5.2º of our Constitution provides that the State shall not be bound by any international agreement involving a charge on public funds unless the terms of the agreement have been approved by Dáil Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened carefully to the Minister's speech.  As our time is limited I will refer briefly to a few points.  Towards the end of his speech the Minister referred specifically to possible stricter controls on exports of waste to developing countries. It has been argued for some time that we should not speak in terms of developed versus developing countries in the context of this convention but rather that we should talk in terms of OECD versus non-OECD countries and that our <Col N="524" /> responsbility in regard to non-OECD countries should be particularly guarded. I am thinking in particular of what we used to call the Soviet bloc, or Eastern European countries, given their proximity to continental Europe; they form part of the same land mass.  Concern has been expressed in many quarters that the lack of environmental awareness in Eastern European countries for many years could mean that these countries will agree, for economic reasons, to take much of the hazardous waste from OECD countries and that perhaps they may not be in the best position to impose environmentally sound practices in terms of its recycling or disposal.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that this convention should be ratified by Ireland as soon as possible.  I think that at one stage people were afraid that we would have to wait first for the ratification of the convention by the European Commission before we could ratify it, but this is not the case. To date, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium and Portugal have ratified the convention.  As the Minister said, if Ireland did not ratify the convention before the end of December, technically speaking we would not be voting members at the meeting to be held in Geneva at the end of March; but if we deposit our ratification prior to March, we will add significant weight to our presence at that meeting.</P>
    <P>In regard to the extension of the prohibition on the export of hazardous waste from member states to developing countries, the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>The European Commission is currently considering the possibilities for such an absolute prohibition and Ireland is prepared to support any appropriate initiative for EU action in this regard.</P>
    <P>Why should we always follow on the coat tails of other countries, particularly in areas where we obviously have support? The fact that we are prepared to support an appropriate initiative means that we <Col N="525" /> must agree with the thrust of the point the Minister has made in terms of respecting the position of non OECD countries in this regard.</P>
    <P>Could we lead the way on this environmental initiative and not simply support an initiative by another country?  Denmark, for example, is prepared to make the appropriate initiative for EU action in this regard but rather than saying in a month or six months or two years time that we support the case being made by Denmark, I would like the Minister to lead the charge.  There is little on which we can dictate the pace in Europe because of the critical mass of our country as part of the European Union and various other reasons of peripherality and our GDP.  We are there with the begging bowl and we look to Europe to help us often enough.  There are few areas where we can lead in Europe, but environmental practice is one area where we could lead.</P>
    <P>Given the Minister's tacit support for the case being made in this regard I would ask him not simply to support an initiative by another Community country but to promote that initiative.  I can assure the Minister of support from Fine Gael.  I ask him to take an active role with Denmark and the vast majority of non OECD countries in support of a full hazardous waste export ban from OECD to non OECD countries, which is effectively what we are talking about.</P>
    <P>We should take the position that the term &ldquo;developing countries&rdquo; means little following the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Berlin Wall.  Some of the most devastated economies are those in the new republics of the former Eastern Bloc.  These countries are normally not considered developing but they must be included in this ban.  That is why the language of OECD or non OECD is important if we wish to be in solidarity with the desire of these countries not to be a dumping ground for massive amounts of hazardous waste from the west or from OECD countries generally. <Col N="526" /> One of the most important points the Minister made was that we are prepared to support an appropriate initiative in this area.  He should take that initiative and get the other countries to support us. We should lead the way in this most important area.</P>
    <P>The whole political opposition in Eastern Europe in the eighties, as the Minister is probably aware, was in part environmentally driven.  We are inclined to forget that.  The upsurge in political opposition there signalled the beginning of a new political and economic era which culminated in the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.  One socialist regime after another was toppled, to be replaced by democratic governments.  With these political winds of change came a parallel commitment to capitalist free market economies. Progress in the path towards a free market has, however, been hampered by many of the historical structural problems of the centrally managed Eastern European economies.  In particular, the pressure for rapid industrialisation overrode concerns for environmental protection and resulted in a legacy of pollution that will haunt the region for many years to come.</P>
    <P>The need to tackle these environmental problems head on is all the more pressing because they serve as a barrier to future industrial and economic expansion. Investors generally, concerned about substantial environmental liabilities, are wary of developing or acquiring business interests in these Eastern European countries.  The massive costs of remedying historical contamination, redressing current pollution and preventing further environmental risk places a huge burden on these emerging Eastern European economies, a burden which they can ill afford to bear.</P>
    <P>The creation of a modern industrial economy requires the development of an integrated network of facilities for the proper management and disposal of solid and industrial waste.  Eastern European states, with an eye to the wider European <Col N="527" /> economic and political enlargement, are conscious of the need to move closer to adopting Eastern Community environmental standards.  This will represent a quantum leap in investment which could prove difficult to find when there are so many competing demands for funds.</P>
    <P>In addition to the need for access to capital there is a more general question of access to environmental technologies and expertise from these countries. Modern, well designed specialist treatment and disposal facilities are increasingly more technologically sophisticated and require highly trained operating personnel. They are also expensive.  A new hazardous waste landfill facility, for example, may cost more than $1 million per hectare to develop.  A modern waste to energy plant may cost in excess of $100 million.  Technology can be purchased at a price but it is not simply a matter of technology transfer; it also involves the long term commitment to managing and operating plants safely and efficiently. Qualified local employees skilled in the most advanced techniques and operating procedures are paramount to the success of any such project.  Such workers are still predominantly concentrated in the western European and US environmental services sector.</P>
    <P>The key to the success generally of ensuring that these facilities are provided in non OECD countries or the eastern part of Europe depends on many fundamental criteria being met.  First, private sector environmental service companies are concerned about the long term political and economic stability, the legal and administrative certainty and achieving adequate returns on investment. However, even more importantly, it is essential for government at all levels to acknowledge and assess fully the extent of environmental pollution problems. This may appear self-evident but it is often apparently overlooked.  Without having determined as accurately as possible waste generation rates, and 60 to 70 <Col N="528" /> per cent of the waste may be produced by less than 10 per cent of industry, as well as the nature of the current disposal practices, it is almost impossible to evaluate properly infrastructural needs or begin effectively to regulate and control waste. It is senseless to construct a highly expensive hazardous treatment or disposal plant if the quantity of waste produced does not exist to justify this major investment.</P>
    <P>Ratifying the Convention before us will not preclude Ireland, Portugal, Spain and some of the other smaller countries from continuing to have agreements to export our hazardous waste for treatment or recovery in one form or another.  It is essential that we make this quite clear. We will shortly have a major waste Bill before the House for debate.  I ask the Minister, whatever his views in regard to incineration of toxic waste and hazardous waste generally, to bear in mind the important point that if we comply with the regulations requiring the reduction in hazardous waste by cleaner technologies in industry generally, each year over the next 20 years we will be producing less toxic and hazardous waste.  I do not see us reaching the point where we produce no waste &mdash; I would be delighted to be proved wrong in that regard &mdash; but given that we can assume there will be some amount of hazardous or toxic waste to be disposed of, I ask the Minister not to pursue the location of a toxic waste incinerator in our country as long as adequate and environmentally sound disposal facilities exist within easy reach, preferably within the OECD countries.  If the amount of waste we produce is not enough to make an incinerator economically sound, short cuts will operate and the environment will be the loser.</P>
    <P>Our only chance of ensuring the disposal of toxic and hazardous waste, particularly by incineration, and of ensuring that the best environmentally-sound principles are met at all times, will be to ensure that the amount of waste going <Col N="529" /> into any such incinerator would render that operation economically viable. There is really no need for a small country like Ireland to embark on the construction of a toxic or hazardous waste incinerator given the quantities we now produce, or are likely to produce, in the short and medium term.  Many minds would be put at ease if the Minister could accept that point.  I think the Minister is half way there in terms of the following remark he made in the course of his speech:</P>
    <P>However, the regulation explicitly provides that these provisions do not apply in a case where hazardous waste is produced in a member state in such a small overall quantity that the provision of new specialised disposal installations within that state would be uneconomic.</P>
    <P>A toxic or hazardous waste incinerator in Ireland would most definitely be uneconomic, apart from the arguments the Minister will hear from all other quarters in relation to the location of same here. He added that this provision is of direct consequence not only to Ireland but also Luxembourg, Portugal and Greece.  I ask him seriously to consider his own words before embarking on the location of a toxic waste incinerator here.</P>
    <P>It goes without saying that I welcome the convention.  I do not want to repeat what the Minister said, but I note that under Article 3.1, as a contracting party we will be notifying the secretariat of the convention of any wastes other than those listed in Annexes I and II considered or defined as hazardous under our legislation or any special requirements concerning transboundary movement procedures of such wastes in our country.  Perhaps the Minister could indicate whether we are likely to produce wastes other than those listed in Annexes I and II and whether any particular requirements will be requested of Ireland by the secretariat.</P>
    <P>Do we actually know the quantity of hazardous waste produced in this country? On what basis did the Minister provide the figures?  We do not even know <Col N="530" /> the quantity of municipal waste produced. We have figures from 1986 produced by An Foras Forbartha, published in 1987.  By making an educated guess in terms of the increased amount each year, 3 to 4 per cent, and looking at what has happened in the United Kingdom and in Europe generally, we arrive at a figure for municipal waste. Has the Minister compiled figures on hazardous waste and, if so, on what basis? Is he sure all figures are being returned to his Department?  I am quite sure they are not.  Is there any movement of waste in our country which could constitute illegal traffic &mdash; to use the terminology of the convention before us &mdash; once this motion has been passed and the convention ratified?  Could some operations, at present legal, be out of order once this convention is ratified?</P>
    <P>When we talk about disposal of waste generally what must be uppermost in our minds is environmentally sound management of hazardous waste practices. The Minister referred to regulations or legislation to follow this convention, to define competent authority, penalties and other issues.  Would a local authority be a competent authority?  Would a local authority in Ireland be in order in coming to an agreement with a local authority in the United Kingdom, or a local authority in Spain, to take hazardous or toxic waste produced in that country?  Could such competent authorities enter into arrangements without any reference to their national Government or national Department of the Environment?</P>
    <P>To our shame, local authorities in Wexford, Kildare, Carlow and Wicklow have yet to produce the waste management plans that have been required of us for some time.  Yet in the 1994 Estimates the local authority in Wexford has failed to include moneys to compile that waste management plan.  We have a serious financial problem but we have yet to comply with even that minimal requirement.  I would understand if the Minister felt it necessary to bring a requirement in that area to the attention of those local authorities.</P>
    <P>In replying I should like the Minister to <Col N="531" /> indicate where stands the Environmental Protection Agency <i>vis-à-vis</i> this convention and to say whether all the functions under this convention will be transferred to the Environmental Protection Agency.  We should remember that the provisions of the Environmental Protection Agency Act brought certain waste disposal operations, including hazardous and hospital waste incineration, within the scope of integrated pollution control to be operated by the agency. However, any licensing by the Environmental Protection Agency will be done on a BATNEEC basis.  I am worried that the phrase &ldquo;not entailing excessive costs&rdquo;, would allow an &ldquo;out&rdquo; in terms of many of the requirements that could be placed on industry generally.  The Minister's response to that might be in order.</P>
    <P>Waste management is no longer just about ensuring that human health is not endangered.  Waste disposal can contaminate land, ground and surface water and the atmosphere.  Anything we as legislators can do to ensure that developing economies do not sacrifice sound environmental principles must be supported.</P>
    <P>I support the convention.  There are many questions that need to be asked, particularly in terms of how its provisions will impact on Ireland.  I look forward to the Minister's response.</P>

Níl aon dabht ann ach go bhfuil gá lena leithéid de rialacha; is fada an lá ó tosaíodh ag lorg rialacha den tsórt seo agus is cúis áthais dom go bhfuil siad ag teacht anois faoi dheireadh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats Party is very pleased to accept the Minister's recommendation this evening that we approve the ratification of the Basel Convention on the control of transboundary <Col N="532" /> movements of hazardous wastes and their disposal.  There is now a well established need for proper safety regulations to protect the health of the community and indeed the environment of the world in which we live, which is becoming ever more threatened by man's own developments, the thirst for consumer goods and the tremendous developments taking place in their manufacture.  There is a price to be paid.  The difficulties arising from toxic waste highlighted by scientists can no longer be ignored.</P>
    <P>The movement of hazardous waste from one country to another always poses a very serious threat to the environment and to health.  The only sensible way for governments to deal with these threats is to come together, by way of international agreement, to work out the best possible formula and then commit themselves to adhere rigidly to the necessary rules and regulations.  One cannot do that until one has decided what is the best way to do these things.  I have read the convention which is a very comprehensive document covering a wide range of waste products, many of which may not have been considered by the ordinary public to be hazardous.</P>
    <P>It places a tremendous onus on the authorities in each country to ensure great vigilance if they are to comply with the terms of this convention.  There has been an urgent need to set down these basic standards.  The task now will be to ensure compliance with and to have proper procedures for the regulation and implementation of the convention requirements in place in each country that is party to the convention.  The Minister's speech was short on what legislative proposals he intended to bring forward and what regulations he intended to implement in order to ensure that Ireland would genuinely involve itself in living up to the commitments which it will accept when it ratifies this convention.</P>
    <P>I note the requirement in Article 3 to inform the Secretariat of hazardous waste, defined in legislation other than <Col N="533" /> that set out in Annex I and Annex II. In view of the short period before this convention comes into operation the Minister should have given us more information about what work has been done in regard to preparing such a list, how extensive it might be and what other wastes might be identified as common here which are not covered in Annex I and Annex II.</P>
    <P>Article 4 of the convention is of major concern to all of us.  It is the kernel of the convention because it gives the right to any country to refuse to accept waste being exported from another country. The Minister has given his estimate of the quantities we export as about 12,000 tonnes of our most difficult hazardous waste at present.  Because of the lack of adequate statistics in this area I wonder whether that is accurate but we will take it as being as close as one can get at any rate.  If by any chance the other member countries, who sign this convention with us, decide at a later stage that they will not accept the hazardous waste from Ireland then we would be placed in a very difficult position.</P>
    <P>The Minister identifies Finland, the United Kingdom and Belgium as the main countries to which we are exporting our hazardous waste.  If all of those three countries, for one reason or another, were to decide that they would not accept our waste in future &mdash; and they could do so under the terms of this convention &mdash; then we would have a problem of a type which has not yet been faced up to in this country.</P>
    <P>I note the Minister's comment that smaller countries with small amounts of hazardous waste &mdash; where it may be uneconomic &mdash; may not be expected to provide disposal facilities within their own boundaries.  A difficult question arises here and this is probably the reason the Minister has referred to the hazardous waste conference, at which he will participate, which will be held in Trinity College early in January.  The purpose of this conference is to assist in achieving a <Col N="534" /> consensus on the way forward for a policy in Ireland for the treatment of hazardous waste.  Much of this waste is currently exported, a practice which will be discouraged under EU legislation.  The conference will provide a forum to address the perceived needs, potential for hazardous waste minimisation, re-use, recycling and the role of integrated pollution control and the environmentally acceptable final disposable options.  The Minister made very little reference to any of those valuable alternatives.  I wonder how much work has been done at departmental level to find the way forward for Ireland in regard to the situation which obtains when we have signed this convention and when it finally comes into operation.</P>
    <P>It would be disastrous for Irish industry if we were refused permission to dispose of this waste in the countries that are now accepting it.  Possibly many of our industries would be forced to close down. Certainly, in many cases goodwill could be destroyed and there would then be a danger to the health of Irish nationals and a danger to the general environment because of our inability to dispose of it. This is an urgent matter.</P>
    <P>This convention carries heavy responsibilities for this country.  We cannot glibly sign it and expect other countries will continue to accept our hazardous waste.  We will have to find ways in which to deal with it here.  There is also, of course, the facility in Article 4 of the convention for Ireland to refuse to accept any illegal imports from another country that may be coming in here.  I do not know if that is the case and again the Minister made no reference to that. Perhaps there are not any known hazardous waste items being disposed of here either with or without permission. It certainly places a heavy responsibility on the Government to make adequate provision for our own hazardous waste disposal in the future.  We have shirked our responsibilities in this area, national as well as international, because we are <Col N="535" /> relying on other countries to accept this material from us.</P>
    <P>This convention greatly expands the definition of hazardous waste.  It is not just a problem for the pharmaceutical industry, with which many people associate toxic waste and waste which is generally difficult to dispose of.  The definition of hazardous waste under this convention is very extensive.  Local authorities will have large volumes of waste, not of a pharmaceutical origin, which will come under the terms of this convention.</P>
    <P>Little reference has been made in the Minister's speech to the whole question of incineration.  The raging debate is whether Ireland will invest in an incinerator. The Minister will acknowledge that he is on record as having stated that Ireland will have to face up to the option of building an incinerator.  <i>The Cork Examiner</i> of Tuesday, 23 March 1993, under the heading &ldquo;Plan for Toxic Waste Incinerator&rdquo;, stated:</P>
    <P>Plans to build Ireland's first toxic waste incinerator are in the pipeline, Environment Minister Michael Smith confirmed last night.</P>
    <P>The article continues in that vein.  Also the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 23 March 1993, under the heading &ldquo;We Must Burn Our Own Toxic Waste: Minister&rdquo;, stated:</P>
    <P>Ireland will have to face up to reality and build its own toxic waste incinerator.</P>
    <P>I am not sure what the purpose of the conference in Trinity College is if the decision has already been made.  If the decision has been made &mdash; as the Minister indicated &mdash; it raises very serious questions as to why one would choose the incinerator option and whether there is not a more modern and more environmentally friendly way of disposing of this waste.  The Greenpeace organisation have done very valuable work in highlighting the alternatives and the more sensible long term options.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="536" /> The Minister, being the person with responsibility in this area, may have to address this question on two levels, the short term and the long term.  Certainly I do not like to think he has chosen the option of incineration as the solution to both the short term and long term problems. I hope he has a more enlightened environmentally-oriented solution to the long term disposal of waste of this kind.</P>
    <P>The disposal of waste is largely governed by the EU waste regulations of 1979 and the EU toxic and dangerous waste regulations of 1982 and various regulations that have been made under this legislation which is implemented largely by the local authorities.  The track record of local authorities on the preparation of waste plans has not been good and I wonder if the Minister will inform the House whether they have all completed their waste plans.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>How many of the plans have, in fact, been implemented, which is another important stage?  Coming from the Galway region, I am aware that we have a long way to go to live up to the proper standards in regard to the disposal of waste.  In Galway, a local authority has planning permission to operate a public refuse dump in another local authority area but it is alleged that the corporation is not complying with the conditions of planning permission under which the county council gave its permission to operate the dump.  The dump is located in a very sensitive area and the water table levels have to be taken into account. There is a flow of effluent into streams that feed into the River Corrib, which is a main source of drinking water and is also a very valuable wild trout and salmon fishery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The practice of waste management leaves a lot to be desired and I ask the Minister to concentrate some of his time and energy seeking to establish how much needs to be done in each local <Col N="537" /> authority area.  There seems to be haphazard and <i>ad hoc</i> action which could be detrimental to our environment.  I understand also that the local authorities have been very dilatory in supplying the Department with waste statistics.  Deputy Doyle referred in her contribution to statistics based on figures supplied by An Foras Forbartha, which has long ceased to exist thanks to the action of one of the Minister's predecessors &mdash; I think it was Commissioner Flynn &mdash; who abolished it.  Indeed, the demise of that organisation has left a gap in the availability of valuable information on the environment. I hope the Environmental Protection Agency will be able to supply the vital statistics on the environment which have been lacking since An Foras Forbartha was closed down.</P>
    <P>This reflects the lack of priority in local authorities to the disposal of waste.  One must mention, however, how difficult it is for local authorities to comply with all the requirements placed on them by this House when they are not being adequately funded.</P>

      <P>I did not expect the time to go so quickly.  In my remaining time I want to emphasise the need for new waste legislation.  I was pleased to hear the Minister say that he had advanced this and brought it before Cabinet.  Certainly we on this side of the House look forward to seeing it in the very near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need to enact our own legislation because it is not satisfactory to operate under EU Directives as they cannot be tailored to meet our national circumstances. We need a modern statutory framework to underpin all aspects of waste control, including minimising the production of waste at source; ensuring that whatever waste is produced is, as far as possible, capable of being recycled. Any new legislation needs to regulate all aspects of activity relating to waste from <Col N="538" /> the simple collection of domestic rubbish by the local authorities to the disposal of hazardous waste.  No waste policy will work without the appropriate legal basis to give effect to it.  I look forward to new legislation.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm an conradh seo a phlé agus gabhaim bhíochas leis an Aire as ucht é a thabhairt os comhair na Dála.</P>
      <P>It will be five years next March since the genesis of this convention.  The fact that we are discussing this as midnight approaches symbolises also the lateness at which we are getting around to dealing with the problem that has been with us for a long time and has caused numerous international incidents, including loss of life and long term detrimental problems to our environment.</P>
      <P>At first glance the title is midleading: &ldquo;The Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal&rdquo;.  We should realise that certain hazardous wastes are not included and that we are talking in a limited way about a limited number of hazardous wastes, extensive though the list may appear on first reading. For example, waste from ships is not included.  A significant amount of waste comes from ships and we have a great deal of work to do in that area, particularly as we are an island nation.  The recent oil spill off County Louth killed a great many birds, if we need to measure its effects numerically as the <i>Braer</i> incident, yet it was scantily covered in the media and this shows some inconsistency in what we choose to highlight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am certainly very concerned about plastics and whereas plastics may not seem hazardous in their raw state, once they get into the sea they are.  Another aspect that is not covered is nuclear waste and that certainly does not reflect the concern in Ireland.  I realise there are other conventions dealing with that matter but the fact that 46 questions about THORP were tabled last week <Col N="539" /> reflects the degree of seriousness with which Deputies regard that plant.</P>
    <P>Article 3 of the convention refers to a list of wastes and asks us to expand on it. I would be interested to know if we have done so and know the exact amount of waste involved, given that we are a prolific producer of various hazardous wastes.  We have a pharmaceutical company that is second to none in that area. It also calls for a regular updating of that list and I hope that can be provided for too.</P>
    <P>The convention has many positive aspects and, of course, it requires us to live up to our responsibilities.  For example, we must inform other countries of accidents when they happen and we must ensure that we re-import our waste if problems arise when we export it.  Each year we must report on all movements of toxic waste and on all incidents relating to it.  I have just listed a number of responsibilities but there are many others to which I will come later.  I understand that we give £5,000 to the support of the Secretariat of the Convention.  I am not quite sure whether financial matters in the convention ought to be determined entirely by consensus.  The convention mentions that consensus is needed for any change in the financial provisions governing it.</P>
    <P>If a country is benefiting from trade in toxic waste and another country can veto an increase in that financial arrangement, does that mean that we can have a block on provision to deal with problems as they arise? The mechanism for amending the convention does not require consensus but a three-quarters majority.  On paper the rules can be changed, but financially we could be caught in trying to live up to them.  I would not like to see finance become a problem and it should be addressed.</P>
    <P>Annex IV of the convention gives a very interesting list of the categories of waste.  Category A relates to operations which do not lead to the possibility of <Col N="540" /> resource recovery, recycling, reclamation, direct reuse or alternative uses. It rules out from the point of view of resource recovery, incineration on land or at sea.  It has been suggested that incineration can be interpreted as a form of recovery.  The convention nails that type of propaganda.  Incineration is not recovery and many of the other incidents that occur with incineration highlight the fact that it is not desirable either.</P>
    <P>Category B lists a number of activities which can be considered to be operations which may lead to resource recovery.  It rules out direct incineration as a way of recovering resources, copperfastening the view.</P>
    <P>The conference in Trinity mentioned by Deputy Molloy will be a continuation of this debate tonight and I look forward to it.  Whereas I might dig deep into my pocket to pay the £200 registration fee, I wonder if the Minister believes it is possible to reach a consensus on this issue when we seem to be excluding quite a number of people who are very interested in the subject by putting an admission price of £200 on attending a relatively short conference.  It reminds me of a Ben Elton plot in the book &ldquo;Stark&rdquo; where those with money devise wonderful environmental solutions to problems, which include going to another planet, while the meagre mortals who do not have the money have to suffer the consequences. We should not approach the problem in that way and I wonder if anything can be done to give a concession to people who are not Ministers or TDs and who are not suitably remunerated for talking the hind legs off everybody else.</P>
    <P>I hope the area covered by Annex IV will not be changed because if it was considered that incineration was acceptable we would be open to becoming importers of waste just as Britain has become an importer of nuclear waste which causes us problems.</P>
    <P>Going back over my faded files I noted <Col N="541" /> an extract from <i>The Irish Times</i> of 5 July 1989 which states:</P>
    <P>The Brazilian container ship now crossing the Atlantic towards Ireland carrying 35 tonnes of highly toxic wastes, is not bound for any Irish port, according to the Department of the Environment.  Speculation yesterday that the vessel was to dump its cargo at the Aughinish Alumina plant in Limerick has been denied by the company, although the waste originated at a sister firm in South America, Alcanbrasil.</P>
    <P>The 35 tonnes of industrial oil contaminated with highly toxic polychlorinated biphenyls are on board the <i>Copacabana</i>, a 27,000-tonne container ship which left the port of Santos last Thursday.  It is heading for Rechem International Limited, based in Pontypool, Wales, where the oil will be incinerated in accordance with local environmental regulations, according to a Department for the Environment spokesman.</P>
    <P>Local environment regulations sound plausible but I probably do not have to tell the Minister that Pontypool in Wales, the home of that incinerator, is a place in which there are a large number of health problems.  There is documentation, including films, on this problem and Pontypool is a severe warning for us.  I do not want cargo ships coming here to off-load waste for incineration as they may want to if the capacity for an incinerator would require extra waste to make it economical, whatever about efficient in other ways.</P>
    <P>This convention looks at more than Irish problems.  It is a response to the global dumping ground problem which has developed.  Many people will recall the problem in 1987 when an Italian businessman who had been living in Nigeria for ten years wrote to an Italian company called Ecomar to the effect that he was willing to import their industrial waste to Nigeria where he would dispose <Col N="542" /> of it.  The deal agreed, he offered a local person called Sunday Nana, a small farmer in Koko, Nigeria, $100 a month to rent a portion of his land.  Delighted with the deal, Nana was unconcerned as the shipments of drums began to arrive and were stored on his land.  Between 1987 and 1988, five ships brought 4,330 tonnes of toxic waste and approximately 8,000 drums to Koko.  The drums were exposed to the heat and tropical storms and began to deteriorate and leak.  Some villagers began to empty some of them and carried them away for use as storage containers.  Nana used several drums to store food and water.  The drums began to smell and local people fell ill.  According to one report 19 villagers died after eating contaminated rice.</P>
    <P>The dump was discovered in 1988 when the media was tipped off by Nigerian students in Italy.  There is a litany of health problems which are continuing, including premature births, cholera and respiratory failure which finally killed Nana in 1990.  A certain toxic terrorism has been going on.  If we are serious about stopping it we must look to our responsibility in creating the type of economy which just does not try to patch up the problems as they arise without giving this issue the priority it deserves.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that at the very root of our economy there are ways of living and working that do not necessitate the generation of the type of waste being generated around the world and finding its way to places such as Koko in Nigeria or Pontypool in Wales.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is looking forward to introducing the Waste Bill, but that has been on the long finger for some time, although it may be imminent at this stage. I recall a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> in which Deputy Harney was quoted as announcing the imminent introduction of that Bill at a Progressive Democrats conference when she was in Government. One was invited to hold one's breath and it would appear.  But that Government is no longer in office and this Government <Col N="543" /> is looking on it as a new project. However, the problems are far from new; they are getting worse and the Minister is well aware of that.  Ultimately, the main problem is one of education: how not to generate such waste, regardless of the methods and means for dealing with it.</P>
    <P>If we go around with our heads in the air stating that the waste must be disposed of somewhere, we will not solve the problem; it will land on somebody else's doorstep.  Some products, even those advertised as being environmentally friendly, can appear harmless; but that may not be the case.  The batteries in our cars and other products we consider part and parcel of normal living contribute to the problem of hazardous waste; and until we discover how such things are used, where they end up and their effects on the environment, we will be dealing with this problem on an ongoing and worsening basis.</P>
    <P>In the meantime we must deal with present levels of toxic waste.  We must have a rule of thumb which states that detoxification of hazardous or toxic waste must be carried out on site.  I am glad that is one of the objectives of the convention, but it should be given priority.  At present it is a case of private companies boosting their public relations image by advertising that they take steps to detoxify hazardous or toxic waste on site; but in most cases that is a marketing exercise, not an environmental one.  That will continue to be the case until proper regulations are put in place to require such detoxification methods as a matter of course.</P>
    <P>Even if a company detoxifies such waste on site, that is not the end of the story.  The product is sold and becomes the property of a person who is not the producer &mdash; in other words, a secondary processor.  Our law must state that the user in such circumstances is responsible for the disposal of the waste.  We must provide the means, the education and the <Col N="544" /> inclination; but, ultimately, the penalty must lie with the user.  The user should show similar responsibility to that which he or she might show when dealing with other issues of public health, such as, for example, driving a car.  A car could be described as a lethal weapon and in many ways could be compared to hazardous waste.</P>
    <P>We should support Denmark, who has, more often than not, provided an enlightened lead.  Hence its opposition to Maastricht, because it felt the other EU countries were pulling it back and trying to make it accept the lowest common denominator standard in many areas. Denmark is calling for a ban on the export of hazardous waste to non-OECD countries and it behoves us to support it in that regard.  As stated already, this not only involves Third World or developing countries, but also Eastern countries. Given that France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium and Portugal have ratified this convention, I hope we do so soon and go on to amend our legislation so that we are not polluters in a global context.</P>

    <P>Even though it is late at night, I am glad the Dáil has had an opportunity to approve the terms of this convention. Deputy Sargent was concerned that special consideration might be granted to non-governmental organisations to attend the conference on hazardous waste in Trinity College in early January. Special facilities will be made available in that regard and a number of nongovernmental organisations may contact Trinity College in regard to free access to that conference.  Apart from a few hit and run expeditions, my relationship with non-governmental organisations has been good and I intend to ensure they <Col N="545" /> have the best possible facilities in what I hope will be a very useful exercise.</P>

      <P>As one who spent 25 per cent of Dáil time in 1992 &mdash; I do not have the figures for 1993 &mdash; representing my Department in respect of legislation on housing, roads, environmental protection, electoral reform, two planning Bills, the Road Traffic Bill and the Dublin reorganisation Bill, my Department could not be accused of not giving urgency to the legislation which falls within its remit.  We are progressing with the Waste Bill as quickly as possible. There has been no lethargy in that regard; it is a question of the volume of legislation we are introducing in regard to which we are maintaining a lead in this House.  We have had considerable unanimity and support from all sides of the House in regard to the majority of the legislation we introduced.</P>
      <P>In relation to exports of hazardous waste to non-OECD countries, Deputy Doyle referred to the need for caution in respect of the export of such waste to countries of Central and Eastern Europe as well as countries in the developing world.  As I stated, the EU regulation limits exports of waste for disposal to the EU and EFTA countries.</P>
      <P>There is no question, therefore, of waste being consigned for disposal from the EU region to Central and Eastern Europe.  Ireland has never exported waste beyond the EU and EFTA areas. The only issue is whether it should be permissible to export waste for recovery beyond the OECD area.  Ireland does not require or use this facility but some other EU member states do and the present regulation reflects the balance of political views within the Union that the option of exporting waste for recovery beyond the OECD area should remain open, at least for the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Doyle suggested that Ireland <Col N="546" /> should take a leading position in campaigning for the termination of waste exports for recovery beyond the OECD region.  I have already made it clear that Ireland can support this position.  We have already openly indicated our support for the Danish Minister within the Environment Council.  However, if I were to suggest to the Danish Government that it should handle its hazardous waste by means other than incineration, given that it has taken the initiative in some areas, I hope the Deputy understands that some of the other points she made were unbalanced in this regard.</P>

      <P>Deputy Doyle argued that Ireland should not seek to provide <Col N="547" /> a central hazardous waste incinerator.  I hope the Deputy noticed from the waste statistics I quoted that some 10,000 tonnes of hazardous waste are incinerated in Ireland in accordance with appropriate environmental licences.  In some cases further upgrading of incineration systems will be needed within the next few years to meet the new standards required under the recent EU Directive on hazardous waste incineration.  The issue, therefore, is not whether incineration <i>per se</i> should be permitted as a means of managing Irish hazardous waste but whether in addition to existing in-house incinerators we also need a contract waste incinerator.  I am prepared to assess the merits of this matter on an open and fair basis and that is why I am looking forward to the conference debate early in January.  On a number of occasions I have referred to the necessity for this country to face up to the reality of dealing with waste generated here.  In endeavouring to have a self-sufficiency regime in the EU we cannot expect others to deal with the waste we produce.</P>
      <P>Deputy Doyle raised the question of industrial pollution control licences which in the future will be issued by the Environmental Protection Agency.  Like Deputy Doyle, I see the introduction of the Environmental Protection Agency licensing system as a plus factor in controlling and minimising the generation of hazardous industrial waste.  The BATNEEC criteria mentioned by Deputy Doyle will have regard to the possibility of preventing or reducing waste and this will influence the way in which licences will be issued by the Environmental Protection Agency in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies Molloy and Doyle expressed reservations about the accuracy of hazardous waste statistics.  The figures I quoted this evening are based on returns from virtually all Irish local authorities for 1998.  So far as possible these have been validated with major Irish waste producers and waste companies.  While <Col N="548" /> there is always a margin for inaccuracy in relation to waste statistics &mdash; this is acknowledged internationally &mdash; I am satisfied that the figures are reasonably accurate and representative.  However, my Department is drawing up a profile of hazardous waste statistics for 1992 and I hope to have these available shortly.</P>
    <P>Deputies Molloy and Doyle asked for an indication of what wastes other than those included in Annex I and II would be considered hazardous in the context of the recent EU Directive on hazardous waste.  The Union is to establish an agreed list of hazardous waste and this work is ongoing and is expected to be completed by the middle of next year. Ireland's position on this matter will be consistent with that of the European Union and the appropriate notification will be made in due course.</P>
    <P>With regard to Ireland's importation of hazardous waste, we have operated a restrictive approach to such imports and this will continue to be the policy.  Waste imports are centrally controlled by my Department.  In practice, we have permitted the importation of hazardous waste only on a technical basis, for example, for certain laboratory purposes and as starter agents for certain sewage treatment operations.  We have the sovereign right to refuse to accept cargoes of dangerous waste and no doubt we intend to continue to exercise this right.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sargent rightly pointed out that certain wastes, for example, ships' waste and radioactive waste, are not convered by this convention.  The reason for this is that other international conventions, namely, the MARPOL and Vienna Conventions, already cover these wastes.  The Deputy will appreciate also that all of the conventions, including the Basel Convention, represent a political consensus on a broad international basis on how to regulate these various wastes. They are not always, for example, in the case of radioactive waste, as advanced as Ireland and as I would personally like <Col N="549" /> them to be, but we would be foolish not to make the best of them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for giving me the opportunity to raise this important matter this evening.  In outlining the background to the decentralisation of Government offices to Kilkenny it is worth recalling that following the 1991 budget the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Reynolds, now Taoiseach, announced that 120 civil servants would be relocated from the inland fisheries section of the Department of the Marine and the Companies Office in the Department of Industry and Commerce, in Kilkenny city.  This was welcome news for those living in Kilkenny city and surrounding areas.</P>
      <P>At the time and even today there is a great temptation for public representatives and the Kilkenny local authorities to be critical of the Industrial Development Authority and its attempts to achieve results in terms of locating manufacturing industry in the Purcellsinch industrial estate following the demise of the Fieldcrest plant some years ago.  There are 80,000 square feet vacant at present and I take this opportunity to urge the Government and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to make every possible effort to locate manufacturing industry in Kilkenny at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the absence of that, it came as a great source of encouragement to the people of the area to know that the Government was including Kilkenny city in its decentralisation programme.  In the run up to the local elections of 1991 the Minister for Finance of the time, Deputy Reynolds, must have been tempted to <Col N="550" /> make such an announcement.  He did so with a great fanfare of publicity from the local Fianna Fáil public representatives of the day.</P>
    <P>The local authority in question, Kilkenny Corporation, set about getting a site appropriate to the needs of the Office of Public Works to provide this very important facility.  A site at Hebron Road, Kilkenny, which was originally earmarked by Kilkenny Corporation for housing development, was swapped with another site to facilitate the decentralisation of Government offices.  To date existing local Civil Service staff have come together on this site at Hebron Road, as part of phase 1, for housing, tax, social welfare and agriculture services. These are provided in the new Government offices which were opened during the November 1992 General Election.  It was a premature opening &mdash; the Minister for Finance of the day, Deputy Reynolds, happened to be campaigning in the area at that time.</P>
    <P>I have repeatedly sought assurances from the Government that the decentralisation programme was on track.  On 12 October 1993 I asked the Minister for Finance in the Dáil if he would indicate when work would commence on building these new offices in Kilkenny and he told me that it was planned that building work would commence in the following spring. It was certainly a surprise to me when I learned that there was very little interest on the part of civil servants in Dublin in relocating to Kilkenny.  I understand from my contacts in the personnel sections that to date 25 out of 120 civil servants have indicated their interest in relocating to Kilkenny city.  This is a serious disappointment to me.  It will be an even greater disappointment to the people of Kilkenny if, because of lack of interest or lack of resources on the part of the Government to encourage civil servants to relocate to Kilkenny, the decentralisation programme comes off the rail.</P>
    <P>In the absence of the Minister for Finance, I ask the Minister for Education to clarify when work will commence on building these new offices in Kilkenny <Col N="551" /> city and what progress has been made in relocating civil servants from the Government Departments I have mentioned to Kilkenny city.  I ask the Minister to allay the fears of the people of Kilkenny, who have looked forward to this injection of finance into the local economy and the injection of spending power that the relocation of 120 civil servants would give to the Kilkenny area, which needs job creation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on the proposed decentralisation to Kilkenny. As the Deputy is aware, phase 1 of the development, which caters for the locally based Civil Service staff, has been occupied for some months and it is understandable that there is concern about the delay in proceeding with the decentralisation phase of the development.</P>
      <P>The Government decision of June 1991 in relation to Kilkenny was that 125-150 staff from the Companies Registration Office and the Department of the Marine should be transferred.  However, the Companies Registration Office was at that time undertaking an ambitious programme of computerisation and I understand it was not possible to have staff transfer to Kilkenny during that process. The Companies Registration Office has also decided that its initial brief of accommodation requirements now needs to be amended and updated in the light of the computerisation programme.  It is at present engaged on this and it is expected that the Companies Registration Office will be in a position to hand this updated information over to the Office of Public Works very shortly.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Department of the Marine, an initial brief of accommodation requirements for about 30 staff is short of the number required by the Government decision.  I understand that the Department of Finance has been in touch with the Department of the Marine in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="552" /> As soon as the issue of accommodation briefs is resolved, the Office of Public Works will immediately proceed with arrangements to have the necessary accommodation provided.  It was indicated, in reply to a recent parliamentary question from the Deputy, that it was planned to commence building work next spring.  That is still the intention; but the Deputy will be aware that as all the factors that need to be put in place are not in the direct control of the Commissioners of Public Works, I am not in a position to give a categoric assurance that this timescale will be met.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to take this opportunity to place on the record of this House the extreme anxiety and fear of so many people, particularly elderly people, who live and work in rural Ireland because of the increased incidence of break-ins, burglaries with and without violence, and the general level of lawlessness not previously encountered outside the major cities.  There are countless examples of marauding gangs of criminals moving out of built-up areas like Dublin and Cork and hitting small villages and towns in the dead of night.</P>
      <P>The terror these criminals bring to small, law-abiding communities was well illustrated last week at a very well attended meeting held in Moylough, County Galway, to discuss a series of wildcat break-ins into small businesses a week previously.  The local post office was raided twice in 72 hours, while many premises both in Moylough village and in surrounding villages like Caltra and Mountbellew were raided during the dead of night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="553" /> Some of the criminals have been apprehended, thanks to the good work of the local Garda.  However, the number of premises being hit continues to grow at an alarming rate and local communities are galvanising themselves against such attacks by any legal means at their disposal, such as involvement in community alert groups etc.</P>
    <P>This area of County Galway forms part of the new community policing arrangements, but many local people are unhappy with some parts of this new arrangement.  Although it is true that the new squad cars now patrol outlying rural areas not previously covered and give a better Garda presence, the decision to leave the local Garda stations, except the local headquarters at Mountbellew, unmanned for 22 out of the 24 hours per day causes real anxiety about the effectiveness of the new model.  A local community garda is assigned to community duties at each Garda station and attends at the local station for two hours per day.  However, the lack of a uniformed garda walking around such villages is causing concern.</P>
    <P>Many people, including myself, believe that rural Ireland, because of its low crime rate relative to the Dublin figures, is left out in the cold and unless there is a much greater Garda presence in rural Ireland many small-time criminals who would otherwise be identified and dealt with will be allowed to develop into fully-fledged dangerous criminals and thugs.  The recent allocation of the 81 new Garda recruits illustrates this point, because almost 60 were sent to duty points in Dublin.  How many were actually sent to provincial towns and villages has not been published.</P>
    <P>The Minister's new plan is welcome.  It will deal in some limited way with an unprecedented upsurge of crime in the cities, but the preventive measures needed to stamp out petty crime in rural areas has been totally overlooked.  I understand there is a blackspot period between 2 a.m. and 6 a.m. when there is <Col N="554" /> little or no police cover in rural areas. This should be addressed immediately.</P>
    <P>I have more to say, but I want to allow Deputy Kitt to say a few words.  I ask the Minister to bring this message back to her colleague, because this matter is causing real concern.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Connaughton for sharing his time.  I welcome the announcement of the package to fight crime by the Minister for Justice. I hope some aspects of that package, for example, the provision of extra gardaí and the details in relation to technology and computers to which the Minister referred will help deal with the problem Deputy Connaughton outlined.  The critical crime period is between the hours of 2 a.m. to 7 a.m. and we ask the Minister to consider measures to address this problem.  During that time the criminals attack businesses in particular and, most recently, post offices in rural Ireland. Some of those criminals come from Dublin, Limerick and Cork and believe they can get easy pickings in rural Ireland.  Those people are probably well known in the cities and, therefore, they attack businesses and post offices in rural areas.  I would like an extra patrol car to police rural areas between the hours of 2 a.m. to 7 a.m.  That would provide some measure of crime prevention.  The local Chief Superintendent Kilgannon spoke about that matter at a recent public meeting and stated that the main duty of the Garda is to prevent crime.  I know the gardaí have good relations with the local community and the community alert scheme has helped them detect crime. There is a high crime detection rate in the Roscommon-east Galway district.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provision of extra gardaí.  I hope the Garda stations will be kept open as that will provide some reassurance to the people of rural Ireland.  I hope the rural policing scheme will be improved to allow the gardaí do their work.</P>

      <P>I wish to reply on behalf of the Minister of State at the Department of Justice.</P>
      <P>The Minister fully appreciates the Deputy's concern in raising this matter tonight and is glad to have the opportunity to outline the policing arrangements that exist in the Moylough area of County Galway and the measures which are being taken and which are planned by the Garda authorities to prevent and detect crime there.</P>
      <P>Moylough forms part of the community policing scheme for rural areas which was introduced in September, 1991.  The local area headquarters is based at Mountbellew.  The operation of the scheme has been reviewed on two occasions by senior Garda officers and they have found that the scheme has been working very well.  The Minister has been informed by the Garda authorities that this is also the situation in Moylough. The gardaí informed the Minister that they are satisfied with the current policing arrangements for Moylough and are confident that the special measures they are taking will help to combat crime in the area.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been informed by the Garda authorities that a total of 12 burglaries have been committed in the Moylough sub-district in the past 12 months.  The gardaí have detected nine of these crimes and are actively pursuing the culprits for the remaining three.  The detection rate in the sub-district is twice the national average.  That is the good news.</P>
      <P>The fact seems to be, however, that the successes of the Garda in tackling those crimes in the cities, pushes the criminals out into the countryside.  The Minister states that because it is evident to the Garda that some of the crimes in the Moylough area are being committed by criminals from other places who are mobile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nevertheless, the Garda have particular strategies to deal with this type of problem.  For example, the obvious one <Col N="556" /> is increased patrolling and, I understand that some members have taken to patrolling in their own time.  That is a clear indication of the level of commitment by the Garda.  Further measures include the setting up of special mobile patrols within the areas affected as well as closer coordination and the use of foot and mobile patrols and checkpoints at various locations and unpredictable instances. Generally speaking, whatever arrangements regarding the deployment of Garda resources are necessary to meet the special requirements of the Moylough and neighbouring areas will be taken.</P>
    <P>In response to concerns expressed by the local community in Moylough, senior Garda management, including the chief superintendent for the Roscommon-Galway East Division, met recently with local representatives.  The Garda response was outlined, and it is fair to say that these measures evoked general satisfaction.</P>
    <P>The Minister has no doubts whatsoever that the Garda are giving the matter the fullest attention it deserves, that the policing arrangements to cover the Moylough and surrounding areas will be kept under continuous review.</P>

    <P>The overcrowded accommodation at St. Joseph's national school, Glenamaddy, is well known to the Department. I have given the Minister details of this matter on a number of occasions. There are four classrooms and a prefabricated <Col N="557" /> classroom to accommodate the five teachers in the school.  The present classrooms are not adequate.  St. Joseph's national school was one of the 20 primary schools in County Galway found to be seriously substandard in a nationwide survey carried out by the INTO.  That survey revealed that there are 170 such schools in the country and that County Galway had the highest number.</P>
    <P>St. Joseph's national school has 140 pupils and because of the large numbers attending the school and the small classrooms, the classes are split.  I sent a copy of the <i>Tuam Herald</i> of 11 November to the Minister.  That newspaper carried a picture of the children sitting on the floor for a particular class.  There were 37 pupils in the class but only seating for 28. The school authorities have done all that was asked of them.  They rented a prefabricated classroom and the Department provided 50 per cent of its rental cost.  Later the Department proposed that the school authority should purchase the prefabricated building and it did so. At this stage I appeal to the Minister to allow the project proceed to tender.  I understand it is proposed to convert the present four classrooms to two classrooms and to build an extension to provide three extra classrooms.  I appeal to the Minister to give this project the go-ahead.  It was hoped that the project would start in 1993 and I am hopeful it will now start in 1994 and that St. Joseph's national school, Glenamaddy will have a happy Christmas and prosperous New Year.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Kitt for allowing me the opportunity to make a brief contribution on this matter.  I am delighted the Minister for Education is present.  I support Deputy Kitt's case for the proposed extension to St. Joseph's national school, Glenamaddy.  I visited the school a few months ago.  My impression of the school was of one completely overcrowded.  The teachers and <Col N="558" /> pupils could not perform with any degree of efficiency because of the lack of space. There were children in every corner.  The teachers literally had to guide their classes by standing on top of the furniture. Not alone were the classrooms overcrowded but the prefab to which Deputy Kitt referred has added to the school's problems.</P>
      <P>The school has a hardworking board of management that has done a great deal of work to collect funds locally for the proposed extension.  It is located in a disadvantaged area.  The board of management has strived to do all it can to assist this project.  The school management has requested a remedial teacher for St. Joseph's national school, and for the cluster of schools in the parish.  I know this matter is dear to the Minister's heart.</P>

      <P>I am glad of the opportunity the two Deputies have presented me with to clarify the position in relation to this matter.  This school has 140 pupils on rolls with a staff of a principal plus five assistants.  My Department accepts that the existing facilities at the school are unsatisfactory and should be improved, and has given approval in principle for a major building project at this school.  The project will include the conversion of the four existing undersized permanent classrooms to two larger classrooms, and the provision of two new permanent classrooms, together with the adaptation of the other existing accommodation to provide the requisite ancillary facilities.</P>
      <P>On the basis of enrolment trends my Department considers that the fifth teaching post will only be retained in the short term and has agreed to grant-aid the purchase by the school authorities of the existing temporary structure to accommodate the fifth teacher.  The architectural planning of the project has been completed and the scheme is ready to proceed to tender.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, because <Col N="559" /> of the large volume of major building projects on hands and the limitations on resources, it is only possible to allow a certain number of projects to proceed to construction in any one financial year. Unfortunately it was not possible to include this project in the national school capital programme for 1993.  However I wish to assure the Deputy that the project is being considered for inclusion among the projects to proceed to tender and construction in 1994.  It is intended to announce the list of these projects in the near future.  I have taken note of the <Col N="560" /> requests from both sides of the House regarding a remedial reading facility in the area.</P>

      <P>At the heart of any regime of community property is joint ownership of the family home.  As Deputies will be aware, the President, in exercise of her discretion under Article 26 of the Consituation, has referred the Matrimonial Home Bill, which provides for such joint ownership, to the Supreme Court for a decision as to its constitutionality.  The decision on that Bill may have implications for the action to be taken on the proposals of the Second Commission on the Status of Women for a system of community property.</P>

    <P>With regard to a public information programme on the Matrimonial Home Bill.  I am amenable to taking whatever <Col N="281" /> steps are necessary to ensure that the public are made aware of the contents of the Bill and its implications.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Valuation Acts, the Commissioner of Valuation is required to assess the rateable valuations of properties and in this role he enjoys statutory independence.  It is the responsibility of the commissioner to ensure that rateable valuations conform to the requirements of the valuation legislation, and it is not open to the Minister for Finance to change any of the commissioner's individual decisions in this regard.  However, it is open to an aggrieved party, whether it is the ratepayer or the local authority, to appeal any of the revisions carried out by the Valuation Office.  The appeal is to the Commissioner of Valuation in the first instance, and then, if so desired, to the Valuation Tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basis of rateable valuation is the net annual value of the property.  As the net annual value refers to the rental value of a property, substantial changes in the rateable valuation of individual properties may occur.  These changes essentially reflect the operations of the property <Col N="284" /> market including such powerful influences as the development and decline of parts of cities and towns and outflows of demand and development to adjoining areas, the rates remission incentive in the urban renewal areas and boundary charges.  Because many commercial properties have not had their valuations revised in a considerable time, the need for such valuations to conform with the statutory requirement for uniformity can have the effect of significant increases and decreases in rateable valuations.</P>
    <P>The total effective rateable valuation base for the country as a whole, i.e. the valuation base on which rates are actually levied, when account is taken of reliefs and exemptions, has continued to rise: the effective 1991 valuation base of £8,830,218 represents an increase of 1.3 per cent over the effective 1990 valuation base of £8,711,504; the effective 1992 valuation base of £9,183,686 represents an increase of 4 per cent over the effective 1991 valuation base.</P>
    <P>The operation of the valuation system is kept under regular review by the Commissioner of Valuation and the Department of Finance.</P>

      <P>The disabled drivers' scheme, established under the Disabled Drivers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1989, provides significant tax concessions to qualifying disabled drivers and passengers with severe mobility problems.  The reliefs available under the scheme include repayment of VAT and Vehicle Registration Tax on the acquisition of a vehicle to a limit of £9,000 in a period of two years for qualifying disabled passengers, excise duty refunds on up to 600 gallons of petrol or diesel annually and exemption from road tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="285" /> Disabled passengers, including children, qualify under the scheme if they are certified by a Director of Community Care and Medical Officer of Health in the local health board as coming within one or more of the following categories of disability: (a) wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; (b) wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the person is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs; (c) without both hands or without both arms; (d) the person has the medical condition of dwarfism and has serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</P>
    <P>In the case of qualifying disabled passengers, the scheme covers vehicles specially constructed or adapted to take account of their disability, subject to the cost of such adaptation amounting to at least 20 per cent of the pre-tax cost of the vehicle.  I consider that, having regard to the substantial package of benefits arising from qualification for the scheme and to the position that in this case, use of the vehicle other than for transportation of the disabled passenger will be involved, it is reasonable to confine the scheme to such adapted vehicles.</P>
    <P>My Department recently completed a comprehensive review of the operation of the regulations governing the disabled drivers scheme and, in line with a commitment I gave on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill, 1993, copies of the review are now with the Opposition spokerspersons for their consideration and comments.  The scheme itself is administered by the Revenue Commissioners and details and application forms can be obtained from the Disabled Drivers Section, Central Vehicle Office, Customs and Excise, Rosslare Harbour, County Wexford, Telephone: 053-33750.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that where specified amounts are paid or directed to be paid for the benefit of children that: (a) the person making the payments will not be entitled to deduct and retain income tax from the payments; (b) the payments will not be regarded for income tax purposes as the income of the child; (c) the total income for tax purposes of the person making the payment will be computed as if the payment had not been made.</P>
      <P>The effect of these provisions is that the payments are treated in the same way as if the payer were providing for the child out of his/her own after-tax income. This is in line with the tax treatment of all other parents.  In the circumstances, I have no plans to alter the existing tax treatment of the payments.</P>

      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have no automatic right of access to the bank accounts of taxpayers.  The Tax Acts provide procedures for limited access by the Revenue Commissioners in exceptional circumstances.  These procedures have been used on only a small number of cases and require the authorisation of the Board of the Revenue Commissioners before they are activated.  The <Col N="289" /> procedures are set out in two sections of the Tax Acts as follows.</P>
      <P>Section 18, Finance Act, 1983 provides that where an Inspector of Taxes has reason to believe that an account in a financial institution is being concealed by a person for tax purposes an authorised officer of the Revenue Commissioners may apply to the High Court for an order requiring that institution to furnish him with certain particulars of accounts held by that person and such other information as the court may specify.  On being satisfied that an application under this section has merit the High Court may make an order for the furnishing of specified information and may prohibit any dealings in any assets or moneys of the person in the financial institution without the consent of the judge.</P>
      <P>Section 13 of the Waiver of Certain Tax, Interest and Penalties Act, 1993 has not yet been used so far.  This section applies where a taxpayer has failed to lodge a return or accounts when requested by the Inspector or the Inspector is not satisfied with the return.  This section gives authority to an authorised officer who has reasonable grounds to believe that a person maintains an account with a financial institution which has not been disclosed or that there is information in the books of the institution indicating that the taxpayer's return is incorrect to a material extent; to apply to the Appeal Commissioners to determine whether or not she/he is justified in asking the financial institution for: (1) particulars of the accounts maintained in the institution during a period not exceeding ten years, and (2) other information requested by the authorised officer relating to the financial transactions recorded in the books of the financial institution.</P>
      <P>The taxpayer and the institution have a right to be represented at the hearing and there is a right of appeal to the High Court.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 48 and 49 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regulations were introduced in November <Col N="291" /> 1991 enabling people who, as a result of having been insured for periods in public service type employment at the modified rate of social insurance contribution, have gaps in their record of insurance for Old Age (Contributory) Pension and Retirement Pension purposes. These new arrangements provide that in cases of a &ldquo;mixed&rdquo; insurance record a <i>pro rata</i> pension is payable, which is proportionate to the periods of insurance completed at the full rate.  Any increases of pension payable in respect of an adult dependent are calculated on a similar basis.</P>
    <P>The new arrangements are similar to those which apply under EC Regulations to people who have mixed insurance in a number of different EC member states A similar formula applies under various reciprocal agreements on social security to which Ireland is a party.  Accordingly this formula is regarded as the internationally recognised standard for the award of pensions in cases of mixed insurance.</P>
    <P>People qualifying for the new <i>pro rata</i> pensions also become eligible for additional benefits such as free electricity, free television licence, free telephone rental which would otherwise not be available to them.</P>
    <P>The question of contribution conditions for pensions and the arrangements for <i>pro rata</i> pensions generally including intermittent pensions are among the issues which will be addressed in the forthcoming final report of the National Pensions Board.  Any changes in the present qualification conditions for pensions, including mixed insurance pensions, will be considered in the light of the recommendations contained in that report.</P>

      <P>Ireland is a party to the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons but has not, so far, <Col N="295" /> ratified it.  It will not be possible to arrange for the transfer of a prisoner from another jurisdiction to serve his or her sentence in this country until we ratify the Convention.</P>
      <P>Ratification will require legislation. Unless certain reservations are entered, however, at the time of ratification, serious difficulties for our prisons could be created given that the number of Irish nationals serving sentences abroad far exceeds the number of foreign nationals serving their sentences in this country. While it is impossible to predict accurately the number of Irish nationals in prison abroad who would wish to return, or would qualify for it, even low levels of transfer would pose a substantial problem for us because of existing pressures on prison accommodation.</P>
      <P>However, I intend to proceed with this matter and to give the preparation of draft legislation to facilitate ratifications as much priority as I possibly can.  The Deputy will be aware of the extensive and urgent legislative programme set out in the Programme for Government, of the progress I've made to date and of legislative commitments for the immediate future.  Beyond saying that I will proceed with the particular legislation, as quickly as I can, I am not in a position at this stage to set a precise date limit for its introduction.</P>

      <P>By common consent prisons have a number of purposes which include deterrence, protection of the public and rehabilitation.  There is a range of services provided for prisoners including medical, psychiatric, psychological, welfare, education and work/training all of which have a rehabilitative content. These programmes are being constantly adapted and developed to meet changing needs.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the capital assistance scheme, assistance is available to approved voluntary housing bodies to provide housing, where 75 per cent of the units to be provided are to be used as full time residential accommodation for eligible categories of persons as follows: persons, including disabled persons, on or eligible for inclusion in the waiting lists of local authorities; homeless persons; and tenants and tenant purchasers of local authority houses surrendering their existing dwellings.  Persons under the age of 18 years, except married couples or single parents with children, do not normally come within the scope of the scheme.</P>
      <P>The scheme is not designed to provide nursing home or other accommodation where residents would require extensive medical, nursing or institutional type care; health boards are responsible for the provision of such accommodation.</P>
      <P>The scheme is administered by local authorities who are responsible for determining, and certifying to my Department, that projects comply with the terms of the scheme.  My Department's involvement with individual projects relate primarily to the provision of funding within the allocation available in the Public Capital Programme.  No recent changes have been made in the terms of the scheme and none are at present proposed.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the development and management of this fishery is vested in BIM, An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, which has carried out a number of technical surveys and assessments of the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of development options for the oyster bed have been drawn up in the past but have not, to date, progressed beyond the discussion stage for a variety of technical and economic reasons.  BIM has however, recently published a consultation document which outlines the potential of the resource and puts forward various options for its development and management.  The document has <Col N="316" /> been widely circulated by BIM to local oyster fishermen and co-operatives, local community interests and State agencies as well as local Oireachtas members and MEPs.  This gives all concerned parties the opportunity to consider the options and submit their views.  I understand that BIM has asked for responses by 17 December next.</P>
    <P>I fully endorse the consultative approach adopted by BIM in the matter. I am also in full agreement with BIM's view that any strategy for the future development and management of the fishery must command the support of local interests and especially those actively engaged in the fishery as well as taking account of economic, technical, biological and marketing constraints and opportunities.</P>
    <P>A development and management strategy for the fishery will be drawn up by BIM in light of the outcome of this consultative process.  I am confident that a programme to monitor, manage and develop the resource based on consensus at local level is achievable.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to the Official Report of this House for 18 May 1993 (column 1951) when I set out the total area under afforestation in each county at the end of 1992.  Data for 1993 will be available early next year. The total, 509,000 hectares, represents 7 per cent of the land area of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The projected area afforested in ten years time will be approximately 760,000 hectares.  I am satisfied that production forecasts for the next ten years will allow <Col N="320" /> substantial expansion of the timber processing sector.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="323" /> EC Regulations preclude payments under the special beef and suckler cow premium schemes before 1 November and even then limit the payments to 60 per cent advances.  Disadvantaged areas' headage payments other than for sheep are normally on the basis of advances and this is also the practice in 1993.  The level of disadvantaged areas' payments was higher in 1992 due to some £20 million ear-marked for payment in 1993 being brought forward to December 1992.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that the total value of 1993 headage, deseasonalisation slaughter premium, suckler cow premium, (June-July), and special beef premium, January-February and June-July, schemes is of the order of £220 million. Over £104 million has already been paid, some £80 million is not payable before 1994 and I expect that a further amount of up to £30 million will be paid out by the end of the year.  Payment of the 40 per cent balances will be made as early as possible in the new year following final processing.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to give figures for partial payments under the deseasonalisation slaughter premium scheme but this situation should apply only in a minority of cases.</P>

      <P>The European Union's Scientific Veterinary Committee on animal health was asked to formulate criteria by which countries could be certified as scrapie free.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Committee concluded that, given the absence of a diagnostic test for infection, it is virtually impossible to certify absolute freedom for scrapie infection in <Col N="325" /> any country.  It recommended that this objective should not be pursued until adequate methods are available for detecting pre-clinical infection in live animals.</P>
    <P>My Department is at present pursuing the course recommended by the Committee which is the registration and monitoring of flocks whose owners wish to export live breeding sheep to other EU countries.  If and when a satisfactory test is developed full consideration will be given to the possibility of declaring Ireland scrapie free.</P>

    <P>In connection with implementation of CAP reform arrangements in particular, I have arranged for my Department to simplify as much as possible the procedures for participation under the various schemes and to reduce the time <Col N="326" /> elapsing between application and payment. I will continue to pursue those endeavours.  However, the degree to which the requirements of schemes can be simplified or accelerated is limited by the obligations of financial accountability both at national and EU level, obligations which, as the Deputy will understand, it is essential to observe.</P>
    <P>To provide full details on the number of applicants found ineligible under each of the schemes would involve disproportionate administrative expense. However, for the main such schemes, livestock headage and premia, the position is that about 3 per cent of applications on average are found ineligible after all avenues of checking have been exhausted.</P>

      <P>My Department regularly reviews the operation of the livestock and premia schemes and related fieldwork operations.</P>
      <P>As a consequence of the reform of the CAP the number of schemes and the volume of applications relating to the livestock schemes increased from 369,000 in 1992 to 640,000 in 1993.  The increase in the work of administrative staff relating to the schemes has necessitated overtime working in local offices.</P>

    <P>As there is a certain degree of seasonality in the work of field staff which arises from the application and retention periods laid down in EC legislation, my Department endeavours to reassign these staff to other duties as and when required for example, in meat plants at peak slaughtering periods.

      <P>Irish exports to Spain amounted to £384 million last year, an increase of nearly 12 per cent over the 1991 figure.  Indeed, Irish exports to Spain have increased by 245 per cent since 1985.  This period coincided with Spain's accession to the European Community and with An Bord Tráchtála's drive to expand indigenous business with the Iberian peninsula.  We have, in recent years, enjoyed a widening trade surplus with Spain, which reached £262 million in 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most prominent sectors have been <Col N="333" /> fast-food preparations, chemicals, automatic data processing machines, electrical machinery and professional scientific instruments.</P>
    <P>Besides its regular marketing activities in Spain, An Bord Tráchtála has targeted a number of specific events in 1994 to derive maximum benefit from the Spanish market.  These include: National stand at Alimentaria food fair in Barcelona; inward buyer visit of Spanish buyers to Ireland; sectoral electronics mission to Spain; and major research of the food market including personal presentations to major food purchasers.</P>
    <P>While the expansion of our export sales in Spain will depend on the performance of the Spanish economy, I believe that there are widespread opportunities for Irish exporters in Spain and that this market should continue to display strong growth.</P>

      <P>Section 3 of the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1993, repealed section 3 of the Broadcasting Act, 1990, which imposed statutory limits on the revenue which RTE could derive from advertisements, sponsorship and other forms of commercial promotion in broadcasts and on the amount of time to be given by RTE to broadcasts, effectively repealing the &ldquo;cap&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 2 of the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1993, provides that the total daily times for broadcasting advertisements fixed by the RTE Authority and the maximum period so fixed to be given to advertisements in any one hour shall be subject to the approval of the Minister which is, in fact, a restoration of the pre-1990 Act situation.</P>
      <P>I have already given my consent to a return to pre-1990 advertising times on RTE television.  While I have considered the case put forward by the RTE Authority, I have not, at this stage, on the basis of the arguments put forward by the authority, been able to give my consent to an increase in radio advertising times. Furthermore, the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-97</i> states that we will take measures to ensure that commercial local radio remains viable.  My decision is also informed by that consideration. It is for the Authority to decide if it wishes to pursue the matter further.</P>

    <P>The report <i>The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly</i> emphasised the <Col N="339" /> need to develop a range of services for people with dementia and their families, including purpose built accommodation. The report was adopted as official Government policy towards the elderly in October 1988.  Health boards have prepared plans to implement the recommendations of the report.</P>
    <P>Between 1990 and 1992 an additional £9 million was made available to the health services to implement the key recommendations of the report, including the strengthening of home and community support for people with dementia and their families.  The investment by boards in additional community nursing, daycare and respite services has increased the support available to sufferers of Alzheimer's Disease and their carers.  Some health boards are planning major service developments for the mentally infirm, in line with the commitments given in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to develop services for the elderly.  The care of those suffering from Alzheimer's Disease and dementia is emerging as a priority for many boards, a development which I fully support.</P>
    <P>The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, which came into operation on 1 September last also enhances the facilities available to those caring for dependent relatives with Alzheimer's Disease and dementia.  Under the Act, health boards may pay a subvention towards the cost of care in a nursing home of a person who needs that care and who does not have the resources to pay the cost.  Subvention is available for respite care in nursing homes.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the Deputy is aware that my colleague, Dr. Michael Woods, the Minister for Social Welfare, has made £1 million available to establish a respite care fund to assist voluntary and community groups who provide respite care facilities and services.  This respite care fund will also be of benefit to people with dementia and their carers.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that good progress has been made towards translating policy into a practical network of services for <Col N="340" /> Alzheimer patients and their carers and that this progress will be maintained.</P>

      <P>Under existing personnel policy it is, therefore, the responsibility of each health agency to submit prioritised manpower proposals to my Department including details of service requirement and proposed funding arrangements. Proposals in respect of the post referred to by the Deputy have not been included by Beaumont Hospital in its most recent manpower submission to my Department. I understand, however, that the hospital have employed a temporary clinical psychologist in the context of its provision of a neurology service.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that Comhairle na nOspidéal have statutory responsibility for approving all consultant posts.  As the type of post referred to by the Deputy does not fall into this category, Comhairle na nOspidéal would have no involvement in approving such a post.</P>

      <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board are unable, without undue hardship, to provide general practitioner services for themselves and their dependants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the Consumer Price Index.  Assessment is based on gross income less PRSI deductions.  However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, that person may still be <Col N="342" /> awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.</P>
    <P>In addition the chief executive officers have introduced a number of measures to assist medical card holders who take up employment.  Weekly payments made under the FÁS social employment scheme are excluded in assessing income. Also, persons who held a medical card while on the live register are allowed retain the medical card for a period of two years after taking up employment if they qualify for family income supplement. There are also special provisions for people participating in certain other schemes targeted at the long term unemployed.</P>
    <P>On a final note I would like to point out that it is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.

The report of the study group on the development of the psychiatric services <i>Planning for the Future</i> which was published in 1984 noted that the psychiatric hospital had been the focal point of the psychiatric services in most parts of the country and that large numbers of patients resided permanently in these hospitals.  It recommended a shift in the delivery of services for the mentally ill from an institutional to a community-based service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the adoption of the report as Government policy in the mid-eighties, acute units in general hospitals, day hospitals, day centres and community hostels have been opened to replace services previously provided in psychiatric hospitals.  There are currently 14 acute psychiatric units in general hospitals.  In 1991 there were 2,288 places in community <Col N="344" /> hostels and 2,500 day hospital and day centre places for the mentally ill.  Such facilities hardly existed in 1973.  Other therapeutic interventions which have altered the delivery of psychiatric services include domiciliary assessment, community nursing and home support, respite care, out-patient clinics and clinical rehabilitation services.  Modern drugs have significantly reduced the length of time mentally ill patients have to spend in hospital and, consequently, the need for long-stay hospital beds.</P>
    <P>At the same time, specialist services have been developed for persons who are maintained in psychiatric institutions but who were not mentally ill.  These include persons with mental handicap, autism, the elderly and the homeless.</P>
    <P>These developments have contributed to the reduction in the number of long-stay psychiatric hospital beds in each health board area and between 1984 and 1990 the rate of hospitalisation of psychiatric patients has decreased from 3.4 to 2.0 per thousand.  However, it remains higher in this country than in Denmark, France, England and Wales.</P>

      <P>The North-Western Health Board has advised me that the hospital will suspend elective activity in up to 43 beds in the ophthalmic, ENT and gynaecological departments during the period 12 December 1993 to 3 January 1994 inclusive.  This is a period when there is a seasonal decrease for elective admissions and hospital staff take annual leave.  All emergency and urgent services will, of course, continue to be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, closures of some beds over the Christmas period <Col N="346" /> is common practice in hospitals since patients are generally reluctant to enter hospital for elective procedures at that time.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a national school is determined by the enrolment in the school on 30 September of the previous year.  In the case of St. Brigid's Boys' national school, there were 503 pupils enrolled on 30 September 1992, which warrants a staff of principal plus 15 assistants for the 1993-94 school year.  The school also has the services of a full-time remedial teacher.</P>
      <P>The only exceptions that can be made from the agreed staffing arrangements are in the case of developing schools or where my Department's guidelines on maximum class sizes are being breached. The school authorities applied in April 1993 to my Department for sanction to appoint a 16th assistant on the basis that its projected enrolment of 534 pupils for September 1993 met the criteria laid down for designation as a developing school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department sanctioned this additional assistant on a provisional basis, subject to the condition that a maximum enrolment of 533 be achieved when the teacher took up duty, this being <Col N="347" /> the enrolment required under the criteria for designation as a developing school. The enrolment in the school on 30 September 1993 was 516, which was 17 pupils short of that laid down in my Department's letter of sanction.</P>
    <P>A strict policy is operated in relation to teaching posts sanctioned on a provisional basis.  Such posts are withdrawn if the conditions specified by my Department are not met.  The school was allowed to retain the post up to the Christmas vacation in order to minimise any disruption in the school and to give the school authorities time to formulate alternative arrangements for classes.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the Programme for a Partnerhip Government made a specific commitment to the appointment of a very substantial number of additional remedial teachers by September 1996.</P>
      <P>As part of this commitment I approved the appointment of an additional 86 remedial teachers in the current school year, bringing the total now in place to 1,033.</P>
      <P>I anticipate that current demographic trends will give me further opportunities to address the position of special needs pupils in 1994 and I am currently considering ways of using these trends to best advantage in areas such as remedial teaching.</P>
      <P>The needs of all schools, including schools which currently have the services of a shared remedial teacher, will be considered in the context of this development.</P>

      <Quest>the reason second level students from Littleisland in County Cork are being refused a subsidy towards their second level school transport costs; the basis for the decision that those students are in the Cobh catchment area when the town of Carrigtwohill is nearer to them than Cobh; and if she will review the situation.</Quest>

      <P>A number of factors has been taken into account in drawing up catchment areas.  These include distance, accessibility and other geographical features, viability of post-primary schools, and enrolment patterns and trends at the time.  Taking all this into account, it was decided that Littleisland national school was appropriate to the Cobh catchment area.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, for school transport purposes, the appropriate post-primary centre for students from Littleisland is Cobh.  The most that can be offered to such children in respect of their attendance at Carrigtwohill is concessionary transport from the Carrigtwohill-Midleton catchment boundary.  This concession would apply only to pupils who are basically eligible for transport, and subject to spare seats being available on existing services at no extra cost.</P>
      <P>I understand that a privately-run service operates to bring these children to Carrigtwohill.  There is no provision to give financial support to such a service.</P>

      <P>Phase 1 of this programme was introduced in September 1992 and targeted schools with enrolments of 500 pupils or more which did not have caretaking and-or clerical services already.  Phase 2, implemented in September, 1993, using the same criteria, reduced the qualifying enrolment from 500 pupils or more to 400+ pupils, as well as making special provision for schools in designated disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>Current priority is to provide for schools which do not have any service. The question of providing additional assistance to schools such as St. Fergal's which already have a sharing arrangement, has yet to be determined.</P>

      <P>In response to the publication of the Green Paper, my Department has received submissions from the Irish Commission for Justice and Peace and the Irish Peace Institute which address the issues of peace and human rights in the education system.  This dimension of education will be considered in the context of the forthcoming White Paper on <Col N="354" /> education.  The guiding principle will be to ensure that human rights and peace studies are treated in the curriculum on a global basis, where relevant, rather than as a separate subject.</P>
      <P>The Green Paper has among its principal aims the following: fostering an understanding and critical appreciation of the values &mdash; moral, spiritual, social and cultural &mdash; of the home and society generally; promoting self-esteem and self-worth, combined with a respect for the rights and beliefs of others; creating tolerant, caring and politically aware members of society.</P>
      <P>The Green Paper also acknowledges that the development of social and political awareness, with the aim of creating knowledgeable, responsible and caring citizens who are aware of and responsive to the rights of others, is an important school objective.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that in the social and environmental studies area, one of the aims of the present primary curriculum is to provide children with opportunities of planning and working together, thereby giving valuable training for peaceful co-operation in later life.  At second level, the junior syllabus for civics has as one of its aims the inculcation of an understanding and acceptance of the principles of tolerance and peaceful co-operation with others.</P>

      <P>The vocational education committee has again sought ESF aid for training programmes for the period 1994-99 to be operated under the auspices of the North West Community Development Institute.  Following discussions with officials of my Department, information concerning the precise nature of the training programmes proposed for the period 1994-99 were submitted to my Department on 9 December 1993.</P>
      <P>A preliminary examination of the proposals indicates that they do not justify the maintenance of a separate provision for County Donegal vocational education committee within my Department's Structural Funds allocation.  Most of the activities identified for the institute for the period 1994-99 are programmes which can be undertaken by or in conjunction with other State-aided agencies or as part of the normal activity of the vocational education committee.</P>
      <P>My Department will be in further contact with the vocational education committee in the matter at an early date.</P>

      <P>The school transport scheme was basically designed to cater for children in rural areas, who, if living a long distance from school, otherwise might have difficulty in attending regularly.  In urban areas, the nearest school is rarely more than 2 miles from a pupil's home and the provision of transport is not normally necessary.</P>
      <P>However, children in urban areas, whose parents wish them to attend their nearest school under Protestant management, all-Irish school or multi-denominational school, may be issued with bus tickets, provided that otherwise they satisfy the conditions of the school transport scheme, on both age and distance grounds.  Children between 4 and 10 years must live at least 2 miles from their nearest school, and be attending that school, in order to benefit.  Children over 10 must live at least 3 miles away.</P>
      <P>In the case in question, the nearest all-Irish school is now Scoil Chualann, Bray and the children may avail of free tranpsort to this school.  However, they are no longer eligible for free transport to Scoil Lorcáin.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 15 and 157 of 17 November 1993, which stated that the Government had decided not to proceed with the provision of a 50 metre international swimming pool complex and that the provision of a facility to meet the training needs of Irish swimmer and national and limited international competitions was being considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present there is no 50 metre swimming pool in Northern Ireland although <Col N="367" /> a feasibility study has recently been completed regarding the provision of such a facility.  It is the responsibility of the Irish Amateur Swimming Association to arrange for the use of swimming facilities for its members in respect of which special grant assistance is provided by my Department.</P>

      <P>An application has been received from Kilkenny County Council for financial assistance towards the cost of the provision of a leisure complex, including a swimming pool.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Youth and Sport has visited the existing pool in Kilkenny and has held meetings with officials of Kilkenny County Council in relation to the application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the allocation of a grant towards the project will be considered <Col N="368" /> in the context of the funds available to my Department in 1994 for the major sports capital programme and following a detailed analysis of all aspects of the proposal including the commissioning of a feasibility study.</P>
