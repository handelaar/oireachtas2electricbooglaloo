      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 6 and 3.  It is further proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: (1) business shall be interrupted at 4.45 p.m. today.  (2) The proceedings on the Committee and remaining Stages of No. 6, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 2.15 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall in relation to amendments include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for the Environment.  (3) The proceedings on No. 3 if not previously concluded shall be brought to a conclusion at 4.45 p.m. and the following arrangements shall apply to the debate: (i) the opening speech of the Minister and of the main spokesperson for the Fine Gael Party, the Progressive Democrats and the Technical Group shall not exceed ten minutes in each case; (ii) the speech of each other Member called on shall not exceed five minutes; and (iii) the Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon not later than 4.40 p.m. to make a speech in reply not exceeding five minutes.</P>

      <P>May I now ask if the proposal in respect of No. 1 that business shall be interrupted at 4.45 p.m. <Col N="366" /> today is satisfactory and agreed?  Agreed. Are the proposals for dealing with No. 6 agreed?  Agreed.  Are the proposals for dealing with No. 3 satisfactory and agreed?  Agreed.</P>

      <P>I am sure the House would wish to convey its congratulations to the Garda Síochána on the success they have had in detecting drug importation into this country.  I am sure the House would also wish to ensure that the laws we pass here give them the full support they need.  In that context would the Taoiseach agree to two measures in relation to money laundering which is helpful to the trade, because it enables drug barons to put their money to advantage. Firstly, I request the Taoiseach to enact promised legislation to outlaw money laundering and, secondly, to reconsider the proposed tax write-off in so far as it may help money laundering by drug barons?</P>

      <P>I know the Taoiseach is willing to dispense with procedures in respect of good causes when necessary. Would the Taoiseach agree that it would be useful if he, myself and other party leaders were to have an opportunity to briefly congratulate Peter Sutherland on his appointment to the most senior position of any Irish person in recent memory?  It would be useful if the House wished him well in the tremendous task he is undertaking.  The Taoiseach can sometimes be quite generous and I ask him to agree to this proposal.</P>

    <Title>Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1993 &mdash; Committee and Final Stages.</Title>
    <P>SECTION 1.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, subsection (1), between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following definition:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;the Minister&rsquo; means the Minister for the Environment;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister to consider the inclusion of a definition for the expression &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; which appears quite regularly in the Bill.  It also includes expressions such as &ldquo;a Minister&rdquo; or &ldquo;Minister of Government&rdquo; and others but there is no doubt as to who &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; refers to.  As the word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; may be interpreted in a different context it would be appropriate that &ldquo;the <Col N="371" /> Minister&rdquo; be defined as the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>When I raised this matter on Second Stage yesterday the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Stagg, indicated that the definition was included in the 1963 Act, the Principal Act and, as everything refers to that Act, there was no need for this amendment.  The 1963 Act defines &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; as the Minister for Local Government, not the Minister for the Environment.  It is not a major issue and I do not intend to delay the House on it but for correctness the proper definition of &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; should be included in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is unnecessary. Under section 7 (4) this Bill when enacted will be construed along with the previous planning Acts.  All definitions in these Acts, including the term &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; as defined in section 2 of the 1963 Act, are carried through to this Bill.  If I were to accept the amendment it would create the same problems with regard to &ldquo;planning authority&rdquo;, &ldquo;development&rdquo; and the words that are used and repeated throughout the Bill.  There is no necessity for this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to quibble with the Minister but he has just made my case for me.  The 1963 Act defines &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; as the Minister for Local Government.  It is some years since the Minister and his Department were referred to as the Minister for or the Department of Local Government and it requires amending now.  I will withdraw my amendment to allow the Minister to reconsider it on Report Stage.  The Minister for the Environment is not referred to in the 1963 Act but perhaps the Minister can indicate that in subsequent planning and development Acts over the years up to last year this has been corrected. I will raise this matter again on Report Stage when the Minister will have had time to consider it.</P>

      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Section 1 agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.&mdash;Where it is proposed to make regulations under this Act, a draft of each regulation shall be laid before each of the Houses of the Oireachtas and shall not come into effect until such time as a motion approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment would require the draft of any regulation which is to be made under this Bill to be brought before the House for approval by the Houses of the Oireachtas before it could have effect. This amendment is critical to this Bill. There are at least four parts of the Bill where the Minister is being empowered to make regulations.  First, he is empowered to make regulations under section 2 to exclude any development where public safety, administration of justice, national security or defence is involved and also where the development requires a licence or consent or some other form of authorisation included in any other enactment. Section 2 enables the Minister by regulation to exclude from the remit of the Bill and from the requirement to apply for planning permission a range of <Col N="373" /> activities.  The Minister can do that by way of regulation.</P>
    <P>Second, the Minister can by way of regulation provide for a range of procedures governing the consultation which will have to be followed by local authorities where they wish to carry out a development.  Third, in section 3, the most extraordinary section of the Bill, the Minister can, by regulation, modify or adapt any provision of any of the planning Acts for the purposes of securing or facilitating its application to development by or on behalf of a State authority.  This is a very wide ranging power.  Effectively it gives the Minister power by regulation to change the planning Acts in so far as they apply to State authorities.</P>
    <P>Section 4 refers to regulations dealing with environmental impact assessment. Two issues arise here.  First there is the increasing tendency in legislation brought before this House to give to Ministers of Government widespread powers to introduce changes in the law by way of regulation.  The theory is that these regulations may be annulled by the Oireachtas, but in practice that does not happen.  Deputy Doyle has a motion on the Order Paper seeking to annul the regulations dealing with access to information. I do not know whether we will ever have an opportunity to debate that matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be debated next Wednesday during Government time and I thank the Minister for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to hear that, but it is very much the exception rather than the rule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is open Government. I cannot be more helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the first occasion that has happened in a long time and I am very glad the matter will be debated. That underlines the need for this amendment, because since the Minister is prepared to allow time to be made available for a motion seeking to annul regulations, the same purpose could be achieved by <Col N="374" /> having a procedure whereby the regulations would be put before the House in the first place and debated.</P>
      <P>Virtually all speakers, certainly on this side of the House, on this Bill yesterday drew attention to the many areas in which the Government is seeking exemptions for development, and I spoke about the effect of these exemptions.  As the Bill stands there is virtually no State development which would have to apply for planning permission if the Government decided by regulation to exempt it from that requirement.  The Minister in his contribution yesterday and the Minister of State in winding up the debate were at pains to assure us these exemptions and regulations would be introduced only in exceptional cases.  For example, we were told that the purpose of section 3 is to allow for minor technical adjustments to be made to the planning legislation in order to facilitate State development and that section 2 would apply only in cases of national security, to prevent criminals from having access to plans for prisons, Garda stations and so on.  That is very laudible and I am sure everybody would agree with it, but that is not what is stated in the Bill.  Under the Bill the Minister has freedom to make regulations to exempt any development he wishes.</P>
      <P>If the Minister wants to introduce regulations he should bring them before the Houses of the Oireachtas for debate and we will decide whether they are desirable or necessary.  Nobody would argue about not having widely available the detailed plans of Army barracks, Garda stations and so on.  However, we would argue that other State development, whether it be a scheme of local authority houses, Government Department buildings or, as has been the subject of controversy in recent times, interpretative centres, should be subject to planning permission and any attempt by the Government to exempt them from that requirement should not be allowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, as the Minister has reminded us, we are in the era of open Government and there is a willingness on the Minister's part to facilitate everybody and have matters debated, there is now a mechanism <Col N="375" />&mdash; the committee system &mdash; to deal with secondary legislation.  The previous excuse that to bring regulations before the House would clog up the work of the House does not apply now.  Yesterday morning we passed without debate a set of regulations governing local government matters.  A series of changes which were not controversial were passed here without debate.  Regulations would not clog up the working of the House.</P>
    <P>This is a necessary democratic measure, particularly in view of the criticisms made yesterday about the Minister's power to exempt all State development from the remit of the Bill. The problem is that while we may receive all the assurances in the world from the Minister and Minister of State that they are not going to do certain things and that measures are introduced only for minor reasons and will be used only in exceptional cases, Ministers' scripts are not legislation.  What the Minister says in his script may not be in line with what is laid down in legislation and some amendment must be inserted to reconcile the two matters.  This amendment would reconcile what the Minister states is his intention and what he has in practice put into legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the thrust of this amendment.  I would not quibble, nor I am sure would Deputy Gilmore, about the specific wording if it is not to the liking of the Minister.  A serious problem arises in regard to the amount of legislation introduced by way of regulations. When we talk glibly of a democratic deficit, normally we refer to the lack of communication between national parliaments and what is going on in Brussels. But there is an enormous deficit within this House whereby the democratically elected politicians cannot debate, offer an opinion, or amend legislation introduced here.  The enabling mechanism, that is the regulation, needs urgent attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Minister and all the Whips, including Deputy Keogh, for allowing the annulment motion which I tabled on the <Col N="376" /> Order Paper last week to be taken during Government time next week.  I do not know when last an annulment resolution was taken in Government time.  Perhaps this is the first evidence of letting in the light, but we will reserve judgment in that regard.  It is most important not only to debate the access to information regulations within the 21 sitting days as laid down but also that regulations be debated in future during Government time, as is requested by the mover of this amendment. If agreement was given to a debate during Government time annulment resolutions on regulations generally, many of us would be much happier.  Much EC legislation is introduced by way of regulation and Deputies increasingly feel precluded from debating such legislation that will impact on people.  I ask the Minister to take on board the amendment in the name of Deputy Eamon Gilmore.</P>
    <P>The Deputy pointed out that the Bill provides many opportunities for the Minister to introduce various amendments to this Bill by way of regulation.  Perhaps the Minister would look at section 3 which causes me most concern in relation to these regulations because, under it, the Minister can regulate, modify or adapt any provision of the Acts.  In other words the Minister can use a regulation to repeal or modify legislation enacted in this House.  In March this year the High Court judgment on the angel dust case found that we should not repeal enactments of this House by way of regulation.  I know there is not a strict parallel in this case but legal opinion is that if a case was taken in relation to legislation through regulations to repeal existing enactments, it would not be in order.  The Minister must accept that there is some legal doubt about the regulation procedure, I ask him to accept Deputy Gilmore's amendment, but if he cannot amend the Bill before us to ensure that Deputy Gilmore's substantive point is catered for in this Bill.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment. Yesterday I pointed out that this Bill is riddled with opportunities for regulation <Col N="377" /> by the Minister.  I thank the Minister for consenting to a brief debate on access to information next week.  However, we will not have the opportunity to annul those regulations, although we appreciate the opportunity to debate them so that we can make our views known.</P>
      <P>I oppose section 3 of this Bill on the principle of regulations.  Under the committee system we will perhaps have the opportunity to debate regulations in full but to try to bypass the Oireachtas by giving the Minister such wide discretionary powers is a very bad precedent. Because there is such a huge Government majority we are even more aware of the need for transparency and openness.  Whereas the Minister might consent to debate regulations from time to time, that is not good enough.  Will the Minister reconsider this amendment and take on board our fears because it is not good enough to have a nod and a wink approach to legislation?  We want our approach accepted, and we want the Minister to consider accepting some of the amendments put down.</P>

      <P>Secton 3 gives wide-ranging power to the Minister to change anything in legislation from 1963 to date, which is going too far and Deputy Gilmore's amendment will go some way towards sorting that out.</P>
      <P>I commend Deputy Avril Doyle for her persistence in relation to the matter which will be debated next week.  I thank the Minister for allowing the debate. That is a first step in the right direction and the acceptance of Deputy Gilmore's amendment would be the second.</P>

      <P>It is a long tradition whereby changes to primary legislation are made by regulation.  It is not true that this happens without the control of the Oireachtas.  The Oireachtas specifies the parameters under which delegated authority is given to the Minister.  In the case of this Bill the parameters are extremely well defined.  In regulating under this Bill the Minister will work closely to a formula approved by the Oireachtas.  The Oireachtas also supervises the Minister in using delegated powers through the rights in every legislation to review, annul and, in rare cases to confirm, by the Oireachtas.  Deputy Gilmore knows as well as I, that a liberal use of the affirming resolution would bring business in the House to a standstill and would seriously delay orderly public administration.  The annulling resolution provision is a discriminating instrument and enables the Oireachtas to exercise judgment and discretion in its supervision of Ministers. The confirming resolution offers no such discretion.  The provisions in the Bill are important and for that reason the regulatory powers are very tightly circumscribed by the Bill.  The confirming resolution is not necessary or desirable in this case, and I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last October when a general election overtook a referendum which was <Col N="379" /> already designated we were fortunate to have legislation, designed in the 1940s, where the most unlikely event was foreseen. Very often in our efforts to develop primary legislation we endeavour to take account of as many as possible of the type of events that will occur.  However, at the same time we know very well from experience that we shall not be able to cater for certain types of eventualities.</P>
    <P>As I said, changing primary legislation by regulation has been the traditional norm in this House for a very long time.  I predict that two things would necessarily happen if we were not to attempt to adopt this practice in a general way.  I am not saying that what we have done all along in the past should be carried through into the future.  Clearly, the whole planning process is undergoing a much more open examination with greater need for transparency.</P>
    <P>In regard to the regulations I am devising in relation to public notice requirements, I can inform the House that they are very forward-looking and will be introduced very soon.  Indeed, they will indicate that the time available to me following the passage of the primary legislation to consult and, without necessarily changing the content of previous laws, widen their scope and improve their composition, has been valuable.  Whoever might be in my place, I should not like the House to be so constrained at all times to ensure that everything would be on the plate from the very beginning.  I think Members across the House would appreciate that such would not be desirable or indeed possible.  I have some exciting news for the House in relation to section 3.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very interested in the Minister's <Col N="380" /> reasons for rejecting this amendment when he said that this would clog up the workings of the House.  If it is going to clog up the workings of the House the Minister must be thinking of making an awful lot of regulations under the provisions of this Bill, and this would arouse my worst fears about it.  Certainly, it is a long way from what we were told yesterday the Government intended doing under these various regulations.  I am looking at the Minister of State's closing remarks when replying to the debate here yesterday, when he told us:</P>
    <P>The only qualifications on the general application of normal planning controls will be those set out in section 2 of the Bill and the one year transitional period provided in section 5.  It will be seen that the exclusionary power under subsection (1) of section 2 can be exercised only in limited and clearly defined circumstances, and it is clear also that the power in subsection (2) of that section is of a reserve nature and would be used only in wholly exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <P>He continued later to tell us, again about subsection (2):</P>
    <P>..... I wish to comment only that it has been made clear that this power is of a reserve character.</P>
    <P>I am at a loss to know what constitutes reserve legislation.  For example, does it mean that when the Minister was drawing up this Bill he vowed to himself that the Government would never be caught again, as it was in the case of Mullaghmore and Luggala, facing a court decision, having done something it was not permitted to do under existing legislation? Does it mean that he could not anticipate all of the circumstances which might arise in the future and build them into the provisions of the Bill?  Does it mean that instead he inserted what is now called a power of a reserve character, which really means: &ldquo;I have not really thought out where all of this lead us in the future, but in case there is anything. I have not thought of, I am going to stick in a provision in the Bill I can exercise at <Col N="381" /> the time so that I will not be caught again.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that the Minister should be telling us now that, were we to seek a positive affirmation of these regulations, it would clog up the workings of the House whereas yesterday we were told by the Minister of State that this would be used in exceptional circumstances only, that it was a power of a reserve character, which might mean it might never be used at all and had been incorporated for technical purposes only. It is either one or the other; either it will clog up the workings of the House, in which case the Minister anticipates using it quite a lot, or it will not clog up the workings of the House and is to be used in exceptional circumstances only, in which case I do not see what is the problem in having the House affirm the regulations.</P>
    <P>This method of passing law is bad, passing a general type of Bill which then gives all of the power to the Minister. Repeatedly this House is being asked to do so.  Repeatedly the Minister comes in here with this new phraseology which is beginning to become very much the buzz word of this Government &mdash; that there is going to be consultation.  I am all for consultation with the public but I am certainly not for replacing the normal planning process with some kind of a more vague form of consultation.  It seems to me the Government is now in danger of turning this country into a nation of consultants; we shall all be consulting about everything.</P>
    <P>For example, we shall have two months consultation about Mullaghmore; we shall have further consultation about the Green Paper on Education, on the Roads Bill, on the power of local authorities to implement road motorway schemes, and so on which power is being taken from them.  Instead, we are to have a consultation process brought into being. Under the provisions of this Bill henceforth we shall have a consultation process for local authorities who want to carry out works &mdash; all very good but in circumstances in which the Minister wants to exclude State authorities from the obligation to apply for planning permission <Col N="382" /> he talks about there being a process of consultation and so on.  What he is forgetting to tell us is that, at the end of that process of consultation, he, or the Government Minister responsible for the State authority, will end up taking the decision in any event.  By all means, let us have processes of consultation but let us not substitute consultation for the independent planning process we have, which is open to the public and well known to them.  That would be going in the wrong direction, and simply dressing up, in some kind of mock democratic cloak, forms of consultation which are intended to be a replacement of public involvement in the decision-making process in the first place.  It would not be a substitute for subjecting State authorities to the normal planning process.</P>
    <P>What we have in this Bill is a mechanism whereby, at any time, the State can duck out of the obligation to apply for planning permission.  We are being told it is being introduced to oblige State authorities to apply for planning permission but stitched into the Bill are four different mechanisms which can be used by the Government to enable any State authority to duck out of the obligation of having to apply for planning permission. That is to be done by way of the Minister making a regulation which in practice &mdash; and I take the point that Deputy Doyle's case is the exception &mdash; means we shall never be given an opportunity of debating such in this House.</P>
    <P>I am pressing this amendment because it is critical to everything that was said yesterday, it is critical to this Bill and to the way in which the provisions of this Bill will be operated in the future.  I intend pressing this amendment because I believe these regulations should be brought before the House and debated. We have now four or five Select Committees which have the means of addressing these matters.  This assertion of its clogging up the workings of the House is an excuse for not having it brought forward.  In any event, it flies in the face of what we were told yesterday, that these would be exceptional measures only.</P>

      <P>I was amazed at what the Minister said in reply to the brief debate we have had on this amendment.  It appears to me that what he wants is to adopt a belt and braces approach in relation to these regulations.  If he is worried about its clogging up the workings of the House, I should point out that we have had long debate about a committee system here and its relevance.  I, for one, am very unhappy, and have said so in the course of debate in this House, about the format of those committees because, if they are to have any meaningful purposes, they must have subjects to debate. If the Minister insists in introducing regulations I suggest that at the very least the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs should be given an opportunity to debate those regulations. At present the committees are not overloaded and it will be a long time before they are.</P>

      <P>It will come as no surprise to the Minister to learn that I do not agree with him, but his reference to minor changes to be made by way of regulations galled me.  If only minor changes were involved the Minister would meet far less opposition and less concern would be expressed about this enabling procedure.  I consider that the regulations procedure is used excessively. None of us &mdash; I hope I am interpreting what my colleagues had to say correctly &mdash; is suggesting that we should do away with the regulations procedure <i>per se,</i> but it should only be used when minor changes have to be made to Acts. I cannot accept the Minister's point that only minor changes are made by way of regulations.  If provision was made for affirmative orders which would be dealt with in Government time we would feel far easier and democracy would be protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present greater use is being made of the regulations procedure whereby more and more legislation is being introduced by way of regulations.  This is anti-democratic and means that the democratic deficit is being increased.  Many members of the thinking public are asking us what <Col N="384" /> we are about, if we have any say or an input into legislation.  It amounts to government by diktat if the Government insists on retaining the present procedure whereby a motion must be tabled within 21 sitting days and taken in Private Members' time if the Opposition wants to have an order annulled.  The Minister should assure us that an affirmative order will be required, that it will be taken in Government time and that all shades of political opinion in this House will have an input into legislation introduced by way of regulations.</P>

      <P>Once again Deputy Gilmore has attempted to give the impression that we have a sinister intent in relation to certain provisions of the Bill, but I reject this absolutely.  During the past year legislation introduced by my Department has taken up about 25 per cent of Dáil time.  We are using the limited resources at our disposal to bring forward good social legislation dealing with planning, housing and electoral reform.</P>
      <P>We could decide that in all instances the primary legislation should include everything that normally would be prescribed in regulations; but it is well accepted, not just in this House but right across Europe, that that is not the road to take.</P>

      <P>As I have already indicated, to provide access to information I am quite prepared to have a good sensible discussion in Government time and will attempt in the context of this legislation to take on board some of the sensible comments made yesterday afternoon.  I will not however be able to accept the amendment; but I think we will still achieve the same result in regard to what is proposed, particularly in section 3 of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once again I wish to point out that we have no sinister intent or hidden agenda. Long before the Supreme Court made its decision I had put proposals to the Government in connection with the Bill <Col N="385" /> now before the House.  In the context of the planning laws I want the same system to apply in the case of State authorities and the private sector, but there will always be exceptions and these are well established.  Within the time available we are doing what we can to provide for this.</P>
    <P>On section 3, when the 1963 Planning Act was being drafted it was accepted that State authorities would not have to apply for planning permission.  There is no argument however that minor amendments to the <i>corpus</i> of legislation may be <Col N="386" /> required by way of regulations.  Nonetheless, I have to indicate in the strongest possible terms, in the context of what I will have to say to the House when we come to deal with section 3 or before then if there is a danger that we will not reach it, that it would be sensible to include these provisions and that when changes are being made I will avail of the wisdom of this House in determining which is the best path to take in the future.</P>

      <P>We now proceed to amendment No. 3 in the name of Deputy Avril Doyle.  I observe that amendment No. 4 is an alternative and amendments Nos. 10 and 24 are related. I suggest therefore that we discuss amendments Nos. 3, 4, 10 and 24 together.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  Before Deputy Doyle intervenes, I wish to announce to the House that the heading &ldquo;Section 3&rdquo; should appear before amendment No. 26 on page 3 of the green list of amendments dated 10 June 1993. Therefore, section 3 is opposed by Deputies Keogh and Gilmore.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1) (a), line 4, to delete &ldquo;provide that the Acts&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;provide that Part IV of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963 and any amendments made to the sections within Part IV by subsequent legislation&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Effectively, Part IV of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, is the critical part of the planning laws enacted to date.  It relates to the control of development and makes it necessary to obtain planning permissions, including permission for retention of existing structures built without prior planning permission, as well as the enforcement of planning control.  The wider exemption, which appears to be provided for in the Bill, if this amendment is not accepted, could effectively negate section 2 (1) (b) and section 4 which I understand is not the Minister's intention.  I am concerned that the broad sweep the Minister appears to be taking will mean that the retention and enforcement procedures could also be affected.</P>
      <P>I am trying to focus on what I understand is the Minister's intention in this subsection.  I ask the Minister to take my amendment on board which narrows the scope of his intent.</P>

      <P>The inclusion of Part IV of the principal Act effectively requires the State to apply for planning permission for the types of development it is proposed to exempt from planning permission. We are back to the core debate we have been having over the past two days, that State authorities should apply for planning permission for development and that there should not be exemptions. Ideally, it should be stated positively that there is a requirement on the State &mdash; as in all other cases &mdash; to apply for planning permission for its various developments. However, the Bill provides for a series of exclusions.  In this series of amendments we are seeking to exclude from the exclusions Part IV of the principal Act, the part of the principal Act that places an obligation on a person to apply for planning permission.  Therefore, with a <Col N="389" /> double exclusion there is an obligation on these bodies to apply for planning permission.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 3 seeks to amend subsection (1) (a) by substituting a more limited reference to Part IV of the 1963 Act and any subsequent amendments of that Part for the current reference to the planning Acts generally. I do not think that a change of this nature is desirable because it can lead only to confusion and uncertainty in the application of the provisions of the planning Act, apart from Part IV of the 1963 Act, to developments by or for State authorities. It is simpler and clearer to provide that the planning Acts in their entirety will not apply to development which is brought outside the scope of planning control and I cannot, therefore, agree to this amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 10 follows from amendment No. 3 and I have to reject it for the reasons I outlined.  However, there is an inconsistency between the two amendments.  Amendment No. 10 also includes a refernce to section 4 of the 1963 Act.  I am not sure why it does because the question of exempted development status is clearly not relevant if development controls under Part IV of the 1963 Act do not apply to the development. To put it another way, the question of exempted development status is irrelevant if planning permission is not necessary in the first instance.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 24, which seeks to amend section 2 (1) (a) (ii), is similar in content to amendment No. 10 and for the same reason, I cannot accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore's amendment No. 4 would have a different effect from the amendments proposed by Deputy Doyle. It would mean that the Minister for the Environment could provide for the non-application of any provision of the planning Acts other than Part IV of the 1963 Act, as amended, to particular categories of State development.  It would, therefore, entirely negate the purpose and intent of section 2 (1) (a) which is that there should be a mechanism for removing development from the scope of the <Col N="390" /> planning permission requirement where the nature of the development or the existence of an alternative development consent process makes this necessary. Since the amendment is completely at odds with the section, reluctantly I cannot accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister reconsider the substance of the amendment if he is not inclined to take the wording on board?  I understand what the Minister is trying to do in section 2 (1) (a) in allowing certain State development to be exempt from planning permission &mdash; we are really talking about new State development.  I would have thought that it may be sufficient to exempt them from planning permission. I am not sure why prisons, military airports or any such State developments deemed exempt, should be allowed to ignore the by-laws of an area or be excluded from the enforcement procedures in meeting certain environmental standards in relation to emissions or discharges or other enforcement measures.</P>
      <P>In this amendment I am not trying to thwart the Minister's efforts to exempt certain State development that he feels need to be exempt for reasons we will discuss later &mdash; even though I do not agree with the full range of development he includes.  It might be sufficient to exempt them from planning permission or from seeking permission for retention, but not from the enforcement procedures in the planning Act.  Surely they will have to conform generally with environmental and all the other standards applied to any development in the private or public sector?</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 3 &mdash; the others are consequential &mdash; tries to limit the exemption for those certain State developments to planning permission and, perhaps, a retention only but certainly not for general enforcement or a general obligation on these developments to conform with the natural physical standards that would be required of them in the area where they are built.</P>

      <P>I assure Deputy Doyle <Col N="391" /> that requirements in relation to discharges or emissions are adequately covered under the Acts governing air and water pollution and other Acts which are consolidated in the context of how the Environmental Protection Agency will operate.  If I were to accept the Deputy's amendment many of the provisions of the Planning Acts &mdash; other than Part IV of the 1963 Act &mdash; would continue to have effect and would have a notional application to State authority development. For example, the compensation provisions under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1990, would be applicable in principle but meaningless in practice because planning permission would not have been required in the first instance.  Because of the confused and complicated nature of that it is much better to leave the position as it is where the remaining part of the Act is in force.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of our worries about the use of this section derive from the way in which it is drafted.  Section 2 (1) (a) (i) states:</P>
      <P>such development is, in the opinion of the Minister, in connection with or for the purposes of public safety or order, the administration of justice, national security or defence;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of us try to understand what these general categories mean.  When replying last evening the Minister of State told us what was meant by the term &ldquo;security&rdquo;. He said the type of development which this embraces is Garda stations, court-houses, prisons and military installations and that there was nothing more wide-ranging than this involved.  If that is the case why is it not simply stated in the Bill. Opposition Members are worried about these general statements, for example, public safety or order.  What do they mean?  If what the Minister intends to exempt from the requirement to apply for planning permission and planning control are Garda stations, court-houses, prisons and military installations why does he not simply say that in the Bill?  We would <Col N="392" /> then know what we are talking about and would probably have less to argue about. By insisting on these general categories, which we all understand to mean Garda stations, court-houses and so on but which we fear may include more at some stage in the future, the Bill gives rise to problems and worries which could be alleviated if the Minister addressed himself to what is stated in the script.  We are back to the problem we have had during the debate on this Bill where the script says one thing and the Bill says something else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>No matter how I try I cannot convince Deputy Gilmore that there is nothing sinsister in the Bill.  I have dealt with his amendment and indicated that it would run counter to the provisions of the Bill.  In the context of Deputy Doyle's view, if no retention of planning permission is required it is difficult to imagine from where the enforcement problems would emerge.  I spelt out the security and military nature of the exemptions.  Primarily, the application is to deal with those situations but it is not possible to cover every eventuality, and beyond that I do not think I should be expected to go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment impinges on other amendments that deal with the same issue.  I support the point Deputy Gilmore has made that if Garda stations, court-houses, prisons and military installations are all that is being referred to by the Minister in relation to public safety or order, the administration of justice, national security or defence why can the Bill not state precisely that these are the developments which are exempt?  The concerns of many extend to the wider-ranging powers the Minister appears to take on himself in the loose language used in this section.  For example, will the construction of a Garda station or a court-house be subject to the county development plan in the functional area in which it is intended to be built?  We need some indication as to where it maybe permissible to erect a Garda station or, more important, a military <Col N="393" /> airport.  Can the powers that be in Dublin suddenly decide that they will construct a military airport in Carnsore ignoring Wexford county councillors?  Is there some reference to the councillors' development plan in their functional area?  There should be.</P>
      <P>I also suggest in an amendment that outline planning permission or an equivalent system which would elicit the same information which outline planning permission gives, be the maximum requirement for Garda stations, court-houses, prisons and military installations.  Outline planning permission deals only with the nature and character of the development and the location.  At least it would indicate to the local authority the size of the construction, its intended use and its location.  One may not wish to call it outline planning permission because that is not permission in itself but a procedure that would give notice to the local authority and to the planners involving that amount of information which is now included in an outline planning permission. That is the very least we can expect in terms of any exemption from full planning permission.  I see no difficulty with that.</P>
      <P>Nobody wants to know the internal layout of a prison; it is a security issue and it does not really trouble us where the sanitary facilities or the kitchens are located in the prison.  We assume the central authorities will know what they are doing when they are constructing such a development.  However, we want to know where it is intended to be located, the size of the structure and the character of the development, all of which are required in outline planning permission.  If such a procedure was involved I would be happy to accept exemption from the full planning requirements. Any exemption should only be for the purposes of public safety or order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the routine administration of justice &mdash; national security or defence &mdash; there is plenty of time to plan where a prison or a courthouse will be located.  In the normal course the Department will have a policy and a capital programme ranging over several years and in that case I do <Col N="394" /> not think the wide-ranging exemptions are needed.  In the case of an emergency or a public safety or order issue special powers are needed but routine administration does not need the wide-ranging exemptions the Minister is proposing to take upon himself.</P>
    <P>The other amendments, which are relevant to the amendment before us, seeks to narrow the Minister's powers in regard to section 4.  I accept some of the points the Minister made.  Perhaps my amendment, and others, do not scientifically meet the points we are trying to express.  However, I cannot accept that routine administration of justice, national security and defence planning developments require total secrecy.  If the Minister at least accepted that information should be supplied on the nature, character and location of developments similar to that for outline planning permission, I could accept much of what he is trying to achieve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the Minister three examples and he might state whether they would be required to apply for planning permission under the provisions of this Bill.  First, the LORAN C mast at Loop Head in County Clare has been the subject of controversy recently and has given rise to much local concern in regard to health and safety.  It is claimed that the mast will be used mainly for the purposes of navigation at sea and might be classified under the heading of public safety.  It has been suggested that it might be used for military and naval purposes, in which case it would be classified under the heading of national security. Would planning permission be required for that mast under those headings? Second, the proposed airport at Clifden in County Galway was also the subject of controversy.  If that airport was used as a base for the air, sea and rescue service or the Air Corps used it occasionally, would it be required to apply for planning permission under this legislation? Third, we all know the meaning of a courthouse in the traditional sense, but rooms in buildings which are not <Col N="395" /> courthouses are increasingly being used as rooms for the purposes of hearing court cases.</P>

      <P>Would planning permission be required in those circumstances? We all know what we mean by the traditional Garda station, court-house, prison and Army barracks. However, in practice, there is an increasing blurring of those distinctions.  For example, Garda stations are not what they used to be.  In an era of community policing, buildings other than the traditional Garda station may be used by Garda in their work.  For example, a house in a housing estate may be used by the Garda.</P>

      <P>It is intended that local authorities, elected members, An Bord Pleanála and everyone in the planning process should adhere as far as possible to county development plans; but there is scope for contravention at all levels &mdash; at local level for locally elected members and for An Bord Pleanála in circumstances where it is deemed necessary. For the purposes of this Bill it would not be appropriate to limit that facility to State or private development.  The playing field will be level.  Of course, contravention <Col N="396" /> is a serious matter and must be dealt with in the appropriate manner.</P>
      <P>The question of outline planning permission will be dealt with in a later amendment.  Deputy Doyle covered most of the points by saying that such planning permission would not necessary mean that a development could proceed but that there would still be a necessity to submit the detailed plans.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I hope I have dealt adequately with Deputy Gilmore's three examples.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies are losing sight of the fact that most State development will be subject to either the planning process or the consultative process.  Therefore, there is no question of any development being <Col N="397" /> exempt, except in exceptional circumstances where the consultative process is not in operation or the local authority is not obliged to indicate publicly the plans or location of the proposed development.  In 99.9 per cent of cases either full planning permission or the consultative process applies.  In a small number of problematic cases &mdash; for example, an Army post along the Border &mdash; it may not be deemed necessary or prudent to have a consultative process for security reasons.  Deputies will appreciate that in those circumstances a decision may be taken one day and the operation would be in full force the next day.</P>
    <P>As I have stated already, we are opening up the majority of State development to the planning process.  In cases where full planning permission is not required the consultative process applies and in a minority of exceptional cases this requirement is necessary.</P>

      <P>In page 3, subsection (1) (a) (i), lines 8 and 9, to delete &ldquo;, in the opinion of the Minister,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment proposes to delete the words &ldquo;, in the opinion of the Minister&rdquo;. It appears that we are engaging in tautology because this role is clearly provided for in section 2 (1) (a).  As that is the case I would like to refer to the wide powers the Minister is taking on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister can provide that Acts do not apply.  I listened carefully to his answer on the last two amendments.  It may be a small thing to the Minister, but people are concerned about consultative processes.  I accept what the Minister says about being open to consultation and so on.  However, one can disagree with a consultant's report and one can disagree with consultation.  No matter how wide consultation is, there is always the difficulty that people do not believe that <Col N="398" /> their views are being taken on board.  It may be that the proof of the pudding is in the eating and people will see that their views are being listened to, but people are sceptical about the whole nature of planning because of the history of planning in this country.  Anything that detracts from the transparency of a process should be looked at in a very sceptical way.  This is really a technical amendment, but I wanted to refer back to that point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Keogh seems to be of the view that the words which her amendment seeks to delete bring an element of subjectivity into the making of regulations, excluding development from planning control on security related grounds.  This is not the case.  The words are in fact an additional safeguard because they impose on the Minister for the Environment an express legal duty to form an opinion and consequently be satisfied that the development has a security dimension.  In effect, Deputy Keogh's amendment would weaken that requirement on the Minister for the Environment.</P>
      <P>That there may not be agreement with all consultants is as logical as night follows day.  However, there is an inherent presumption that planning problems can be solved when the most open, transparent and acceptable systems are in existence.  We all realise that there can be differences of opinion and that sometimes extremes on both sides cannot be accommodated.  We have had this argument before.  If we think we can satisfy everybody, then we are living in dreamland.  There will always be differences. The provision in the legislation which requires the Minister to be legally satisfied that there is a security dimension is a safer and better one.  It is not just a matter of the Minister's opinion.  He must be legally satisfied.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No 6:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1) (a) (i), lines 10 and 11, to delete &ldquo;the administration of justice, national security or defence; or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that the routine adminstration of justice, national security and defence needs the blanket exemption the Minister is providing.  I have made my point on this already.  Granting the Minister powers in cases of public safety or order, of emergency and other such critical occasions is all very well, but routine construction of any State development such as prisons, Garda stations, military installations and courthouses should be subject to some type of preliminary planning procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has already told me that outline planning permission is not permission and that one must go on to get full planning permission.  I know that. However, this Bill is providing for exceptions to the normal rules of the planning process.  I am asking the Minister to consider an exception along a different line and that routine construction of court-houses, jails, etc., should be notified to the local planning authority, at least providing the amount of information that would be provided in an application for outline planning permission.  An outline planning permission covers the nature and character of the development and the location of the development.  Basically, it is indicating on a map of an area where it is intended to build a courthouse or Garda station so that the local people will know where it is to be built and the intended usage.  I accept that there is a good case for not allowing the internal plans of courthouses and prisons to lie around in planning offices and on files for public inspection, but at the very least the amount of information now required in an outline planning permission application should be furnished for routine <Col N="400" /> capital developments such as Garda stations, courthouses, prisons and military installations.</P>
    <P>The Minister instanced the case of an Army Border post where if a problem arose tonight they might have to erect some type of observation structure for use tomorrow.  That would be dealt with in my proposed amendment because section 2 (1) (a) (i) would provide that such development, which in the opinion of the Minister is in connection with or for the purpose of public safety or order, would be excluded.  That would cover an Army observation post or any other military installation that needed to be constructed instantly to look after public safety or order.</P>
    <P>My amendments deal only with routine administration where, for example, Wexford town is to have a new courthouse or Enniscorthy a new Garda station.  There is really no reason why we might not know in advance where it is intended to locate such buildings and the nature and character of the development.</P>
    <P>If the Minister cannot take my amendments, which may not be to the satisfaction of the parliamentary draftsman in expressing what I am trying to say, I urge him to allow the provison of the equivalent information that is now available in an outline planning permission. The Minister can call it something else if it upsets him to call it an outline planning permission.  The Minister has the power to do that because he is making other and greater changes, but for routine administration of the areas the Minister is now completely exempting, I think the equivalent information available in outline planning permissions should be made available to the local authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support amendment No. 8.  The Minister seems unwilling to take on what is a very reasonable amendment and look at it carefully. I would ask that he do so because otherwise this Bill will create the false belief in people's minds that somehow the system has been opened up and that the community at large has some say over development in the way they have at <Col N="401" /> the moment when development is being carried out by private individuals.  It would simply be adding to the cynicism if yet again people could wake up one day and discover that there is a Garda station or a courthouse next door to them and have to ask how that happened and why they were not told about it.  Amendment No. 8 is a very good one because it does cater for the need for security and caution while at the same time enabling people to have some input into the planning of their area.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that nobody is infallible. It may be that Departments decide to put buildings in the wrong place.  One of the huge benefits of the planning process we have had in place and enjoyed since 1963 is that there are checks and balances.  That was one of the huge considerations in relation to the Luggala development; there were no checks and balances and nobody pointing out the weaknesses and the shortcomings and the fact that the development was in the wrong place.  The planning process has that benefit.  The Minister should acknowledge that and, in accepting this amendment, allow that the planning process is a good thing in itself because it can actually produce the right decisions which represent an accumulation of knowledge and wisdom on the part of the Department and of the community and the local authority.  This amendment has that strength and I ask the Minister to consider it seriously.</P>

      <P>Initially one might consider that section 2 (1) (a) is reasonable in that developments in relation to the administration of justice, national security and defence should be exempt, but there must be a case for monitoring such developments.  For that reason I support amendment No. 8.  That amendment alleviates concerns people may have in that regard, even though such concerns might be unnecessary.  For example, a Garda station might be built in close proximity to a residential area.  Such development may not cause concern initially, but it is important to alleviate potential concerns people may have. <Col N="402" /> Therefore I consider this a reasonable amendment and I would ask the Minister to accept it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Doyle has suggested it may be possible to have a new form of outline permission procedure for the development we are discussing which would not be subject to any subsequent approval.  While I accept this might overcome the problem of disclosure in respect of sensitive detail, such an arrangement would also give rise to problems.  It must be borne in mind that the location of security-related development is often strongly influenced by strategic considerations which extend beyond the normal considerations for planning and development.  While it is right and proper that full account should be taken of views of the relevant planning authority and local interests in relation to security-related proposals, I do not consider it would be practical or appropriate to bring about a situation where the final decision on the location of a development would rest with the planning process.  It is for those reasons that it is essential to have a mechanism which allows development which raises security issues to be taken outside the scope of planning controls. However, I hope I have made it clear on Second Stage that it will make use of the regulatory power under section 2 (1) (b) to ensure there is as much public information and consultation as possible consistent <Col N="403" /> with bona fide confidentiality requirements for developments of this kind.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore referred to the community input in regard to security matters and greater public involvement in such matters is welcome.  I am sure the Deputy would accept that the area of security far from accommodating full community involvement may pose a danger to members of the community in respect of the high level of crime today, which must be dealt with in all its facets.  Considerations in respect of the national security and defence areas must take priority because of the threat to life, limb and property involved in those areas. Those areas are different and they should not be interpreted as providing an open opportunity for any unnecessary irregular or unacceptable type developments. The consultative process will be used as much as possible, but in the final analysis the strategic decisions that must be taken in the public security area must also be considered and that is accepted by all those with whom I have discussed this matter.  Those matters must be considered and security in this area must be guaranteed as far as possible, otherwise the flexibility and ability of the forces to which we designate authority could often be compromised in their genuine efforts to secure the safety of the country.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1) (a), lines 12 to 16, to delete subparagraph (ii).</P>
      <P>Under section 2 I suggest that subsection 1 (a) (ii) be deleted.  I do not understand the need for this subsection and I await with interest the Minister's explanation. Apparently, any development subject to another statutory authorisation process will be exempt from the planning procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is mind-boggling to contemplate how wideranging this provision could be and perhaps the Minister would indicate the extent of the provision in this subsection. For example, a prospecting licence is now required for mineral extraction and mining; would future mining developments be exempt from planning permission? Would any development on the foreshore requiring a foreshore licence from the Department of the Marine be exempt from the planning process?  We can list processes in relation to many areas which take place under other authorisations. The justification for the exemption is that most of those other processes are considered in detail under the present procedures, particularly under the environmental impact statement <Col N="405" /> ment provisions, and that there would be an element of duplication if planning permission was also required.  I do not accept that.  The fact that environmental impact statements are now required means that a subsequent planning procedure would be efficient because the answers to difficult questions would be contained in the statement.  If that was part of the planning application it would be an efficient case to resolve in terms of the planning process.  I see no need for this wide-ranging exemption for any development now covered by another authorisation process.  In fact, many of these are controversial projects such as foreshore, mineral or ore extraction developments carried out under licence. Because they are of a controversial nature it is necessary that they remain within the planning procedure so that the local planning authority in whose functional area the development will take place will be allowed to lay down certain conditions to conform with the development plan and the environmental requirements of the area in which the development will be constructed.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's views and I will return to this matter at a later stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms. McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a peculiar section in the Bill which requires full explanation and I will certainly listen to the Minister with interest.  In relation to the previous section the Minister argued the point regarding national security and I am sure he acknowledges that we all share his concern about protecting our security forces.  We are all agreed on that issue but there must be local and public accountability and it is extraordinary that there is a wide-ranging let-out clause in this Bill covering various contentious developments in which local communities have a right to have their say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why should people have a say in whether someone adds an extension to a house but not in relation to whether a marina will be provided or whether mining will take place in the natural landscape bordering their village or town?  It makes no sense if one accepts the principle <Col N="406" /> of local accountability and democracy. If we do not accept this principle, we can insert as many sections and clauses as we wish but I understood this to be some flawed attempt to open up the system in regard to the general thrust of the Bill.  Quite clearly, if there are so many let-outs that it becomes meaningless people will realise that there is no real change.  Local communities want to have a say in contentious issues such as the development of a marina.  I have some experience regarding the provision of a marina which caused controversy and genuine concerns.  People need to feel they have some say in a proposed development.  Obviously, we are all aware of the mining controversy in Mayo.</P>
    <P>There was some justification for the previous section although it was overstated. This section does not seem to indicate any clear position regarding the principle undermining the planning process, namely, that people have a right to express their views when it comes to making a planning decision.  Why should the people not be heard in relation to these developments?</P>

      <P>We have now moved on to ensure that environmental impact <Col N="408" /> statements are carried out in relation to major projects.  There has been a significant change in terms of public involvement in this regard.</P>
      <P>Coast protection works under the Coast Protection Act, 1963, will be carried out only if I am satisfied that there is adequate provision for public notice and participation.  It is unreal for Deputy Doyle to suggest that the State or a State Authority will be directly involved in mining.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Even allowing for the distance Deputy Doyle can move from reality this is really stretching my patience. In circumstances where the State is involved, it would require full planning permission as in the case of a private developer at present requiring a prospecting licence and then requiring full planning permission before any activity could be undertaken.</P>
      <P>The foreshore is outside the jurisdiction of the planning authorities generally and outside the requirements of planning permission.  It is regulated by freeshore licences under the Forshore Acts of 1933 and 1962.  We cannot de-exempt development to which permission did not apply in the first instance.</P>
      <P>I reassure Deputies that the purpose of this section is to avoid unnecessary duplication and to satisfy me that the Acts to which these regulations apply have, in the first instance, adequate public consultative processes.  It is not envisaged that these provisions will apply in any other circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">

      <P>So far as I am aware drainage carried out by private individuals is not subject to planning permission &mdash; it certainly was not when a controversy arose in my area.  There is a very good argument for providing that all drainage be subject to planning permission because it would ensure the survival of wildlife and birdlife.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is Coillte Teoranta, and its many developments, exempt under the terms of this Bill?  Much of its developments, particularly in regard to commercial coniferous forests, should be strictly controlled by the planning process. I will not develop that point because time does not allow me to do so, but Coillte is a State authority and we are discussing development by State authorities, not by private individuals.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Act dealing with arterial drainage has been amended in the past six or seven years, but the public consultation process was not obvious at that time and I do not think it is now.  Even under environmental impact statements there is no public consultation process such as exists under the planning laws. For example, appeal procedures and so on are not as transparent or as easily accessible to the ordinary lay person as they are under the planning procedure. In all State and semi-State developments, even if there exists a statutory authorisation process, there should be no exemption unless the public has a right to participate and object, or at least to be heard, as is the case under the planning process.  That area I am concerned about.</P>

      <P>We should try to stay with the business of the day.  Coillte is not a State authority within the meaning <Col N="411" /> of this Bill but it is required to obtain planning permission for developments in excess of 200 hectares.  There are a number of provisions involved such as distance from the road and distance from a river, but these apply to a greater extent in the context of coniferous plantations, and I accept Deputy's point in that regard.  This matter must be considered in the context of the low percentage of land covered by trees, which is much less than the European norm.  There is ample scope for development in this area, but it must be done in an environmentally sensitive way&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;with greater emphasis on broadleaved trees.</P>
      <P>As regards drainage and wildlife conservation, referred to by Deputy McManus, it is important to put this matter in a wider context.  It is essential to have wetland and to protect wildlife, but there are parts of the country where drainage is essential.  There are two reasons for this; an economic reason in terms of the survival of the people who live on the land and, more important, to prevent flooding of towns and villages. People living on a hill who do not experience flooding problems may suggest that drainage should be subject to planning regulations, but there are wider considerations to be taken into account. When the Deputy is free I will take her to parts of my constituency where some of those problems occur.  It would not be fair to make the drastic changes suggested by Deputy McManus such as subjecting all drainage to planning laws.  In relation to pet projects, Deputy Keogh from time to time has a slightly suspicious mind&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In amendment No. 14 we recognise that EIS procedures are rather new and it is quite hard for professional people to deal with this.  Experience is a great teacher.  Environmental impact statements I have seen have varied a lot in quality and that gives rise to a concern that there should be some way of assessing the professionalism of the EIS.  I have seen good studies and in one instance a very poor one.  There is a presumption that once the professionals are brought in and the EIS is done, everything is all right.  There is no harm in assessing the professional work to see if it is adequate, if for no other reason than that this is a new area for professionals to be involved in.  For example, the EIS in relation to Luggala is now being cited in educational establishments dealing with this field of work as an example of how not to produce an EIS.  I worked as an architect.  I know people are inclined to underestimate the inadequacies of the professions and it is no harm to have some system of checking to see if the work being carried out is adequate and sufficiently tuned to the problem.  Unless at least one of these amendments is accepted, there will not be an automatic assessment of the work.</P>
      <P>There is a weakness in the present system.  We need to learn from the experience of having environmental impact statements carried out in that there is enormous variation in EISs coming forward, ranging from very good to the less good.  We should be conscious of that and ensure that some appropriate system is in place.  An Bord Pleanála needs to be opened up and made less secretive, but there is no other form of appeals procedure in place.  It can be reformed, but it needs to be brought within the system in relation to environmental impact statements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what has been said here already.  My amendment No. 13 purports to add to section 2 (1) (b) (iv) the provision that in the event of anybody being dissatisfied with the content or adequacy of an EIS provided <Col N="416" /> under this Act, that person may appeal to An Bord Pleanála who will determine whether or not the EIS is adequate and, if it determines it to be inadequate, it may require the compilation of further studies as provided for under existing environmental impact assessment regulations. For the reasons already given by Deputy McManus, I feel my amendment is reasonable, because there is an enormous disparity in the types of environmental impact statements now being produced from different sources.</P>
      <P>The Minister might consider examining this whole area of environmental impact analysis regulations.  Thankfully, it has spawned a new industry of environmental engineers and environmental professionals with one title or another. But there is no national accreditation of this new professional league.  Therefore there is a huge disaparity in standards between self-appointed environmentalists right to the top professionals. We still lack a national environmental data bank, as the Environmental Protection Agency struggles into existence. When it is finally up and running, I hope this will be one of the first tasks it will be properly resourced to undertake. Because of the lack of environmental data, resources play a huge part in determining whether or not a particular EIS is extensive.  Given the variety of standards and the disparity between standards of environmental impact statements at present, it is reasonable to expect that from time to time there will be dissatisfaction with a particular EIS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment No. 13 allows anyone disssatified, particularly with a State development, which normally is of some magnitude, to have recourse to An Bord Pleanála.  In the interests of local democracy, of this so-called open Government, in the interests &mdash; dare I use the Taoiseach's phrase of some months ago? &mdash; of letting in the light, what is the Minister afraid of?  Why is he afraid to allow third parties go to An Bord Pleanála if they are unhappy with any EIS?  I do not think the Minister has anything to fear in 99.9 per cent of cases.  But he is giving rise to the accusation that there is some cloak <Col N="417" /> and dagger exercise being engaged in throughout this Bill because of the lack of transparency in the application of procedures. I would ask the Minister to allow access to An Bord Pleanála by any dissatisfied party in relation to any environmental impact statement.</P>
    <P>Similarly my second amendment No. 19, which we are also discussing now, deals with section 2 (1) (b) (vi).  That subsection says:</P>
    <P>the reference to a specified person of any dispute or disagreement with respect to proposed development between a State authority and the planning authority for the area in which the proposed development is to be carried out,</P>
    <P>Whom has the Minister in mind?  I presume the Minister for Local Government. Could we have specific reference to An Bord Pleanála, as I have asked here?  Why is the Minister afraid of the referral to An Bord Pleánala of any dispute or disagreement with respect to proposed development between a State authority and the planning authority for the area in which a proposed development is to be carried out?  I have no difficulty in this respect.  Does the Minister not trust An Bord Pleanála with the details of a State development?  Is the Minister not satisfied to be said by the board in terms of the outcome of its deliberations, or what is his coyness to refer specifically to An Bord Pleanála at that point?  I take it the Minister will not resort to the Environmental Protection Agency, but that would be another option.  I am happy with An Bord Pleanála, given that that is the procedure we have in place, warts and all.  I agree with Deputy McManus that we shall have another opportunity to discuss the actual functioning of An Bord Pleanála and the lack of openness on the part of that body, but it is there and generally does a very good job.</P>
    <P>May I please have my amendment No. 19 accepted by the Minister.  All the concerns and suspicions about what the Minister is really at in relation to this Bill could be defused if he would leave that <Col N="418" /> procedure there for any aggrieved third party, a procedure that has been tried and tested over time and which I think most people feel operates reasonably well.  I do not need to elaborate my case any more.  I feel the Minister merely needs to allow an out for aggrieved objectors on both those amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that once I had deleted section 3 I did not have to undergo any further tests on the question of the integrity of what I wanted to do. Unfortunately, I am still being subjected to a certain amount of stress on this one.</P>
      <P>The effect of the amendments proposed would be to incorporate An Bord Pleanála into the approval process for developments either deemed to be too sensitive to be subject to normal planning controls or where there is an alternative approval system.  I must disagree fundamentally with the approach being adopted by Members on the far side of the House on this matter.  The overall thrust of this Bill is to apply normal planning controls to the majority of developments by State authorities &mdash; a decision, I might add, which the Government took some considerable time before the Supreme Court judgment was given.  The Government took that decision at a time when the accepted wisdom was &mdash; and supported by one High Court judgment &mdash; that the State was exempt from planning controls.  The decision was taken in the interest of greater openness in regard to State development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our intention was, and still is, to apply the normal planning process to the vast bulk of development by State authorities. However, we must draw the line at certain matters of national security where it would be patently inappropriate to apply the normal planning process, with plans floating about in local authority offices or in the offices of An Bord Pleanála.  What the Government is trying to achieve in this Bill is to provide, even in those cases, a system of public consultation, which of necessity falls short of the full planning process but which nonetheless gives full opportunity to the public and public authorities <Col N="419" /> to express their views on developments proposed in this sensitive category.</P>
    <P>Frankly, I am disappointed at the approach of Members opposite, who on Second Stage welcomed the principle of the Bill but now seek through these amendments to undermine its fundamental objectives.  I want to make it clear to Members opposite that the regulatory powers this section proposes will enable a flexible approach to be taken to the different categories of development, even within the justice, national security or defence envelope.  It may well be that in the case of certain categories of development it would be possible to invoke the services of a third party in resolving a dispute, but in particularly sensitive cases it would not.  Even where a dispute-resolving mechanism is to be applied, I do not consider it appropriate to tie the arbitration process to An Bord Pleanála as the amendment in the names of Deputies Doyle and Keogh would seek to do.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (1) (b) (vi) provides a mechanism which in certain circumstances could be embodied in An Bord Pleanála, but not necessarily or exclusively.  Very often when we are having a discussion like this on planning there are derogatory references to our planning system.  I should say I have exhaustively examined systems all over Europe and have found quite a number with no third party appeals procedure.  In Denmark, where there is no planning appeals procedure whatsoever, planning permission is given by a local authority or their courts.  As Members will know, that is a country with a great general environmental policy.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we should realise that we have here a very open system which allows people to process their claims, objections or disagreements.  That will be the same situation for the vast majority of cases coming under the provisions of this Bill.  We are dealing here with the more sensitive developments and the Deputy is asking me to make provision for an appeal to An Bord Pleanála but that brings us back to an earlier argument. <Col N="420" /> I do not want to delay the House, suffice it to say that if there is a dispute I will be prepared, by way of regulations, to ask An Bord Pleanála to become involved in some instances.</P>

      <P>Section 2 (1) (b) (iv) reads: &ldquo;the preparation of an environmental impact statement with respect to proposed development, the contents of such a statement and the making available for inspection or purchase by members of the public of such a statement....&rdquo;  This provides for a degree of openness on this matter which will satisfy a number of people.  I do not know why, therefore, there should be a difficulty in making provision for an appeals process because this would seem to be a natural extension. It seems that people will have access to information but if they have a problem what can they do?  The logical thing is to provide for an appeals mechanism.</P>
      <P>I have tabled an amendment to the part of the Bill in which the words &ldquo;specified person&rdquo; are used.  We should specify which third party we are talking about as the wording is too loose.  While a degree of openness is provided for there is not a safeguard when things go wrong.  The Minister should go one step further and reassure people on this matter.</P>

What is the point in making available for inspection or purchase by members of the public an environmental impact statement if all they can do is read it and allow their blood pressure to rise and have no outlet in which to make their views heard?  The Minister is causing trouble for himself and he should drop the pretence that the people will be involved if he will not listen to their views on the statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We might be able to reach agreement on section 2 (1) (b) (vi) which includes the words &ldquo;specified person&rdquo;.  The Minister said that in some cases he may refer the matter to An Bord Pleanála but that he wants to retain the option of referring it to the Environmental Protection Agency in others.  Will the Minister consider including the words &ldquo;or body&rdquo;?  The <Col N="421" /> wording would then read &ldquo;the reference to a specified person or body&rdquo;.  As it stands, it seems that the Environmental Protection Agency and An Bord Pleanála are excluded, because neither of them is a person.  I would be reasonably happy if there was an avenue to An Bord Pleanála, the Environmental Protection Agency or to a Minister who might arbitrate on the matter.</P>

    <P>I hope the Minister will not lecture me about the need to make harsh decisions. On this amendment, we are not even trying to suggest that a decision should be made.  If bodies, such as An Bord Pleanála, will be available or if the EIS has relevance for a local authority why <Col N="423" /> not give them the information?

      <P>If the Minister does not accept this amendment we will have to raise questions about his approach.  It is a reasonable request.  The Minister should remember that very often local authorities are the human face of bureaucracy and that local councillors have to translate enigmatic decisions made at the top so that they can be easily understood by the public.  Very often local authorities feel that they are by-passed when it comes to the making of decisions by central Government.  These amendments propose that the information should be given to the relevant local authority and to An Bord Pleanála.  The Minister may underestimate the distance which exists between ordinary people and central Government in terms of the giving out of information.  Any measure which can bridge that gulf will be beneficial.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the relevant local authority is concerned, section 2(1)(b)(ii) allows regulations to require the State authority proposing a development to give the relevant planning authority any notice, documents, particulars, plans or other information which may be specified in the regulations.  For that reason, I do not consider that the specific provision for giving EIS-related submissions to the planning authority, as proposed by the <Col N="424" /> Deputy, is necessary.  However, I will give very careful consideration to the intent underlying this amendment when I am designing the regulations.</P>
    <P>With regard to the proposal that EIS-related submissions should be given to An Bord Pleanála, I wish to point out that the Board will be involved in the procedure of public notice and involvement to be established under section 2(1)(b) only if it is specified as the body to which disputes between the promoting State authority and the local authority concerned are to be referred.  If the Board is so specified the power under section 2 (1) (b) (ii) could in any event be used to ensure that all relevant information, including possibly EIS-related submissions received by the State authority, is made available to it.  I think it is clear that the Board will have complete access to the documentation in all the cases in which it is involved.  I intend to put this proposal into effect in the regulations; there is no need to do this in primary legislation.</P>

      <P>In page 4, subsection (1) (b) (vii), lines 5 and 6, after &ldquo;considerations&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, especially any conservation or preservation designations provided for under the Acts as well as any environmental studies relating to the intended location prepared by the relevant authority; or by any statutory or official body since the Acts came into effect in 1964 even if that body is no longer extant&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to try to prevent any anticipated environmental conflict in terms of the siting of a proposed development by the State.  If the State insists on a particular location for a development which is enviromentally sensitive, these issues should be evaluated from the outset, preferably by means of an environmental impact statement. The intention in this amendment is that a State authority should at the outset have regard to existing planning studies or strategies in terms of site selection criteria which have been adopted by local authorities or to any planning studies produced directly by such bodies or commissioned by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to recognise that many of our planning studies were produced by An Foras Forbartha, a body which did much excellent work in its day.  These studies are still fundamental in terms of conservation of our natural and manmade heritage.  I am referring to studies such as the Inventory of Outstanding Landscapes in Ireland which was published in 1977 and the Areas of Scientific Interest in Ireland which was published in 1981.  Neither of these categories enjoys statutory protection, although the Office of Public Works has started to re-survey the areas of scientific interest with a view to including them within the natural heritage <Col N="426" /> areas which were intended to have statutory protection under the Wildlife Bill, whenever we will see that.  I am particularly interested in works carried out by bodies which are no longer extant, works which are essential to our understanding, appreciation and proper planning and development of many areas.  I hope the Minister will accept my amendment.</P>

      <P>Section 2 (1) (b) (vii) provides that regulations establishing a procedure of public notice and consultation for a limited range of developments should be taken outside the planning process by way of regulations under section 2 (1) (a) which may require the promoting State authority to have regard to specified matters or considerations. Deputy Doyle's amendment appears to be designed to spell out what these matters and considerations should include.  However, it is not clear to what the Deputy is referring in any conservation or preservation designation and environmental studies prepared by the relevant authority or any statutory or official body since the planning Acts came into force.  I think the Deputy will agree that the wording of the amendment is vague and would be open to many different interpretations.  The matters raised by the Deputy could be best dealt with by way of regulations as distinct from primary legislation.  I will examine these matters in the context of the regulations.</P>

      <P>In page 4, subsection (2) (a), line 14, to delete &ldquo;or is otherwise necessary in the public interest&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment proposes to delete the phrase &ldquo;or is otherwise necessary in the public interest&rdquo; from section 2 (2) (a).  I raised this matter in my Second Stage contribution.  This entire section seems to border on the unconstitutional.  I am not a constitutional lawyer but this section appears to enable a Minister to make an order which, in effect, is legislation. I have great fears about this.  I am seeking to restrict the Minister's powers in this regard by deleting the words &ldquo;or is otherwise necessary in the public interest&rdquo; from this section.  My advice &mdash; I seek the Minister's guidance in this respect &mdash; is that the Bill as currently drafted would create a power equivalent to section 84 of the 1963 Planning Act, as it existed prior to the recent Supreme Court decision.  I am seeking in my amendment to restrict the scope of this section.  I should like to hear the Minister's views on the amendment.  Whatever about exercising power for the purpose of public safety or order and the administration of justice why must a Minister be given wide discretionary powers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>This could be described as a problem of setaside.  In this section, the Minister wants to set aside the planning legislation in certain cases where he can make an order allowing certain developments to go ahead irrespective of the planning legislation.  I do not have any argument about works of that type going ahead in cases of accidents or emergencies, for example after a bad storm a road, a bridge or a building may be damaged and require certain emergency work.  We all understand such work is urgent and the Minister can make an <Col N="428" /> order in those circumstances.  However, it is proposed that the Minister will have that power in cases that are described here as &ldquo;otherwise necessary in the public interest&rdquo;.  That is a wide canvass.  Virtually any development by or for a State body could be described as being in the public interest.  When a nuclear power station was proposed for Carnsore Point it was argued at that time that it was in the public interest.  I do not have any difficulty with retaining the provision in regard to accidents and emergencies &mdash; that is very obviously necessary &mdash; but I do not accept the wider sweep of development deemed necessary in the public interest.  In an emergency, it is fair enough that the Minister can make an order as he is subsequently accountable to the House for that but why, in cases which are neither an accident nor emergency, can he not proceed in the normal way as set down in legislation?  Will the Minister agree to delete that provision?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the case made by the two previous speakers on this significant section.  Again, the expression &ldquo;in the public interest&rdquo; causes some concern because I cannot imagine what State development could not be justified as in the public interest.  What is in our interest is not often what we like, it is like medicine, you have to take it even if you do not like it but the end result can be to your benefit.  If the Minister indicated a development that might not be in the public interest we could begin to try to understand how broad the section is.  The scope of this provision is far too wide and if enacted as drafted it would be creating, as Deputy Keogh said, a power equivalent to section 84 of the 1963 Act as understood prior to the latest Supreme Court judgment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendments we are discussing would overcome this difficulty by restricting the impact of the section specifically to the exempt classes in section 2 (1) (a) (i) that we have debated.  If the Minister does not accept our amendments his intent must be greater than to provide for national security considerations.  If that is so perhaps will he explain it to us? <Col N="429" /> The expression, &ldquo;in the public interest&rdquo;, is not defined and I cannot understand what State development would not be in the public interest.

      <P>This matter was raised on Second Stage.  I was worried about its inclusion when we were establishing the parameters within which we wanted to work.  I believed the word &ldquo;emergency&rdquo; would cover virtually every possible eventuality that I could think of.  I was subsequently advised that there could be circumstances which I cannot specify &mdash; perhaps tentative security elements where there would be no public involvement and it would have to be carried out on a confidential basis &mdash; that the word &ldquo;emergency&rdquo; might not cover.  I have looked exhaustively at any potential area that might not come under what I understand to be an emergency and I have not been able to satisfy myself that there is one at this stage.  I may well be taking a risk in doing this because the strong advice available to me is that I might not be able to cover everything.  It was never intended that this would be the wide measure that Deputy Gilmore seeks to impute to it by his amendment.  Nonetheless I will take the risk of accepting the amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On this side of the House we are at one on this amendment.  The reason for our amendment is that legislation should not be amended by means of a statutory instrument and that any change in a section of an Act has fundamental legal implications and thus should require the consent of the Oireachtas.  I am told it is doubtful in a legal sense if the Minister can implement changes to an Act by <Col N="431" /> means of a statutory instrument.  I refer back to the comments I made yesterday about bypassing the Oireachtas in regard to changing legislation.</P>

      <P>The Minister has already circulated his own amendment in relation to section 3 which he is proposing to delete.  This is something I welcome.  The amendment we are debating now deals with much the same issue in that regulations would modify enactments as opposed to statutory instruments.  It would appear to be consistent with the deletion of section 3 that the Minister would also accept this amendment since it relates solely to enactments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2 (3) is a standard provision which has been used in many enactments over the years.  I offer, for example, section 52 of the Local Government Act, 1991.  It is an essential fail-safe mechanism to enable minor &mdash; I stress &ldquo;minor&rdquo;&mdash; amendments to be made to existing statutes should this be necessary to facilitate the smooth transition to a new system such as the one this Bill is seeking to introduce.  In my experience regulations to amend statutes are rarely necessary, but it is essential that the power should be there should it be necessary to facilitate the new system. I have to stress however that the circumstances in which the power may be used are extremely narrow by virtue of the wording of section 2 (3).  It most certainly is not a <i>carte blanche</i> for the Minister to amend primary legislation by regulations.  Section 2 (3) specifically limits the use of regulatory power to enabling the regulations to have full effect.  I am therefore opposing this <Col N="432" /> amendment.  I hope however that the decision I have taken in relation to section 3 is taken as absolute proof of the narrowness in which this provision has to operate and also to ensure that the frustrations of the Opposition are compensated for by being able to play a full role in ensuring that the total wisdom of this House is applied to the laws we try to enact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's decision in relation to section 3, which is even more generous than my amendment was suggesting in that I was allowing the Minister to retain the provisions only in relation to areas of development as outlined in section 2 (1) (a) (i).  I welcome the Minister's amendment and wholeheartedly support it.  We have rehearsed many times in this House our concerns in relation to legislation by way of delegated authority through the regulation procedure. It is being used to such an excessive extent that we need a full debate on the use of regulations or statutory instruments for legislating.  I am concerned, as I know my colleagues on the Opposition benches are, at the number of times in this Bill alone the Minister has made provision by way of regulation at some later stage to make changes or amendments in this legislation.  My quibble with the Minister is that many of them are not minor changes.  The whole procedure was envisaged for minor changes, and we would not want to thwart a Minister being able to make minor changes without having to come before both Houses of the Oireachtas. The change may have to be made when the Houses are not sitting.  However, I am afraid we have gone way past the concept of a minor change in terms of the use of the regulation; but that needs a more extended debate than we can give it today.</P>

      <P>I accept what the Minister said about amendment No. 25.  I thank him for listening to the misgivings voiced yesterday about regulations.  I said on Second Stage that I felt this section should not be contained in the Bill.  Without <Col N="433" /> going over old territory again I want to reiterate my misgivings about the widespread use of regulations.  Already this morning the Minister has given us some reassurance in that regard.  By deleting section 3 he is going a little further down that road and I thank him.  But, through the Minister, we should put other Ministers on notice about the way people view government by regulation. The Minister's action is some small concession, but it is welcome.</P>

      <P>We are dealing with the whole area of regulations.  The regulations cannot take effect until the Bill takes effect.

Millions of pounds are involved in very significant employment projects which have gone through the consultative process.  It will be necessary for me to bring in those provisions quickly and I intend to do so next week.  This would mean that the one year would extend to mid-June 1994.  In reference to Deputy Gilmore's amendment, that is close enough in order to have practically no difference between what I want to achieve and what is being <Col N="434" /> sought on the other side.

      <P>I do not consider that the change suggested by the Deputies is necessary.  As it stands, paragraph (a) (ii) of the new subsection (1) which amends section 78 of the Planning Act 1963 allows local authorities to be required to give notice of, or information about, proposed development to any specified persons. <Col N="435" /> Persons in this context would include legal as well as natural citizens and it will be possible to require local authorities to give notice and information to particular groups, organisations and bodies.  I will consider whether this requirement should include bodies prescribed for development plan purposes under article 6 of the 1977 planning regulations but, in my view, it would not be appropriate to spell out what is essentially a detailed matter of this nature in primary legislation.  This argument has been covered more than adequately and I have nothing further to add.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 30 envisages the submission of reports to the elected members of local authorities at an earlier stage then the report provided for under subsection (1) (a) (v) of section 78 of the principal Act as amended by section 4 of the Bill.  This would run contrary to the new arrangements proposed for development by local authorities. Under these arrangements there would be full public disclosure of proposals for local authority development including the making available of relevant documentation and there will be a full opportunity for making submissions to the local authority about the proposed development. It is only after that procedure has been followed that the report will be prepared and submitted to the elected members.  In those circumstances, the <Col N="436" /> Deputies might consider withdrawing the amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 32 and 33 would involve making available to the public the reports prepared for them under the new arrangements now being introduced. I have no objection in principle to this but as those reports are prepared by and for local authorities I would prefer to leave it to them to decide the manner in which they should be brought into the public domain.  In any event, those reports would be considered at meetings with the elected members and would, therefore, become public knowledge through media reporting and so on.  I would prefer to leave it to the local authorities to make arrangements for making such reports public and, therefore, I do not propose to accept the amendments. Deputies will appreciate that in regard to amendment No. 33, what is proposed would be a matter for local authorities.

      <P>I made it clear during the debate on this Bill that the Government is committed to ensuring that procedures are in place which will allow the public adequate opportunity to be informed about, and to express their views on, development proposals by State authorities and local authorities alike.  Regulations relating to local authority development proposals which would be made under section 78 of the 1963 Act, as amended by section 4 of this Bill, will provide for the right to make submissions, or to express observations, to local authorities.  Account will have to be taken of those submissions or observations in the report on the proposed development which will be submitted to the elected members of the local authorities and this will enable the elected members to take full account of the public concerns and opinions when deciding whether developments should be allowed to proceed.  I am satisfied that those procedures allow ample opportunity for public participation and I do not consider it necessary to make provision for oral hearings.  The system of public consultation proposed is full and open and with proper advanced planning of works by local authorities this should not disrupt the programme of works essential to make our country competitive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those developments are substantially underpinned by European funds and the <Col N="438" /> Culliton and Moriarty reports which support investment of this type.

      <P>Section 4 of the Bill provides for the replacement of subsection (1) of section 78 of the 1963 Planning Act.  Under the new subsection the Minister for the Environment will be given power to establish, by way of regulations, a procedure of public notice and participation in respect of certain local authority development.  Under these proposals a local authority would be obliged to prepare a report on relevant development for submission to the elected members.  It would be open to the councillors at that stage to use their power under section 3 of the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955, to direct the manager that the development should not be carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 34 and 36 envisage the final decision in relation to local authority development being taken out of the hands of the local authority's elected members and passed to either An Bord Pleanála, the Environmental Protection Agency or the Minister for the Environment. Under EC legislation, there is a requirement that major developments by local authorities be subjected to EIA procedures and authorisation by a third party.  The Irish regulations implementing this EC Directive vest the authorisation in the Minister for the Environment.  I do not accept that an authorisation procedure should apply to all local authority development.  This would run counter to the principles of local democracy which suggest that the decision as to whether local authority development is to proceed should rest with the authority's elected members. This will be the position pertaining under <Col N="440" /> the framework to be established under the Bill and I am afraid I cannot agree to any amendments which would alter this position.</P>
    <P>In regard to amendment No. 35 I should point out that the new public notice and participation procedures established under the new section 78 (1) of the 1963 Act which section 4 of the Bill will insert, will require a local authority to publish notice of proposed development and at a later stage to prepare a report on the matter for submission to the local authority elected members.  The Deputy's amendment seeks to have a further notice published after this report is presented to the elected members.  I am at a loss to understand what would be achieved by the publication of a notice at that stage of the process as the councillors will have decided by then whether the development is to proceed.</P>

An independent third party such as An Bord Pleanála would alleviate this problem.</P>

      <P>We are returning to a debate we had earlier.  I do not want it to be thought I was suggesting that Deputy Keogh is naive.  That was not my intention. It seems that the Deputy is fundamentally of the view that it is possible to reconcile irreconcilable differences.  I have no problem with the principle of trying to do that and the Deputy will appreciate that there is balancing to be done in the context of many developments that have to be carried out.  I have sought to ensure that in the case of housing developments the new procedures for a better social mix are put in place.  These are already causing stresses in the areas the Deputy speaks of such as housing and the provision of sites for itinerants.  In making decisions local councillors must <Col N="441" /> have regard to the county development plan and to submissions.  Up to now local authorities proceeded with developments without consultation.  That is now being changed.  We have to rely on the democratic strength at local level to take sensible decisions and the public will have an opportunity to determine whether their views are fully recognised in decisions at local level.</P>

      <P>There may be a serious loophole in the planning laws.  I am concerned that the present laws will allow a local authority to go ahead with a development and that the public will have very little input to the decision making process.  My colleague, Deputy Doyle, instanced the joint venture in Little Island, County Cork, where Cork County Council and Cork Corporation will develop a very comprehensive and <Col N="442" /> high-tech sewage treatment plant.  I want the Minister's assurances that that project will be subject to the planning laws, in other words, that the authorities will have to apply for planning permission and that the residents of the area will have the right to make their views known. A comprehensive environmental impact statement has been produced but neither the residents nor the businesses in the area was consulted or had any input to that report.  Generally speaking, they were ignored.  There is a golf course in that area which was recently funded by Structural Funds.  It employes 37 local people but it is at risk.  Houses in the area will be seriously devalued and, under the present planning laws, the people there will have no right to object.  Their only recourse will be through the courts.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister give an assurance that the present laws place an obligation on the local authority to apply for planning permission and that the public have the right to submit their views in regard to such developments?  If that is not the case will the Minister accept this amendment?</P>

      <P>As I explained on Second Stage local authorities must obtain planning permission for developments, other than road works, which they plan to undertake outside their functional area.  This means for example, that an urban district council proposing to build houses or construct a sewage treatment plant in a county council area must obtain planning permission for the works in the same manner as a private developer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>This is provided in local government law.  Section 59 of the Local Government Act, 1955, permits local authorities to enter into an agreement under which one authority will exercise or perform, powers, functions or duties for the other.  This could, for instance, mean that a county council and urban district council might agree that the county council would carry out a particular <Col N="443" /> development for the urban district council in the county council's area.  In that event, I do not consider it would be appropriate to require an application for planning permission to be made to the county council.  The correct course in those circumstances would be for the county council to engage in public consultation in accordance with the new procedures to be provided under section 78 of the 1963 Act, as amended by section 4 of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I had the pleasure of visiting a new plant on the outskirts of Bandon town in County Cork recently.  It is important in debates like this that account is taken of advances in technology so that the public are assured that the type of plants being installed meet very high environmental standards and must meet the requirements set down in environmental impact statements.</P>

      <P>The Minister has just confirmed that the people of Little Island and surrounding areas will have no rights because he has now confirmed that under the planning laws joint ventures between two local authorities will be exempt from planning permission.  The only way people of that area, and elsewhere, who are involved in joint ventures with local authorities can have their problems dealt with is if this amendment is accepted by the Minister.  Despite the Minister's assertions about modern sewage treatment plants and high technology in joint ventures with local authorities the rights of the public are being seriously undermined and the only recourse people have is through the courts which is expensive. Most communities are ill-equipped to deal with matters in that way.  I appeal to the Minister to be pro-people and allow communities to become involved and to protect their interests and properties.  In this case the rights of people and communities may be overridden by bureaucracy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 22, 35, 42, 49, 50, 61, 62 and 63 together.  The Government has consistently held the view that the plan for Bosnia-Hercegovina, developed by International Conference Co-Chairmen Vance and Owen, provides the only mechanism available for the re-establishment of peace, with justice and respect for human rights, in Bosnia-Hercegovina. The rapid implementation of this plan offers the best prospect for improving the situation there in all its aspects &mdash; security, political, economic and humanitarian.  This requires the support of a united international community. Pending the full implementation of the plan, there is an over-riding need to ensure the protection of life in besieged communities in that Republic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To achieve the implementation of the Vance-Owen plan, the Government has actively pursued a policy involving full support for the International Conference Co-Chairmen, Owen and Stoltenberg, and increased pressure on Serbia and on the Bosnian Serbs through the application of sanctions.  We have also made clear that the continued defiance by the Bosnian Serbs and by Serbia and <Col N="449" /> Montenegro of the decisions of the UN Security Council would not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>In Luxembourg this week, I welcomed the developments at the UN Security Council in relation to the plight of the besieged Muslim communities.  I welcomed, in particular, the decision of the Security Council, in its Resolution 836 of 4 June to make provision for the protection of the safe areas.  I underlined that these were temporary arrangements, which have as their objective the preservation of the lives of those displaced persons who have been forced to seek refuge in their isolated and besieged communities. When secured, these communities should be free from bombardment or attack and should receive humanitarian aid unimpeded.  I expressed concern about the developing situation in Croatia.  The international community should make clear to Croatia that it must act responsibly and avoid escalating the conflict.</P>
    <P>EC Foreign Ministers reconfirmed their commitment to work for a lasting and equitable peace in former Yugoslavia, most immediately in Bosnia-Hercegovina. It was agreed that the Vance-Owen plan remained the centrepiece of the EC's strategy for peace, that there is no feasible alternative to this as a means for reaching a durable political solution based on the principles agreed by all at the London Conference, and that the acquisition of territory by force is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Ministers were given a detailed briefing by Conference Co-Chairman David Owen.  We agreed that authority to pursue political settlements in former Yugoslavia, including the implementation of the Vance-Owen plan in Bosnia-Hercegovina rested primarily with Co-Chairmen David Owen and Thorsvald Stoltenberg.  They have our full confidence and support in pursuing these objectives on our behalf with the parties in the region.  This, I believe, is the most effective method of bringing the peace process forward and securing implementation of the plan.</P>
    <P>We also had a useful and important meeting with US Secretary of State <Col N="450" /> Warren Christopher yesterday.  At that meeting, we considered follow-up by the UN Security Council to the joint action programme on a number of issues, including the safe areas, which had been developed by the EC.  It is clear that a substantial increase in the strength of UNPROFOR and its financial resources will be required to make these areas safe. This matter is currently being considered by the UN Secretary General.</P>
    <P>The long-term economic, and political requirements of the inhabitants of safe areas can only be realised when the Vance-Owen plan, under which all displaced people can return to their homes with security, has been fully implemented by all parties.  Adjustments to the plan, acceptable to all three parties, may have to be made.  However, as I have made clear in the Dáil, the alternative to the Vance-Owen plan is likely to be the partition of Bosnia-Hercegovina.</P>
    <P>UN sanctions continue to remain the cornerstone of the EC's pressure on Serbia and the Bosnian Serbs.  These are becoming increasingly effective.  In Luxembourg, we confirmed that sanctions will continue to be rigorously enforced until all conditions specified by the Security Council have been met, including the withdrawal of Bosnian Serb forces from territories occupied by force.</P>
    <P>The Government is commited to continue its humanitarian and human rights involvement in former Yugoslavia, especially in Bosnia-Hercegovina.  We have already made clear our strong views on the atrocities which have been perpetrated. In the case of the victims of rape in Bosnia, the Government is funding a project of the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, and a group of counsellors from the former Yugoslavia are currently in Ireland for intensive training in assistance to rape victims.</P>
    <P>I will continue to avail of every opportunity to work towards the objective of peace, with respect for human rights, in former Yugoslavia.  To this end, I will utilise every occasion, both at international level and in my bilateral contacts &mdash; for example, next week with the Bosnian <Col N="451" /> Foreign Minister &mdash; to promote these objectives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that EC action to date with regard to former Yugoslavia has failed dismally to bring about peace and bring to an end the atrocities and daily killings in that region?  Would the Minister not agree that the safe areas which he supported and for which he took much kudos have not worked because of the lack of commitment by the EC to make them work? Will the Minister comment on Lord Owen's exhortation to the EC that it must do more than pay lip service to UN Security Council resolutions, that it must be prepared to make resources' available and what resources have been made available following the Ministers' meeting on Tuesday?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I know from the Deputy's interest in the continuing conflict in former Yugoslavia she has a good understanding of what is an extremely complex problem.  The European Council of Ministers, in conjunction with David Owen and Cyrus Vance, pursued a peace plan which achieved some progress in terms of requiring the warring factions to sign a peace agreement but, unfortunately, implementation has proved much more difficult.  However, in practical political terms the Vance-Owen plan is still the most feasible prospect, perhaps the only prospect in bringing about agreement in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I advocated the establishment of safe areas as a temporary measure to ensure preservation of life in a difficult situation. The establishment of safe areas is the best prospect of securing the lives of many hundreds of thousands of people in this besieged area.  The UN commitment to this plan is very clear.  The UN Secretary General is at present setting out to make available 5,000 to 6,000 UN troops for the protection of these safe areas and he will report on that matter at the weekend. Lord Owen, in his address to the press in Luxembourg, made it very clear that he believes resources must be provided, and <Col N="452" /> the United Nations is in the process of providing these resources.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that it was mentioned in the last number of months that for the implementation of the peace plan on its acceptance by all parties in a peaceful situation 50,000 to 60,000 United Nation troops would be required as well as the necessary resources.  At present a peace-keeping force of 5,000 to 6,000 troops is being formed.  The latest information is that the Secretary General is confident that the necessary resources will be put in place as a matter of urgency.</P>

On the putting together the 5,000 to 6,000 troops to implement Resolution 836 of 4 June, will the Minister give his views on requests for Irish involvement?  Will he outline his understanding of Article 10 of Resolution 836 which refers to member states acting nationally or through regional organisations?  For example, does he understand that to mean NATO or Western European Union?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just returned from the General Affairs Council in Luxembourg where, concurrently, EC Ministers held accession conferences with each of the four EFTA applicant countries. These conferences recorded considerable agreement on a range of issues in the enlargement negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, negotiations which may lead to the enlargement of the European Union in 1995 opened with Austria, Sweden and Finland on 1 February 1993 and with Norway on 5 April. I am happy to report that significant progress has been achieved in the negotiations under the Danish Presidency. The initial, lengthy exercise of the applicant countries and the Commission <Col N="454" /> examining the Community's body of law has been largely completed.  During May, preparation of detailed Community positions began on issues put forward by the applicants or requiring negotiation.  It was these Community positions, as agreed by the Council, that were put to the four applicants on 8 and 9 June for acceptance or continued negotiation.</P>
    <P>Enlargement of the Union is a major policy objective of the Community.  The Danish Presidency has advanced the process significantly.  Belgium has indicated that enlargement is at the top of its Presidency agenda and that it hopes to be in a position to complete the negotiations by the end of 1993.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree it is premature to implement the policy of further enlargement of the Community without the existing Twelve having put their house in order in respect of the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty and many outstanding issues that remain to be implemented?  Will the Minister indicate to the House what issues are causing difficulty and if they have any implications for this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The leaders of the European Community were faced with a choice in the context of the delays in relation to Maastricht which was to put everything on hold until the Maastricht Treaty was ratified by all member states. The decision was that, notwithstanding the difficulties in relation to Maastricht and the Danish case, the British case and the German constitutinal court, work should progress in relation to enlargement. Thus, negotiations have commenced. This was the right decision and it showed the determination of the Community to make progress despite the Maastricht problems.  There is a number of issues in relation to agriculture, fisheries and rural development which will form the main part of the negotiations but there will not be any unsurmountable difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate the probable impact on the financing of <Col N="455" /> the Community and any institutional arrangements that might be necessary in the enlargement process?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give the Deputy line by line details in relation to the impact on institutional arrangements. The provisions are that the applicant countries will apply to join the European Community within the present institutional framework.  There is a determination to complete the enlargement as the institutions are at present constituted. If there is to be provision for instutitional reform, that will take place after the enlargement, which is probably the best procedure to follow.  Obviously the four countries will be net contributors to the Community, which we should welcome.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>whether he has considered the recent proposal by Deputy Michael McDowell that an Irish Institute of International Affairs should be established, centred on a third level institution of learning, in order to develop a greater awareness of, and acquaintance with, international affairs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>
      </QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I have believed for a long time that there is a need to develop in Ireland a greater awareness of issues arising in international affairs and of Ireland's position on them.  A well informed public opinion is as necessary in this as in any other aspect of public life.  It is one of the reasons I pressed for the establishment of a Foreign Affairs Committee.</P>
      <P>Several bodies are already doing good work in this area, in particular the Institute for European Affairs, the International Affairs Committee of the Royal Irish Academy, and the Irish Council of the European Movement.  All have links with the universities which have developed courses and programmes in international or European affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="456" /> These initiatives are capable of fulfilling many of the functions the Deputy has in mind &mdash; research, debate, analysis, education &mdash; particularly on European affairs.  Nevertheless, I agree with the Deputy that there is a need to broaden the debate beyond Europe to international affairs generally and in the light of this I am prepared to examine further his proposal.</P>
    <P>I also wish to encourage a wider understanding of, and debate about, foreign affairs issues among the population generally, and not in an elite way only.  I intend to discuss with the Minister for Education the possibility of examining, in the context of the forthcoming White Paper, how a broader awareness of foreign affairs issues might be inculcated at second level.</P>

    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Tánaiste agree it is important, in relation to areas which fall outside the remit for instance of the Institute of European Affairs and of the Irish Council of the European Movement, that Ireland should have a group of people who have an opportunity to confer in relation to Pacific, African, American and Central American affairs and so on and in that context a wider institution is desirable?  Will the Minister also agree that an initiative sponsored by his Department with one of the universities here would be a useful way of establishing such a body, bearing in mind the success of the Institute of European Affairs and the Centre for European Law Studies in Trinity which, before she was elected, the President played such a dynamic role in creating when she was attached to that university?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not take offence at the way the question was put down.  I became aware of the Deputy's statement <Col N="457" /> when the question was put down and decided to deal with it appropriately.  I would like more debate on a whole range of foreign affairs.  Obviously European affairs have taken the lead perhaps because of the proximity of Europe and the debate in the European Community. It is extremely important that all these issues are thrashed out and that a body of qualitative research is available to the public.  However, I would be worried if this became elitist because it is very important that the average citizen should understand the implications of foreign policy, our involvement in it and would have an input into its development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that Deputy Lenihan, who chairs the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, agrees that it would be very useful to have some indigenous backup for our committee, a specialisation at academic level.  I fully accept what the Minister said about not making it elitist but the research necessary for an informed debate must be located in some institution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 41 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By turning out to vote in such large <Col N="458" /> and enthusiastic numbers in the recent UN-supervised elections the ordinary people of Cambodia have clearly demonstrated their wish for a future based on peace and national reconciliation.  After 15 years of war there is now a real prospect of a better future for Cambodia.</P>
    <P>The elections have provided a firm and widely supported democratic base on which those now elected to the constituent assembly can draw up a new constitution and establish a new Government for all of Cambodia.</P>
    <P>I would like to support the call made by the UN Security Council on 2 June that all the parties in Cambodia stand by their obligations to respect fully the results of the elections.  This is crucial to ensuring that the will of the Cambodian people is fully respected.</P>
    <P>I would also like to take this opportunity to extend my congratulations to Mr. Akashi, the Special Representative of the UN Secretary General in Cambodia, and all the members of the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC), particularly the Irish members, for their courage and dedication in providing the necessary support for the electoral process despite hardships and difficulties.</P>
    <P>Three members of the Oireachtas were in Cambodia to observe the elections and found them to be free and fair.</P>
    <P>Following the peace accords, Ireland, in common with many other countries, pledged support for the reconstruction of Cambodia both bilaterally and through multilateral support measures undertaken by the United Nations and the European Communities.</P>
    <P>Funds have been provided under the bilateral aid programme for the rehabilitation of the electricity supply for Phnom Penh.  This work, which is being carried out by ESB International, will be commissioned later this summer.</P>
    <P>Through APSO the Government funded 45 volunteers working with the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) to assist in the election process.</P>
    <P>The Government is also supporting the activities of a number of governmental <Col N="459" /> organisations by direct co-financing of projects in Cambodia and is providing a total of 12 volunteers to Concern and GOAL through APSO.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>While thanking the Minister for his reply, there is a specific part of my question which has not been addressed.  Would the Minister say whether this country include Cambodia as a priority country in any extension of our bilateral aid programme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that in the past we have concentrated on the continent of Africa in our bilateral aid programme.  But in present circumstances, in which we are reviewing all of our programmes, I can assure the Deputy that we will be focusing on Cambodia as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste may be aware that this morning the United Nations officially declared the results of the elections in Cambodia, which the outgoing Government refused to accept. Would he agree with me on the need for the United Nations Transitional Authority to remain on in Cambodia to ensure that a similar disaster will not occur there, as occurred in the case of Angola, where there was a transitional authority but where, once the elections were over and the losers refused to accept the results, the United Nations pulled out, leading to a disaster of horrible proportions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I think we would all be wary of circumstances in which the work being done by the United Nations Transitional Authority, which made the arrangements for the elections and supervised them would come to naught if the constituent assembly is not allowed to function, develop into a legislative assembly and establish a new Government for that country.  In that respect I would say to Deputy Connor I am sure the United Nations will be reviewing the position and outlining a course which they feel is in the best interests of Cambodia and to ensure that, after the suffering <Col N="460" /> and hardship endured by the Cambodian population for so many years, democracy is firmly established there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Tánaiste say whether the Government will insist at United Nations level that the role about which he has spoken will be undertaken by the United Nations, that is, that UNTAC will remain there to ensure that civil order is restored and transition to a new government achieved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, may I raise a brief point of order?  I am doing so in the spirit of allowing our work here to be seen in operation.  I have noticed there is quite a time lag before the television cameras pick up this side of the House.  Perhaps, Sir, you would take that matter up with the people operating the television cameras.  It has happened over and over again.  I timed it this afternoon.  The Tánaiste's face appeared instantly whereas that of Deputy Michael McDowell and others on this side of the House did not appear for some four, five or six seconds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact there have been some discussions.

I will avail of every opportunity to discuss these matters with the Israeli Ambassador or, indeed, with Israeli Ministers.  As I said to the Deputy at the outset, the question of establishing an embassy here is under review.

      <P>I take the Deputy's view but would not necessarily concur with it.  On matters of interest to the Irish Government <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Israeli Government, I should say that in fact I raised the matter of the treatment of the Palestinians myself at my meeting with Shimon Peres and I will do so again in relation to such treatment.  Of course, the other aspect is the Middle East peace process being re-established in Washington. Obviously, we were briefed on this in our meeting yesterday with Mr. Warren Christopher, the United States Secretary of State.  That is a process we would like to see being brought to fruition and which will require the best determination of all the parties in the Middle East.  Obviously, all of these matters would have to be taken into consideration if and when the Government is presented with the option of establishing an embassy.</P>

      <P>Ireland's ODA is subject to outside, independent evaluation in the form of regular reviews by the Development Assistance Committee of the OECD.  The last Development Assistance Committee review of Ireland's ODA programme took place in March 1991 and the next review is scheduled to take place in September <Col N="465" /> 1994.  In addition, as part of the management of the bilateral aid programme, each individual project is regularly reviewed, usually at three-yearly intervals, by a team which frequently includes outside consultants as well as departmental analysts.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the quality of Ireland's official development assistance is high.  The Programme for Government calls for a substantial increase in funding over the next four years which will involve significant expansion of the programme. In that context, a thorough examination of all aspects of the programme is taking place and a broad range of consultations is being held.  I hope to be able to announce plans for the expanded programme before the summer recess.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the problems arising from the heavy burden of debt carried by many Third World countries.  This is a major issue for the world community and needs to be tackled at global level.  The role which Ireland can play is to support the efforts of the main agencies through which this problem is addressed, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.  Within the European Community, we have also given our support to measures to write off the debts of the poorest ACP countries arising under STABEX, the Community Fund set up under the Lomé Conventions.</P>
      <P>A fairer trade deal for developing countries is of crucial importance if they are ever to achieve a more equitable distribution of the world's resources. Ireland will continue to argue that trade be given a special priority in the European Community's relationship with developing countries.</P>

      <P>At the meeting yesterday of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs officials of the Department presented us with a considerable amount of information on this matter and we had a very interesting debate.  We very much appreciated the co-operation of the officials.  Given that the Minister said he supports the idea of cancellation of the <Col N="466" /> debt owed to the EC will the Minister of State indicate the sources of opposition at European Community level to such a move?  What diplomatic efforts are being made by Ireland to overcome this on a bilateral basis?</P>

      <P>At a recent meeting which I attended the Community decided that, in regard to the single market for bananas, it should favour exports from traditional suppliers in the Caribbean. Therefore, the Community endeavours to take the needs of developing countries into account.  Official debt accounts for the bulk of the debt owed by developing countries in sub-Saharan Africa.  As Deputies are aware, no official debt is owed to Ireland.  We provide support primarily at World Bank and IMF level.  At European Community level some countries have a particular relationship with developing countries but we maintain a consistent and supportive role, particularly in regard to the ACP countries.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister of State a question, which I put to his officials yesterday at the meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, about the impact our official development assistance has had on the fundamental problem of under-development. If I recall correctly we support a livestock improvement project in the Sudan and a hospital improvement project in Tanzania to mention but two.  Can we say that the livestock industry in the Sudan and the hospital services in Tanzania and so on have been improved as a result because that is the basis on which this should be judged?</P>

      <P>The Deputy and I visited Lusaka some years ago where one of the projects to which he referred, namely the pre-natal and post-natal clinic, is being undertaken.  I am confident that we are getting good value for money and that the bilateral aid programme, especially in Africa, has been a tremendous success. That is not just my view or that of the Government but the view of other Governments and many international <Col N="467" /> agencies.  The Deputy has raised an important matter.  The real challenge facing us is how can we secure sustainable development.  That is the challenge facing this and other Governments and it is separate from the need to provide humanitarian relief.  As the Deputy is no doubt aware, it is our intention to set up an advisory committee.  We also have a Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and it will be a matter for those committees to decide if they should examine closely the programme we are implementing.  That programme can be improved only if independent advice is offered in the case of the advisory committee.  The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs to which the Deputy referred also has a role to play in evaluating our programme.</P>

      <P>I welcome the courageous document presented by the Minister of State's officials yesterday.  They did not shirk their responsibility to tell us just how disastrous the position was during the past five to six years in regard to our overseas development aid budget.  They did not fudge the issue.  Will the Minister of State ensure there is an examination of the way the multilateral aid programme funds are spent having regard to the fact that it is such projects rather than bilateral aid programme projects that have been subjected to most criticism?  Will he ensure that a hands-on approach is adopted in regard to the cheque-writing exercise that Ireland indulges in at present whereby we write a cheque at the start of the year and forward it to some agency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister and I are in full agreement that there must be accountability.  I instructed my officials to ensure that in preparing the document strong emphasis was placed on bilateral aid programme projects rather than multilateral aid programme projects.  It is in that area that Irish aid agencies excel given that a hands-on approach is adopted, be it at official or NGO level. This additional money is welcome and I am privileged to be in this position at a <Col N="468" /> time when the programme is being expanded.  Through these projects we can make an impact in the international community. We must invest the additional moneys in such projects, not in multi-lateral aid programme projects.  I agree with the Deputy that in many cases we are not sure how these moneys are spent because they are spread out and allocated to large scale programmes.  When money is allocated to specific bilateral aid programme projects we can see the results.</P>

      <P>The Government deserves to be congratulated for adopting a positive approach towards ODA.  It was a major bone of contention over many years that the Government's allocation in this area was declining but this has now been reversed.  However, there is a need to ensure that developing countries get a fair crack deal in international trade.  Will the Minister of State have any input to the negotiations on GATT which will have a major impact on the quality of life of people living in developing and underdeveloped countries?  At this stage we have a friend in court.  It is important that we concentrate on other matters in addition to the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>

      <P>I wish to reassure the Deputy that this issue is constantly on the agenda at EC level.  Indeed, it was discussed again at a recent meeting in Luxembourg.  I understand that Mr. Peter Sutherland, the new Director General of the GATT organisation, made the point that he has a responsibility not just to the wealthy economies but to the developing world.  I should point out that, in line with the positive attitude we have adopted towards the developing world, we have time and again made positive statements at EC level and at EC-Central American country meetings in support of the ACP countries in particular.  In some instances, this may impinge on our own prospects for economic development but we must take a broader view of our <Col N="469" /> relations with developing countries and with eastern and central European countries in particular.</P>

How can he explain the reduction in the co-financing in the current year of moneys available for voluntary agencies?  I am referring to the bilateral side as opposed to the multi-lateral side.  If the Minister's approach is followed through there should be an increase in funding for the Irish voluntary agencies which we support on a co-financing basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland and Libya established non-residential diplomatic relations with each other in 1977.  Our embassy in Rome is responsible for Ireland's relations with Libya.  The Libyan People's Bureau in London was responsible for relations with Ireland but the bureau was closed by the British Government in 1984.</P>
      <P>On 30 March 1992 the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 748, imposing sanctions on Libya with effect from 15 April 1992.  The sanctions were imposed because the Security Council considered that Libya had failed to respond fully to an earlier call on it by the Security Council to respond effectively to requests by the American, British and French Governments for co-operation in establishing responsibility for the bombing of PanAm flight 103 over Lockerbie and UTA flight 772 over Niger.</P>
      <P>The sanctions imposed by the Security Council are: a ban on flights to and from Libya, the supply of aircraft or aircraft components and the servicing of Libyan aircraft; a ban on arms sales to Libya and a significant reduction in the number of level of staff in Libya diplomatic missions.</P>
      <P>The sanctions, which are being implemented by the international community, including Ireland, are subject to review by the Security Council at least every 120 days.  The most recent review was carried out on 8 April 1993 and the President of the Council concluded that there was no agreement that the conditions existed for modification of the sanctions.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that one of the apparent aims of some of the member states to which he <Col N="471" /> referred was to oblige Libya to hand over suspected persons involved in the Lockerbie bombing for trial outside of Libya? Would he agree that this raises important questions of international law in that it suggests UN sanctions are being used as a form of compulsory extradition against the Libyan Government?  Does Ireland support the use of sanctions in order to effectively force a form of extradition on the Libyan Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy and the House will agree that the Lockerbie and UTA bombings were appalling and that the perpetrators must be found and brought to trial.  The Security Council has demanded Libya's full and effective co-operation in bringing these people to trial and it does not consider that Libya has so far provided that co-operation.  It would be in everybody's interest, particularly the Libyan Government's interest, if they provide the co-operation required.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious that Ireland should play its part in supporting the process of democratisation which is under way in South Africa.  Earlier this year I told the Dáil that I regarded assistance for democratisation and institutions building as an important component in our bilateral aid programme.  I said that Ireland would be stepping up its efforts in a number of countries.  Since then, we have channelled funding for such projects through the Association of West European Parliamentarians Against Apar-theid, AWEPAA.  We have supported the monitoring of elections in Lesotho and referenda in Eritrea and Malawi and we have also provided funding to AEWPAA for voter education projects.</P>
      <P>It would be natural to extend similar assistance to South Africa at such a critical time in that country's development. A number of requests for funding have been received and I am considering these.  I am also considering other ways in which Ireland can assist South Africa.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's indication of Ireland's positive intentions towards South Africa.  Is the Minister aware that there are approximately 22 million black potential voters in South Africa who have never voted previously?

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">

      <P>I am fully aware that up to 22 million black people in South Africa have never seen a ballot box before and <Col N="473" /> will be voting for the first time.  There are also difficulties in regard to transport to polling stations.  A very necessary programme is required for voter education. The President of the European Council of Foreign Ministers, Mr. Petersen, recently visited South Africa and reported to us at our meeting in Luxembourg during the past two days.  On my suggestion, we hope to take an initiative in regard to voter education.  This has to be done well in advance of next May.  In the context of 22 million people voting for the first time and 7,000 polling stations, which many people believe will be quite inadequate, I do not believe it will be possible to achieve the voter education necessary in a short period of time.  At our meeting, I requested EC Ministers to address this question as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given consideration to this matter.  In fact, an official of the Department of Foreign Affairs spent a fortnight in South Africa during the past number of weeks.  He has reported back to me on the present situation in that country.  The question of the establishment of an embassy in South Africa is under active review at present.  I agree with the Deputy that there are enormous opportunities for our Government in this regard.  The South African Government still has a difficult road to travel but hopefully it will progress to establish democracy in that country, which the main parties now seem determined to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="474" /> Obviously we will want to play an active role in the establishment of that democratic system.  The Department is presently examining the projects we can support and help.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of an organisation known as IFEE, the Independent Forum for Electoral Education? Incidentally, there is a number of Irish priests and sisters involved in that organisation.  Would the Minister examine a request for assistance from that organisation because what is most needed now is training facilities for the 20,000 or more local monitors that will be required prior, during and after the election?  Will he consider allocating some of the moneys that will be made available by his Department to allow staff from local authorities or elsewhere who might be useful to take part in training in South Africa?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">

    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support the proposal of my colleague, Deputy Owen, to assist IFEE, which represents some 40 Church and lay organisations in South Africa and is already spending every penny it can get its hands on on a variety of programmes.  Will the Minister pay particular attention to an issue that the situation in Angola has brought to the fore, that is that where democratic concepts have been absent for a long time we cannot walk away from the country after the election because there is need for an ongoing programme to support, defend and develop democracy?  Will he ensure that in the consideration of bilateral and EC aid for South Africa &mdash; and, indeed, countries such as Mozambique and other countries that are engaging in the process of democoracy &mdash; that this be given more attention and more resources than in the past?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the tenor of the Deputy's request.  The process is threefold: First, there is the preparation and the obvious ongoing discussions between the parties in South Africa; then the education process prior to the elections and the conduct of the elections themselves, which are complex and difficult and, finally, the process of ensuring that democracy is stabilised.  That will be as difficult as the previous two aspects. In the context of our discussions at EC level we are very conscious that progress is being made in South Africa and that we have a major role to play in that regard.  Because of the formal links that most European countries have with South Africa, there is a major responsibility on the European Community, which I believe will be honoured.</P>

      <P>On 16 December 1992, the UN Security Council established the <Col N="476" /> UN Operation in Mozambique &mdash; UNOMOZ &mdash; with the following mandate: to monitor the implementation of the peace agreements between the Mozambican Government and RENAMO; to provide technical assistance and to monitor the electoral process; and to co-ordinate and monitor humanitarian assistance.</P>
      <P>Deployment of UNOMOZ is almost complete with over 6,000 UN troops now stationed in Mozambique.  Four of the proposed five security corridors for the delivery of humanitarian supplies have now been established and are operational. Ireland has not been asked by the United Nations to provide troops or military observers to UNOMOZ.</P>
      <P>Demobilisation of the Government and RENAMO troops and the establishment of a new national defence force are matters of paramount importance. The Community and its members states have urged the Government and RENAMO to initiate demobilisation immediately and to accept demobilisation procedures that will allow the process to be completed quickly.  The UN troops and observers are now largely in place to ensure stability during the process and to assist with the practical work of demobilisation.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently looking at the possibility of Irish involvement in the reconstruction of Mozambique in the aftermath of the civil war which has wrought such devastation to the economy and to society there.  I have dispatched an evaluation team to Maputo for the purpose of examining, together with the Mozambican Government, the possibility of beginning a programme for assistance.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for the information in his reply.  Is he aware <Col N="477" /> of the deep concern throughout the region about the slowness of the deployment of the UN forces?  I have a proposed schedule that was circulated in January which indicates that the UN would be present at all assembly points by February. I believe the troops have not begun their work at the assembly points and that none of the demobilisation process which was expected to be completed by May has commenced.  Will the Minister do all he can to make known our concerns about this and about leaving two armed forces in a stand-off position in a situation where war could resume at any time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the delays that have taken place.  It is extremely important in the light of what has happened in Angola that the position in regard to the armed forces be completed as quickly as possible.  I will raise that matter with the appropriate authorities because it is extremely important.  There are enormous strains and pressures on the United Nations' manpower and resources and recently I raised this with the Secretary General of the United Nations.  As most Deputies will be aware, he is under considerable strain in relation to the ongoing demands on the United Nations but notwithstanding that, there is a commitment to Mozambique and obviously there are obligations that have to be responded to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Tánaiste for his reply.  I have no doubt that when the fact finding mission return they will report on the devastation of the country following the war.  Does he recognise the enormous importance for the future prosperity of the country of making allowances for the forces, when they are demobilised.  Perhaps we can learn from the Namibian situation where the Koevut police force was demobilised in the proper way and they did not undermine democracy in Namibia.  Will he take that experience on board?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a brief question that arises from Question No. 31.  Earlier the Minister said that it was the Irish Government's attitude to examine every request to take part in a peace-keeping or peace-making force on a case by case basis.  Will he inform the House who makes the decisions in this respect? Who has the prime ministerial responsibility? Is it the Minister for Foreign Affairs and his Department, or the Minister for Defence Deputy Andrews?  Will he comment on a report in today's newspaper of a difference as to whose primary role it is to decide these matters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>We might be straying outside the brief somewhat but I have no difficulty in commenting, as my Department did last night, that there is no difference of opinion between myself and the Minister for Defence.  I can state quite frankly that we have not had any cross words in relation to this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Let the Deputy listen as I tell it as it is.  There has to be co-operation between the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Defence in these matters.  To the best of my knowledge that has always been the case and it is my intention to ensure that it continues. These matters are far too serious for people to have difficulties, as was speculated about in a mischievous way, I have to say, in a certain newspaper this morning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>

      <P>The Minister said that the United Nations troops were largely <Col N="479" /> in position.  Will he indicate whether 70 per cent, 80 per cent or 90 per cent are in position, or does he have the percentage figures?  The Minister said he was examining various mechanisms for supporting restructuring.  Will the Minister consider identifying Mozambique as one of the primary countries to which we give bilateral aid?  As my own information is a couple of weeks out of date, does he know of the moneys promised to RENAMO and Dhlakama under the Rome Donor Conference have been handed over, because I understand that the failure to make these resources available is delaying their return to Maputo and the commencement of the next stage of the peace process.  While the Minister may not have this information he may be able to get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>That was well anticipated, Deputy.  There are three parts to the Deputy's question and I will answer two of them.  There are over 6,000 United Nations troops in position.  On the basis of the evaluation received in the Department we will examine the possibility of beginning a bilateral aid programme to Mozambique.  Finally, I will seek the information the Deputy requested and forward it to her as soon as possible.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Part of what happened in Angola was that the demobilisation process was not complete when the election was held.  The target for demobilisation was not achieved and that led to the awful problems we have today.  Will the Minister agree that we should raise with the United Nations the postponement of elections until there is a full <Col N="480" /> demobilisation and surrender of the arms held by both private and official armies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>We can take up that matter with the United Nations.  It is extremely important, as suggested in this House, that demobilisation and disarmament takes place in an orderly manner, as happened in Namibia. Obviously it is extremely important when the elections take place that the results are accepted and democracy established.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 16, 38 and 60 together.</P>
      <P>The search for progress in relation to Northern Ireland remains a key element in the Government's programme.  We continue to promote this objective in every way open to us, including through intergovernmental meetings and contacts, wherever possible, with representatives of the constitutional parties in Northern Ireland and with responsible religious and community leaders there.</P>
      <P>At the meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference in Dublin on 25 May, I had an opportunity to discuss with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland the prospects for a resumption of talks, now that the local elections in Northern Ireland are out of the way.  We confirmed that the two Governments remain fully committed to the talks process, aimed at achieving a comprehensive political settlement which would address adequately all the main relationships.  We also agreed that there should be further contacts with the Northern Ireland constitutional parties in relation to the basis for a fresh round of talks.  The Secretary of State and I agreed to stay in close contact on this issue.</P>
      <P>Deputies will no doubt be aware of a number of statements by Unionist leaders in the interim which have not given grounds for encouragement.  However, I assure the House that the Government is determined to persist in its efforts to ensure progress.</P>
      <P>There will be an opportunity for a full review of the prospects for talks at the forthcoming meeting between the Taoi-seach and the British Prime Minister, Mr. Major, and for joint consideration of the best way forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Government programme makes clear, our goal is an accommodation between the two traditions in Ireland based on the principle that both must have equally satisfactory expression and protection.  The issue, therefore, is not how much one or other Government or one or other community has an input at any given time, but rather how to find, through a process of dialogue, an accommodation which can be accepted by all. <Col N="482" /> The British and Irish Governments are partners under the Anglo-Irish Agreement. They are, therefore, naturally partners in any search for a new and more broadly based agreement.</P>
    <P>As regards contact with Unionist leaders, I am satisfied that they are fully aware of my desire to meet them, in whatever circumstance and format they would find convenient, to enable me to listen to their concerns and to hear at first hand their views on how best to achieve political progress in relation to Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>While it has not been possible to follow this up in practice to the extent I would wish, I want to make it clear that my invitation to the Unionist leaders still stands.  I urge them to recognise the critical role of dialogue in the deepening of mutual understanding and in the pursuit of new relationships on this island.  We all have a part to play in the search for a comprehensive political settlement which will yield lasting peace, stability and prosperity for both North and South.</P>
    <P>It remains the earnest hope of both Governments that all concerned will respond to the desire for peace and dialogue and for a fair and honourable accommodation which has been clearly shown by the overwhelming majority of people in both parts of this island and in Britain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept there is much disappointment on my part and, indeed, on the part of many other people in the country that there has not been discussion between himself and the Unionist leaders?  We accept that making statements is essentially the dialogue of the deaf and that the only way forward is to have direct discussions.  Can the Minister suggest any moves he might make, other than the general invitation to which he referred, which would encourage the Unionist leaders to respond to his invitation to have discussions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>It sounds like a very gentle west Cork question.  I have made it perfectly clear that I want to have discussions <Col N="483" /> with the politicians in the North.  I have taken the opportunity to have meetings with members of the Unionist party whenever possible.  Unfortunately, the leaders of the Unionist parties have made it known publicly that they are not, at present at any rate, willing or available to come for discussions.  We have a responsibility as politicians on this island to make ourselves available for discussions to see if we can bring about peace.  I have expressed my views on that on many occasions and I will continue to do so.  I will do everything possible to ensure that dialogue recommences.  I do not want to give the impression that I am attempting to lecture anybody but I feel very strongly that it is incumbent on politicians to seek a resolution to the conflict in this island without preconditions.  I will pursue that course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>From the point of view of pursuing this very worthy objective of having discussions with Unionist leaders, will the Minister agree that it could be helpful if there was clear confirmation from him and his Government of a willingness to amend Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution in the context of an overall settlement?  Will he accept that if there was a clear statement from him and his Government it would help to encourage&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Joe Jacob">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;talks with Unionist leaders.  This is the issue, as you are well aware, and I ask the Minister to respond to that specific question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter of amending our Constitution is ultimately a matter for the people.  As I said on many occasions, constitutional matters should be discussed between the politicians on this island in the context of setting out a future for the relationships between North and South and between London and Dublin.  I have made my position <Col N="484" /> very clear.  I do not think it is very helpful at this stage to set down pre-conditions. Our constitutional position causes difficulties but they should be expressed in the context of talks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that one of the obstacles &mdash; apart from Articles 2 and 3 &mdash; clearly referred to by Unionist leaders, is the ongoing discussions between the leader of the SDLP and the leader of Sinn Féin and the joint statements issued by those two leaders in Northern Ireland?  As long as that continues it is highly unlikely that serious talks can get underway or that the Nationalist and Unionist leaders will get round a table in Northern Ireland.  In relation to the recently published Opsahl Commission document will he agree that its suggestions should be seriously examined by all politicians who are concerned about the future of Northern Ireland given that they are the condensed views of approximately 3,000 people, mostly from Northern Ireland, who are suffering daily at the hands of terrorist gangs from all sides?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the discussions which John Hume is having, I have made my views very clear, it is a matter for him.  John Hume dedicated his political life to establishing a peaceful resolution to the conflict on this island.  I have said I would trust his judgment in relation to whom he talks, when he talks to people and how many times he talks to them.  I recommend the Opsahl Commission report as essential reading for anybody who wants to understand the present situation in Northern Ireland.  I have had the opportunity to read most of it and whereas it is very clear it is not setting out a prescription or a formula whereby this problem would be solved overnight it is a very interesting study and should be supported by everybody. I regret the rather predictable reaction from certain quarters, from people who should know better and who should have treated it more generously.  It should be read by anybody who has an interest in the Northern Ireland political problems <Col N="485" /> because, as the Deputy said, it reflects the views of over 3,000 people who have lived with strife for the past 23 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>To what extent if any, has the Minister established common ground with any or all of the communities involved in the discussions which are likely to take place?  Is he satisfied that the Government has established clearly a common approach in relation to the entire matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has a common approach in relation to the entire matter and that is set out clearly in the programme for Government.  We are trying to find an accommodation for the two traditions in Northern Ireland. There is no difficulty in that regard.  We are pursuing the policy area as outlined in the Programme for Government and we will continue to do so</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>Has it been drawn to the attention of the Tánaiste that, following his meeting with Sir Patrick Mayhew last Tuesday, the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, Jim Molyneaux, once again asserted that differences between the Irish and British Governments were an impediment to progress in the talks process? In relation to the remarks about the Hume/Adams talks, would the Tánaiste agree that a successful outcome to such talks would entirely transform the position. It might be worthwhile to recall the adage, &ldquo;fools rush in where angels fear to thread&rdquo; in regard to matters of this nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The remarks made by the leader of the Official Unionist Party, Jim Molyneaux, have been brought to my attention informally.  I have not seen them, in print, nor have they been brought to my attention by officials of my Department.  Those remarks are regrettable. Both the British and Irish Governments are determined to resume the talks process because we believe that dialogue is essential if we are to make progress. All the political leaders must realise that we have to talk about how we will conduct <Col N="486" /> our lives and the political institutions on this island in a peaceful manner.  The serious difficulties on this island cannot be allowed to continue without people taking responsibility.</P>
      <P>I have responded already on the Hume/Adams talks and I trust and respect John Hume's judgment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Tánaiste agree that, rather than responding to demands for unilateral agreement to change Articles 2 and 3, it might be useful for the Government to publish a paper on the implications of those Articles so that public debate here and in Northern Ireland might be educated and that Unionists, who attach so much importance to the Articles, might have an opportunity to examine some of the thinking behind them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I will always welcome widespread and constructive debate on constitutional matters and on issues relating to public life and politics on this island.  The question of publishing a paper in relation to any aspect of our Constitution has not been considered. However, as the Deputy has raised it, I will give it some consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Tánaiste had time to consider the remarks in the British House of Commons earlier this week by the former British Prime Minister, Sir Edward Heath, to the effect he felt that any further talks with members of the DUP or the Reverend Ian Paisley would be a waste of time?  Will the Tánaiste indicate whether he agrees with that statement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The only outcome so far from the talks with Mr. Adams is a strengthened position for Sinn Féin on Belfast City Council.  With regard to the statement issued by Mr. Hume and Mr. Adams that they reject an internal solution, will the Tánaiste agree that an internal solution is the only feasible and practical solution likely to emerge from any talks and that it is extremely foolish to rule out such options even before the democratic politicians in Northern Ireland agree to sit around the table?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said at the outset, it is foolish to rule anything in or out in relation to these discussions.  There should not be any preconditions.  It is essential that politicians who want to bring about a solution to the problems in Northern Ireland should make themselves available so that we can resume the dialogue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Tánaiste accept that there is a great sense of concern and frustration at the lack of progress and delay in getting talks under way?  Will he indicate the timetable to which the Government is working at present?  What are his expectations in the short to medium term so that the sense of concern and frustration might be relieved and people could look forward with some hope and confidence to the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, I would like to allay any fears which are causing concern to Deputy O'Keeffe and others, but it is difficult to put a timeframe on this matter.  At our last meeting the Secretary of State and I said we would do everything possible to resume the process of dialogue.  The Secretary of State is having a series of bilateral meetings with the leaders of political parties in Northern Ireland.  I have told them I am available if they wish to contact me.  We are hoping <Col N="488" /> that we might get the talks process in train prior to the summer with a view to serious dialogue in the autumn. Obviously, it depends on the day to day response from the various political leaders.</P>

      <Quest>if, in regard to the address by his Minister of State to Dáil Éireann on 2 April 1993 when he spoke of the need for the public to have greater access to information about the EC, its decision-making procedures and the significance of these decisions, he will give details of the steps, if any, which have been agreed by the interdepartmental European Affairs Committee to improve the situation; when these steps will be implemented; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The interdepartmental European Coordination Committee, which the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, chairs has examined the question of the improvement of public information on European Community matters and the committee has agreed on the terms of a report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general terms, the report concludes that the objective of an information strategy on European Community affairs should be to educate and to promote understanding, open communication, confidence, trust and a sense of involvement, participation and goodwill on the part of the general public towards the EC and towards the Government's policies on EC matters.  The report covers a number of areas which can be summarised as follows.  Government information on EC affairs should be delivered in clear and precise language; it should be presented in an objective and credible manner.  There will be better liaison on information matters between Government Departments and the offices of the <Col N="489" /> EC Commission and European Parliament in Dublin and with voluntary agencies such as the Irish Council of the European Movement and the Institute for European Affairs.  There should be increased briefings of media representatives on aspects of EC business by Ministers and, where appropriate, by civil servants.  Ministers, Departments and State agencies will be asked to have greater regard in their publicity activities to the EC dimension of their work.  Greater use will be made of the EC logo and flag by Government agencies.  The possibilities for the better dissemination of information via the media will be explored, particularly where local radio is concerned.  The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs could have a very important role in the dissemination of information through its proceedings and reports.</P>

      <P>Would the Tánaiste agree that, apart from the question of information, one of the critical issues not just in Ireland but elsewhere in relation to the development of the European Community is the feeling that ordinary people are not involved in that process?  While the proposals the Tánaiste has outlined might improve the image of the European Community, would he not agree that more openness and transparency with regard to Council meetings would be a major step forward in reassuring people about the decision making process and involving them to a greater degree in the discussions which take place at those meetings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I have voiced that opinion on many occasions.  It is important that people outside the political arena are involved in the European process.  Difficulties have arisen in relation to the dissemination of information and access to information on Community business. This is a matter which is under discussion by the Council of Ministers and it is difficult to know if in fact the opening up of the Council meetings would of itself go any way towards solving the problems. The Deputy will be aware that the first <Col N="490" /> meeting of the General Affairs Council this year was a televised session.  The general conclusion afterwards was that it was not exactly the best way to make information available to the public. However, it is under review and I accept that we have to do everything possible to engage the public in European community affairs.</P>

      <P>Would the Tánaiste agree that the principle of subsidiarity, which is spoken about at length in European circles, could be equally applied at home? Would he agree that we have a very centralised system of Government in this country and that people feel totally alienated from the political system because they feel no sense of involvement?  Would the Tánaiste agree it is disgraceful that it took so long for the Government to publish even a summary of the ESRI report on the national plan on structural funding and that it was so difficult to force the Government into the House next week to debate the national plan for the spending of £8 billion of EC money on behalf of the people of Ireland over the next six or seven years?  Would the Tánaiste also agree that he has missed an opportunity to give the sense of involvement he says he is seeking to promote in the community&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Deputy will be aware that the Minister of State in my office, also attached to the Department of Finance, for the first time a Government Minister ever did so, met all of the regional committees on the preparation of the national development plan relating to the Structural Funds.  That was done and there will be a discussion in this House in relation to it.  I have no difficulty with more information being made available by this House and by local authorities. In terms of subsidiarity, if there are things we can do at regional level or at national level, then they will be done at those levels, not at European level.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. S. Brennan) Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. S. Brennan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann, pursuant to the provisions of section 2 (6) of the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978 (No. 17 of 1978), hereby confirms the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978 (Section 2) Order, 1993 (S.I. No. 135 of 1993), made under section 2 (4) of the Act, copies of which Order were laid before Dáil Éireann on 25 May, 1993.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this resolution is to confirm an order made by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment on 21 May 1993 under the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978 relating to the financial criteria which apply to mergers and take-overs for the purposes of that Act.</P>
      <P>The order, which doubles the thresholds under the mergers and take-overs legislation, is in accordance with a specific recommendation of the Moriarty Task Force on the implementation of the Culliton report.  The increase will not affect the position of mergers and take-overs proposals involving newspapers, all of which will continue to be notifiable irrespective of the scale of the operations involved.</P>
      <P>Since the removal of old borders throughout Europe it is essential that Irish firms be allowed to create the size of enterprise needed to compete in the vastly increased European market place. The present limits, which predate the Single European Act, are now too low and need to be increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Allowing them to remain at their lower level creates uncertainty for those who wish to build larger scale operations. These concerns have been expressed by the Moriarty Group, which has recommended increasing the financial limits. The decision to raise the limits is a further step in the implementation of the Culliton <Col N="556" /> report.  This measure is, therefore, part of the package of measures which are being taken to ensure that the report is implemented.</P>
    <P>The effect of the increase will be to take a significant number of small scale mergers outside the scope of the mergers and take-overs legislation.  This action keeps up the momentum in the process of the implementation of Culliton.</P>
    <P>The Moriarty recommendation is not a theoretical one; it has practical effects. Looking back at the notifications under the 1978 Act over the past decade, a clear pattern emerges.  From a level of almost 50 notifications in 1982 the number has climbed fairly steadily to almost 150 in 1992.  The exceptions to his trend are the years 1985 and 1986 where the number of notifications fell below those of 1984. A reasonable explanation of this was the increase in financial thresholds in 1985. The persistent upward trend was not long in reasserting itself.  Control of merger activity is essential to safeguard competition. However, it must be recognised that it places a burden on business and that burden must be proportional to the threat to competition.</P>
    <P>It is essential, therefore, for the administration to keep in mind the burden it imposes and to keep its procedures under review.  This is not solely a question of reviewing thresholds periodically.  Time limits and administrative practices also need to be reviewed.  Changes in the procedure under the 1978 Act brought about by the Competition Act, 1991 mean that except where a case is referred to the competition authority by the Minister, and such cases are rare, a decision must generally be given within one month of all relevant information being available.  As a matter of administrative practice my Department aims for a decision within two weeks.  In recent times this objective has been met in the majority of cases.  I am anxious to ensure that, without increasing resources for the task, this will continue to be the case.  The doubling of thresholds which should reduce the <Col N="557" /> number of notifications will in itself help achieve this aim.</P>
    <P>The Moriarty Group also urged that greater competition should continue to be promoted within Ireland, and with increased urgency and vigour in all markets for goods and services.  As the House is aware it pointed out that the application of competition policy and of monopoly and merger controls is vital so as to prevent abuse of a dominant position, either in markets for new material inputs or in final products markets.</P>
    <P>In essence, a key message emanating from the Culliton report and from the follow-up Moriarty Group, is that competition must become a strategic part of our thinking both for policy makers and the business community.  The environment created by the Competition Act, 1991 is essential to prevent any company abusing a dominant position.  Indeed, the Competition Act created a new framework to deal with anti-competitive behaviour and the abuse of a dominant position.  It enables any party who consider themselves injured by anti-competitive behaviour to seek relief through the courts.  Any enterprise excluded from the scope of the 1978 Act by virtue of the present increase in the limits will continue, therefore, to be subject to the Competition Act, 1991.</P>
    <P>The Competition Act has been in place since 1991 and has already brought an awareness of the benefits of competition to many businesses and individuals. Much work remains to be done, however, in improving the climate for a more competitive, efficient economy.  I can assure the House that this Government will pursue this goal with determination in view of the significant benefits to be gained for the Irish economy at large.</P>
    <P>We now have to take a hard look at the structures and rules that regulate business, industry and services.  Just because it is the way things are or have always been done, does not mean that it is still appropriate for today's environment. We must examine all aspects of our regulatory environment against the yardstick of competition.  Are the legislative and regulatory instruments such that industry <Col N="558" /> or business can operate efficiently, progressively and with benefits for the consumer? With these questions in mind we have begun to look at the many controls restrictions and licensing systems which can operate to restrict competition in trades, professions and services.</P>
    <P>What we want to do is to create opportunities, to open doors and to break down barriers &mdash; to create a climate for enterprise. By the end of 1993 we will have gone some way towards identifying where we need to move in this direction.</P>
    <P>The summer report of the Central Bank also reminded us of the need to look at ways to increase competition.  The report advocated greater competition and transparency in non-competitive sectors such as many public utilities and professional services.  Public utilities and services will not be immune from our assessments.  Already at EC level public utilities such as telecommunications, electricity and gas industries have been viewed as sectors where competition can play a role with benefits for the consumer and for the industries themselves.  It is my view that we should undertake our own assessment of our public utilities to ascertain where competition can best serve all our interests.  This is a process which we must undertake without delay, as for many of these services, competition from the Single Market and from third countries is just around the corner.</P>
    <P>In the same vein, one of the key recommendations of the Moriarty Group accepted by Government was to look at the restrictive arrangements and other limitations which operate to limit entry of suitably qualified people to trades, professions or services.  Any suggestions, therefore, that access to any of the professions be limited for any reason other than the safety or welfare of the consumer would be entirely contrary to the task force's recommendation and correspondingly will not be entertained by the Government.</P>
    <P>Mergers and take-overs can take place for a variety of reasons, such as economies of scale to be achieved by mutually complementary business operations, new business opportunities, market diversification, <Col N="559" /> expansion and so on.  The external growth of businesses does not, however, have to be viewed in negative light in all cases if such development increases efficiency of the undertakings concerned and leads to new employment opportunities, among other things.  Thus, while the reasons for, and advantages of, mergers and take-overs are usually directly associated with the enterprises concerned in the first instance, the final result of mergers and take-overs can also be of significant benefit to the economy as a whole.  If, however, such proposals result in dominance in the market place to such a degree that effective competition is eroded or eliminated altogether, the adverse effects on the economy can be very serious.</P>
    <P>Businesses which are not exposed to the rigours of competition in their own territorial areas often do not have to strive to realise efficiency gains.  In addition, their position of relative comfort in the market may tempt them to impose unfair purchase or selling prices or trading conditions, or limit production, all of which would ultimately be against the best interests of the economy.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, therefore, the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978, as amended, imposes a strict requirement on businesses considering mergers or take-overs to notify such proposals to the Minister for Enterprise and Employment in advance of putting them into effect. Under the Act, any proposal which exceeds certain financial limits must be notified to the Minister.  These limits, which are specified in section 2 (1) (a) of the Act, currently apply the Act where the value of the gross assets of each of two or more of the enterprises involved in the proposal is not less than £5 million or where the turnover of each of those two or more enterprises is not less than £10 million.</P>
    <P>Cases which are notified to the Minister for Enterprise and Employment under the Act are subjected to a detailed assessment by the Department in the first instance with a view to assessing their <Col N="560" /> likely implications for competition, employment and a variety of other considerations with due regard to the interests of the common good.  In addition to requiring notification for the Minister's clearance under the Act, a proposed merger or take-over may be the subject of a reference to the Competition Authority and, ultimately, may become subject to an order prohibiting it absolutely or conditionally.</P>
    <P>The 1978 Act made special provision, in section 2 (4), for increasing, by order, the amounts specified in the financial limits relating to mergers and take-overs. Any such order also requires confirmation by both Houses within 21 sitting days after presentation, otherwise it will lapse.  The present order, which is the second such order providing for an increase in those amounts, was laid before each House on 25 May 1993.  The previous order to which I referred earlier was made on 8 July 1985.</P>
    <P>It is, in my view, necessary and desirable that the limits which were last amended in 1985 should be increased and the Minister has made the order accordingly. The new limits, as set out in the order and as recommended by the Moriarty Group are £10 million and £20 million for gross assets and turnover respectively, in merger or take-over cases.  The new limits proposed in the order should ensure that the provisions of the 1978 Act apply only to the types of enterprises for which it was intended and I commend the motion to the House accordingly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to the Order before the House.  It makes for sensible bookkeeping.  I wish to comment on the wider issue of competition policy being pursued by the Government.  I searched the Programme for Government in vain for any real commitment to competition policy.  In the programme, competition is hedged around with qualifications included to protect the interests which the Government might wish to serve.  The Government has ignored substantial opportunity for gain in this economy through an effective competition policy.  I am sure the Minister is aware of <Col N="561" /> a recent independent study carried out by the economists Fitzpatrick and Somerville in which they estimated Ireland could realise gains of £265 million from an effective competition policy which we do not have.  Those gains would be partly enjoyed by the consumer and, more importantly, they would be enjoyed where barriers to entry came down and new businesses, employment and output could develop as a result.</P>
      <P>I am disturbed that the Government seems to prefer the cosiness of good relations with those businesses that are gaining from uncompetitive practices in the Irish economy to an effective policy that would exploit the opportunities that exist for consumers and those out of work now.</P>
      <P>The Competition Authority which was set up by this House some years ago is a toothless Authority by comparison with any similar authorities in EC countries and, indeed, by comparison with the EC Commission.  If has no powers to receive complaints from third parties concerning abuses of dominant positions; it has no powers to initiate investigations into anti-competitive practices and it has no powers to prosecute offenders.  In effect, it must wait until cases are brought to its attention by companies and it then adjudicates upon them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is crazy to have a system here where we expect the consumer, the small person, to take on business giants and effectively take them to court to pursue cases where they may be abusing dominant positions or exploiting competitive advantages.  That is not realistic.  We introduced a small claims court here because we recognised that consumers cannot effectively complain about items they purchase.  Yet while we have done that for simple consumer items we expect people to become involved in this much more complex area and challenge instances of competitive abuse or expect the smaller businesses which might be affected by such anti-competitive behaviour to resource the taking of such cases. It is foolish to introduce further legislation in that area and I would have been more pleased to hear the Minister indicating <Col N="562" /> that he will overhaul the Competition Act and introduce reforms that would correct those defects.  That would be much more encouraging than the wishy washy statement in the Moriarty report which is very short on detail.</P>
    <P>Quite apart from the defects of the Competition Authority the Government has starved it of resources.  A recent article in <i>The Irish Times</i> reported that there are 1,100 cases awaiting decision from the Competition Authority but in the two years of its existence it has decided upon only 17 cases.  If that position continued it would take the Authority 100 years to deal with the backlog of cases.  On numerous occasions the Government has been told that it has not effectively resourced this Authority.  Only three members have been appointed to the Authority and it is my understanding that no decision can be reached without the approval of three members.  Therefore, if anyone is out sick or away decisions cannot be taken.  The Act provides for the appointment of additional people and I cannot understand why the Government has not appointed sufficient members to deal with the backlog or appointed people temporarily if it does not want to commit itself to permanent increases in staff that may not be required in the long-term.  A backlog of cases is building up in the Competition Authority and it is unacceptable that they are being left unaddressed.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed that the Minister's speech did not deal with that matter. The research to which I referred earlier indicated the potential for gains of up to £265 million and this was backed up by recommendations that an investment of £5 million could effectively realise those gains.  There is need to reform the Act, to devote resources to investigation of potential abuses of power, to survey and study retail prices to identify potential areas where consumers may be ripped off, to resource cases being taken by third parties so that members of the Authority might attend meetings regarding such cases and contribute to effective policy-making emerging in this area from court practice.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="563" /> Many things could and should be done on a tight schedule and it is a mystery that the Moriarty report, which examined ways to deal with issues quickly and administratively by Government, failed to address this area.  The Government could second to the Authority, from its resources in the Department of Enterprise and Employment, the necessary funds to enable the Authority to carry out this work.  It rings hollow to hear the Minister of State repeating the Government's commitment to competition and all the virtues that can be wheeled out here but we hear nothing about actual policy action.</P>
    <P>The Government seems to have a sneaking regard for companies involved in restrictive practices.  I am aware that at least four major State companies are among those against whom the EC Commission has taken action for abuse of dominant position.  It must be said that if the Government's flagship companies are abusing dominant positions it is difficult to expect private business to behave differently.  It is not surprising that we have, in effect, developed here an extremely &ldquo;cartelised&rdquo; economy.  Cases have been taken against Ireland in the trade and goods sector alone, which we all recognise is the more competitive sector.  Major Irish companies have been before the courts for abuse of dominant position.  Those include companies involved in the sugar and fruit business, the manufacture of concrete products, as well as those involved in air transport, the distilling industry, the health insurance industry, the television guide market, etc.  Major operators in Ireland are being arranged before the EC courts for abuse of dominant position but they are not being prosecuted under Irish law.  It makes a joke of competition law here if the effective pursuit of cases will be taken now at EC level.  It makes a nonsense of commitment in this area.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about competition policy we must move away from direct political control in this area.  It is wrong that Ministers might see this area of policy as one where they can entertain <Col N="564" /> lobby groups or hand out patronage. Unfortunately, as the Takeovers and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1979 is now established it lends itself to such activities. First, it is up to the Minister to take the initiative under this Act; the criteria which are listed in the Act are extremely broad and do not provide anyone approaching a case of a merger with any sense of confidence as to how the Government or any individual Minister might act.</P>
    <P>Some examples of this include details such as harmony with Government and regional policy and many other unspecified areas.  To achieve radical change in this area we must address this issue much more realistically than the Government did in its reaction to the Moriarty report. We have not examined the non-traded area where much greater abuses exist than those which the EC Commission have highlighted in our traded sector.  We need an effective Competition Authority that can eliminate these restrictive practices in trades and professions.  It must not be left to the Minister or his Department, as is indicated in the Moriarty report, to do some sort of a trawl where it will be open to all forms of lobbying and very awkward political decisions.  We should commit ourselves to a competition policy and allow the independent people who have the responsibility to carry on their work.  I would like to see that change and I hope the Minister will come back at the end of the year when he has reviewed the matter and indicate that that is the way forward.  There is no future in Ministers simply identifying a few cases in order to give an appearance of commitment in regard to this area but in reality not making that commitment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>As this is a topic of some importance one would like to have more than ten minutes available to speak on it because it is only occasionally that one can advert to competition policy in this House, despite the fact that I personally regard it as very important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Has the Minister of State taken into account the recent decision of Mr. Justice Johnson in Meagher <i>v.</i> the Minister <Col N="565" /> for Agriculture, known generally as the angel dust case.  It is interesting that on the day we debate this matter the Minister's colleague, the Minister for the Environment, deleted section 3 from the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, simply because it would run counter to the decision in the Meagher case.  Obviously the Bill was drafted before the decision was given in that case, that is why the Department for the Environment realised the section would not stand up because a Minister does not have power to make an order which changes the provisions of an Act.</P>
    <P>It could be argued that this order is different because it will be approved by a positive resolution of this and the other House.  Nonetheless it does not get over the principle enunciated in the Meagher case which is that if the Legislature fixes particular figures in legislation, only the Legislature can change them.  This matter should be considered by the Minister and the Department.  One can argue that in a motion at least the spirit of the requirement is dealt with, but it does not fulfil the letter of the requirement.  A motion in which each Member can speak for only ten minutes is not very useful.  It is much different from proper consideration of a Bill over a period of perhaps a couple of weeks, with an interval for Committee Stage and Report Stage.</P>
    <P>Another point to which I wish to refer which, to my surprise was not adverted to in the Minister's relatively lengthy speech, is the problem that has arisen under the decision of the Competition Authority in the Woodchester and UDT case.  I cleared Woodchester and UDT about 18 months ago and it created no difficulty; it was relatively straight-forward. However, it was apparently thought necessary to refer the case to the Competition Authority under either section 4 or section 5 &mdash; or both &mdash; of the Competition Act, 1991.  The Competition Authority, as I am sure the Minister knows, decided in that case that Woodchester and UDT had a concurrent jurisdiction and the fact that the Minister for Industry and Commerce had cleared it under the 1978 Act did not mean it automatically <Col N="566" /> had clearance under sections 4 and 5 of the 1991 Act.  That fundamental problem is not adverted to in the Minister's speech.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to quote Culliton, the justification for practically everything nowadays.  However, Culliton did not recommend these figures.  From a careful reading of the Minister's speech it is obvious he is referring to the Moriarty report although he briefly referred to Culliton at the start of his speech.  If Culliton or, more specifically Moriarty, identified a problem it lies in the Woodchester-UDT decision rather than in the thresholds set out under the 1985 order, which do not pose a great problem.</P>
    <P>If the CPI is applied to the 1985 figures it will not result in a 100 per cent increase or anything like it.  The Minister and the House should bear in mind that simply by removing from the scope of the 1978 Act many mergers and takeovers that might be otherwise examined under it we are not making matters easier in terms of competition.  On the contrary, more difficulties may arise for the consumer by excluding all these mergers and takeovers.</P>
    <P>I will instance one type of case which is not unusual in many sectors of business here, that is where one large dominant firm which is above even the amended thresholds can pick off all its competitors below the threshold because the requirement under the order is that two or more of the enteprises must comply with one or other of the threshold requirements &mdash; a firm must have £10 million in gross assets or £20 million in turnover.  If all the competitors of a particular dominant firm do not meet that requirement, which is quite possible, it could pick off each one individually, which is undesirable. That is one aspect of this matter that has always concerned me, and the problem is accentuated by increasing the threshold to such an extent.  There seems to be an underlying assumption in the Minister's speech that if firms are removed from control they are made more competitive, but the opposite may well be the case in many instances.  The Minister should <Col N="567" /> reflect on that matter because his reasoning is wrong in this regard.</P>
    <P>The great weakness in the 1978 Act &mdash; I was sponsor of that Act, as I was of the 1991 Act&mdash;is that it does not apply to public utilities.  I tried very hard at the time to get agreement on this matter.  It was not a matter of political controversy that I could not get agreement but it was certainly a matter of enormous effort on the part of certain Departments and the various bodies for whom they had responsibility that this legislation should not apply to them.  Happily, in the meantime Europe has come to our rescue in many respects.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton rightly read out a list of cases dealt with in recent years.  I welcome that but it is a great pity that only the European Commission deals with some of these Irish publicly owned giants. In terms of Irish law they are immune to normal competitive requirements, which is regrettable.  Let us look at some of the instances in which the Commission has intervened &mdash; for example it fined Aer Lingus more than £500,000 for engaging in totally unacceptable restrictive practices. It will obviously have a field day with Telecom if the Government's present proposals go ahead because it is clearly in breach of Article 90.  Deputy Bruton listed other, equally important, instances and there will be many more in the future.  We should not be dependent on Europe in these matters; our law should reflect these requirements.</P>
    <P>Because of the size of the increase and the fact that it is potentially uncompetitive to allow so many firms automatic clearance I might in some circumstances have considered voting against this order, but on balance it is probably better not to do so.  Particularly disappointing in the Minister's speech is the fact that he does not refer to the real issues but tends to repeat the concepts as they were some years ago.  However, they have changed greatly since.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton referred to the backlog in the work of the Competition Authority. I am not here to defend the Authority but it is better to put its difficulty in <Col N="568" /> perspective.  It received notification of nearly 2,000 cases in one day in October last.  The office had to be kept open until midnight to take in the vast volume of paper handed in at the last minute.  That was because there was a requirement in the 1991 Act that certain things be notified within 12 months.  Once the principle is decided in the bulk of those cases all of them will flow automatically from it.  I understand that that has been largely done so that the perceived hold-up, or backlog, is one which will disappear very quickly.  It is a once-off matter which will not give rise to problems in the future.</P>

      <P>I would have liked to have dealt with general competition principles and to comment on what the Minister said.  Unfortunately, I will not have an opportunity to do so.  I am sure the Minister appreciates the importance of genuine competition policy and law.  Perhaps it can be arranged that we can have a proper debate and not be confined to an impossibly short period as we are now. The more one can convey to the public at large the desirability and the value of such policy and law, the more the consumer, employment and business generally will benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>To take up the point Deputy O'Malley made, this matter came before the Whips' meeting at which I was coincidentally present.  It was proposed by the Government that this should be put through without debate.  The remarks we have just heard from Deputies Bruton and O'Malley point to precisely how bad a practice that is, because at the end of the day in the context of industrial policy the theory which underpins competition and the issues that have been touched on here are central.  It is not desirable that it be put through the House without debate.  I objected to that and the Government Chief Whip agreed the format now.  It has become clear that as a format it is inadequate to cope with <Col N="569" /> something as important as this.  I understand that the Bill in regard to FÁS will be published tomorrow and, perhaps, that will give us an opportunity to raise the issue again.</P>
      <P>There are many questions which the Minister did not deal with in his opening address.  He adverted to the fact that this was a further step in the implementation of the recommendations in the Culliton report.  There is no reference in the Culliton report to raising the thresholds with which we are dealing.  The Moriarty report is a different story, and the chairman, drawing on all his native ingenuity managed to trim back the Culliton report in important respects, obviously with an eye to what this Government might accept.  Then the Government trimmed it further.  For the Government to now claim it is implementing the Culliton report is not only misleading but an insult to the intelligence of those who take an interest in these things and have read the report.  Whatever this has to do with, it does not relate to Culliton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I asked what the Government proposed to put through without debate I was assured that it did not include the newspaper industry.  The Minister made the point that the increases will not affect the position of mergers and takeovers involving newspapers.  I presume that was said deliberately to steer one away from believing that anything pushed through the House might be taken advantage of, for example in the threat under which the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> exists.  I notice that on other occasions the Minister confirmed he had informal contacts with the Independent group about that.  In summing up, will the Minister comment on that, because it seems that the independent group already controls the two biggest selling Sunday newspapers?  To allow it to acquire a controlling interest in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> would give it effective control of 70 per cent of Sunday newspaper sales.  Given that the Independent group already controls the biggest selling daily paper, the <i>Irish Independent,</i> and has a substantial share in the <i>Star</i> and controls around 30 per cent of the provincial press we are now approaching a <Col N="570" /> situation of unhealthy dominance of the newspaper market by one group.  That is exacerbated by the fact that the Irish Press group seems to be labouring under difficulties at the moment.</P>
    <P>It is not in the interests of democracy that the Government should control or monopolise the press, but neither is it in the interest of democracy that any one commercial group or individual should be able to use its wealth to control or monopolise so much of the press that it has a disproportionate influence over public opinion.  Certainly, the experience in the UK where individuals like Rupert Murdoch have been allowed to gobble up great sections of the media has not all been positive.  In addition some of the media coverage of various political events are invariably conditioned by the perspective of the particular newspaper group.</P>
    <P>I do not hold any brief for the <i>Sunday Tribune</i>.  I have on occasion disagreed with the position adopted by its editor, but the paper has generally pursued an independent if sometimes unpredictable editorial line.  The interests of democracy will be best served by having a newspaper industry which reflects a diversity of views and political opinion.  This would be seriously challenged if Mr. O'Reilly and the Independent group are now allowed to acquire the controlling interest in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i>.  The Minister must use his powers to stop that happening.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Independent group argue that the percentage share in the marketplace should take into account British newspapers on sale in the Irish market.  It all seems to be preparatory to the inevitability of takeover.  Notwithstanding the view any Deputy might have about the <i>Sunday Tribune,</i> that would be undesirable.  Will the Minister comment?</P>
    <P>I would also like the Minister to comment on a central question raised by Deputy O'Malley concerning the implications of the Woodchester UDT case and whether the issues raised by that case are not more important than the question of thresholds.  If one does not think about <Col N="571" /> it, the 1978 Act seems reasonable, that the limits were raised in 1985 and are now raised again, but the issues Deputy O'Malley raised in this context require an answer.  When the Competition Bill was being put through the House.  I said, in relation to a remark made by Deputy Bruton, and as reported at column 1539 of the Official Report for 30 April 1991:</P>
    <P>It is ironic that the Minister chooses to abolish the existing mechanisms in favour of a new competition Authority which amazingly can only be triggered by the Minister himself.  Surely what is required is an independent, executive, sceptical, suspicious, pro-active Authority which initiate their own investigations and studies, quite apart from the views of whoever happens to be the Minister of the day.  Indeed it flies in the face of the arms length trend of recent years in the public service which caused bodies like Telecom Éireann, An Post and even the office of the Ombudsman to be established.  It leaves the new Authority open to the vagaries of the political and cultural disposition of the Minister for Industry and Commerce of the day.  It is unthinkable in a political culture of patronage and against the backdrop of our recent record of collusion between business and politics that this Minister should advocate the creation of such a critical new Authority as a tool of the Minister rather than as an executive, independent Authority that is its own matter.</P>
    <P>That question mark still hangs over the functioning of the Competition Authority. I note the Minister does not say that this order is concerned only with thresholds but deals also with procedures, time limits and so on.  He instanced the rule of thumb where, if a matter is not referred by the Minister &mdash; which he acknowledges is a rare enough event&mdash;there is a kind of two-week rule <Col N="572" /> of thumb within the Department which has been met on almost all occasions.</P>
    <P>I had been under the impression that to some extent this measure had been prompted by the fact that, as currently resourced and organised, the Competition Authority cannot deal with the number of cases coming before it and that part of the purpose of this order was to remove from its ambit a good number of prospective mergers that will not now require to be scrutinised.</P>

      <P>I thank Members for their contributions to this motion.  I agree with the view that there are much broader issues involved here than the rather net point of thresholds and procedures.  Indeed, we should endeavour to find an occasion on which we can debate them.  Certainly I would welcome such an opportunity enormously.  It would be unfair to endeavour to deal with those broader issues today, some of which have been touched on, some of which I agree with and others I do not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Competition Act, 1991 is now one year old.  In its way it was a very fine attempt to put a stamp of competition on our economy.  Being a year old &mdash; and there having been some cases dealt with under its provisions &mdash; it is now appropriate that we should sit down and ascertain where it goes henceforth.  I might inform the House that we have decided to do just that, to review the Competition Act, 1991 in detail in the light of the 12 months' experience of its operation.  It was a useful and a good attempt to commence the procedure of insisting on competition in our economy and embodying that purpose in one Bill.  Therefore, I very much look forward to bringing a review of the provisions of that Act before the House as soon as possible and, perhaps on that occasion, to having a fuller debate on competition policy, a debate which we could usefully have. Competition policy has commenced well <Col N="573" /> under the provisions of that Act but we need to think it through further and do so by reviewing the provisions of that Act rather urgently.</P>
    <P>Deputy Richard Bruton asked whether I would overhaul the provisions of the Act.  That would be a useful thing to attempt to do once we have reviewed its provisions carefully.  Deputy O'Malley asked me about a number of points.  I have no advice to the effect that any difficulty was experienced <i>vis-à-vis</i> the angel dust case.  I have received no comments from the Attorney General's office in that regard.  I am not in a position to respond to the Deputy's direct question other than to say that I do not have any advice that any difficulty is being experienced in that area.</P>
    <P>In making my opening remarks today my understanding is that clearly the Minister has power under the legislation to make the order and that the order is being made properly in compliance with that legislation.  That is my advice at this point.  Of course, the Woodchester case was cleared by the Minister; the Competition Authority was notified by the parties involved.  As the House will be aware, the Competition Authority said it had jurisdiction.  This has now turned out to be a very difficult, complex area.  I require to examine it within the context of the review about which I have just spoken.  Indeed, the Woodchester-UDT case must form an urgent and central part of that review.  That case has exposed a difficult, complex area which we had not anticipated and which I do not believe had been anticipated by the framers of the original Act.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley also asked about the down side of removing companies from the scope of competition, pointing out that in many ways that, in itself, could be anti-competitive.  That also is possible but Deputy O'Malley himself instanced 2,000 cases in one day flooding into the Competition Authority, right up to midnight. If one needed any more evidence that that was not necessarily the best way to <Col N="574" /> do everything &mdash; that is to have almost everything notified to an over-worked authority &mdash; that must be a good example and indeed a good reason one would seek to exempt as many transactions as possible from approval.  I take the point that exempting transactions does not always automatically help competition but, in a general sense, the more transactions one can exempt from having to seek either Government or Competition Authority approval the freer will be the system, resulting in fewer cases to be adjudicated on.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Richard Bruton who spoke of 1,200 cases awaiting a decision.  That cannot be good for business or competition.  While there is no easy answer I take the view that one is better off to exempt as many transactions as possible from awaiting decisions in a queue like that and adhere to a system within which one checks up on exceptions rather than endeavour to measure every transaction against a rule laid down.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte asked me to comment on <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> case.  I agree with Deputy Rabbitte that <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> fills a very important niche in the Irish newspaper industry and is a highly respected newspaper.</P>

      <P>It is that time of year again when the air conditioning system in Leinster House ceases to function and the queues in Molesworth Street for the Passport Office lengthen.  The two appear to coincide.  The Minister is probably well aware that on 6 May last there were parliamentary questions, including a priority question, tabled regarding the problem obtaining in the Passport Office in Molesworth Street.  In reply to those questions the Minister stated that the position which developed in the Passport Office last year was exceptional, in that the postal strike coincided with the busy, peak season for passport applications.  He went on to say that queues and delays on the same scale were not anticipated this year.  I might point out to the Minister that they are bigger and longer and almost reached into the grounds of Leinster House yesterday morning when, at approximately 10.30 a.m., I counted something in the region of 300 people <Col N="576" /> queueing at the office.  The position was not much better today.</P>
      <P>I can understand that this is the peak season when people going abroad apply but surely some better way of doing this could be organised.  I do not know whether the fault lies entirely with the public all of whom apply simultaneously. Perhaps it does.  But I sympathise with the staff of the Passport Office, first and foremost, and, second, with the people who must travel from all parts of the country to obtain passports, who must queue for hours on end and in some cases, having to remain in Dublin overnight. Surely some better system can be devised?</P>
      <P>According to the Minister's reply on 6 May, 65 additional staff had been recruited to deal with the influx of applications. Perhaps that number has increased but there is something wrong. Is the Passport Office large enough and should we consider the possibility of other offices given that the office in Cork has helped in alleviating the overall position? Perhaps four or five centres should be open during certain months of the year.  I would like to hear what the Minister's view is and I hope this problem can be solved.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has presented his case in a reasonable manner and I will try to be as constructive as possible.  I am conscious that there is discontent among the public and that the current conditions in the Passport Office in Dublin are less than ideal.  A combination of factors has given rise to these problems, including the cyclical nature of demand, the physical space limitations in the Passport Office and problems in predicting levels of demand from one year to the next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the greatest issue which inhibits accurate forward-planning is the unpredictability of the level of demand for passports.  In the period 1987-91 the demand for passports was reasonably <Col N="577" /> stable at around 160,000.  In 1992, however, there was an increase of almost 20 per cent in demand.  There has been a continued increase in demand this year to date, with a record increase of 10 per cent in May alone over the same month in previous years.</P>
    <P>In the traditionally busy April to July period the Passport Office deals on a daily basis with an average of around 1,200 applications.  In an effort to cope as promptly and efficiently as possible with this exceptionally heavy demand, significant numbers of additional temporary staff are recruited every year.  At present, 86 additional temporary staff members are supplementing the permanent staff of the Passport Office. Additionally, the staff of the Passport Office are working overtime to cope with the demand.</P>
    <P>People queue outside the office before it opens &mdash; I have seen them myself on many mornings &mdash; in order to get their business dealt with as quickly as possible when the office opens.</P>

      <P>To meet the consequent demand we have as an exceptional measure provided for four additional temporary counters which has done much to ease the situation.  Unfortunately, due to the capacity of the present office and the large numbers of people who apply in person at this time of year it is inevitable that waiting periods in these circumstances can be somewhat long. However, I want to emphasise that nobody is turned away and all applicants who come to the Passport Office in person have their applications examined that same day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="578" /> I appreciate that some members of the public have encountered difficulties in getting though to the Passport Office by phone.  We have experienced certain technical problems with a number of lines over recent weeks and we have taken prompt steps to try to rectify these.  We have also advanced our planning for the expansion and modernisation of the telephone system in the Passport Office.</P>
    <P>We have placed special emphasis on trying to overcome the problems associated with seasonality of demand.  The House will recall the introduction last year of a special low-season fee for passport applications received during the months of October and November.  The campaign was very well received by the public and was reasonably successful in its objective.  Therefore I propose to continue this campaign this year.</P>
    <P>The Department over the past few years has also conducted a publicity campaign with the aim of encouraging people to apply for their passports in good time. If people applied in good time they would get a very good service.  As part of this campaign, the Passport Office has participated in the annual Holiday Fairs in Dublin and, as from last year, in Cork, at which it has dealt with several thousand inquiries.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Passport Office also ran an advertising campaign in the national press at the end of March this year aimed specifically at urging those intending to travel abroad to check that they have an up-to-date passport and, if not, to apply in good time, and to apply as far as possible by post.  A greater reliance on postal applications would help substantially to reduce queues in the Passport Office.</P>
    <P>The passport application form states that six weeks should be allowed for the processing of postal applications during the peak season.  However, the Passport Office consistently achieves much better turnaround rates than this.  Currently, for properly completed postal applications, the waiting time is about four to four and <Col N="579" /> a half weeks.  This is good by international standards.</P>
    <P>I am conscious that the acquisition of additional space would considerably ease the conditions in the public office during peak periods.  Until recently, there was no suitable additional space in the building in which the Passport Office is housed in Molesworth Street.  However, we are currently exploring a possible opportunity in this area and we will be following up actively on this.</P>
    <P>A shift in demand away from the Passport Office in Dublin would, as the Deputy suggested help in reducing waiting times in the public office in the city. A regionalisation plan for the Passport Office is under active consideration within the Department.  As part of this plan, we envisage the upgrading of the existing Cork office to computerise it and to make it a full passport issuing office for the Munster region.  However, there is a number of aspects, including costs and security &mdash; which is always a consideration in relation to passports &mdash; which require to be considered in depth before any steps are taken.  We are also considering the possibility of other regional offices in due course to eliminate the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this matter and the Minister for the Environment for coming into the House to reply.  He has had a busy day in the House.  I appreciate the fact that he has made himself available again to reply.</P>
      <P>This weekend the country will witness a binge of national lottery mania as the prize fund is set to exceed a record £3.5 million.  That being so, the time has come for us in this House &mdash; we were the ones who set up the national lottery in the first instance &mdash; to stop and take stock and question the logic and fairness of these occasional multi-million pound pay-outs by the national lottery.  The time has come to amend the 1986 Act under which the national lottery was set up in order to confine the maximum prize pay-out in any one national lottery draw to £1 million and to disperse any prize funds which accumulate beyond that amount to deserving welfare, sporting and cultural organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to reassure the House that I am no kill-joy when it comes to having a flutter on the national lottery but the <Col N="581" /> matter is now out of proportion and the time has come to restore some balance. We ought to ask outselves if it is reasonable that a State lottery should create occasional multi-millionaires.  I understand that there are now 16 lotto millionaires at a time when so many worthy welfare, health and sporting organisations are crying out for resources. Many of these organisations would be greatly helped if they were to receive a small amounts.  This would make a big difference to a number of the organisations I have in mind.  I am talking here about women's aid group, women's refuges and rape crisis centres which are scattered throughout the country and whose demands are minor in money terms but whose needs are great in terms of the good they do in the community.</P>
    <P>Looking ahead to Saturday night any person or group of persons would consider themselves lucky if they were to win £1 million. A win of £1 million is about as much as any ordinary person could handle.  I have been reassured by a statement made by one of our more recent Lotto multi-millionaires, Mr. Tom Jones of Ballymun, who said in an RTE radio interview yesterday that if he had won about one third of a million pounds he would have been quite happy, that this would have been enough to satisfy all his needs and that anything above and beyond that figure is of no relevance or benefit to him.  That man's comments should not be ignored.  It should be remembered that he won £1.9 million.</P>
    <P>I was very impressed by the comments made by John O'Shea of Goal on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; today.  He made a harrowing appeal on behalf of the starving millions in the Third World.  His appeal should not fall on deaf ears.  I believe the Government would have the support of everyone if it listened to John O'Shea's appeal and made a provision for this organisation in the disbursement of lottery funds.  Irish people have contributed magnificently on a voluntary basis to overseas aid agencies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="582" /> This is not to ignore the fact that there are groups in Ireland whose need is almost as great as the needs of organisations such as Goal.  If surplus lottery funds were transferred from the prize fund to the fund which is disbursed many groups would benefit greatly.  I am referring to groups such as the Rape Crisis Centre, sporting organisations which believed they would get money from local authorities but have not got any and other needs groups.  I ask the Minister to consider setting a ceiling on the prize fund and to allocate the surplus money to these deserving groups.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Quill for raising this matter.  The points made by her are often expressed by other people throughout the country.  Indeed I have expressed the same opinions on occasion.  When the Deputy has heard my reply she will find that the position is quite different from the one outlined.</P>
      <P>As the lottery jackpot increases, so too does the number of people who play the game.  By setting a ceiling on the jackpot prizes, the amount of money available for needy groups is reduced.  When the Lotto jackpot is £500,000 an average of 600,000 players participate in the game and when the jackpot is heading for more than £3.5 million approximately 1.5 million adults participate in the game.  Therefore the amount of money available to the Government to disburse among needy groups is considerably enhanced when there is a larger jackpot.  It should be pointed out that 83 per cent of jackpot prizes have been for less than £500,000. In fact, when one takes into consideration that many of the winning tickets are owned by groups who share ownership of the tickets then the percentage goes up even further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To put a cap on the size of Lotto jackpots would run the risk of undermining public interest in participation and could well jeopardise the long-term success of the game.  In the circumstances, the Minister for Finance does not propose to issue a direction to An Post National Lottery <Col N="583" /> Company to change the prize structure of the lottery.</P>
    <P>The issue of the level of Ireland's official development assistance is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  However, I might mention that the Government has contributed some £53.2 million in 1993 to overseas development assistance, an increase of almost 25 per cent on the 1992 allocation.  The Government is committed to increasing the level of our ODA progressively in accordance with the Programme for a Partnership Government.</P>
    <P>Since its inception in 1987 to the end of 1992, the national lottery enabled the Government to spend some £346 million on a wide variety of expenditure programmes in areas like youth, sport, arts, the Irish language and health and welfare. This year a further £89 million is being allocated to these areas.  Inevitably the demands for assistance exceed the resources available, particularly from voluntary groups in the areas mentioned by the Deputy.  However, I hope I have demonstrated that capping lottery jackpots would actually worsen the position of groups dependent of lottery funding. This runs counter to the view expressed by many people.  Larger jackpots draw in more funds which are disbursed to needy groups, 83 per cent of jackpot prizes have been for less than £500,000 and many tickets are bought by groups.  The number of people who win jackpots on their own account for a tiny minority of prizewinners.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Student Summer Jobs Scheme.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>In this year's Social Welfare Bill, published on 11 March, the Minister announced the very controversial and, in the opinion of the majority of people, unjust decision to disentitle leaving certificate students and third level students of the right to apply for means tested unemployment assistance. Given the job sitution, both here <Col N="584" /> and abroad, this decision is appalling and inexplicable.</P>
      <P>There are two elements involved in this: first, a school leaver who may not wish or who may be unable to go on to third level education will have to wait for up to three months after the completion of his leaving certificate to sign on for unemployment assistance and, second, the withdrawal of an entitlement which existed in years, that is, the entitlement of a third level student to apply for unemployment assistance during the summer holiday period if he or she could not find work during that period.  The inabilility to find work during the holiday period is hardly an unusual phenomenon nowadays. Students and their parents rightly believe that this decision is an outrageous attack on the social guarantees which natural justice gives them.  In addition, it is flagrant discrimination against these students.</P>
      <P>In order to counter some of the criticisms about these restrictions on students, the Minister announced the summer jobs scheme.  This scheme could have been good if it had been given half a chance to work but, alas, the Minister did not even give it a quarter of a chance. It was decided to fix the weekly income under the scheme at £40 per week.  This was a disgraceful decision; it is the worst example I have seen of asking people to work for low wages.  A recent survey shows that it costs at least £80 per week to keep a student.  The Minister for Social Welfare has decided that they should somehow be able to exist on half that amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To qualify for the scheme a student has to be entitled to £15 per week only in unemployment assistance.  This is a total insult to students.  No student, even those from the lower income brackets could qualify for the scheme.  Students from the average, middle and lower middle income brackets will not be able to qualify for this scheme because the conditions are so restricted &mdash; they are the worst conditions which apply to means tests for <Col N="585" /> unemployment assistance.  These conditions have been condemned over and over again in this House.  For example, students living at home are deemed to have the benefit of board and lodgings. There is also the fictitious notion that a portion of the parents' income or, even worse, a portion of the income of other members of the household, somehow goes into the pocket of an applicant.  This simply does not happen in 99.9 per cent of cases.  We have condemned that attitude. The Minister, in responding to parliamentary questions tabled by me, acknowledged there is something wrong and that he would like to do something about it but it has been continued in this scheme.</P>
    <P>The questions on the application form are intrusive.  The students are asked to state the third level grant they are getting, their income under any deed of covenant or if they have savings in a bank, post office or credit union account.  These questions are unnecessasry.  There is also a range of intrusive questions in regard to their parents' income; how much each parent earns; whether either parent is in receipt of social welfare and the level of their rent or mortgage payments.  There is also a range of personal questions about other members of the family.  The students are asked to name and state the family members who are employed and unemployed, again implying that a portion of the income earned can be attributed to them.</P>
    <P>This scheme in its present form is a disgrace.  There are enough youth problems without us contributing to them.  It is bad enough to debar young people from a social welfare payment for which they reluctantly apply as it is their only option, but this is an insult to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the students' summer jobs scheme, which is being introduced for the first time this year, is to cater for full-time students who cannot get summer jobs.  The new scheme will <Col N="586" /> operate for the weeks during the period 1 July to 30 September 1993.  Students who would formerly have been eligible for unemployment assistance of at least £15 per week are eligible for the scheme and may earn up to £400 over the ten week period of the scheme.  Voluntary organisations, community groups and public sector bodies with suitable work will be able to participate as sponsors. Participating students will be given full details of the work available from sponsors. Payment for work done under this scheme will be made to participating students by the sponsors who will, in turn, be reimbursed by my Department.</P>
      <P>The scheme has been advertised in the public press and fact sheets and application forms for both students and sponsors have been prepared which clearly set out the conditions under which the scheme operates.  Up to the initial registration date for applications of Friday last, 4 June 1993, almost 2,000 students had applied to participate in the scheme and over 4,000 jobs were available from 1,000 sponsors who are offering a wide range of activities for students.  Initial indications are that the small number so far identified as not eligible for the scheme are not in fact third level students but have finished their final year of studies. As the Deputy will be aware, people in that situation are entitled to unemployment assistance but yet they are applying for this scheme because they regard it as suitable.  The Deputy mentioned the means test and the interview. This is really an ultra simple arrangement. The average payment to students on unemployment assistance would have been in the order of £35-£37 per week. The Deputy seems to have missed the fact the maintenance grant was taken into consideration and that, therefore, the payment was less.  By providing £40 per week, we are, in the vast majority of cases, providing more than previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The desk top interviews are the simplest type of assessment.  There will not be investigations and inspectors will not <Col N="587" /> call on the homes.  I could not have made the system any simpler and yet maintain order in the expenditure of public funds. I announced last Monday that students may continue to register for the scheme up to Friday, 25 June 1993 to facilitate those still committed to examinations. Jobs available under the scheme will be on a first-come, first-served basis and students applying late may have difficulty in getting a summer job in their locality or may not get the full benefit of ten weeks in the scheme.  We, therefore, advised students to apply early.</P>
    <P>I have no further update on the takeup of the scheme.  From yesterday over 2,600 students and 1,300 sponsors applied under the scheme.  The number of job opportunities available from sponsors now exceeds 6,000.  The number of sponsors, job offers and students applying is accelerating rapidly.  Even since yesterday there has been an increase in this number, that is certainly a very encouraging sign.</P>
    <P>I am delighted with the response to date and I thank all those who have taken such a positive interest in the scheme. This is an innovative scheme which gives sponsors an opportunity to improve their services while at the same time giving participating students the opportunity to contribute to local voluntary activity and get work experience which will be of value to themselves and their local communities.</P>
    <P>I am optimistic about this constructive scheme which will throw up a great many worth while ideas and experiences for students.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Williamstown (Galway) Sewerage Scheme.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to raise this important matter and the Minister for being present.  I want to put on record the absolute frustration and anger of the people of Williamstown at the delay in <Col N="588" /> getting the sewerage scheme started. They have been campaigning for almost ten years.  Over 70 families must contend with a bad domestic sewerage scheme, widespread pollution and nauseating smells.  There are definite health hazards in the village.  Furthermore, because of the lack of a proper sewage treatment scheme, fewer houses have been built in the village than would normally be expected.</P>
      <P>Galway County Council, the Western Health Board and the Department of the Environment acknowledge the necessity to get a proper treatment plant installed. All the necessary lands have been acquired by the county council and the present design plan now encompasses two areas originally omitted which ensures a better outfall point.  Deputations over the years met a host of Ministers for the Environment.  A very definite commitment was given on a few occasions.  However, when all seemed in order a red herring was introduced to the proceedings.  It was alleged that the scheme which was provisionally costed at around £300,000 in 1986 was now more expensive than originally envisaged and because of the new budget costings of £900,000 the Department was caught unawares.  I have no doubt the Department of the Environment officials never believed that in 1992-93 figures a sewerage scheme of the size required by Williamstown could be installed for a sum in the region of £300,000.  I fully endorse the approach taken by Galway County Council.  The additional extensions and the outfall facility mentioned above, when taken with a rise in general prices since 1986, would push the cost up to around £900,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister satisfied with the budget cost of the project as presented by Galway County Council?  I believe everything is in order on that score.  The people of Williamstown are in a militant mood. They want to see the commencement of their sewerage scheme in 1993, they have waited long enough and have seen other <Col N="589" /> areas leap frog over them.  The people in this village have shown commendable civic spirit over the past few years and a community spirit second to none has developed.  However, there is only so much a small village can do.  When Williamstown gets the sewerage scheme it so richly deserves, it will respond by kick-starting many worthwhile projects that will maintain existing jobs and may well create some badly needed jobs for people in that area.</P>
    <P>On behalf of this united village I am asking the Minister to identify and ear-mark the necessary funding to allow the work to commence.  Williamstown, without a sewerage scheme, carries a deadly handicap; Williamstown with a new sewage treatment plant will prosper and grow.  I thank the Minister for his attention and I look forward to a favourable reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Paul Connaughton for giving me the opportunity to address the House on the issue of the funding of the proposed sewerage scheme for Williamstown.</P>
      <P>Since 1989 over £15 million has been allocated to Galway County Council for major water and sewerage schemes.  So far this year alone, the allocation for the county has been £5.56 million the highest ever for the county, and a substantial increase on 1992.  This year's allocation includes significant funding for major sewerage schemes at Tuam and Oran-more in County Galway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of Williamstown, a preliminary report for a sewerage scheme to serve around 50 houses was approved in March 1987.  The estimated cost of the scheme at that time was £331,000. Galway County Council gave an updated cost estimate of £592,000 in April 1992. Contract documents for the scheme were submitted to the Department of the Environment in September 1992.  It is clear from the contract documents submitted that the county council has <Col N="590" /> expanded the scope of the scheme to serve around an additional 15 premises and that the route of the outfall sewer has been amended and extended.  These additions and amendments, which were not approved by the Department of the Environment, have had the effect of increasing the cost to the region of £1 million, a threefold increase on the approved estimate at contract document stage.</P>
    <P>Cost increases of this magnitude clearly have implications for the overall funding programme of schemes generally and militate against any scope which might be available to approve new schemes.  The contract documents and the cost increases and amendments are currently under examination.  Given the circumstances, the Deputy will appreciate that the matter must be throughly investigated and examined before a decision can be reached.</P>
    <P>I am aware of problems being encountered locally by the absence of a sewerage scheme and of pressure for the scheme. However, the scale of investment implications for schemes throughout the country has been increasing steadily over the past few years.  In this context, it has not been possible so far to afford this scheme priority within the national sanitary services programme or to give any specific commitment of funding.</P>
    <P>I note Deputy Connaughton's concerns. I have had representations too, not only from the local group but from Deputy Michael Kitt and from the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Noel Treacy, on the matter raised here this evening and on previous occasions but having regard to the overall demand on the water and sanitary services programme, I cannot say when it will be possible to approve the scheme.</P>
    <P>I was one of those Ministers who met the group concerned and I indicated that if the cost were of the order as outlined to me I would do my best to make provision for the scheme.  Subsequently when checked, I found it would cost <Col N="591" /> treble what was indicated.  I should mention to this House that there is an ever increasing demand for resources for the provision of water and sewerage schemes that sometimes this work has a very low profile on the overall political agenda. However, because it is such a basic service we will make available any resource possible, whether private or public, including EC funds, to remedy problems in Williamstown and in many other parts of the country.  This will be done not <Col N="592" /> only for developmental reasons but for environmental considerations &mdash; to prevent pollution of inland rivers, coastal water and so on.  This is an area to which I am giving exceptional priority and I hope to be able to return to the question of funding as soon as possible.</P>

    <P>Most recently the UN Security Council in adopting resolution 832 on 27 May 1993, which renews the mandate of the UN Observer Mission in El Salvador called, once again, on all parties to implement fully all their commitments under the Peace Accords and to exercise moderation and restraint especially in the former zones of conflict.  Within the Community we are currently examining what steps can be taken to bring about the full implementation of the Truth Commission's recommendations and have offered our full support to the UN Secretary <Col N="495" /> General for his efforts in this regard.</P>
    <P>I see great merit in the proposal for the establishment of an international tribunal to try those accused of the type of crimes which have been witnessed in El Salvador. The experience of Yugoslavia has led me to the view that there is a need for a permanent tribunal which could deal with abuses of this kind wherever they occur.</P>

      <P>The existence of red mercury, as well as its alleged properties and potential uses in nuclear weapons development, have been a matter of some controversy for many years.  While recent media reports have suggested that international trade in such a substance is taking place, there is no conclusive evidence of the existence of red mercury as a unique substance with applications in nuclear weapons.  In many cases, it appears that known compounds of mercury have been offered for sale for fraudulent purposes or as part of a hoax.</P>
      <P>The International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna takes the view that, even if the substance does exist, it would not fall within the competence of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).</P>
      <P>I would be very concerned at any trade in dangerous substances which could have nuclear proliferation implications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the provisions of the NPT and the international co-operation in controlling trade in dangerous substances, through such groupings as the Nuclear Suppliers Group in which Ireland participates, represent the best protection <Col N="496" /> against the proliferation of potentially dangerous substances.</P>

      <P>The British Government are fully aware of the concern felt in this country arising from the recent trial of the three Surrey policemen charged in connection with the Guildford case.  While the conduct of the trial is a matter for the Courts, I very much understand the concern widely felt at the emphasis reportedly given to the actions of the Guildford Four, notwithstanding the earlier decision of the Court of Appeal in this matter.</P>
      <P>It must, of course, be emphasised that the verdict in this trial in no way alters or detracts from the October 1989 decision of the Court of Appeal which allowed the appeals and quashed the convictions of the Guildford Four.  I would hope that the May Inquiry, which was set up to look into the Guildford and Maguire miscarriages of justice, and the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice, which was established in 1991 in the aftermath of the Birmingham Six case to consider reforms in the criminal justice system, will, <i>inter alia</i>, consider how best to ensure that the rights of those who have already suffered from miscarriages of justice can be adequately protected.</P>

      <P>The recently published report of the independent advisory group on financing of the United Nations, knows as the Volcker/Ogata report has been made available to my Department and its recommendations are being carefully studied.</P>
      <P>The report was prepared by the Ford Foundation in consultation with the United Nations.  The advisory group was co-chaired by Mr. Paul Volcker, former Chairman of the US Federal Reserve, and Shijuro Ogata, former Deputy Governor of the Bank of Japan. The genesis of the report is to be found in the Secretary-General's 1992 document entitled <i>An Agenda for Peace,</i> in which he indicated that he had requested a select group of qualified persons of high international repute to examine the entire question of UN financing and submit a report to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome publication of the Volcker/Ogata report, which contains a number of recommendations intended to provide more consistent and reliable <Col N="498" /> means of funding UN activities, both in the interest of the UN's effectiveness, and to facilitate the work of the Secretary-General. The central argument of the reports is that the UN must be assured of the timely availability of funds to meet the obligations placed on it by the member states.  The report addresses in particular the methods of financing the UN Regular Budget, Peacekeeping Operations and the UN's humanitarian and development activities.</P>
    <P>The report's recommendations are likely to be formally considered at the 48th session of the General Assembly this autumn.  The Secretary-General is at present preparing his response to the report and is expected to submit proposals to the Assembly on its implementation.</P>
    <P>In the post-Cold War era, the United Nations is developing rapidly and is being asked to assume many new and important responsibilities.  It is essential that the UN be provided with the necessary financial resources to discharge the responsibilities assigned to it by the membership.  Ireland has consistently supported efforts to place UN financing on a firm and secure footing and will accordingly play an active role in the consideration of the Volcker/Ogata report when it comes before the General Assembly.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 64 together.</P>
      <P>I have discussed on several occasions with the Portuguese Foreign Minister the situation in East Timor, including the trial and sentencing of Mr. Xanana Gusmao.  Our most recent discussion took place at the General Affairs Council this week.  We discussed, <i>inter alia,</i> the representation to be made by the Community and its member states to the Indonesian authorities regarding the life sentence passed on Mr. Xanana Gusmao by the Indonesian courts particularly as the date for an appeal &mdash; 4 June &mdash; has now passed.</P>
      <P>Ireland and our partners in the European Community remain very concerned at continuing reports of human rights abuses in East Timor.  Earlier this year Ireland played an active role in this matter at this years session of the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva where a resolution on the situation in East Timor was adopted.</P>
      <P>I will also convey this concern to the newly appointed Indonesian Ambassador to Ireland whom I will be seeing later this afternoon.  I have written to the Indonesian Foreign Minister, Mr. Ali Alatas, expressing the Government's concern at the sentence passed on Mr. Gusmao and asking for a review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We believe that dialogue is the best <Col N="501" /> way to resolve the question of the status of East Timor.  We therefore welcome and encourage the ongoing negotiations between Portugal and Indonesia at Foreign Minister level under the auspices of UN Secretary General and we hope that these negotiations will lead to a comprehensive and intenationally acceptable settlement of the question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The thrust of my Department's approach has been to take advance action to try to ensure that students travelling abroad for summer work are as well prepared as possible so as to avoid the type of situation which makes consular intervention necessary. Earlier this year, the Department took the initiative in organising a Seminar on Travel and Work Abroad which was attended by a wide range of organisations representing students, teachers, parents and other groups working with young people.  A special advice leaflet for tourists and young holiday jobseekers has also been prepared, which I personally sent to the principal of every secondary school in the country, asking that it be brought to the attention of young people who might be travelling abroad this summer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are hopeful that these steps will help minimise the difficulties that can arise for young people seeking summer work abroad.  However, if problems occur, our embassies and consulates are on hand to give the necessary assistance. In general, I would expect that our missions will be in a position to meet any additional demands within existing <Col N="502" /> resources; however, I will be keeping the situation under review throughout the summer months.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 65 together.</P>
      <P>The Government has continued to draw attention internationally to the humanitarian crisis in Southern Sudan. Since Minister of State, Deputy Kitt's visit to Sudan in late April, we have been urging increased international humanitarian and political action to assist the people of the region.  The issue has been raised with President Clinton and the US Administration, with the Secretary-General of the United Nations and at European community level.</P>
      <P>A recent and welcome development is the appointment by the UN Secretary-General of a Special Envoy for Humanitarian Affairs for Sudan.  Together with our partners in the Community, we will give our full support to his work.  In addition, the Troika of EC Development Ministers will visit Sudan shortly in order to emphasise directly, to all parties involved, the Community's increasing concern at the humanitarian tragedy in the South.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to two million people remain at risk of starvation in Southern Sudan. Ultimately, a solution to this tragedy depends on the establishment of a lasting peace between the Government of Sudan and the SPLA and an end to the fighting between the factions of the SPLA in the South.  We have provided a total of £1 <Col N="503" /> million from the Emergency Humanitarian Assistance Fund so far this year to Irish NGOs working in Southern Sudan and to the UN's Operation Lifeline Sudan.  We will continue to press for additional resources to be made available by donors for the international humanitarian effort and for effective action by the Government of Sudan and the SPLA to ensure the security of aid workers and their safe access to all areas of need.</P>

    <P>I would be happy to provide the Deputy with information on the business conducted on these occasions if he feels it would be of interest.</P>
    <P>As to future commitments this year, I expect to travel to Belgium for two meetings of the General Affairs Council in July and one each in November and December; for an informal ministerial meeting in September and for the European Council in December.

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Security Council of the United Nations decided, by Resolution 827 adopted unanimously on 25 May 1993, to establish an international tribunal for the sole purpose of prosecuting persons responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia between 1 January 1991 and a date to be determined by the Security Council upon the restoration of peace, and to this end, to adopt the Statute of the International Tribunal recommended to the Council by the Secretary-General.</P>
      <P>The decision to establish the Tribunal was taken under Chapter VII of the UN Charter which provides for Security Council action with respect to threats to the peace, breaches of the peace and acts of aggression.</P>
      <P>All States are obliged to co-operate fully with the Tribunal and its organs, in accordance with resolution 827 and the Statute of the Tribunal, and consequently are to take all measures necessary under their domestic law to implement the provisions of the resolution and the Statute. Application of the terms of the resolution and Statute in Irish domestic law is under consideration by the Department of Justice.</P>
      <P>The Secretary-General is requested to implement the resolution urgently, make practical arrangements for the effective functioning of the Tribunal at the earliest time and to report periodically to the Council, which will remain actively seized of the matter.</P>
      <P>The Statute sets out the legal basis for the establishment of the Tribunal, its legal competence and the manner in which it is to be organised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="506" /> Ireland was among the countries which submitted proposals to the Secretary-General at the preparatory stage of drafting the Statute.  These proposals dealt with legal aspects of the establishment of the Tribunal.</P>
    <P>Together with our European Community partners, Ireland has consistently supported the early establishment of the Tribunal.  The effective functioning of the Tribunal will call for a firm political commitment by the international community. The nature and scale of the atrocities perpetrated in the former Yugoslavia demand urgent action and it is imperative that every effort be made to bring those responsible to justice.  The establishment of the Tribunal significantly strengthens the prospects of ensuring that justice will be done to the victims of these terrible crimes.</P>
    <P>Outside the context of former Yugoslavia, there is no forum at present in existence with international criminal jurisdiction.  The International Court of Justice in the Hague does not have competence in criminal matters.  The jurisdiction of the European Commission of Human Rights and the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg is confined to findings of breaches by States parties to the European Convention on Human Rights. Its competence does not extend to the trial of individuals.</P>
    <P>The Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe recently created a mechanism which allows the Council of Europe, at the request of a European non-member state, to appoint qualified persons to sit on a control body or court responsible for the adjudication of human rights observance within that state.  The contact body may draw on the competence of the European Court and Commission of Human Rights.</P>
    <P>The mechanism was originally devised as a response to a request by Lord Owen to create a system of judicial control of human rights in Bosnia-Hercegovina, within the framework of the Vance-Owen Plan for that country.  The mechanism is intended for application in any European state not a member of the Council of Europe.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43 and 54 together.</P>
      <P>The Atlantic coast region of Nicaragua which is divided into two autonomous regions is the home of the Miskito and Suomo Indians.  It has always been a poor and underdeveloped region.  I am informed that the Nicaraguan Government has been providing assistance to the region through agriculture and rural development schemes.  I am not aware of any attempt on their part to undermine the autonomy process.</P>
      <P>The Community's aid to the developing countries of Asia and Latin America includes stipulations regarding the respect for human rights.  This aspect was reaffirmed in the Cooperation Agreement between the Community and Central American countries, including Nicaragua, which was signed at San Salvador in February of this year.</P>
      <P>While it is not normal for specific amounts of EC financial assistance to be allocated to individual regions, I am willing to pass on the Deputies' suggestion on the matter to the European Commission.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44 and 48 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland is not the only member of the European Community whose citizens require a visa for the United States; citizens of Greece and Portugal face a similar requirement.</P>
      <P>My Department has been in contact with the US authorities over a number of years about the possibility of waiving the visa requirement for Irish visitors to the United States.  The US Immigration Reform and Control Act, 1986 provided for the establishment of a visa waiver pilot programme for visitors from a number of countries.  However qualification under the programme depends on a low overstay rate on the part of visa holders; we are informed that, as of now, the Irish overstay rate is such as not to permit our inclusion in the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Decisions concerning the granting of entry visas to the United States are a matter for the US authorities.  We are informed that the application procedures for Irish nationals are the same as those for other nationals also subject to a visa entry requirement.  As regards criteria, the US Embassy has stated that no set criteria are used in considering visitor visa applications.  Each case is dealt with individually on its merits.  However, a necessary condition in all cases is that <Col N="509" /> the individual consular officer must be satisfied before issuing a visa that an applicant is not a potential illegal immigrant.</P>
    <P>The policy and procedure governing visa applications will continue to be discussed in the course of our regular contacts with the US authorities.</P>

      <P>The positions referred to in the Deputy's question do not represent my views, and in this regard I would refer the Deputy to the Programme for a Partnership Government which sets out in some detail the approach of the Government to the Northern Ireland problem.  Since coming to office in January last, I have worked to implement that approach.</P>
      <P>The Government has consistently expressed the view that the problem of Northern Ireland is a conflict between two sets of rights.  The reality is that there are two political allegiances on this island.  A peaceful and lasting solution to the problem of Northern Ireland requires arrangements to be made which acknowledge, respect and accommodate adequately the rights and aspirations of each tradition.</P>
      <P>It is the policy of the Government to seek an urgent resumption of political dialogue to address comprehensively all three strands of the relationships involved.  I believe that this is the way forward and look to all those who are committed to achieving peace and justice on this island to give it their support.</P>

Almost all of the equipment and supplies currently in use in the Tánaiste's Office and in the headquarters of the Department of Foreign Affairs has been purchased from Irish firms.</P>
      <P>There are some practical problems which limit the scope for purchase of office machinery from Irish firms for use in our overseas missions: high freight costs together with incompatibility with local equipment and systems and the need for local maintenance.

      <P>The Royal Canal extends from Spencer Dock in Dublin to Clondra, County Longford, a distance of some 90 miles and includes 47 locks, ten of which are double locks. The canal is currently being restored by the Commissioners of Public Works under their Royal Canal restoration programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The restoration of the Royal Canal which was closed to navigation by CIE in the early sixties is a considerable undertaking, involving the complete dredging <Col N="514" /> of the canal to navigational depth, the restoration of access along the towpath, the rewatering of levels, the restoration of lock chambers, the manufacture and installation of lock gates and the stocking of fish into sections of the canal.  Under the Royal Canal restoration programme the 46 mile stretch of canal between Blanchardstown and Mullingar has been restored and in 1993 works have continued on the restoration of the stretch between Blanchardstown and the River Liffey.  At present, with the exception of two small areas in Dublin city at Binn's Bridge and Spencer Dock, restoration works on the stretch between Blanchardstown and the River Liffey have been completed.  With the completion of the works at Binn's Bridge and Spencer Dock later this year and the installation of a lifting bridge at Newcomen Bridge to replace the existing railway culvert, on which agreement has been reached with Iarnród Éireann, the Royal Canal between the River Liffey and Mullingar will once again be re-opened to navigation.</P>
    <P>Works are also underway in 1993 on the Royal Canal west of Mullingar.  Again considerable progress has been made in this area.  Dredging and towpath clearance works have reached Ballymahon, approximately 15 miles from the junction of the canal with the Shannon at Clondra. Considerable additional works along this stretch will be required such as the manufacture and installation of lock gates and the removal of fixed obstructions, low road bridges and canal crossings, before this stretch of canal can be reopened to navigation.  Furthermore, an investigation of satisfactory water sources, currently in hand, must be completed. However the restoration works undertaken to date have already revitalised a valuable local amenity which is and will continue to be enjoyed by the public at large.</P>
    <P>The Royal Canal will be fully navigable from the River Liffey in Dublin, to Mullingar by the end of this year or early next year.  The reopening of the canal to navigation between Mullingar and Shannon is dependent on the resources available <Col N="515" /> to the Commissioners of Public Works in the years ahead for their Royal Canal restoration programme and on agreement on the removal of the permanent restrictions to navigation with the relevant local authorities.  Because of these variable factors, it is not possible at this stage to provide a date for the reopening of navigation along this length of the canal.</P>

      <P>The Department of Social Welfare, as is the case for all State agencies, is bound by general Civil Service procurement procedures relating to competitive tendering.  These are set out in guidelines issued by the Department of Finance and the Government Contracts Committee, and comply with EC Directives. These guidelines require that all purchases are completed by way of competitive tender.</P>
      <P>In this context the Department invites tenders from a range of suppliers in relation to all goods and services required.  In the case of goods below the EC threshold of ECU130,000, IR£104,192, the Department invites tenders from Irish suppliers.  Where goods or services exceed the EC threshold, an advertisement is placed in the Official Journal of the EC as required under the European Directive on Public Procurement.  Subject to compliance with EC and other rules, where possible the Department generally places orders with Irish based suppliers.  This is particularly the case where the equipment is used for critical payment operations and therefore there is a requirement for comprehensive and speedy local support.</P>
      <P>In practice goods and services purchased by my Department are almost exclusively sourced from Irish suppliers. However, given the nature of modern manufacturing processes, goods sourced in Ireland may have components manufactured in other countries.</P>

      <P>Under the Programme for Government it was agreed that arrangements would proceed for the establishment of County Enterprise Boards which will be empowered to seek funding to assist local development, the start-up of small enterprises and the promotion of tourism projects.  My Department has, at my request, consulted <Col N="521" /> widely regarding the best approach to adopt in establishing the boards and determining the organisation and the conduct of their development work.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the review I have decided, with the approval of the Government, to proceed with the establishment of County Enterprise Boards in every local authority area.  These new boards will have unequivocal enterprise and job creation objectives and will assume responsibility for business areas not already covered by the State industrial development agencies.  The enterprise boards will prepare action plans for their own areas.  While those plans can be expected to encompass a variety of measures their essential focus will be on pro-active strategies to tap the employment opportunities in their localities through: identifying and commercially developing local resources; promoting the creation and development of enterprises from within the local economy, particularly through support for local enterprise groups; and creating and strengthening networks between the local community and State agencies in the interest of mobilising and co-ordinating their energies and knowledge.</P>
      <P>In the Budget Statement by the Minister for Finance it was announced that £25 million would be provided in funding support for the work of the County Enterprise Boards and for community-based employment programmes.  The boards will have a budget at their disposal to provide assistance for enterprise projects put forward by individuals and by local community bodies.  The allocation of funds as between boards and the criteria for the evaluation of project applications will be determined by a national enterprise council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new boards will complement the work of existing State agencies and will not displace or duplicate local enterprise initiatives.  Their role will be to facilitate local development and to act as a catalyst where no enterprise group is currently active at community level.  Wherever project applications call for forms of advice or assistance which are more appropriate to the remit of existing agencies e.g. <Col N="522" /> IDA, SFADCo, Údarás, the Regional Tourism Organisations, FÁS, CERT, Teagasc, etc. they will be directed to those bodies.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture and Food is the authority designated by the European Commission to administer the Leader programme in Ireland.  The County Enterprise Boards will operate in harmony with existing community enterprise initiatives such as Leader groups and will encourage them to develop innovative solutions to the problems of rural development.</P>

No final decision has yet been taken on whether or not it will proceed.  Following a public consultation process undertaken by the UK Inspector of Pollution (HMIP), some 80,000 submissions were received by HMIP and a report has recently been submitted to the Secretary of State for the Environment for his consideration. The Secretary of State will now decide if a hearing is to be granted on the THORP issue to interested parties or whether to issue discharge authorisations.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 118, 119 and 126 together.</P>
      <P>The post-primary accommodation needs of developing areas such as Maynooth are reviewed periodically within my Department.  The most recent application for extra school places in Maynooth Vocational School was submitted by County Kildare Vocational Education Committee to my Department in March 1992.  An initial offer of additional accommodation, to address the schools immediate needs, made in June 1992, was not accepted by the Committee.</P>
      <P>In January 1993, my Department received further details in support of the Committee's proposal for extra accommodation at the Maynooth School.  A new offer of extra accommodation was made to County Kildare Vocational Education Committee last April.  The present position is as stated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 207 of 25 May 1993.</P>
      <P>My Department is not aware that any children from within the Maynooth Post Primary catchment area have been refused a place in Maynooth Vocational School for the 1993-94 school year.  Children living in areas outside the Maynooth Post Primary catchment area may have been refused places in Maynooth Vocational School.  However, the school is under no obligation to admit such pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A guidelines of 6m² per pupil is currently used in drawing up the schedule of accommodation for a new primary school.  In the case of an existing school, the provision of additional classrooms would be assessed in relation to the extent and nature of the existing classrooms and the pupils projections for the area.  The schedule of accommodation <Col N="541" /> agreed with the County Kildare Vocational Education Committee for Maynooth was drawn up on that basis to meet the needs of the school.</P>

In this context a Library-Classroom was sanctioned for Ardscoil Lorgan last March.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, funding of the capital works at Castleblaney Vocational School referred to by the Deputy cannot be considered in the current financial year within the capital resources available to my Department.</P>

      <P>As a result of co-operation between the Departments of Health and Education a set of educational resource materials on HIV/AIDS for post-primary schools was developed and issued to schools in October, 1990.  Those materials included an information booklet for teachers and sets of model lesson plans dealing with themes such as infection and the immune system, information on HIV/AIDS, ways of prevention of transmission of HIV and issues such as responsible behaviour, care of persons infected by HIV and community responses to the problem and were aimed at pupils in the age-range 14 to 18 years.</P>
      <P>During the school-years 1990/91 and 1991/92, seminars for post-primary teachers were held throughout the country on the use of those materials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the autumn of 1992, a survey on the use of the materials was conducted with the assistance of the Education Research Centre, St. Patrick's College of Education, Drumcondra.  This survey indicated that approx. 89 per cent of post-primary schools were making provision for education about HIV/AIDS and that about 98 per cent of those schools were using the materials developed by the Departments of Education and Health. In general, schools were very positive in regard to the materials with over 80 <Col N="550" /> per cent of respondents rating them as &ldquo;excellent&rdquo; or &ldquo;good&rdquo; on attributes such as content, effectiveness and ease of use in the classroom.</P>
    <P>Education about HIV/AIDS is an ongoing issue and is being review by both Departments at present.  Among the issues under consideration is the question of information/education for pupils in age ranges not covered by the current materials and the issue of guidelines on infection control in schools generally.</P>

      <P>As I explained to the Deputy, last October, in relation to this question, individual vehicles are required to operate a number of services to schools and this often results in an early morning start or a longer wait in the evenings by pupils. In this case, the pupils who are collected first in the morning are returned home first in the evening.</P>
      <P>The transport liaison officer who administers the post-primary school transport scheme locally, on my behalf, is at present in consultation with Bus Éireann and the school authorities to see if any improvement can be made in the service for the coming school year.  I have asked for an urgent report on the outcome of these discussions and I would wish to consider this report before deciding whether a meeting with parents' representatives would be productive.</P>

      <Quest>the number of vacancies to be filled in relation to the School Attendance Staffing levels in the County Borough of Dublin; the number of additional posts that will be required to be filled by September 1993; the number of pupils presently on the roll as covered by the School Attendance Act, 1926, in the Corporation area; the approximate number of these who are absent from school each day either through mitching or because they will not or cannot go to school; the number of absentees that are being coped with, on average, by School Attendance Staff; her views on whether there is an urgent and desperate need to keep those children off the streets and out of danger of sliding into crime; the action, if any, she proposes to take in the area of school attendance staff and in any other areas to address this serious problem; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Under the School Attendance Act, 1926, the appointment of school attendance officers and provision for their remuneration are matters for the appropriate council of the county borough, which in this case is Dublin Corporation. I understand that at present there are ten vacancies in the five school attendance areas under the jurisdiction of the Corporation.</P>
      <P>If Dublin Corporation proposed the appointment of officers to fill current vacancies I would be happy to sanction such appointments.  It would, however, be a matter for the corporation to fund the posts.</P>
      <P>The information requested by the Deputy regarding pupil numbers would not be available in my Department.</P>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern about the non-attendance of children at school, and would like to point out that a review of the working of the School Attendance Act, including an examination of the roles and responsibilities of the various agencies involved, is under way at present.</P>

      <P>Office supplies and equipment including computer supplies are purchased by my Department from Irish firms.  As far as possible my Department purchases Irish manufactured goods.  In many cases Irish manufactured alternatives do not exist.  The purchase of all office supplies and equipment, including computer supplies, follows standard Government purchasing procedures as laid down by the Department of Finance and the EC.</P>

      <Quest>if she will ensure that a portion of the extra funding for disadvantaged schools through extra concessionary teachers, special units and other such areas will be focused on areas of high unemployment on the north side of Dublin, in particular, Darndale, Kilmore, Ayrfield, Donaghmede and Kilbarrack.</Quest>

      <P>Most of the schools serving the areas referred to by the Deputy are already included in the Scheme of Assistance for Schools in Designated Areas of Disadvantage, and as such, have been allocated additional ex-quota teaching posts and also receive supplementary capitation funding amounting to £17 per pupil.</P>
      <P>In addition to the above supports, many of those schools also have the services of a Home-School-Community liaison co-ordinator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Programme for a Partnership Government attaches particular importance <Col N="553" /> to the need to address educational disadvantage in its variety of forms and the Deputy will be aware of my intention to target extra resources in this area.</P>
    <P>As already announced in the House, I am allocating additional ex-quota teaching posts and funding to schools in disadvantaged areas with effect from September, 1993.  This will allow for the inclusion of additional schools within the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme.  Part of this allocation will also be used to provide additional concessionary posts to larger schools already in the scheme and schools in the scheme which have particular needs at this time.</P>
    <P>I have also announced that I propose allocating additional posts in September 1993 to facilitate expansion of the Home-School-Community Liaison Scheme.</P>
    <P>Decisions on the selection of schools to receive these extra posts and funding will be taken shortly and the needs of the schools in the areas mentioned by the Deputy will be fully considered in this context.</P>
