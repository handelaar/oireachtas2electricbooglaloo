      <P>In regard to the Government's proposed monster tax write-off &mdash; it is not an amnesty, it is a write-off; it appears that the Government prefers the Mafia vote to the PAYE vote &mdash; what legislation does the Government plan to bring before this House to seek democratic authority for this tax write-off or does it just propose to go ahead and give this tax write-off without the authority of the House?</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach suggested that this matter be raised at the select committee dealing with the Finance Bill.

      <NameTxt>Ms. F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The question that arises in relation to the commissioning of independent programmes is whether a mechanism needs to be built in at this stage for that purpose.  It would be helpful to consider such a mechanism within RTE, with outside representation.  I am concerned that the system is being left too open.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion the Minister told us he would see how it works, review the position and, if necessary, introduce some changes.  I accept the Minister is serious in that regard, but such an approach is not good enough.  He should adopt what has been suggested by my colleague, Deputy Fitzgerald, and introduce new mechanisms.  This area is fraught with danger and the more I think about it, the more dangerous it appears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister is aware, we are talking about a great deal of money which, properly handled, could have a major influence on the future of independent film makers and programme makers here.  It would have a greater influence than the resuscitated film board which I am glad to note has been put back in place after being so outrageously scrapped by the Minister's colleague a number of years ago.  We are all aware that we will not have a separate station in the immediate future, but we have an opportunity of <Col N="789" /> getting some alternative to RTE if there is satisfactory independent control over the finance.</P>
    <P>RTE will handle this very well, but what would happen if RTE found itself in a cash strapped rather than a cash rich position? From previous experience we know that in such circumstances RTE can be as tough as anyone.  Anybody who doubts that need only ask those who worked in Century Radio.  The Minister is aware that the cost of programmes can vary greatly.  Films which are made on location and for which artists must be paid can be exceedingly expensive while other programmes can be produced cheaply, for example, &ldquo;Talking Heads&rdquo;.  Under the Minister's amendment RTE could offload its expensive programmes so that, in turn, it would have cash for programmes over which it would have total control.  &ldquo;Glenroe&rdquo; is a very expensive programme because it is filmed on location and the various actors and actresses must be paid.  There will be successors or alternatives to &ldquo;Glenroe&rdquo; and under the Minister's amendment, RTE could contract out such programmes with the result that the independent people would have to pay all the artists and RTE could save money over which it would have total control.  I am not saying that would happen but it is a possibility under the Minister's amendment.</P>
    <P>Another example is the Eurovision Song Contest.  We are all aware of its success and we were told that the cost was between £2.25 million to £2.5 million. Next year, under this legislation, RTE could ask an independent group to produce the Eurovision Song Contest and provide the money under this arrangement, thus saving itself £2.25 million.  In turn, it could ask the independent group to employ its own people. I know it is not the Minister's intention that this should be the case, but all of those things could happen.  Therefore, some control is necessary.</P>
    <P>RTE has a monopoly and the size of our population and our economy dictates that we are unlikely to have an alternative to RTE in the near future.  The nearest <Col N="790" /> we will come to that is by building up a strong independent group of film makers and the Minister has the power to do that under this legislation.  Such film makers will not be effective if RTE has absolute control, as is the case at present.  This amendment states that moneys standing to the credit of the account shall be used by the Authority for the purpose of procuring the formulation by persons of proposals for the commissioning by the Authority of the making of programmes. RTE may request people outside to produce programmes for it.  That will not build up an effective group of independent film makers or programme makers.  Of course, there is much more than film making involved.  To a great extent, this will lead to RTE doing its own thing and someone else making the creative input.  The Minister should reconsider this matter and devise some mechanism by which there would be an input from somebody other than RTE regarding the expenditure of this money.</P>
    <P>Who will have the rights over those programmes?  Will it be possible for the independent film makers to sell them on to somebody else?  What will this mean for co-productions with other television stations?  Could that be handled under these arrangements?  I would not like to see RTE swamping the industry and having absolute control.  Under the Minister's amendment all the money could be spent, if not directly by RTE, in the furtherance of programmes originated by RTE.  That will not strengthen the position of independent programme producers so that we might have some sort of alternative to RTE, which I know the Minister would welcome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for the enthusiasm with which they are approaching the amendments.  In particular, I appreciate Deputy Nealon's interest, both as a broadcaster, programme maker and presenter of considerable experience.  I would remind the House that in amendments Nos. 7 and 9 I am responding to cases which have been made for greater flexibility.  I did this because my approach to broadcasting <Col N="791" /> respects two very important principles; first, that one can and should assist the independent film production sector and second, that one can do this without setting one's face against RTE.  I am impressed by arguments that take as their basic premise that RTE has a monopoly and, therefore, is incapable of levels of creativity in response to new conditions. My main aim in broadcasting is to release creativity without and within RTE.  I am endeavouring to give the necessary flexibility in this Bill.</P>
      <P>I would ask the House to consider carefully what I am doing in amendment No. 7 which is specifying the way in which money standing to the credit of the account shall be used by the Authority. Lest people think I am in the difficulty of someone who has begun a marathon and is required to produce the speed of 100 yards overnight, I am setting up a regime for independent film production commissioning. I am providing this House with an opportunity of discussing this every year.  I am requiring a report from RTE as to how it operates and I have gone further from the publication of the Bill by committing myself to a review of the whole procedure not later than two years.</P>
      <P>If I was in a different frame of mind from that of philosophical generosity which prevails this morning I would ask about that period between the abolition of the Film Board and now.  I have re-established the Film Board.  What about all those years when no formal mechanism was in place in RTE?  I am simply saying that I want to try it in this way.  I will go further by saying that I hope, having set up a mechanism for commissioning, that there will be a response within RTE of a formal kind, in appointing a senior officer in charge of a development section, grouping together what may already exist there formally to harness creativity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know what Deputy Nealon and Deputy Fitzgerald want and I am reviewing the entire nature of broadcasting. That review will obviously include the <Col N="792" /> role of the RTE Authority, the role of other authorities that I may choose to establish and perhaps the entire structure of broadcasting.  I will examine this whole area root and branch to determine what is the best structure, but I want to allow the Authority to respond to my proposals within the capacities that they have in the existing legislation.  For example, if what Deputy Nealon described did occur and that there was off loading, this will be highlighted, for the first time ever, in a report placed before this House every year.  If such a report is placed before the House and Deputies opposite draw attention to it, I have committed myself to a review which will enable their comments to be taken into account.  I accept that Deputies on all sides of the House want the best legislation possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Nealon invited me to address the best interests of the film and audio visual industry.  I can assure him that I will approach it in as integrated a way as possible.  I would remind Deputies that in my later amendments Nos. 12 and 15 I specify mechanisms which should be given an opportunity to work.  Regarding the other point raised by Deputy Nealon, he will appreciate that the usual mechanism is in fact for the broadcaster to purchase screening rights leaving the substantial rights the property of the maker or vendor.  This is obviously a matter for management within the commissioning structure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the goodwill and the interest of the Minister.  Whatever he may think, he will not always be in office. We should make provisions now for the time when some other person will be in his position who will not have the same goodwill and interest in fostering creativity in the film industry and in television programme making.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister consider making some of this money available to the new Film Board with a view, perhaps, to their setting the seeds of television programmes as such?  It would offer a new degree of independence in the use of portion of this money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="793" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>When I refer to an integrated approach to what I am doing in the film and audio-visual area I would remind the Deputy that the Arts Council provide some money for the development of scriptwriting and film making through their small development fund.  I have their assurance that they will continue with that.  There is also, as the Deputy is aware, a small script development fund which is sourced in Europe. We now have the Film Board and if one considers the changes I have made in relation to the development fund, the 10 per cent I am allocating now is to enable projects that are conceptual in character or those that require to be completed to be turned into products to which the customer and the broadcaster can relate. That is what I had in mind in this regard.</P>
      <P>When I am reviewing the outcome of this the Film Board will be in operation with the benefit of its first year's funding. I have indicated the amount of funding which will be allocated to it over a number of years.  These will interact with each other.  It is fascinating that having provided this atmosphere I am sometimes told that RTE will welcome all of the benefits I am creating but at other times I am told that RTE will be starved by my proposals.</P>
      <P>My approach to all of this goes beyond notions of simply developing an obvious creative source in this country, but also involves job creation.  There are jobs in RTE, outside RTE and in the televisual area.  It is logical that the Film Board will be required to set up its operation and decide its priorities.  I will not interfere with it in that way but it is obvious that it will be of assistance to what I am proposing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms F. Fitzgerald Ms F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>To take up the last point in terms of job creation, I agree with the Minister that it is an important element of the suggestions being made here.  A figure of 882 jobs was referred to as being possibly created in the sector. That is considering television production alone without looking at possible job creation within independent film making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To return to the point concerning commissioning, <Col N="794" /> I know the Minister has experience of both types of commissioning. When he was involved in a programme for Channel 4 his producer would have dealt directly with a commissioning editor.  The Minister has had experience also of the other system.  He probably will not tell us his thoughts on the two systems at this point but I wonder which he considers to be the most satisfactory.</P>
    <P>I am surprised at the Minister's reluctance to include a type of structure at this stage in the commissioning.  We are talking about a figure of up to £12 million and in terms of setting in train initially a structure that would be most helpful to the development of the Minister's goals, more thought and detail in the commissioning structure would set the process off on a more targeted start.  This would be useful and would create a structure within which it could develop at a faster rate.  I take the Minister's point that nobody would cast doubt on the creativity in RTE.  That is not what is intended by my comments.  I have no doubt about the creativity within RTE and the opportunities to develop it further which I hope this section of the Bill will allow.  The Minister indicated that he saw a need to carry out a review of broadcasting at a later stage.  In fact this ties in with the intent of amendment No. 29 in my name which has been ruled out of order, to establish a single broadcasting authority to oversee the independent and RTE stations.  I welcome the Minister's commitment to again look at a possible evolution of a single broadcasting authority.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Minister builds into the Bill provision for an annual report and review; however it is regrettable that a more detailed commissioning structure is not also provided, which leaves several questions unanswered. The question of editorial control is another grey area as it leaves open to question who is an independent producer and who RTE will have to accept within that term.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the <Col N="795" /> Deputies opposite are being very positive. We are all seeking to put the best structures in place.  I will not be provoked into indulging myself by recounting experiences of different places where work in which I was involved was shown but I can draw from it.  RTE, in aspects of its commissioning, can be compared to Channel 4 but it also has to be compared to the BBC.  We have one major broadcasting station on whose excellence a great deal depends.  I am simply being careful in allowing that station and the staff who work in it to respond, using the existing legislation in a vigorous way.  I am not convinced by the argument &mdash; I am not attributing them to anybody as they were made outside this House &mdash; that RTE must be written off or forced to face competitors to change broadcasting here.  I do not think that is being said in this House.  Channel 4 had a very special relationship in regard to commissioning which is quite different from the totality of responsibilities of RTE.  I am not introducing this Bill solely from the viewpoint of the independent film production sector.  I am very interested in making sure that RTE is a place of creativity, that it is strong, will develop to meet its many needs and will have the resources to do this.  I intend that it will be accountable for its use of resources.  By that I mean accountability for everything it is asked to do under the provisions of the Broadcasting Act.  Channel 4's availability in conjunction with RTE has been to the benefit of many independent film makers and for that we should be very grateful.  Under the leadership of Sir Jeremy Isaacs, many young Irish film makers managed, through a combination of commissioning, to make significant advances.  When the commissioning structure changed in Channel 4 &mdash; when there was no longer a specific commissioning editor for Irish material it was to the disadvantage of young Irish film makers in particular.  After the regime is improved here I hope we can also restore the former relationship with Channel 4. To this end I have had initial talks with Sir Peter Brooke, the Minister for Heritage. <Col N="796" /> I am hoping also that we will build on co-production to create the best possible set of opportunities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>RTE is finally judged by what is seen on the screen.  Members on all sides are anxious to ensure that programmes are of the highest possible standard and this is what we are seeking to do in this Bill.  However, there should be a challenge to the monopoly of RTE and some body should be able to challenge the type and quality of its production. We are seeking to encourage the independent sector and the Minister is making money available to this end, which is welcome.  I object to RTE getting its claws into that money and I hope that as much as possible is given to independent film producers.  I believe that when independent film makers and producers originate an idea they should feel it has an excellent chance of succeeding and that it will be judged on its merit when it is offered to RTE.</P>
      <P>This section gives RTE extraordinary authority to originate everything, to ask people to develop an idea for which it would then commission if the work is suitable.  In that regime independent film and programme makers will feel they are not getting an equal chance and that no matter how good their ideas, those of RTE will dominate.  Let us remember that RTE, excellent institution as it is, like all institutions has certain sameness in its thinking.  That would be challenged seriously if there was an independent broadcasting organisation.  That is the value of competition.  I know the Minister, as a dedicated socialist, will agree that competition of that nature is of great value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are seeking to ensure that independent producers and programme makers get an equal opportunity.  RTE, like any organisation, by its very nature likes to retain as much control as it can. Naturally the final responsibility for what appears on the screen rests with RTE. No one is challenging that but in legislation the Minister must make an effort to stimulate and encourage independent film makers to originate ideas in the <Col N="797" /> knowledge that they will be accepted on merit rather than being in competition with an idea that RTE originated and then commissioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I can add very little to what I said.  I will explain my thinking once again as succinctly as possible. When we talk about choice on television &mdash; great confusion sometimes creeps in &mdash; we are talking about plurality of programme making and the capacity to produce different programmes.  This obviously arises in RTE and there must be a capacity in a major brodcasting organisation such as RTE for that creativity to emerge.  I have addressed this issue already in relation to RTE but it must also be addressed in the independent sector.  Unfortunately previous attempts to create plurality in broadcasting have gone down the wrong track and the plurality of editorial character has been confused with the plurality of ownership.  There is also the crazy view that if people own something else we will have induced competition, whereas what we want is variation and creativity.  That is separate from the issue of ownership. Where broadcasters have gone into this field they have been among the more successful simply because it shows in the way they structure programmes, this applies to radio as well.  To put it in its most simple terms, the issue is that at present RTE spends over £3 million on independent production.  Let us remember that figure is now being increased, by 1994 it will rise to £5 million.  That is an increase of £2 million but the £3 million is more accountable than previously because there is a reporting mechanism to this House.  I have also committed myself to a review.  Anybody who has dealt with RTE knows there is no shortage of young producers and young film makers offering them products.  There is nothing to stop such people, if they feel the mechanism is not working, from drawing attention to such, reviewing it annually and, in the total review within two years, such matters would surface.  I like to think that there will be an open and progressive attitude towards this new <Col N="798" /> regime.  I would emphasise again, because an area of great negativity in debates about Irish broadcasting is that people seem to want to begin by saying that whatever progress, innovation and creativity we have in new structures of broadcasting, it must be at the expense of RTE.  I accept there will be changes; changes which will be of benefit within RTE but I see it as very important that I trust it in the atmosphere of these new changes.  That is why I respect its editorial control but, by means of this legislation, I will require it to report and I will review the exercise of its responsibilities.  I feel that is only fair.</P>

      <P>What I am saying here is that the Minister needs to have some flexibility.  In amendment No. 10 I suggest that the figures mentioned would apply unless, in prevailing circumstances, the Minister authorises a lesser sum.  Amendment No. 11 is related to this.  For example could there be a situation where the Authority would have some money in the independent account but RTE would borrow for some of their other work?  RTE is often painted as a cash rich empire and in a sense one has to ask where the evidence for that is. We are aware that the licence fee yields the substantial sum of £55 million and we have to think about balancing broadcasting. Nevertheless the Minister is aware that his Department has sanctioned £7.5 million for capital equipment and renewal and there is a <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> commitment of £1.5 million. Various other factors need to be taken into account such as price increases for performing rights and international newsagency costs and these bodies will be seeking increases from the news division, increases that may range from between 35 per cent and 37 per cent.  In a sense I am saying it would be wise to have some flexibility built into the sums envisaged by the Minister.</P>

      <P>These amendments which seek flexibility are correct.

My amendment No. 15 will meet the concerns expressed in amendments Nos. 10, 11, 17 and 19 and particularly in amendment No. 20.  My amendment No. 15, resembles the spirit of these amendments and produces the most democratic way possible of ensuring that the concerns are met.  I want to say also that the effect of my amendment, No. 15, is that it will give us the opportunity to adjust these structures should our review suggest it.  Should my amendment be successful the capacity is in the Bill to adjust the procedures in the light of experience.  I hope Deputies will agree I have taken their concerns on board and that amendment No. 15 addresses the issues raised in the other amendments.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(4)  The amount of moneys required to be paid by subsection (3) of this section into the account in a financial year shall be so paid in such number of instalments as the Authority deems appropriate having regard to its duty under subsection (2) (b) of this section:</P>

    <P>Amendment No. 12 allows RTE greater flexibility to manage the payments into the independent television programmes account by requiring that the payments are made as appropriate, provided that the full amount is paid into the account by the end of September each year.  The amendment is designed to avoid a situation where money could be lying needlessly unused in the account.  It enables RTE to better work within its normal cashflows.  Money will have to be available for projects as they arise and the internal annual allocation must be paid into the account by the end of September each year.  It will address an issue of flexibility within the cashflow situation of RTE.</P>

      <P>I accept that, a Cheann Comhairle.  In deference to what the Minister has now said, I see this amendment as a substantial improvement on the corresponding section in the original draft.  In the light of that I will not move amendment No. 13 because the Minister, in his amendment, has made adequate provision for what I had in mind.  My main concern was that RTE would have a cashflow.  It seemed unrealistic to expect any company to be in a position to put up such substantial amounts in the first half of their financial year.  Very few companies have cash lying around in that manner and if they have it is another matter.  The reality is that in this House we have imposed many requirements on RTE already.  The purpose of this Bill is neither to bury Caesar nor to praise him but rather something in between.  We must acknowledge the contribution RTE <Col N="802" /> make to the Exchequer.  For example, since 1990 RTE has repaid £16 million in Exchequer advances.  Provision was made in 1993 for £13.4 million out of cap revenue.  There is also a cap provision of £4.5 million towards Teilifís na Gaeltachta. Because we impose many requirements on RTE it is important that we would be sensitive to the cashflow problems and cashflow management within RTE.  That is why I submitted the amendment I am now withdrawing.  The Minister has tabled an amendment that is equally good and will achieve the results I intended.  I thank him for that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Quill.  I welcome the Minister's amendment which takes account of the sort of practices Deputy Quill has mentioned.  I do not know if it is appropriate to mention it at this stage, but in the context of the Authority's functions under the Broadcasting Authority Act which we discussed under amendment No. 15 I appeal to the Minister to look at the other two areas I mention in my amendments, that is, the area of short wave providing a service that is much sought after and would be very welcomed by many Irish overseas.  It would be extremely helpful if the Minister would give the Authority the power to investigate that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other area I would like the Minister to look at in the context of his review of broadcasting is the status of professional music within the Authority and the question of the orchestra, the choirs and string quartet.  When the cap on advertising was introduced RTE made certain comments about the viability of these institutions in the long term, but now the cap is being removed.  I know there are a great many other demands on the finances of RTE, but I would ask the Minister to look very carefully at that area and examine how these groups can best be supported, maintained and developed.  They are national assets in the same way as RTE is.  There is a need for us to look at public service broadcasting and define how it can be best supported and developed while recognising what it has given the country <Col N="803" /> already.  We must also define how the great contribution RTE has made can be best sustained and developed in a changing and challenging climate for broadcasting in the face of international competition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I also make a plea in respect of the matters mentioned by Deputy Fitzgerald.  I refer specifically to the Vanbrugh String Quartet and to the RTE Chamber Choir.  Both of these institutions suffered severely when the cap was imposed.  An opportunity has now arisen for these two institutions to be properly funded by RTE.  We are a very small country.  Our future lies in the promotion of excellence in every field of art and industry and certainly in music. There may be a small audience for the Vanbrugh String Quartet and for the Chamber Choir.  Nevertheless it is a legitimate audience which has the right to have its tastes and requirements met within the ambit of public service broadcasting and other broadcasting.  It is important that we maintain these high levels of excellence in music and in other areas of life for a young generation of Irish people growing up in a European setting.</P>
      <P>Although I am not sure that these two matters come strictly within the ambit of what we are discussing I know the Minister will keep them in mind.  What was done to the Vanbrugh String Quartet when the cap was imposed has been modified in the meantime, but the Chamber Choir is still out in the cold.  I know it is not possible for the Minister to meet all demands, but we would all benefit from any measure that would enable that choir to continue.  It would be of particular benefit to young people who are getting a musical education now that was not available in my day at school.  That is a great and positive thing.  We should consider the service we are maintaining in the interest of all the population and the next generation of retaining these institutions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me first thank Deputies Quill and Fitzgerald for their willingness to accept that the amendment I have proposed addresses the spirit of their own amendments.  The Vanbrugh Quartet, the Chamber Choir and professional music generally were early casualties when the cap was introduced.  What is sometimes lost sight of is that in this legislation the cap is being removed.  It is only reasonable to expect that the casualties of the imposition of the cap will be restored.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Deputies that here we have an illustration of the point I was making philosophically on Second Stage as to the content of public service broadcasting and its role.  In the context of communications policy I regard the citizenry not as a set of market segments for exploitation as purchasers &mdash; that is a view that is held in marketing and it is legitimate within that profession.  As the Minister with responsibility for broadcasting, my view is that citizens have rights within a communicative order. There are people with tastes that are served by the string quartet, the Chamber Choir, the orchestra and so on.  It would be saying something about the nature of a national broadcaster if one had to list these and put them into legislation.  It must have been an extreme situation if RTE decided that these were to be its earliest casualties when they felt that the cap was threathening them very severely. There are those who argued as to whether they should have been the casualties. However, there is no argument about the fact that these are activities which the public will expect to see reconstituted in an atmosphere where the cap does not prevail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a time for me to express my trust and confidence in the Authority in the context of responding to the new situation.  It would have been a confession of failure to some extent to find it <Col N="805" /> necessary to mention them in a legislative expression.  I am willing to wait and see.</P>

      <P>There are two things that I am anxious to do.  I am anxious that the Authority should function with its full autonomy within the Broadcasting Act without interference from me.  That is very important to me.  There are opportunities within the Act, and there are obligations.  I have said that I intend to review the entire broadcasting framework. I have looked at the question of independent commissioning and how it works out and I specify later the criteria across which we will look.  That will be an opportunity for addressing this issue and it would be a pity to miss it.</P>

However, in the absence of the sort of debate that we need in relation to public service broadcasting and all aspects of broadcasting, the wish to build in a protection for the groups we have mentioned is understandable. I take the Minister's point. Deputy De Rossa's suggestion that it should be very much part of the review would be of help in evaluating how they have fared during the first year.</P>

      <P>In page 4, between lines 17 and 18, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(8)  The Minister shall make regulations to provide that a specified proportion of the appropriate amount shall be spent on the making of independent television programmes within the State.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My concern is that nowhere in the current Bill is there a provision that any specific amount of money or any work done must be within this State.  I admit that my wording is not precisely what I intended, it might more precisely read:</P>
      <P>The Minister shall make regulations to provide that a specified proportion of the amount shall be spent within the State on the making of independent television programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My intention is not that the programmes should be totally made within the State. In many cases that would not be feasible. If Radharc goes to Somalia to make a programme, it cannot obviously make <Col N="808" /> the programme in Ireland.  However, a proportion of the expenditure which might be assisted through this fund should be spent in the State on hiring and buying equipment, renting facilities, or on post production work and so on.  In the amendment I am leaving it to the Minister to make regulations in regard to it.  Clearly it is a difficult area to specify. It could not be specified in the necessary detail in an amendment but it is something that we should have regard to.  If we want to develop a thriving independent film making sector here we must ensure that the money we are providing &mdash; or at least some proportion of it &mdash; is spent here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the point raised by Deputy De Rossa. However, the Deputy will appreciate that I am under the constraints of the Treaty of Rome and that our obligations, particularly in relation to competition, place certain restrictions on what I can do.  The annual report on how it works out will be interesting.  It may well be that the Irish viewing audiences will find that Irish film makers can address the complexities of the Treaty of Rome in different ways.  I also take the Deputy's point about working abroad.  There will be an opportunity to look at how this has worked out.  RTE is spending about £3 million on independent production and from now on they will spend £5 million, but that £5 million is becoming transparent in terms of how it is being used, so we will have an opportunity to look at the balances then.  That is the way to go about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the success of home produced programmes on RTE, Irish independent television producers will be best placed to conceive and make programmes of relevance and interest to the Irish audience. Indeed, the success of Irish film makers is such that the security of knowing that a definite amount is available each year will enable them to develop in such a way as to not only remain the first choice of Irish audiences but to increase their popularity with audiences abroad. I sympathise with what the Deputy is seeking to achieve but I am under a constraint <Col N="809" /> which makes it impossible for me to accept his amendment.</P>
    <P>Not only will the Irish independent producers excel in meeting the needs of the domestic market, they will make great achievements abroad.  Let us record achievement.  Recently I met a young man, Mr. Charlton, who made &ldquo;Blood on the Canvas&rdquo;.  He edited and processed it in Telegael near Spiddal, entered it for the international festival in Houston, Texas, against 4,200 entrants and won the gold medal.  That man is only 24 years of age.  There is enormous talent in this community.  This is a very exciting time. I share Deputy De Rossa's view but I am precluded from accepting his amendment under our Treaty commitments.  The spirit of what the Deputy is trying to do will be achieved anyway and even if it is not we will with the first report have an opportunity to address the consequences.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be loath to accuse the Minister of trotting out the Treaty of Rome as a means of avoiding this issue.  I am not convinced that the Treaty of Rome is as black and white as implied in this area.  I have a particularly harrowing case in my constituency where a father has been precluded from erecting a piece of non-Irish stone in a graveyard in Dublin because the graveyard authorities argue that they will use only Irish stone.  For the father concerned it is a particularly gruelling imposition because while the item might not be described as being artistic it is all important to him because his daughter was killed in a car accident.  It seems that in certain circumstances the Treaty of Rome can be ignored in its general application.  If I am wrong in my understanding perhaps the Minister will explain more clearly how the Treaty of Rome affects things.  My understanding is that it is only in circumstances in which the State, or a State agency, would be engaged in the business of promoting &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; or obliging people to invest in, buy or spend on Irish products that the provisions of the Treaty of Rome would have effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know how the Minister feels that applies to RTE which is free <Col N="810" /> to operate within the provisions of the Broadcasting Acts.  I wonder whether it is accurate that the provisions of the Treaty of Rome preclude the kind of idea I have voiced here.  I am not arguing for a kind of kitchen sink approach to television production but, if we are to have a vibrant, independent sector, there must be investment to enable creative people actually do their job.  Unless a significant proportion of the money now being made available is spent in this State that infrastructure will not exist.</P>
    <P>I am struck by the fact that on quite a number of nominally Irish programmes I have viewed, one sees in the credit square that various technical work has been undertaken in studios in Britain and so on.  There is need for devising some way of ensuring that at least a proportion of this money is invested to guarantee that the necessary supports for a thriving industry to develop are put in place.  I do not expect this to grow immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to the suggestion that we might be in breach of the provisions of the Treaty of Rome.  I do not think it is necessary to insert in legislation a specific advantage for an Irish independent film producer which would instigate a contest about the exclusion of others in Europe.</P>
      <P>Let me paint the worst possible scene. Let us imagine that, at the end of the year, we had a great deal of leakage of what is effectively Irish money, one way or another, that we need to build up our film and television sector.  Let us suppose there was a great leak in relation to non-Irish purchased technical work, or indeed total product.  That would immediately suggest to us that there was something very seriously wrong with either the quality of what was coming forward or with the commissioning structure.  We would have to examine that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure Deputy De Rossa that while I cannot accept this amendment it is my intention to keep the matter under continuous review, to ascertain the effect of what I am doing.  I am speaking this morning on this Bill, but Members have referred, correctly, to what I am doing in <Col N="811" /> other areas, such as the Film Board, J &amp; P McMahon and so on.  I will watch carefully to ensure that we reap the maximum job creation benefits for our economy from the whole set of measures I am taking.  I hope I will be proved right but, of course, I cannot guarantee success in everything.</P>
    <P>On Deputy De Rossa's point about infrastructure, it is my hope within a very few short years to put other infrastructure in place, if I have the opportunity, including a training institute for film and so on. This will mean, as another Member said, that structures will be in place for my successors.  I make no apologies for being quite ambitious about what I am endeavouring to do.  Obviously that will require reviewing all of the details, piece by piece.  I can assure Deputy De Rossa that I will review what is happening.  I cannot accept his amendment in the form drafted because I perceive it to be open to challenge which, in itself, could delay some of the progress I want to make.</P>

      <P>Another part of the structure that needs to be in place, not unconnected with the question of supporting and encouraging Irish film makers, concerns the overall tax and financial environment within which independent producers, or indeed international film makers, operate.  The report of independent film makers advanced many recommendations in this regard.  Perhaps the Minister would comment on the type of development he envisages as necessary for this purpose. It is connected with support for Irish film makers.  We do need more initiatives, more co-production agreements and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>IBEC, who represent the film production side of the business, have film makers affiliated to them and so on.  I have made recommendations to the Minister for Finance on very significant changes to section 35 which would render it very attractive for Irish venture capital to invest in film.  It is not appropriate to go into the detail now. What is most significant is the raising of <Col N="812" /> the figure from over £600,000 to £1,050,000 which can be spent in one year rather than across three years.  I have also recommended changes in BES investment which would not disqualify one from investing further in film.  In addition I have recommended circumstances in which individuals can invest £25,000 annually in a tax effective manner in the film industry.</P>
      <P>The net effect of all this is that we have a co-production agreement with Canada.  It is my aim and hope to sign one with Australia within months and thereafter to begin preparing co-production agreements with France and Germany.</P>
      <P>The changes I have announced, that is the combination of re-financing the Film Board and the changes in the finance regime in section 35, have meant that there have been very significant inquiries made already of my Department.  There is an expression of interest.  When I announce within the next day or two the members of the Film Board the test will be whether they share my confidence that we are on our way.  When people see the number of feature films that will be made this year and next year, they will see that we are going about it in a serious manner.</P>
      <P>Deputy Frances Fitzgerald's point is well taken that it was necessary to make recommendations on the financial environment in order to complete the package. It is my intention to review that also.  If I need to fine tune the financial provisions in relation to the film industry, I will make recommendations at the end of the year for the next Finance Bill, having reviewed the amount of money invested, how it is being expended and the results thereof.</P>

      <P>In view of the Minister's undertaking I am quite happy not to press my amendment, but I want to emphasise that the amendment relates to the expenditure of some of the money in the State.  It does not seek to discriminate regarding the location of those who may be actually producing a programme. The producer could be British, <Col N="813" /> American or from another country, it would not matter.  All that is important is that a proportion of the money is spent here.  I agree there may be difficulties and I do not want to delay the implementation of the Bill, but I would appreciate if the Minister would keep the matter under active review.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 22.</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 17 and 18, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(8)  Where it is proposed to make an order or regulations under this section, a draft of the órder or regulations shall be laid before each of the Houses of the Oireachtas and the order shall not come into effect until a motion approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment does not relate specifically to the content of this Bill.  It is a general amendment which I have tended to table for most Bills.  Where orders or regulations are made, it should be by way of a positive motion.  At present regulations and orders are in a negative form in that if they are not annulled by the House within 21 sitting days, they automatically become law.  In the nature of the Standing Orders of this House, it is virtually impossible to have such an order debated here whatever about having it annulled.  In normal circumstances it is impossible to have it debated and discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most obvious example of this is section 31 of the Broadcasting Act.  The order in relation to that Act has been made year after year every January by <Col N="814" /> the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications without a debate in the 16 years since it was adopted.  There is a need for the adoption of a procedure in this House whereby orders, particularly important ones, can be debated here.  I am sure orders are made daily by Ministers and it would be physically impossible for them all to be examined in the House.</P>
    <P>In relation to Dáil reform I proposed a secondary legislation committee which would operate similar to the European secondary legislation committee.  It would be a committee of Deputies but Senators could also participate.  It could take the most important orders and regulations, examine them within the period specified by the Acts and make a case for their implementation or amendment.  Far too often regulations have had an effect beyond that intended by the Minister concerned.  If there was debate and discussion anomalies could be avoided.  I do not propose to delay the House with a list of examples but many regulations have wider consequences than were intended in the first instance.  The purpose of the amendment is to draw attention to the fact that this House does not address or debate many of the laws made in its name.  Changes are made which are never addressed by this House except in an emergency.  I also have responsibility for the social welfare area in which there are many regulations; most of them are probably innocuous but some have serious effects on the income and livelihood of many people.  We have no control over these effects.</P>
    <P>I did not table the amendment to generate a major debate or to press the matter to a vote but simply to draw attention to the fact that important regulations should be made in a positive way and that this House or a committee is given an opportunity to address them.</P>
    <P>Perhaps we could use the legislative committees in place to consider those regulations.  I have made this point in relation to other matters relating to this Bill.  The committees should only address those issues if they are passed to them by the Minister.  They should not, of their <Col N="815" /> own accord, discuss any regulation.  That should only be done if the Minister refers the matter to them by way of report.  I am aware that the Minister is well disposed to ensuring and enabling Deputies to have a real role in this House and I ask him to examine the remit of the Select Committee on Social Affairs.  Will he also review how his Department could cooperate with that committee?</P>
    <P>Arising from last Friday's debate on the Estimates for the Minister's Department, it may be that the committee should establish a subcommittee to monitor the activities of the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and broadcasting.  For many years that area has been neglected by this House.  From the debate last Friday it is clear that there is an interest in that whole area.  I have rarely seen as many Deputies attending a debate in this House.  On the debate on the Broadcasting Bill four Deputies are present and we have achieved a very good general balance.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy De Rossa for his comments.  I appreciate the quality of the debate last Friday.  People agreed it was very positive and constructive and revealed a very deep interest in the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  I wish to thank my officials for the enthusiasm with which they provided information and I favour such information being provided.  It was commented upon that paragraphs were provided on subheads.  Our future approach will be to provide such additional information, suggested by the questions raised last Friday, to facilitate the involvement of Deputies.  This is the direction which we shall take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Referring to Deputy De Rossa's question, I have anticipated it in amendment <Col N="816" /> No. 15.  In respect of amendment No. 22 account must be taken of amendments Nos. 20 and 21 which have been taken already.  Amendment No. 15 (7) (c) states:</P>
    <P>(c)  Where it is proposed to make an order under this subsection, a draft of the order shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the order shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I take the principle in the Deputy's amendment and I have addressed it in amendment No. 15.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Amendment No. 15 was issued subsequent to the insertion of my amendment and, therefore, was not taken into account.  On the Order of Business virtually every day we agree to take a range of items without debate.  Even when positive orders are required by this House they are increasingly being taken without debate.  There was a dispute on this issue yesterday when it was proposed that an extremely important Financial Resolution be taken without debate.  This is now common practice.</P>
      <P>I understand the reason they are taken in this way; there are only so many hours in the day and only so much work that can be covered.  That is the reason I am suggesting again that we should consider the possibility of establishing a committee to deal with secondary legislation. It would be issued with regulations in draft form and consider them.  I imagine that most of these regulations are unimportant and technical but others deal with key issues which can have a major effect, yet, they are rarely discussed in the House.  I accept fully that the Minister has shown good will on this issue and for that reason I withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 28:</P>
      <P>In page 5, before section 6, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;6.  &mdash;The Minister shall take steps to ensure that, among the members of the Independent Radio and Television Commission and the Authority to be nominated by him, a minimum of 40 per cent of both men and women shall be so nominated.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has an historic opportunity to incorporate this recommendation in legislation.  If one examines the involvement of women in decision-making structures at many levels, one will see that it leaves much to be desired and that women are under represented in most decision-making structures within society.  The Commission on the Status of Women recently reported on this issue. One of its recommendations in its first statement to the Government issued in April 1991 was that in the current lifetime of the boards of all the State-sponsored bodies women should be appointed to all casual vacancies to be filled by direct Government appointment unless there <Col N="818" /> are objective criteria for appointing a man and, as the boards of State-sponsored bodies are reconstituted or set-up, Government policy should guarantee a minimum of 40 per cent of both men and women and other direct Government nominees.  I am asking the Minister in this amendment to incorporate this recommendation for the first time in legislation.  In this way we would be acknowledging that there is a need for equal representation in all our institutions.</P>
    <P>In the European Community's Third Action Programme this issue is highlighted and it states that if we are to achieve equality in society it is critical that in the decision-making centres there is equal representation.  Moves in this direction would be in line with the recommendation made in the commission's first statement to the Government two years ago and with current thinking in the European Community and the Council of Europe.</P>
    <P>I do not think in either the Independent Radio and Television Commission or the RTE Authority a rate of 40 per cent has ever been achieved even though there are many women who are well qualified to fill such posts.  Political parties worldwide have found that when positive action is taken it does make a difference and leads to greater equality and the rate of progress being accelerated. If we are prepared to wait for things to happen we will be waiting for a long time.  I ask the Minister to accept the amendment which presents him with an historic opportunity to ensure that such positive action is taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I give my full support to this amendment and think the Minister will be very receptive to the arguments which have been well made already.  The head of the reconstituted Film Board is a woman.  This is to the credit of the Minister who made the appointment.  I am quite sure that it was made in deference to that person's ability and experience as well as to her gender.  This is true in the case of many other appointments which have not yet been acknowledged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="819" /> It is not enough, however, to appoint a &ldquo;token&rdquo; woman, which was the practice of the past.  A substantial number of women have to be appointed to State boards not in deference to any abstract arguments but to the fact that if people are to reach their full potential at this juncture of Irish history large numbers of women have to be appointed to State boards and key decision-making centres. Our failure to do this in the past has cost us dearly.  Women who are creative and courageous and with insight and experience have been excluded and as a result we have ended up the losers.</P>
    <P>This amendment presents the Minister with an opportunity to redress the imbalance. I have met many women who are full of new ideas and fresh thinking, who are creative and courageous and who have a major contribution to make to the development of this country in the short, medium and long term.  We now have an ideal opportunity to put mechanisms in place.  I fully support the amendment put forward by Deputy Fitzgerald and I appeal to the Minister to accept it.</P>
    <P>The last thing we want to see is the maintenance of the old establishment line on every issue, the status quo and the gentleman's club.  We want fresh new ideas.  This will only happen if the requisite number of women are appointed. As I said, it is not enough to appoint a &ldquo;token&rdquo; woman.  This was good for PR purposes and happened in the past but I do not think it will happen in the future to the same extent.  Women will not be appointed automatically unless each and every opportunity is grasped and measures are taken to ensure that this happens.  I appeal to the Minister to take such measures and I am certain he will be receptive to the arguments which have been made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">

      <P>This is a good amendment.  We are fortunate that the four Deputies in the House have traditionally impressed on the House the need to ensure equal representation of women on various boards and authorities appointed by the Government.  The old <Col N="820" /> argument against this approach is that it is difficult to find women with experience, knowledge and so forth.  I suspect that was more to do with the fact that women were excluded from areas where they might have gained the experience or acquired the knowledge that they would be able to use in situations such as this. The way in which boards and authorities are appointed by Government Ministers should be examined when addressing this issue.  In the nature of things I imagine &mdash; I have never had the pleasure of doing it &mdash; that names are sought from friends, party colleagues, officials in Departments and so on who would be suitable for a particular position.  A list would be drawn up and because of the exclusion of women from so many areas in Irish life the likelihood of sufficient numbers of women being named in that process is very slight.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>One way the Minister might address this problem is to place an advertisement in the daily newspapers indicating that he will be appointing, in the course of a certain period of time, a board or an authority, that he is anxious to ensure a gender balance and that any women interested in this post should write to him indicating their experience, their role and their interests.  The Minister might strike a vein of gold if he opened up the whole system of appointments in that way.  It would not in any sense take from this or any other Minister the right to make whatever appointments they wished in the final analysis.  Obviously, any board or authority must have a certain level of expertise in the area to which they are appointed.  In many cases a degree of common sense and general experience <Col N="821" /> is required.  Experience in an area not connected to broadcasting may well be valuable to a person on a broadcasting authority.  For example, a mother who has reared a number of children would have any clear views as to the role of broadcasting and how a broadcasting authority should operate.</P>
    <P>There are other areas of life also where women are becoming increasingly active and I am just offering those as suggestions. The Minister would be setting a headline if he were to ask women to indicate their interest in particular areas. This would not deprive him of any right to select, at the end of the day, those he felt would be most suitable.</P>

      <P>I am happy to inform the House also that women will be in the majority on the Irish Film Board.  It is my intention to give Deputies those members' names because I am aware of their interest in this area.  The Irish Film Board, is chaired, as I have already announced, by Dr. Lelia Doolan.  The other members are Ann O'Connell, who worked on the Coopers and Lybrand <Col N="822" /> report on the film industry, Mary Allequen, who is involved in production and has a great deal of experience, Deirdre Friel, who has enormous experience as a drama producer, Peter Owens, who is knowledgeable in the whole marketing area and whose expertise is valuable, Louis Marcus, about whom I need say very little but who is a distinguished film maker and Neil Jordan.  Of these seven, four are women and it gives me great pleasure to say that there were many gifted women from which to choose who have made great achievements.  I am as sensitive as anybody else to the nature of patriarchal society and I am anxious to ensure the advancement of women in other institutions and organisations for which I have responsibility.  I am referring to institutions such as Údarás and others and I will be examining all of those as the opportunities present themselves. In relation to the Coiste Bunaithe, the Film Board and the National Gallery the pattern of my nominations to Government for appointment is one which meets the gender balance.</P>
      <P>This amendment is one for which I have sympathy but I have difficulty concerning its wording.  I have indicated to the Deputy what I have done in relation to the boards to which I have had an opportunity of making nominations so far.  The point she is making in her amendment will be helpful.  I would like to extend this to the point where her proposal could apply to all State bodies, not just those I have mentioned.  This principle should be addressed in terms of more general legislation if the 40 per cent participation was not adhered to in other State bodies.  I am willing to follow the spirit of what Deputy Fitzgerald is trying to achieve.  I would also like to address the issue referred to in this specific legislation in more general legislation and to discuss this with Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms F. Fitzgerald Ms F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at the Minister.  Of course, I recognise his efforts in this area and he is adhering to and, indeed, going beyond the recommendations of the commission in relation to the 40 per cent participation <Col N="823" /> by women, which I welcome.  I am surprised that the Minister is not willing to include it specifically in this Bill.  I am not accusing the Minister of this but there has been much lip service to equality. Obviously, what is required is action on the specifics.  Women are crying out for this, whether in the home, in business or elsewhere.  They want joint ownership of the family home, membership of the semi-State boards, etc.  We have a difficulty frequently getting to the specifics of this issue and the Government accepted this recommendation two years ago.  The new Partnership Government accepted it also and the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, said that he wants to see this sort of balance within a three-year period so we have support for the thinking behind the commission's recommendation. Therefore, what is the difficulty in building this recommendation into the area for which the Minister has specific responsibility?  I welcome the Minister's point that this recommendation should be taken into consideration in looking at legislation generally.  However, I remind him that since the first recommendation was accepted two years ago &mdash; to which the previous Government gave a great welcome &mdash; Eolas and the free Legal Aid Board were set up with all male appointees to their boards.  This was done at a time when the Commission on the Status of Women had made a recommendation which was accepted.  Even though there is a commitment to ensuring a gender balance on the boards of semi-State companies and an acceptance of the principle, there are still failures in this area.  My amendment relates to one of the Minister's specific areas of responsibility, he should lead by example and avail of this historic opportunity to build my proposal into the legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not using sentiments of support for the principle of a gender balance.  Actions speak a great deal louder than words.  There is a gender balance on the board which I announced previously and for the first time there is a 40 per cent representation of women on the board of the National Gallery. The woman I appointed is not only distinguished but has been a member of the staff of the gallery for a long time and served it well.  I have been consistently in favour of ensuring a gender balance in all my actions.</P>
      <P>The 40 per cent gender balance rule should apply to every State board and it should not be left to each individual Minister to implement this provision.  If it does not happen legislation should be introduced to implement it.  I would support such action by my colleague, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform. It would be dangerous to leave the implementation of this rule to the discretion of individual Ministers and not to demonstrate that they have taken steps to ensure there is a gender balance on boards.  Regardless of who they are, they will not have difficulty in demonstrating they have taken steps which would astonish people but which do not achieve the desired result.  The provision should not be as loose as that; it should be monitored in the case of each Minister.  If there is significant failure to implement this provision across all State boards this matter should be addressed by way of simple general equality and law reform legislation.  I have given the Deputy an undertaking that I will monitor this area. I have been consistent in my actions so far and I have no intention of changing.</P>

I congratulate the Minister on doing this &mdash; it is something of which he can be proud.  On that basis if he finds the wording of the amendment inadequate or loose it is within his remit to agree to bring forward an amendment on Report Stage to cover this area.</P>
      <P>The relationship between the Minister and Opposition Deputies during the debate on this Bill has been fairly good. We have managed to iron out some of our differences.  The Minister has very graciously accepted a number of the principles for which we argued.

      <P>The Minister said he would not like the question of gender balance to be left to the discretion of individual Ministers. However, the reality is that that is the situation.  If individual Ministers do not regard it as their responsibility to do something then, unfortunately, nothing will be done.  I do not propose to comment on the attitude of the Minister's colleagues in Government but I am sure that some of them would not be as flexible as the Minister.  The Minister could put pressure on other members of the Government to act in like manner if he accepted the responsibility we are urging upon him in this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has argued that it would be dangerous to leave implementation of this provision to the discretion of individual Ministers; it would be dangerous and unfortunate if the Minister did not avail of the opportunity here to take on board an amendment which, as far as I am aware, would provide for the first time in legislation a gender balance on boards.  I emphasise that we are talking about gender balance.  We are not seeking to incorporate into the legislation a provision that X number of women will be appointed to boards.  There must be at least 40 per cent men on any board, <Col N="826" /> committee or authority.  We are not arguing that boards should be made up entirely of women.  The Minister has a golden opportunity to take his commitment a step forward and include in legislation something in which he genuinely believes and on which he has acted during his short time in Government.  I appeal to the Minister to take on board the principle of this amendment and to bring forward an amendment on Report Stage which will cover the case which he and we are making.</P>

      <P>The Minister's position is not totally simple, he has to consider the views of his colleagues in Cabinet.  I have no doubt that arguments can be advanced about the rigidity which might arise from the imposition of quotas in the law.  If the Minister attempts to get support for an across the board statutory provision I am sure arguments to the contrary will be advanced with quite an amount of intensity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One way of getting around those arguments is to include the provision in legislation and see how it works.  Maybe the arguments of undue rigidity will prove to be quite persuasive.  If the Minister was willing to include this provision in legislation and put a limit on its duration, for example, that it will apply for the next five years only, it would be clear it is an experiment and not a permanent change.  The experience of operating such an amendment would be helpful to the Government in making a decision on the wider issue because they would have seen it work in an important area &mdash; it has been acknowledged that the Minister is sympathetic to making it work.  Equally problems that might arise would be brought to light &mdash; for example, in the case of organisations that might wish to be represented, all of whose members happen to be women or all of whose members happen to be men, it would not be possible to accommodate them because of the 40 per cent rule.  In that way we could see how a general provision in this regard, to which the Minister said he is looking forward, would be dealt with.  Unless we experiment with the <Col N="827" /> measure we will not see the problems or the potential in this area.  Perhaps the Minister, who is very reasonable in his approach to this matter, will accept Deputy Fitzgerald's amendment on an experimental basis.</P>

      <P>I am not persuaded one iota by what the Minister said in that if he takes responsibility in this area it will somehow lessen overall Government responsibility for this matter.  It is already Government policy to accept the commission's recommendations, as was restated recently by the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor.  I ask the Minister to make an historic breakthrough and incorporate this proposal in law to ensure that the 40 per cent recommendation is met in areas for which he is responsible.  Given the Minister's track record and commitment in this area, if he does not take on board this amendment, what hope is there of other Ministers accepting it?  Will the Minister consider the amendment or introduce an alternative amendment on Report Stage if he feels that the wording &ldquo;shall take steps&rdquo; is not appropriate?</P>

      <P>I have no doubt that the wording &ldquo;shall take steps&rdquo; is extraordinary weak and very much short of my actions in this area.  I am grateful to the Deputies for their comments.  In relation to appointments I have accepted the equality report, but the wording in this amendment does not meet the recommendations I wish to see implemented.  I am not happy with a formulation as weak as &ldquo;shall take steps&rdquo;. I also want to address the issue of nomination and decision by Government. Ministers, in relation to bodies under their responsibility, make nominations to the Government which decides on them. That mechanism is worth considering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no disagreement about what we are all seeking to achieve.  I want to ensure appropriate representation of women on boards in the most effective way possible.  Between now and Report <Col N="828" /> Stage I will have discussions with my colleague, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform.  I cannot give commitments until I study his proposals in this regard. I would like to see this matter dealt with in a general way in one Bill.  I will return to the issue on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on his actions to date.  At every opportunity he acknowledged the ability and capability of women and has done so in the most practical way possible, by making a number of appointments of women, as announced today.  He is to be highly commended on doing so because at the end of the day it is the action taken that matters, not the aspiration advanced at Árd Fheiseanna or occasional conferences called for various purposes.  This Minister has taken action on each occasion on which the opportunity has arisen and he is to be highly commended on doing so.</P>
      <P>However, I stress the necessity of acknowledging this amendment on Report Stage.  If it is defeated the wrong signals will be sent out and our actions misconstrued.  People will fail to realise that advances have been made in terms of appointments of women by this Minister, who in many ways is the most open and enlightened Minister in regard to these matters.  All the wrong signals would go out to women and to the general public and Ministers in other Departments who do not have the same outlook or the same broadness of vision as this Minister would not be encouraged to take action in this area.  That could be very damaging.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to take note of what I said.  The best approach to this matter is to proceed on a Department by Department basis in the context of legislation rather than in a global manner with the old liturgies and aspirations trotted out again.  I do not wish the appointment of women to State boards to be as longrunning as the draining of the Shannon. The Minister is capable of giving a lead on this matter, not only in his own Department but to other Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister consider this matter on Report Stage?  He should come up <Col N="829" /> with a form of wording that does not shackle him or the Government in what we are attempting to do, and which would achieve the desired results.  If the first major step is not taken in the context of this amendment culminating in a result, future attempts in this regard will hardly succeed.  This amendment is the acid test of the future success in this area in the context of other Departments.  I support the spirit of Deputy Fitzgerald's proposal and I have no doubt she will advert to the Minister's goodwill and intent on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clearly a matter for Deputy Frances Fitzgerald as to the way she intends to proceed with this amendment.  I am disappointed with the Minister's response to this proposal. I appreciate that he is only one of 15 Ministers in Government, but he has autonomy within that body in relation to this legislation, and he can if he wishes accept this amendment particularly in view of the fact that it is entirely in line with the commission's report which has been accepted by Government.  I can understand the Minister's wish to consult with the Minister for Equality and Law Reform in relation to the terms of the amendment which might be brought in on Report Stage.  The Minister would be doing himself a disfavour by not agreeing in principle to proceed on Report Stage with an amendment such as this.  I am not pressing on him acceptance of the wording here.  He has indicated its weakness and that is inevitable with amendments coming from the Opposition as we do not have the services of expert drafts people.  I urge very strongly on the Minister the need to incorporate in this legislation the reference to the need for a gender balance in the appointment of the Authority and the radio commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is mistaken if he believes that this is not the time to do it.  We are fortunate that we have Deputy Michael Higgins as Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht with responsibility for the broadcasting area.  One of the certainties of political life is that we cannot be certain where we will be next year or the <Col N="830" /> year after.  For that reason the Minister should not miss a golden opportunity to ensure that something of lasting value is left in this legislation which bears his stamp.  There is nothing to stop the Taoiseach from deciding tomorrow to reshuffle the Cabinet and put, perhaps, Deputy Noel Davern into that position.  Who knows what kind of amendments might then be brought forward in this legislation?</P>

      <P>I mentioned Deputy Davern to highlight the difference of approach that might be taken by different Deputies in different positions. The Minister should have regard to the fact that he does not know who will fill the post after him.  Now is the time.  The Minister has an opportunity to do something lasting, to set a headline for other Ministers and make it almost impossible for other Ministers not to take similar steps.  I appeal to the Minister to take this step and do himself and the women of Ireland a favour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree it is fortunate that Deputy Higgins is the current Minister. The only better person I could see in that job would be Deputy Frances Fitzgerald who would have included this provision in the Bill.  The next time the Minister sits down to write wonderful poetry he will be singing the praises of Deputy Fitzgerald, because she has given him an opportunity to be the first Minister to recognise that our boards and State institutions should recognise in legislation the role of women in our society.  When poets and poetesses of the year 2010 start to write about this time and about their fellow poet, Deputy Higgins, they will be singing his praises as the man who was prepared to stand up and be counted.  I am disappointed that the Minister did not on his own initiative include this provision in the Bill but I welcome the fact that the Minister will address this on Report Stage.  Having listened to Opposition Deputies the Minister is now fired <Col N="831" /> with enthusiasm and his officials will present him with the appropriately worded amendment for Report Stage so that we can again sing the Minister's praises and perhaps get someone to write a poem recommending that amendment.</P>
      <P>This is also an opportunity for the Minister to impress on his Cabinet colleagues that this amendment calls for 40 per cent representation of both men and women.  At some stage someone might suggest a board comprising all women but we must also ensure that men will not be discriminated against in certain areas. This amendment will ensure that men will not be excluded.  It recognises that both men and women should be fairly represented.  I am sure the Minister's colleague, Deputy Mervyn Taylor, will wholeheartedly support the Minister in this amendment.  This legislation will be a flagship for some of the Minister's more reluctant colleagues on the Front Bench who say that of course they will appoint women to boards and recognise their role in our society but who when the opportunity arises cannot find a suitable woman.  There are plenty of trained, skilled women who can take their places on any board.  Let us take this opportunity to give a lead in this area.</P>
      <P>I look forward to Report Stage.  I hope Deputy Frances Fitzgerald will not be forced into resubmitting this amendment if she decides now to withdraw it on the Minister's promise.  I hope we will not have to withdraw all the compliments paid to the Minister.</P>

There was not a Minister, of the most patriarchal type, since the State <Col N="832" /> was founded who could not show that he had taken steps of some kind.

      <P>There is no difference between Members in what we are trying to achieve.  It is facilitated by the fact that at every opportunity I have exceeded the 40 per cent quota.  I appreciate that people recognise that and I thank them for it.  I have also said that I do not intend to depart from that philosophy. The issue is whether this is the best way of achieving what we want to achieve.  I listened carefully to the points in favour of including a specific reference in this Bill.  I have said that I will have discussion with the Minister for Equality and Law Reform.  General legislation is the best way of handling this issue across the State boards.  I want to consult with the Minister not only on that principle but also on the timescale for such legislation as he is planning.</P>
      <P>I will consider before Report Stage all the points that have been made.  It is my intention to examine how this matter can be best advanced so that the objective of equality can be achieved.  That will give Deputies an opportunity to reconsider the position.  I must strike a balance between introducing general or specific legislation and I will have to consider the timescale involved in introducing both types.  I have listened carefully to all the comments and I will consider them before Report Stage.</P>

I compliment the Minister on his record and I have no doubt about his future intentions in this regard.  Nevertheless, up to now there have been enormous barriers to women in regard to both access to the law and changes to the law which reflects the needs of women.  We have seen an example of this recently.  The law is crucial in terms of its approach to women. The Minister should accept this amendment so that our law is unequivocal and clear.  We have had the promises, we want action.  I will withdraw the amendment in the hope that the Minister will introduce an amendment in this regard on Report Stage.

    </Speaker>
    <P>In tabling this amendment I was reacting to the initial drafting which I felt was much too loose and vague and would not meet the requirements of reporting, particularly when we are talking about the use to which public moneys are being put.  I reacted to the phrase &ldquo;As soon as <Col N="835" /> may be after the end of the financial year&rdquo;, which could be three, six or nine months later.  I propose to substitute words to the effect that a report should be made available before the end of the first month of the calendar year after which the allocation was made.  That is a reasonable request.  I admit that the matters under consideration are ongoing and that we cannot put the same deadline on programme and film making that we could on an annual financial report where precise figures and an exact report could be produced at the end of every year. That yardstick cannot be applied to what is under consideration in this Bill.  Nonetheless, a progress or an interim report should be made available to this House within a reasonable timescale after the end of financial year in which time the moneys have been made available.  It is important that we should require that a report be made available before the end of the following January setting out the progress to date and the plans which are in train so that we could have an overall view as to progress.  Because of the nature of this activity it cannot be tied down in a mathematical or specific way but it is reasonable that the Members of this House should have a report that would answer Deputies' questions and that such reports should be made available before the end of the first calendar month of the year after which the allocation was made.</P>

        <i>(Donegal South-West):</i> On the invitation of His Excellency, the Prime Minister of Malaysia, Dr. Mahathir, the Taoiseach will pay an official visit to Malaysia from 27 to 30 May 1993. The Minister for Tourism and Trade will accompany the Taoiseach, together with a substantial trade delegation.</P>
      <P>The visit is a follow-up to the visit to Ireland last September by the prime minister accompanied by a number of his ministers and a Malaysian trade delegation.</P>
      <P>I see the objectives of the mission as further cementing the growing trade relationships between Ireland and Malaysia as well as raising the profile of Ireland among the Malaysian business community.</P>
      <P>Malaysia is one of the fastest growing economies in Asia with growth rates of 8 per cent over the last five years.  The market offers great potential for Irish companies especially in the service sector.</P>
      <P>About 20 Irish companies will participate in the mission.  The mission has a specific strategic focus and the companies are drawn from four major sectors, aviation, healthcare, education/training and engineering.  In addition, there is also a number of companies from the food sector which already have a substantial trade with Malaysia.  A number of the companies will be signing agreements aimed at developing further co-operation with their counterparts in Malaysia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the visit, the Minister for Tourism and Trade will also participate in bilateral meetings with a number of Government Ministers to discuss ways of <Col N="841" /> further developing trade and economic relations between Ireland and Malaysia.</P>

        <i>(Donegal South-West):</i> In 1992, we exported £28.235 million worth of goods and services to Malaysia &mdash; this is a provisional figure &mdash; and imported £36.735 million worth of goods. This leaves a shortfall in the balance of trade in the region of £8.5 million.  This is healthy when one compares it with the figure for 1991 when the shortfall was £17.5 million.  Apart from 1989, this is the lowest it has ever been.  I do not know what position Malaysia holds in the league but I can obtain this information for the Deputy.</P>

      <P>For some months now, the Government has been engaged in an extensive process of consultations with national and regional interests in relation to the next National Development Plan.</P>
      <P>In a tourism context, the Minister and the Department have met with, and received submissions from, a wide range of tourism interests, including trade representative associations such as the Irish Hotels Federation.  The Minister has of course also had the benefit of the recommendations of the Tourism Task Force in relation to Structural Funding which, in the course of its deliberations, received submissions from 130 bodies and individuals.</P>
      <P>Account has been taken of these submissions in preparing proposals for the next national plan.</P>

      <P>I acknowledge the level of contact and consultation that has taken place to date.  However, in view of the fact that the detailed proposals of the plan are now being drawn up is it not only right and proper that the Government should consult the main players, the hoteliers, members of the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation and others to discuss the final detail with them?  Does the Minister agree that it is right and proper that they should know the shopping list as the Government expects them to be the main investors in future tourism projects?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Donegal South-West):</i> The Government fully appreciates the investment by the industry which is very much an integral part of overall investment in this sector.  In developing its proposals the Government has undertaken an extensive process of consultation with national and regional interests as well as the social partners, Government Departments, and the subregional review committees. In the tourism context <Col N="845" /> consultations have taken place with Bord Fáilte, Shannon Development, the Office of Public Works, CERT, the Department of the Marine, the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and representative organisations from the tourism industry, including the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation and the Irish Hotels Federation.  As I stated already, 130 submissions were received and they are being considered by the Minister.</P>
      <P>If the industry has further views which it wishes to communicate to the Minister, I am sure he will be glad to give them his full consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>

Will he also convey our request that he engage in a final round of consultations before the plan is finalised, in view of its major importance for tourism growth in the next four to five years?</P>

        <i>(Donegal South-West):</i> I cannot accept that there is such a degree of disquiet because every opportunity has been given to the industry to submit its views for the Minister's consideration. The further views of the industry will be considered by the Minister if they are submitted to him.  I respectfully suggest that they should be submitted at the earliest possible date.</P>

        <i>(Donegal South-West):</i> The <i>Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-1997</i> specifically mentions that the Government will seek to extend inter-airline agreements with a view to improving access between Ireland and more distant parts of the world.  The Minister has recently asked his colleague, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Cowen, who has responsibility for access transport policy, actively to pursue this issue with relevant carriers.  We already have common-rating agreements with Australia, New Zealand and Japan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister agrees that if Ireland is to be more accessible to the long haul markets from Japan, South America, the west coast of America, Canada and the Far East it is vital that Dublin is common rated with London.  At present 85 per cent of our tourists come from seven overseas markets: Britain, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, the US and Australia. If we are to capitalise on the massive growth in tourism from South America, Japan and the other countries mentioned we must have common rated access.  Will the Minister convey to his colleague the Minister for Tourism and Trade, the importance of this?  Will he ask him to consider reaching agreements with airline carriers on a common rating for airports such as Shannon, Farranfore and Cork?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Donegal South-West):</i> I have no disagreement with Deputy Deenihan's viewpoint.  It is essential that Dublin is common rated with London and possibly with other European cities and that agreements should be drawn up with the various airlines.  I fully accept and appreciate that a common rating agreement would yield significant benefits for tourist numbers and this would <Col N="847" /> help to create further much needed jobs. Our experience of a common rating agreement with Australia has been excellent. There has been an increase of 100 per cent in tourist numbers over the past three years.  It is important to note also that 12 per cent of Australian visitors to Europe travel onwards to Ireland.  We can look at the possibility of establishing agreements with the other countries Deputy Deenihan mentioned.  The Minister with responsibility in this area is the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications and his colleague, the Minister for Tourism and Trade, has written to him requesting him to pursue this matter.</P>

        <i>(Donegal South-West)</i>: I believe this is a question for the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications and he will answer it.  As we have common rating agreements with Australia, New Zealand and Japan I assume that if it were contrary to EC legislation this would have been flagged by now. Even if it were, we should pursue it vigorously. I will pursue this matter with the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.</P>

        <i>(Donegal South-West)</i>: Sustainable tourism development in terms of markets, investment and most importantly the environment, will be the primary focus of plans for the industry <Col N="848" /> for the remainder of this decade.  The environment remains the bedrock of Irish tourism and sustainable development requires that the product is developed in such a way that the environment is preserved and, ideally, enhanced.</P>
      <P>In planning for the further development of tourism, priority will be given to developing new markets and products to improve the seasonal and geographic spread of tourism in Ireland.  Bord Fáilte are creating a planning framework embracing tourism centres, rural tourism, special interest areas and touring routes.  Investment in products for the off-peak and shoulder seasons will feature prominantly in the Government's submission for support in the next round of Structural Funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I get worried when I hear the word &ldquo;enhanced&rdquo; in relation to the environment.  Today I am delighted and relieved by the decision of the Supreme Court in favour of the Burren Action Group.  Does the Minister agree that there should be a threshold on the numbers using sensitive areas, as happened in America in Yellowstone Park?  Does he realise that far from militating against tourism, in terms of numbers, it increases the interest when we put such a value on our natural resources which was shown in the Royal Hospital exhibition of the terracotta army from China, when long queues of people were prepared to wait because they valued the exhibition and were spurred on by the interest shown?</P>

        <i>(Donegal South-West)</i>: This country is a long way short of having reached saturation point in regard to visitor numbers.  I know Deputy Sargent referred to specific areas but I do not intend to mention them except to say there are areas which people should not visit.  We should continue to entice as many visitors as possible.  To better utilise our facilities we should look at the off peak and shoulder seasons which, in turn, would result in greater profitability and help the environment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Far from asking people <Col N="849" /> not to visit areas, will the Minister bear in mind that other areas regret not having put in place a policy in terms of options when we have to put some restraint on the numbers visiting?  Far from naming specific places, which the Minister would be better qualified to do, will he indicate that, in time, there will be a threshold in regard to numbers in a concentrated area?</P>

        <i>(Donegal South-West)</i>: It may be very difficult to establish a threshold but it is something the officials of the Department can examine.  I look forward to the day when we will have that situation in Ireland.  In relation to the environment, practical initiatives have been taken under the operational programme and more will be taken under the next round of Structural Funds.  I assure the Deputy that every effort will be made to impress upon the Minister for the Environment the necessity to look at the environmental factors.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Donegal South-West)</i>: At the General Affairs Council on 5 April 1993, Trade Ministers discussed the Uruguay Round and current issues in the Community's bilateral relations with the US, following a wide-ranging report to the meeting by Commission Vice President, Sir Leon Brittan on his meeting with US Trade Representative Kantor on 29 March 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations, Sir Leon reported that the US has indicated they wanted to <Col N="850" /> reach agreement on the round by the end of 1993.  This seemingly more positive attitude of the US Administration was welcomed by member state Ministers, including the Irish Minister, although the overall US approach was still far from clear and the possibility remained of further impediments to progress in the round.</P>
    <P>Since the Council of 5 April, there have been further discussions in the matter between the Community and the US, and the round was also discussed at a quadrilateral meeting, involving the EC, US, Canada and Japan, on 14 May.  In addition, the US Administration has applied to Congress for extension of the fast-track negotiating mandate which would be required for the US to meet the deadline of concluding the round by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>The major participants in the negotiations are clearly making considerable efforts to reach an agreement and, therefore, the prospects for a successful conclusion to the round must be enhanced. As indicated when the matter was debated in this House in February, and in replies to parliamentary questions in the meantime, the Government remains fully committed to achieving a successful and balanced Uruguay Round Agreement as a means of boosting the world economy and contributing to a stable and well regulated world trading environment.</P>

When he talks about development of the world economy is he including the Third World in the equation, given that the current row appears to be between the rich nations?  The EC is battling with the United States and Canada about a share of the spoils of world trade.  It seems there is too much emphasis on that area while virtually three quarters of the world living in poverty seem to be relegated to the back burner.</P>

We must ensure there is equality and that all the participating countries are involved in liberalisation commitments.  It is not only in agriculture that difficult problems remain to be resolved in the negotiations.  A vast amount of work still has to be done in other areas such as services and market access before this global and balanced outcome can be achieved.

      <Quest>if, in regard to the allocation of £11.42 million in the Estimate for his Department for export guarantee arrangements, he will give a list of the main sectors to benefit from this cover; the arrangements in place to ensure that taxpayers' money is not exposed to unreasonable risk; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Donegal South-West)</i>: The policy in relation to the provision of export credit insurance is to assist Irish companies in the sale abroad of Irish goods and services, while at the same time operating the scheme at no net cost to the Exchequer, over time.  This means that it is necessary to adopt a prudent approach to underwriting, balancing very carefully the needs of Irish exporters against the risk of non-payment by their foreign buyers, which would result in the payment of claims from taxpayers' money.</P>
      <P>Short-term policies were issued or renewed in 1991 which had a potential liability of some £127 million in respect of sales of goods and services where the credit period did not exceed one year. No medium term policies, which relate to longer term contracts for the sale of capital goods and services with a credit period of up to five years were issued in 1991.  The State ceased to provide cover for short term commercial risk at the end of 1991 and, as a result, total cover under short term policies issued and renewed in 1992 reduced to £1.66 million.  One medium term policy covering just under £8 million was issued last year.</P>
      <P>The allocation of £11.42 million in the 1993 Departmental Estimate provides for repayment to the Central Fund of advances made to meet net liabilities which arose in the perid 1 April, 1991 to 31 March, 1992 and does not relate to any cover which will be written this year.</P>
      <P>Of the £11.42 million, almost £6 million related to claims paid in respect of pharmaceutical, electrical and healthcare services and most of the balance was made up of two large claims, one in respect of food and drink exports, and one in respect of a construction contract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the question of an EC scheme to support credit, while measures to harmonise export credit schemes in the <Col N="855" /> member states are under examination, I would consider it unlikely, having regard to the views of many member states, that an EC scheme will be developed, at least in the foreseeable future.  We, of course, continue to press for the introduction of such a scheme, at every available opportunity, as the Irish export credit scheme, due to its small scale of operations compared with most other EC state export credit schemes, will never be capable of competing with what they can offer.</P>

      <P>Is there any cover provided for what are known as high risk countries and is any of the £11.42 million in this year's Estimates for contracts with high risk countries?  These are countries such as Iraq which it is expected will not pay as a result of failure of one kind or another.</P>

        <i>(Donegal South-West)</i>: A substantial amount of the £11.42 million would relate to high risk countries; £6 million would relate to Iraq.  There are other countries involved, such as Nigeria and Canada.  The Department of Tourism and Trade categorises the different countries and this can change from period to period.  It is not customary to indicate the names of the countries involved.</P>

      <P>It may not be customary, a Cheann Comhairle, but we are spending a considerable amount of money in Dublin Castle trying to get to the bottom of various events which relate directly to this question of the export credit insurance scheme and it would be useful for the House to know who is getting taxpayers' money.  If the business is legitimate, as I am sure it is, there is no reason this House and the public should not know who those companies are.  This is an insurance scheme and, therefore, one must assume that premiums <Col N="856" /> are paid.  What proportion of the payouts is covered by premia?  For instance, in relation to the £6 million on the contracts to Iraq, which one must presume were for beef, what premium was paid by the company concerned for that kind of cover?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Donegal South-West)</i>: The overall question of the premium would depend on various factors, such as the country involved and the assessment of short term risk.  There is no rule of thumb as to the amount of premium paid. The risks and the company's previous business record are taken into consideration. I am not trying to withhold this information from the Deputy but I do not have the actual amount of premium in relation to any of them.</P>

        <i>(Donegal South-West)</i>: It is a matter for a company to apply to the Department.  If there is a short term political risk that scheme covers consumer goods.  If the money is not coming on stream then it is possible to withdraw the cover.  Medium term risks are a bigger problem, but no country is ruled out.

        <i>(Donegal South-West)</i>: The Department and the Government strive to ensure that there is no net cost over a period of time.  Of course, this <Col N="857" /> assistance is made available to exporters to enable them to create jobs.  It is important to recall that this scheme was introduced as far back as 1953.  We have had sales of approximately £5 billion during that period and the deficit is in the region of £30 million.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Donegal South-West)</i>: Over the past number of weeks the Minister has met representatives from various sectors of the tourism industry, and among the issues discussed were proposals in this year's budget, and Finance Bill, likely to impact on their business.</P>
      <P>The fundamental purpose of the budget was to provide for the orderly development of the public finances in the current year.  This, and the other economic management measures taken by the Government since the beginning of the year, have had the effect of substantially reducing interest rates to the benefit of the tourism sector as well as other businesses.</P>
      <P>As a result of the Minister's post budget discussions with the industry, the Government decided to defer the increase in the VAT rate on car hire to 21 per cent announced in the budget. The Government also decided to add a deferral scheme to the vehicle registration repayment scheme being introduced in the Finance Bill to help ease the cost to car hire firms of increasing supply of hire cars for the peak season.  These modifications should go a long way towards meeting concerns expressed about car hire supply for the coming and future tourist seasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The industry has also welcomed the <Col N="858" /> proposal in the Finance Bill to include tourism as one of the eligible sectors under the new seed capital scheme, which should be a significant incentive for small to medium sized enterprises in the sector. The positive, pro-jobs provisions in the Finance Bill will provide a significant incentive to business, together with reduced interest rates, to proceed with developments which will benefit wealth creation and jobs in the tourism sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase causing most concern relates to VAT on accommodation which has been increased from 10 per cent to 12.5 per cent.  I understand this amendment on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill has not yet been reached. Therefore, even at this late stage, I ask the Minister to defer the increase in VAT on accommodation until January.  I am sure the Minister will agree that a great deal of brochures, videos and so on have been distributed throughout the market niches advertising accommodation at a certain cost.  Those people are now forced to increase their costs to tourists despite the fact that they advertised at lower rates.  In some cases they will have to absorb this increased cost themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Donegal South-West)</i>: The Minister for Finance justifies this increase on grounds of budgetary demands.  Of course, the House will be aware of the necessity to begin gradual implementation of the EC VAT Directive in regard to which there is a derogation until 1996.  Even if the Minister wished to retain the 10 per cent VAT rate on accommodation, it would not be possible within the EC legislative framework. We have a parking rate and a normal rate and the parking rate is 12.5 per cent.  We realise the effects of its overall imposition and the Minister took into consideration car hire, the seed capital scheme and the business expansion scheme.  I hope that at the end of this season the steps which have been taken will be beneficial and that the imposition of an additional 2.5 per cent on accommodation will not have serious effects.</P>

        <i>(Donegal South-West)</i>: In recent weeks the Minister held meetings with a number of organisations such as the Coach Tourism Council, the Chauffeur Drivers' Association, the IFA, the Recognised English Language Schools' Association, the Cottage Holiday Homes' Association, Kilkenny Rural Tourism, the Irish Amusement Trade Association, the Hotel and Catering Institute and the Tour Operators' Forum.  Prior to the budget the Minister also had meetings with ITIC and the Irish Hotels Federation, various issues relevant to the tourism industry were raised, but in so far as the budget and the Finance Bill are concerned, the principal issues raised related to VAT on tourist services and the need for relief on the car hire sector to deal with the shortages in supply.  I have no doubt the industry representatives were not entirely happy, but they have welcomed the reduction of VAT on cars from 21 per cent to 12.5 per cent.  They also welcome the seed capital scheme and the fact that the payment of duty on new cars purchased by operators and resold in the short term has been deferred.  In the case of cars purchased between 1 December and 31 August, it is paid on 15 September and on purchases made between 1 September and 30 November it is paid on 15 December.  There is no difficulty in regard to cars that remain within the car hire business.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that a 2.5 per cent increase is insignificant <Col N="860" /> in terms of the overall package for tourism?  We are talking about £2.50 in every £100.  That will not have a great impact on customers.  In view of the extension of the business expansion and seed capital schemes, will the Minister give an estimate of how important this will be in terms of attracting additional tourists and encouraging the development of additional tourist projects?</P>

        <i>(Donegal South-West)</i>: The Deputy will be aware that the former Minister set targets which seemed unrealistic at the time.  However, they were realisable and created an additional 25,000 jobs in the tourism industry, thus increasing substantially the income from tourism.  I have no doubt that to continue with that policy, taking into consideration matters relating to the business expansion scheme, the seed capital scheme, and the VAT on car hire, will be a great benefit to the industry.  I am sure it will result in the creation of much needed jobs in this important industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Donegal South-West)</i>: I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 23 and 39 together.</P>
      <P>The critical need to improve the marketing capability of indigenous industry has been recognised by successive Governments.  Following the decision of the EC Commission to adopt a support rate of 75 per cent for marketing measures under the Programme for Industrial Development 1989-1993, the Government has been able to substantially increase An Bord Tráchtála's budget over the four year period.  This year An Bord Tráchtála will receive £37.828 million in Exchequer grant-in-aid, an increase of 11 per cent on the 1992 outturn and over 80 per cent higher than the 1988 figure.  Given the many demands and constraints on Government spending, this level of funding underlines our commitment to improving the marketing skills of our manufactures and service companies to enable them to compete on world markets.</P>
      <P>The increased Exchequer support has enabled An Bord Tráchtála to intensify its existing services to Irish exporters and to initiate new market support measures. The success of An Bord Tráchtála's programmes can be judged by the prodigious export growth of our indigenous firms. Last year, 1992 was the fifth year in a row that our indigenous exports surpassed overall export growth.  The 1,200 companies in the indigenous sector, employing almost 98,000 people, have increased their export sales from £2.1 billion in 1988 to £3.7 billion last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Tourism and Trade has recently set An Bord Tráchtála a new target of increasing indigenous exports by 50 per cent by the end of 1996&mdash;from <Col N="862" /> the current £3.7 billion to £5.5 billion. This ambitious target can be achieved by maintaining the current high level of Exchequer support for An Bord Tráchtála's existing activities and for the new measures which the agency will initiate under the market development programme 1994-1999.  Our market development policy over the coming years will have the radical focus demanded by the Programme for a Partnership Government in order to optimise the employment spin-off from this increased marketing effort.</P>
    <P>In the area of partnership marketing, An Bord Tráchtála operates a wide range of programmes and services.  For example, the agency recently introduced a new group marketing scheme which is designed to aid groups of first time exporters to make the initial breakthrough into the international marketplace. An Bord Tráchtála are prepared to fund up to ten group marketing schemes representing 50 exporters over the next three years.  Under this scheme, An Bord Tráchtála will co-finance market based agents which represent a number of companies.  The total cost of this scheme over the three years will be £1.4 million of which An Bord Tráchtála will contribute up to £0.5 million with the rest of the cost being shared between the participating companies.</P>
    <P>The regional markets &mdash; international partnerships programme is aimed at identifying new commercial opportunities for Irish firms in selected regions of the Community which are showing above average economic performance.  As part of the process, An Bord Tráchtála assists firms to identify suitable partnership arrangements for Irish SMEs with firms in the chosen regions.  The programme also involves establishing linkages between Irish SMEs with firms from other countries with a view to developing opportunities in third markets.  The regional markets programme now covers 11 EC regions and has so far generated additional exports worth £72 million.  In 1992 alone, 1,600 companies participated in the programme.</P>
    <P>Through their group promotions programme, <Col N="863" /> An Bord Tráchtála organises group promotional events and activities by small companies within a given product or market sector which would not have the scale or expertise to proceed on an individual basis.  Logistical and organisational support is arranged centrally on behalf of the group and the purchasing power of the group is used in space negotiations with trade fair organisers.</P>
    <P>An Bord Tráchtála's group development programme facilitates the gathering of design and market information for groups of firms with common marketing objectives and needs.  Through this programme consultants usually prepare product, merchandising or packaging concepts.  Costs are shared between participating firms and An Bord Tráchtála.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister outline how indigenous exporters have fared in comparison with multinational exporters?  It seems there is a more positive result in respect of exports by multinationals. Regarding the lack of foreign language skills in selling indigenous products, would the Minister agree with recent commentators that the lack of those skills is a major barrier to selling Irish products abroad and is a flaw in our marketing process?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Donegal South-West)</i>: The programme has generated additional exports worth £72 million and that is indicative of its success.  In 1992, 1,600 companies participated in the programme and I have no doubt those numbers will continue to increase and that the exports generated will grow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully accept that foreign language skills are vitally important.  The fact that a considerable amount of business is carried out in English is an advantage to us.  If business is transacted in another language we require a working knowledge of that language.  There is an obligation on us to impress upon companies the necessity to take advantage of language skills but it does not come within the ambit of these programmes.  It is a <Col N="864" /> matter I will discuss with the Minister to establish whether we can be of assistance.</P>

        <i>(Donegal South-West)</i>: The recent currency crisis once again highlighted the vulnerability of those indigenous firms who depend on price-competitiveness to win market share. The reality of our geographical location on the periphery of Europe and the small size of our domestic market mean that businesses which compete mainly in price will find it very difficult to achieve the necessary economies of scale which will enable them to trade competitively.  The solution for such firms must be to seek market segments where they can compete on the basis of differentiated product which can give value to the customer in terms of higher quality or better service or some other non-price factor.</P>

    <P>Market-driven product design and development can be a key element in enhancing a company's competitive edge.  An Bord Tráchtála operates five specialised programmes in the area of design and product development to help companies exploit the many opportunities created by rapidly changing technology and shifting market trends.  The individual company advisory programme provides confidential and impartial advice on the improvement of existing products, packaging or promotional literature.  The group development programme <Col N="867" /> facilitates the gathering of design and market information for groups of firms with common marketing objectives and needs.  Through this programme consultants prepare product, merchandising and packaging concepts. Costs are shared between the participating firms and the agency.  The design intelligence programme gathers design intelligence and forecast information in a number of product areas, notably apparel, knitwear and fabrics. Seasonally or annually, information is communicated to companies through publications, workshops or seminars. The design audit programme provides an expert, impartial assesment of a company's existing design activities, along with an evaluation of current products, packaging, sales literature and promotional print.  Costs are shared between An Bord Tráchtála and the participating firms.  Finally, under the advanced products programme product concepts are developed for market research and testing.</P>
    <P>The programme provides funded design and product development consultancy, typically involving up to 20 man-days of work by qualified specialist consultants.  To participate in this scheme, companies undergo assessment to determine their capability to benefit from significant product development work.  Consultancy fees are paid by An Bord Tráchtála with a contribution from the participating companies.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Donegal South-West)</i>: Absolute priorities for the next round of Structural Funds for the tourism sector, including the maritime leisure industry, will be determined in the light of available funds.  It is clear that there is a need for increased funds for marketing certain infrastructural improvements in the areas of roads and sanitary services, and for some large scale anchor projects.  The Deputy also referred to the large conference centre catering for up to 1,000 delegates.  It is for the Minister to formulate a development plan and he is in the process of doing that.  He has consulted with and taken advice from the industry.  We have to await a decision before we know exactly what the allocation and priorities will be.</P>
      <P>In considering large scale projects we should consider the 40 per cent assisted under the Operational Programme 1989-93 which involved investments in excess of £0.5 million each.  A further 21 per cent were between £1 million and £5 million and 2 per cent or eight projects involved were investments in excess of £5 million each.  There is a perception that there were not sufficient large scale projects. There has to be a reasonable balance between the anchor and the smaller projects.  I hope that the balance will be incorporated in the tourism plan.</P>

Is the Minister aware that 66 per cent of tourists come here between May <Col N="871" /> and September and that the rest come between September and March?  To extend our season to the shoulder and off-peak season we need these anchor projects.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate if the Government will present a shopping list of tourism products with the national plan in view of the fact that over £300 million will be committed to tourism under the next programme?  If there is to be a shopping list there should now be consultation with the various tourism interests.</P>

We could have a reduced number of projects, all large scale, but that might not be advantageous to some areas.  There should be a balance. I agree that some larger projects would help to extend the season and would ensure greater profitability for the tourism industry.</P>
      <P>The shopping list is under consideration. It is a matter for the Minister but I believe a specific shopping list would tie our hands for the next five years.  We should talk in general terms and then look at the specific aims.</P>

I think we should await the outcome of the investigations. I am quite sure the Minister will ensure that all appropriate steps are taken.  If it is proven that it is a fraud and the case should be pursued in the courts, then that will happen.  An Bord Tráchtála obtained a High Court injunction preventing the assets of the suspect firms being reduced in order not to prejudice the recovery of payments which may have been misappropriated.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977 was enacted by the Oireachtas in April, 1977. The Act provides that dismissal is unfair unless there are substantial grounds which would justify such dismissal.  It provides a system under which claims of unfair dismissal can be investigated impartially by a Rights Commissioner or by the Employment Appeals Tribunal. It also provides for redress for unfair dismissal, reinstatement, re-engagement or compensation for financial loss.  The Bill before this House today amends the 1977 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill contains the following main changes to the 1977 Act: extension of the coverage of the Act to include persons employed through employment agencies; access to protection under the Act in the case of the termination of certain second or subsequent fixed term and fixed purpose employment contracts; a new basic award of up to four weeks' pay where the dismissal of an employee is found to have been unfair but where no financial loss has been incurred; extension of the list of grounds for dismissal which are deemed to be automatically unfair to include the sexual orientation of the employee, the age of the employee and <Col N="914" /> the employee's membership of the travelling community; improved claims and appeal procedures with the Employment Appeals Tribunal and clarification of the role of the Circuit Court in relation to the enforcement of tribunal determinations.</P>
    <P>I will deal with each of these changes in more detail in the course of my introductory remarks.  The commitment to bring forward this Bill formed part of the Programme for a Partnership Government.  I am pleased, so early in the term of the Government, to be able to introduce it in the House.  The review of the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977 has shown it to be a most effective piece of legislation.  The legislation continues, in the main, to meet the need for a fair, inexpensive and relatively speedy remedy for employees who have suffered unfair dismissal.</P>
    <P>Prior to 1977 there were, basically, two avenues open to employees for resolving the issue of an unfair dismissal. One route was the invariably costly and characteristically tardy legal remedy at common law.  The other avenue of redress was instant industrial action, repeated recourse to which obviously was prejudicial not only to the enterprise involved but also to the public good.</P>
    <P>This was the context within which the Unfair Dismissals Act of 1977 &mdash; referred to throughout the Bill as the Principal Act &mdash; was set.  The introduction of that legislation reduced significantly the number of days lost due to industrial disputes arising from unfair dismissal. The proportion of such disputes as a percentage of all disputes has fallen from 20 per cent in 1976, the year before the introduction of the Act, to about 10 per cent a year since then and, in some years, the statistic has been as low as 7 or 8 per cent.  This fact, taken in conjunction with the number of claims made under provisions of the Act, suggests that the Act has played a major role in reducing industrial relations tensions.  Those who criticise the provisions of the Act seldom advert to this positive impact the Act has had on industrial relations.</P>
    <P>Listening to some of the commentators <Col N="915" /> in this field one might get the impression that, prior to enactment of the 1977 Act, there had been no legal framework governing the termination of employment contracts.  This, of course, was not the actual state of affairs.  The contract between the parties in the employment relationship was and, indeed, continues to be governed by the common law rules relating to contract.  The difficulty of employees in exercising such rights had more to do with the problem of access to the common law courts than with any lack of clarity about their entitlements. Indeed, as headline cases in the employment law area in this country have shown in recent years, employees &mdash; even in the public service &mdash; have been able to secure judgments and significant financial compensation for wrongful dismissal through the courts.  Unfamiliarity with court practice and precedents and, most importantly, the likely costs involved have in the past acted as effective barriers to many employees, especially to those on low wages, in pursuing their rights by this avenue.</P>
    <P>The 1977 unfair dismissals legislation modified and enhanced existing common law rights but, more importantly, gave ready access to redress for the broad range of employees who had formerly been intimidated by the intricacies and economics of the common law process. Thus, the greater degree of access to redress afforded by the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, is the main factor that distinguishes it from the historically available common law remedy.</P>
    <P>The need for the type of protection provided by the Unfair Dismissals Act is illustrated by the number of cases referred under the 1977 Act to the Employment Appeals Tribunal for adjudication.  In the period 1984-91, inclusive, a total of 7,751 direct claims of alleged unfair dismissal was dealt with by the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  Of these, the appeal was allowed in 1,734 cases and disallowed in 2,414 cases.  The balance was made up of cases which were either disposed of without a hearing or withdrawn during a hearing.  In cases <Col N="916" /> where dismissal has been found to be unfair &mdash; and compensation has been decided upon as the remedy &mdash; the average amount of such compensation has risen from £1,864 in 1984 to £2,660 in 1991.  In 1991, the size of such awards ranged from less than £100 to £15,000 in the light of the circumstances of individual cases.</P>
    <P>The 1977 Act is not concerned with all dismissals but is focused on unfair dismissals.  An unfair dismissal is one where no substantial grounds can be shown as justifying the dismissal.  This point was raised in the Seanad, in the context of possible amendments.  Let us be clear that dismissals arising because of redundancy, rationalisation or other organisational reasons fall outside the scope of the legislation.  Similarly, the dismissal by an employer of employees because of incompetence, serious misconduct, inefficiency etc., is not restricted by the legislation &mdash; as all these are substantial grounds which justify termination of employment.  In addition, all dismissals in the case of employees with less than one year's service, with the exception of dismissals based on grounds of pregnancy or trade union activity, are excluded from the coverage of the Act.</P>
    <P>Having said that, everyone &mdash; employee or not &mdash; has a right to be treated in a reasonable and evenhanded manner.  As we are all aware, there is a contract between the parties to an employment relationship which is governed by the rules relating to contract law.  As with contract law generally, a contract of employment cannot, without penalty, be terminated by one party without the consent of the other.  Both parties have obligations under a contract of employment, one of the most important being that the parties must act in a fair and reasonable way towards one another. Indeed &mdash; as the unfair dismissals legislation recognises &mdash; summary dismissal of an employee by an employer is permissible where the conduct of the employee has been so extreme as to irreparably damage the employment relationship.  In general, however, the 1977 Act imposes an obligation on an <Col N="917" /> employer to deal with an unsatisfactory employee in a manner which is procedurally fair and reasonable.  This ethos in the legislation reflects the common law rule of natural justice which applies in the courts of the land in regard to contract law generally.  It may seem that I am covering ground already covered in the 1977 Act but as I am outlining the amendments to that Act it is useful to go over it again.</P>
    <P>The Unfair Dismissals Act has had an impact on employers and on how they manage the conflict that is likely to arise in dealing with an unsatifactory employee.  Since 1977, there has been evidence of increased codification of disciplinary procedures which have no small part to play in the sensitive handling of dismissals which may be necessary from time to time.  These changes will, no doubt, have had financial implications for employers.  I suggest, however, that such costs have been well outweighed by the resultant benefits in industrial relations terms.  An important benefit, too, for employees flowing from such improved systems is the realisation that they need not fear the possibility of arbitrary unfair dismissal.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset while the 1977 Act has been working satisfactorily, the length of time it has been on the Statute Book suggested that a review of its contents would be worthwhile.  In this context a discussion document was published in November 1987.  The document outlined possible options which might be considered in three specific areas of our employment protection legislation namely: (i) unfair dismissal, (ii) employment equality and (iii) payment of wages. In relation to (iii), as Deputies will be aware, a new Payment of Wages Act was enacted in 1991.  As regards (ii) the present Bill results from consultations and discussions with both sides of industry and other organisations interested in the operation of our unfair dismissals legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill is in line with an undertaking in the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-1997</i>&ldquo;to amend and improve the working of the Unfair Dismissals <Col N="918" /> legislation&rdquo; and also fulfils a commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>In promoting this legislation, I am conscious that the Programme for a Partnership Government commits this Administration to a review of labour legislation to ensure that it extends full protection against discrimination to a range of minority and disadvantaged groups.  Among the possible grounds for discrimination listed in the programme for inclusion in the review are parental status, religion, age, handicap, race, colour, sexual orientation and national or ethnic origin, including membership of the travelling community.</P>
    <P>That review falls within the brief of my colleague, Deputy Taylor, Minister for Equality and Law Reform.  I have discussed with him relevant aspects of unfair dismissals legislation which already provide protection in a general way against dismissal on the grounds listed in the programme and designates some of them specifically &mdash; for example, race, religion, colour &mdash; as grounds for automatically unfair dismissal.  Indeed, in the course of passage of this Bill through the Seanad I was pleased to accept amendments which added age and membership of the travelling community to the list of reasons for dismissal which are deemed for the purposes of the legislation to be automatically unfair.</P>
    <P>In this context, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform has indicated to me that, following the review of the equality aspects of labour law, he will promote proposals for legislation framed to ensure full equality of opportunity for all in the workplace.  If necessary, those proposals may incorporate suitable amendments of unfair dismissals legislation.</P>
    <P>Another issue raised in the Seanad &mdash; and which has perplexed us for some time &mdash; is the practice in drafting legislation of using words such as &ldquo;he&rdquo; and &ldquo;him&rdquo; when references to &ldquo;she&rdquo; and &ldquo;her&rdquo; are also intended.  I am advised that this approach is dictated by the provisions of the Interpretation Act, 1937. On this issue, I and I am sure other Members in the House strongly support <Col N="919" /> the recommendation in the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women that this Act be reviewed and amended as soon as possible.  I understand that this will be examined in the context of the Equal Status Bill which is being considered by my colleague, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor.</P>
    <P>The emphasis in the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, and in the Bill before us is on the protection of employees from being unfairly dismissed from their jobs by setting down criteria by which dismissals are to be judged unfair and by providing an adjudication system and redress for an employee whose dismissal has been found to be unjustified.  This objective remains as valid and worthy today as it was in 1977.</P>
    <P>Before proceeding to the sections of the Bill, I should mention that the question of the optimum hours threshold for eligibility for protection under the 1977 Act, set at 18 hours per week in that Act, was a matter of major concern at the time of publication of the 1987 discussion document.  The debate on this issue however has, in practical terms, been overtaken by the enactment of the Worker Protection (Regular Part-time Employees) Act, 1991.  That Act extended the protection of the 1977 Act to regular part-time employees i.e. defined as those who, subject to the one year service requirement, have been in the continuous service of an employer for at least 13 weeks and are normally expected to work for that employer for not less than eight hours a week.</P>
    <P>That is the background or a quick overview of the 1977 Act and the matters which have arisen since then.  I have also outlined the main changes to that Act contained in this Bill, the Unfair Dismissals (Amendment) Bill, 1993.  I will now go on to deal with the Bill section by section.  Members realise that this, by its nature, will be very technical.  I find the technical pieces difficult to come to grips with, particularly in the context of legislation such as this which is essentially concerned with people's rights.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="920" /> I now turn to the provisions in the Bill which provide for changes in the 1977 Act.  While no fundamental alteration to the broad thrust and purpose of the 1977 Act is proposed the Bill addresses a number of important issues of substance relating to the Act and effects a range of technical and administrative amendments.</P>
    <P>Section 1 is a standard interpretation section.  Section 2 makes technical amendments to the definitions of &ldquo;trade union&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Tribunal&rdquo; in the principal Act, the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, and clarifies that an award of reinstatement entitles an employee to benefit from any improvement in terms and conditions of employment which may occur between the date of dismissal and the date of reinstatement.</P>
    <P>Section 3 amends section 2 (2) of the principal Act by inserting a proviso to the exclusion in that subsection from coverage by the Act of certain fixed term or fixed purpose contracts of employment. The proviso will allow a rights commissioner &mdash; the Employment Appeals Tribunal or the Circuit Court, as the case may be &mdash; to examine any second or subsequent fixed term or fixed purpose contract of employment and to take a view as to whether the fixed nature of the contract was wholly or partly for or connected with the avoidance of liability under unfair dismissals legislation.  In such circumstances, a claim for unfair dismissal at the expiry of the contract may be heard in the normal way.  The section also broadens the scope of the legislation to include temporary officers of health boards and deletes the obsolete reference to a committee of agriculture by amending section 2 (1) (j) of the principal Act.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides for certain minor amendments to subsections (1), (2) and (3) of section 5 of the principal Act, the main purpose of which is to ensure consistency of approach in relation to lockout and dismissal as between the principal Act and paragraph 2 of the First Schedule to the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973.</P>
    <P>Section 5 extends the scope of section <Col N="921" /> 6 (2) of the principal Act to include three circumstances: (i) sexual orientation, (ii) age and (iii) membership of the travelling community in the list of reasons for dismissal which are deemed to be automatically unfair for the purposes of the legislation.  Section 5 also provides for a new section 6 (7) of the principal Act to reinforce the concept of procedural fairness by providing that a rights commissioner, the Employment Appeals Tribunal or the Circuit Court, as the case may be, in deciding whether a dismissal is an unfair dismissal, may have regard to the reasonableness or otherwise of the conduct of the employer and to compliance, or failure to comply, by the employer with dismissal procedures or codes of practice.</P>
    <P>Section 6 alters section 7 of the principal Act as follows: paragraph (a) amends section 7 (1) of the principal Act to provide for a new basic financial award for unfair dismissal in certain circumstances. The amendment will allow a rights commissioner &mdash; the Employment Appeals Tribunal or the Circuit Court, as the case may be &mdash; to award compensation &mdash; of up to four weeks' pay &mdash; for unfair dismissal in cases where no financial loss has been incurred by the employee.  Paragraph (b) amends section 7 (2) of the principal Act by clarifying some of the considerations that are required to be taken into account in calculating the amount of compensation payable to an employee who has been unfairly dismissed.  Paragraph (c) inserts a new subsection (2A) in section 7 of the principal Act to provide that, in calculating financial loss, for the purpose of compensation, payments to an employee under the social welfare and income tax codes which arise from an unfair dismissal shall be disregarded.</P>
    <P>Section 7 alters section 8 of the principal Act as follows: paragraph (a) inserts a new subsection (1A) in section 8 of the principal Act which requires that, henceforth, a rights commissioner, the Employment Appeals Tribunal or the Circuit Court, as the case may be in awarding reinstatement, re-engagement or financial compensation in respect of <Col N="922" /> an unfair dismissal must state why either of the other two forms of redress are not awarded; amends section 8 (2) of the principal Act to allow flexibility to a rights commissioner &mdash; the Employment Appeals Tribunal or Circuit Court, as the case may be &mdash; to extend the time limit for hearing a claim for redress for unfair dismissal to up to 12 months in cases where exceptional circumstances have prevented the lodgment of the claim within the normal time limit of six months; amends section 8 (3) of the principal Act to provide a time limit of 21 days for objections by a party to a hearing of a claim by a rights commissioner; amends section 8 (4) of the principal Act to allow the Employment Appeals Tribunal to issue a determination confirming the recommendation of a rights commissioner in circumstances where the employer concerned has neither implemented the recommendation nor appealed the case.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (b) amends section 8 (5) of the principal Act to permit a party to make a claim directly to the Employment Appeals Tribunal without reference, in the first instance, to a rights commissioner as required by the present wording of the section.  Paragraph (c) amends section 8 (9) of the principal Act to increase the fine from £20 &mdash; as set in 1967 under redundancy legislation &mdash; to £1,000 for failure to attend before the Employment Appeals Tribunal, refusal to give evidence or failure or refusal to produce documents.  It is necessary that the fine should be sufficiently high to act as a deterrent.  Quite obviously the deterrent set in 1967 is completely out of date.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (d) amends section 9 (10) of the principal Act to prohibit explicitly the processing of a claim-dispute both under unfair dismissals legislation and by a rights commissioner or the Labour Court under industrial relations legislation.  The paragraph also inserts new subsections (11) and (12) into section 8 of the principal Act.  These subsections provide that in the case of a contract of employment tainted with illegality the employee shall, nonetheless, be entitled to redress for <Col N="923" /> unfair dismissal.  In such cases the rights commissioner &mdash; the Employment Appeals Tribunal or the Circuit Court, as the case may be &mdash; shall notify the Revenue Commissioners or the Minister for Social Welfare, as appropriate, of the matter.</P>
    <P>Section 8 amends section 9 (2) of the principal Act by increasing from six weeks to seven weeks the time within which a copy of a notice of appeal must be given by the Employment Appeals Tribunal to the other party to the appeal. Administrative problems have been encountered by the tribunal under the existing provision in the case of appeals lodged at the last minute.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides for some minor technical amendments to section 14 of the principal Act.</P>
    <P>Section 10 amends section 15 of the principal Act to allow flexibility to an employee in changing a claim as between redress in common law or under unfair dismissals legislation.  The amendment will allow a claimant flexibility as to which avenue of redress to pursue &mdash; without losing his-her right to proceed under the alternative avenue &mdash; up until the point where, on the one hand, a recommendation of a rights commissioner has issued in the case &mdash; or a hearing of the claim by the Employment Appeals Tribunal has commenced &mdash; or, a hearing in the courts under the common law has commenced.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides an avenue of appeal to the Circuit Court from a determination of the tribunal.  In cases where an employer fails to implement an order made by the Circuit Court on appeal or a determination of the tribunal &mdash; which has not been appealed &mdash; the section allows the employee concerned, or the Minister on behalf of the employee, to apply to the Circuit Court for an order directing the employer to implement the determination.  In such circumstances, the Circuit Court is empowered to make an order against an employer which would include interest on the amount of any financial compensation awarded.  In cases where an order for reinstatement or <Col N="924" /> re-engagement is concerned, the Circuit Court may direct the employer to pay to the employee financial compensation in respect of the period during which the employer failed to implement the order of re-instatement or re-engagement.  The section provides also that the Circuit Court may change the nature of an award from re-engagement or reinstatement to financial compensation.</P>
    <P>Section 12 deals with evidence in relation to the prosecution of a person for failure to attend before the Employment Appeals Tribunal or refusal to give evidence or failure or refusal to produce necessary documents.  The section specifies that a document signed by the chairman or a vice-chairman of the tribunal, stating details of the alleged offence, shall be admitted by the court as evidence of the matters so stated without further proof.</P>
    <P>Section 13 extends the scope of the unfair dismissals legislation to include persons employed through employment agencies.  For the purposes of the legislation, the organisation where the person works is deemed to be the employer of the agency worker.</P>
    <P>Section 14 replaces section 6 (7) of the principal Act.  In an effort to respond to difficulties identified in relation to the understanding and identification in the Act of this section, the provision has been redrafted.  As before, the purpose of the section remains to confirm the application of the protection of the legislation to employees dismissed for trade union activity who would otherwise not be covered because of their failure to satisfy the minimum one year service requirement or because of certain exclusion relating to training, probation and apprenticeship.</P>
    <P>Section 15 provides that in cases where a business is transferred to another owner, the acceptance and retention of a redundancy payment on the part of an employee will break that employee's continuity of service.</P>
    <P>Section 16 repeals section 10 of the principal Act, which is overtaken by the provisions of section 11 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 17 is a standard provision dealing <Col N="925" /> with the short title, collective citation, construction, commencement and application of the Bill.  The Bill now specifies 1 October, 1993 as the date for coming into operation of the legislation.  We had hoped that the operative date would have been 1 July 1993.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I would like to make a few comments on what I see as a moral issue at the heart of the Unfair Dismissals Act.  The legislation allows for third party scrutiny of the fairness, or otherwise, of the treatment of employees by employers in the matter of dismissal. The availability of such independent scrutiny in dispute situations is, I believe, the mark of a civilised society.  I would be surprised if, in this day and age, there are many who would support the former practice of employers to hire and fire, virtually at will.  Indeed, the evidence is there that, even before the 1977 Act, industrial muscle and the common law process had been utilised successfully to ensure, as far as possible, an effective means of redress where unfair dismissal was concerned.  The 1977 Act placed a greater emphasis on the achievement of a resolution of these difficulties by more peaceful means.  It is my strong view in industrial relations matters that, at all times &ldquo;jaw jaw&rdquo; is better than &ldquo;war war&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is central to our industrial policy that we have a fair and acceptable code of employment rights legislation.  The existence of satisfactory statutory unfair dismissals machinery is an important element in this context.  We should not expect our workforce to accept arbitrary dismissal without an effective means of redress while, at the same time, remaining as committed, flexible and motivated producers of the wealth on which the future of our country depends.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the contributions of Members on all sides.  We debated this Bill in the Seanad during past weeks where it provoked very lively and stimulating debate.  I look forward to the same in this House.  I intend to be present up to midday tomorrow for Seanad Stage and for the entire Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="926" /> There are always people who will say that legislation such as this is weighted in favour of one side and there will be people who will take opposing points of view.  I hold the view, as I know most Members do, that it is correct and proper that we enact labour legislation because we always seek a proper balance.  I do not hold the view that legislation which gives decent rights to people should not be enacted when times are difficult.  A workforce is better motivated, more productive and in better tune with the realities of the day when they know their proper rights are guaranteed; likewise employers knowing the scope of legislation and all the principal features of it are more assured in an industrial relations climate.  Accordingly I commend the Bill to the House and I look forward to the contributions.</P>

      <P>The Unfair Dismissals (Amendment) Bill, 1993, is by and large a welcome and reforming measure.  It updates and amends the 1977 Unfair Dismissals Act.  It honours the Government's commitment given in section 9 of the <i>programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
      <P>As the Fine Gael spokeswoman on labour I welcome the Bill and will be proposing some amendments.  I hope the Minister has not exhausted in the Seanad her willingness to concede amendments. We will certainly press her on some important issues to concede further.  We shall be raising some new matters also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall begin where the Minister finished. Because this is my first opportunity to speak as spokeswoman on labour I would like to outline my philosophy of labour relations to the House.  It is very similar to that of the Minister.  I consider the working life is important to human happiness and to self respect, whatever the nature and level of employment.  A valued, adequately paid and trusted employee is likely to be a highly productive, reliable and contented worker. There are those, to whom the Minister referred in her closing remarks, who suggested that high standards of worker protection, <Col N="927" /> conditions and rights somehow lead to fewer employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>During the past three years we in Fine Gael have studied the jobs crisis from every angle in round table discussions with employers, economists and welfare specialists and no employer there seriously claimed that such legislation prevented them taking on an employee. Yet it is a view that is regularly and, seemingly, seriously trotted out.  I welcome the fact that the Minister in her speech to the Seanad challenged this notion and I know that the studies available to the Minister support Fine Gael's analysis of the situation.</P>
    <P>In her contribution in the Seanad the Minister referred to a UCD study, published in 1987, on the impact of the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, on workplace industrial relations which was very positive in relation to its impact.  She referred also to a 1986 survey commissioned by the Department of Labour.  That study found that practically none of the firms surveyed saw the legislation as one of the main problems facing them and only a small minority cited it as having caused a problem in the previous year.  The view from other studies was that it had contributed to improving personnel practices and to a more stable industrial relations climate.  I share that view and, indeed, it has led to more professionalism in the managing of employment.  That is something which we in this House should seek to develop and encourage rather than stunt.</P>
    <P>It has long since struck me that the economies that have performed well and have been most productive have included Germany and the Scandinavian countries where conditions of pay and employment and social welfare are among the best in the world.  It is interesting also to look at the Far East, the new engine room of the world economy.  While one could not say that workers' conditions and pay there are all that we would desire, they do have something different in that the Japanese and Taiwanese understand how to look after the workforce.  The factory is much more than a workplace, it is a way of <Col N="928" /> life for them in many cases.  This mutual commitment yields results for owners and workers.  In Taiwan where holiday entitlements are less than in Ireland, many workers never take them up entirely.  That is a philosophical approach that we will never have any problem with and I am not encouraging or expecting it.  It is an interesting point, but on the other hand the employer provides medical services, sporting facilities and in a country where a profound housing shortage exists one can sometimes reside on the factory campus.</P>

      <P>For Irish managers and workers a session of Tai Chi eastern shadow boxing at the start of the day might improve the industrial relations climate rather more than our approach to business.  The culture and philosophy of the East reinforces a holistic approach to work.  I shun an approach that doles out improvements in conditions to workers frugally and cautiously.  With rights come obligations.  The unfair dismissals legislation clarified not just when and how it was wrong to dismiss but how and in what circumstances one could dismiss.</P>
      <P>If a person becomes an employer, learning responsibly and professionally to manage his or her staff should be a primary responsibility not to be shirked or moaned about but to be tackled. Unfortunately, this is an attitude that gets little support at times of economic hardship.  There is a very special problem in achieving this desirable objective for small businesses.  They, in particular, cannot afford large personnel departments or do not have the time to train in this area, a critical information gap exists for them.  The Minister could play a role here.  Some of the money now expended on the IMI and other training activities could go, via IBEC and other small business associations, towards making low cost training courses on the topic of labour laws available, particularly to small businessmen.  Every &ldquo;start your own business&rdquo; course run by FAS should contain a substantial unit on these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="929" /> Every person registering with the Departments of Social Welfare and Finance as an employer should be provided with an information leaflet.  This is essential as the Bill contains a new provision on procedural fairness, whereby even justifiable dismissals could be overturned as a result of failure to follow the correct procedure.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister might mention to the Minister for Education that labour law should be included in personal development courses in secondary schools.  This would promote good workmanship and good management as everybody would have information about the rights and responsibilities of being a worker or employer.  None of these areas has been adequately addressed to date. In my experience good professional management, working with experienced and intelligent union representatives, creates a working environment which produces the goods for both.  Sloppiness at many levels is the scourage of Irish industry and, at a political level, we should not tolerate whining at lower standards but expect higher standards and help to achieve them.</P>
    <P>I welcome the amendment to the 1977 Act.  Indeed, my admiration for the 1977 Act led me to become active in politics. The Government of 1973-77 left behind a memorable legacy of labour law and the 1977 rout was particularly unjustified in the year in which the principal Bill became law.</P>
    <P>The 1977 Act defined parameters within which one can act to dismiss fairly and established grounds for compensation and reinstatement where dismissal is unfair.  It clarifies that the employer is free to act, but only within clear parameters while offering protection to all employees regardless of whether they are organised.</P>
    <P>There has been a significant number of cases taken under the Act but one of the very positive outcomes has been that industrial relations have matured and that a good, firm, sound practice has developed based on prevention rather than cure.  The stages in the unfair dismissals procedure can and have been <Col N="930" /> used to bring about improvements in performance by employees.  The Act has balanced rights and obligations.  However, there are occasions when there are unfair dismissals and this legislation seeks to resolve the difficulties that have emerged in relation to the inadequacies of the 1977 Act, 16 years after its initiation.  As a result of the tremendous changes in the working environment it is clear that no Bill, however good, could survive without being updated.</P>
    <P>Another major benefit of the 1977 Act was the separation of unfair dismissals disputes from the procedure for settlement of other labour disputes.  It has greatly reduced, although not eliminated, the incidence of industrial action associated with individual cases.  In 16 years much has changed in the work environment.  The secure job has become the exception rather than the norm and contract, temporary and other new forms of employment have become much more common.  There is evidence that, as a result, some workers are losing the protection afforded by the 1977 Act.  This will be corrected and I wholeheartedly support this.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael welcomes in particular the proposals in the Bill to extend the scope of the Act to agency workers and fixed term contracts in certain circumstances. In relation to agency workers the Minister is probably aware that IBEC in particular and other groups have asked for further clarification of how that will apply and we will look more closely at that at a later Stage of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I very much welcome the decision to include sexual orientation among the grounds for unfair dismissal and the additional grounds conceded by the Minister in the Seanad of age and membership of the travelling community. Other areas should be included.  A view by the trade unions and by the women's groups is that the issue of dismissal on grounds of pregnancy and associated problems has not been adequately resolved here.  There is some difficulty in following all the arguments put forward in the Seanad because the Committee Stage debate is not yet available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am relying on a number of fairly reliable sources.  That issue has been inadequately addressed and it is important to address it in the context of this Bill where the onus of proof in each case is on the employer, whereas under other legislation the onus of proof is on the claimant.  Dealing with a case under this legislation can sometimes produce a fairer result than pursuing it under other legislation.  I am sure many of us will argue that with conviction and it is one of the areas on which I hope the Minister will concede.</P>
      <P>Another welcome proposal is the provision of a new basic award.  It acknowledges what many speakers in the Seanad said about dismissal which is that regardless of whether there is a financial loss, there is a huge loss of dignity, shock, disruption and disappointment, not just for the individual but for the whole family.  However, unions and employers have pointed out that as it is framed new anomalies will arise in that people who are at a small financial loss could end up receiving less compensation than those who did not suffer a financial loss but who qualified for the basic award.  Perhaps we can look at that again when we are examining the Bill in more detail.</P>
      <P>The proposal to deal with the deduction of social welfare payments and tax rebates in the calculation of financial loss is welcome.  I gather that proposals were put forward in the Seanad by an employer representative there in his capacity as Senator about which the Minister spoke positively but they do not seem to have been adopted here.  I would like to know the Minister's intentions in relation to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a welcome for the removal of the difficulty created by contracts tainted with illegality.  Some of the employer groups have questioned whether persons who collude in relation to this should qualify for the protection of the Act. Although I do not take a rigid position on this, those matters should be pursued under the other relevant revenue Acts <Col N="932" /> and the employment rights should remain based on the qualifying period deemed appropriate.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the clarification on the question of a lockout being defined as a dismissal if an employee is not reinstated when it is over.  However, we are concerned that the Bill, as drafted, does not include proposals for the reform of the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  The Minister indicated the number of cases which come before the tribunal, it is largely a part-time agency with a variety of chairmen, each with two assessors. The number of people involved, all on a part-time basis, begs the question whether the time has come for a full reform of the tribunal to set it up as a permanent establishment for the sake of greater clarity and professionalism.  We should ensure that those charged with the onerous task of making important decisions have broad knowledge and experience in that area.  It would certainly be easier to train adequately a core group of skilled people than a large group of persons who give a relatively small amount of time to such work and who are drawn from many and varied walks of life.</P>
    <P>My colleagues in the Seanad argued for an appeals system separate from the courts.  They are raising important issues. That proposal was argued productively in the Seanad in terms of a likely response, and, therefore, I will not press the matter here.  However, I would be interested in the Minister's views on the employment appeals system and redress to the courts which can involve a case being taken from the Circuit Court right up to the Supreme Court.  By and large many of the groups who have made representations to us seem to be relatively content with an appeal to the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>If this Bill is to be of maximum assistance to employees &mdash; those it is meant to protect &mdash; it should be accessible to them. By choosing to amend the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, we now have a body of legislation added to other legislation.  We are talking about ordinary employees who are trying to come to terms with their rights under the law.  Having spent <Col N="933" /> 12 or 13 years in this House I still have to sit down and work my way carefully through legislation in order to understand it.</P>
    <P>Of all the legislation I can think of, the Bill before us is one that should be urgently and speedily consolidated.  Some groups have argued for a consolidation of all labour law into a single booklet, but the consolidation of the two pieces of legislation would have been a more desirable approach.  I hope the Minister will make a commitment as soon as possible to ensure that information relating to the protection of employees is made available as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not address adequately a number of problems that arise in regard to employees who are pregnant and in regard to the private lives of employees. There have been some very high profile cases where the private life of an employee was used as a basis for dismissal.  Amendments in this regard were tabled in the Seanad but I am not aware as to whether they were reached or, if they were reached, whether they were pressed. Such matters should be dealt with in this legislation.</P>
    <P>An outstanding issue of concern relates to workers' representatives, I am not sure that section 5 deals adequately with the matter of selection for redundancy.  That matter is clear where there is an agreed procedure in a company, but where there is not, the practice of allowing the employer to select is the norm.  Section 5 refers to this but I would like the Minister to clarify whether it proposes some fairer means of selection than that of an employer which can be based on any number of criteria.  Where there is no agreed procedure in place, can we be sure that the selection for redundancy is fair?</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that it is central to our industrial policy that we have a fair and acceptable code of employment rights legislation and that the existence of satisfactory statutory unfair dismissals machinery is an important element in that context.  I share that view and the proposals, as far as they go, are worthy of our support.  However, I hope the <Col N="934" /> Minister will consider amending the Bill, based on the substantial and rational arguments which we will put forward.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister has received many representations both from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the employers' groups in relation to this Bill. Obviously, those representations were made to the Minister in the past few weeks, but I hope that, based on the Minister's reading of them and the arguments we will put forward, we will see further improvements in the Bill.  Some of the proposals that will be put to the Minister will be conflicting.  For example, IBEC refers to the fact that in Great Britain the protection of such legislation does not apply to small businesses for up to two years whereas ICTU suggests that the qualifying period should be reduced to six months.  The secretarial staff in this House, for example, are made permanent after six months.  I understand that six months is a common period within which people are made permanent employees.  Employees are in a kind of limbo until such time as they are covered by the legislation.  In my view the current period gives even the smallest employer reasonable time in which to consider whether an employee is satisfactory. Indeed, in many cases where there are question marks in regard to an employee's ability, the employer could give him or her a further six month trial period in which to prove satisfactory. Therefore, a one year qualifying period is a reasonable balance in this context although some people may hold a different view.</P>
    <P>The practice of employing workers through agencies has increased substantially here.  The Minister made a clear amendment in this regard.  Nevertheless, I would like her to outline whether research was carried out about that practice. For instance, how often would an agency employee be employed for more than one year?  Regardless of the circumstances, if a person is employed by the same employer for a period of one year he or she should be entitled to all the benefits accruing from this legislation.</P>
    <P>That raises the question regarding payment <Col N="935" /> to an agency who, in turn, pays the employee.  Why was it decided that the obligation should rest on the person on whose premises the employee is working rather than on the agency who, in another sense, is the employer of the person involved?  I would like the Minister to clarify whether the onus should rest on the agency or on the employer.</P>
    <P>In regard to dual remedies, the explanatory memorandum attempts to make it clear that a person may have recourse to only one means of redress at a time.  The section which deals with this in the Bill is less clear and this issue was raised in the Seanad but, again, because the debates are not available, I am at a loss as to the Minister's response.  It appears that action can be taken under the industrial relations Acts, up to an advanced point and only at the point of making an award or a decision must one or other avenue be selected.  Is there duplication in this regard and does it not contradict what the Minister stated to be her intention?</P>
    <P>The Bill does not address the need to reform the Employment Appeals Tribunal and to enact comprehensive legislation on unfair dismissals.  The issue of the treatment of pregnant women is one about which my colleagues and I are deeply concerned.  I hope the Minister has had a re-think on this issue.  Today I heard details of a number of cases where women were dismissed on grounds of their pregnancy due to necessary limitations on their activities in the use of machinery or an unwillingness by employers to facilitate them with less demanding employment.  These are regular and not isolated occurrences.  The effective application of this Bill will be extremely important in relation to that issue.  I would like the message to go from this House that pregnant women should be treated fairly in the workplace and allowed make their valuable contribution to society.</P>
    <P>The issue of trade union membership is not adequately dealt with in the Bill. The Minister indicated that this matter was adequately deal with, even in cases <Col N="936" /> where people were employed for less than 12 months.  Unlike other areas provided for in this Bill the burden of proof in this case rests on the employee to prove that his or her dismissal was related to union membership.  In other sections of the Bill the burden of proof rests on the employer.  The trade unions are concerned that this Bill in failing to resolve this issue is not as comprehensive as it might be.  They have expressed the same concern in relation to redundancies.</P>
    <P>Those are the main points I wish to raise.  I look forward to detailed discussions on this Bill.  I would refer to the 1977 Act which was a milestone in industrial relations legislation.  I hope this amending Bill will be comprehensive and that we will continue the good work in this area.  I would ask the Minister to clarify, in her concluding remarks, whether the commencement date of 1 July is still an achievable target.  It is important that this date be clarified for people who may be applying provisions relating to the Bill.  We support the speedy passage of this legislation.  I hope we will see it amended on Committee Stage and we will work hard to achieve that.  We hope that workers will benefit and that industrial relations will improve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats welcome this Bill.  This type of legislation needs to be updated on a more regular basis than most other legislation, given the changes in the employment market during the last few years and the fact that there is likely to be continuous change in that area.  Our definition of employment is changing dramatically and it will remain flexible for the foreseeable future.  It is important that the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, should be updated. It is the type of legislation that should not be set in tablets of stone.  It should be open to dealing with matters as they change, as established practices become outdated and new ones take over and as working relationships improve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The improvement in industrial relations during the past few years has been tremendous.  Many good work practices have been introduced.  Some Irish <Col N="937" /> companies could compete with the best of foreign companies in respect of the attitude of the workforce and existing industrial relations.  It is important that a legislative framework should be set down to deal with grievance matters and difficulties that arise from time to time, particularly when a person loses his or her job.  It is very traumatic for anyone to lose a job.  I am sure there are politicians who believe that their dismissal was unfair at election time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I had considered applying for unfair dismissal at one stage. Perhaps I could set up a tribunal and chair it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring also to Members who lost their seats.  I do not know whether we can have redress under legislation in this regard or whether it would be wise to seek to do so.  One tends to forget about the trauma, difficulties and social problems faced by families where one of the family members loses his or her job.  It is particularly difficult for families to survive where there is a number of young children of school-going age or where university fees and mortgage repayments must be paid.</P>
      <P>In cases where the main source of income is cut off in a sharp way this can lead to a traumatic time and pose enormous difficulties for those involved. It is very frustrating when one believes one has been unfairly dismissed.  It is necessary that legislation is put in place to redress that balance in those cases. People lose their jobs when the market changes, as happened recently in Digital. Companies close down, trends change and this is not the fault of the workforce or the management.  When one loses one's position at work and believes that one was unfairly dismissed, it is important that this type of legislation is available to bring about a satisfactory and fair outcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Legislation to deal with these matters tends to become a legal quagmire for those involved and it is difficult to know how to counter this.  There is a contradiction and a dichotomy involved in <Col N="938" /> that area.  The Minister made the point that in this legislation, we are dealing with moral issues in respect of how people deal with people.  Common sense should be at the root of this legislation. If common sense is not an obvious thread running through this legislation, as the years go by and other Departments introduce legislation which impinges on this area we will face many difficulties.  This will give rise to problems and the simple manner in which it was intended to deal with the problem will involve a series of legal procedures.  That will require a person to employ solicitors and will involve the whole apparatus of the legal system.  Indeed, as some people take this course of action those who do not will feel inadequate and will feel that unless they take similar action they will not get a fair crack of the whip.  In introducing this legislation and in dealing with this area we must be extremely conscious of the work we are undertaking.  We are dealing with a serious difficulty that arises from time to time in the area of unfair dismissals.  I am glad to see the figures are indicating that the trend is not on the increase and that since the establishment of the Employment Appeals Tribunal there is an improvement in the way these matters are handled.</P>
    <P>Earlier my colleague, Deputy Flaherty, drew attention to the raft of legislation now in existence, that it is likely to increase and that people will be required to go to different arenas to deal with various problems.  We must organise the legislation &mdash; it may not be an area for this Minister to address but for the Minister for Equality and Law Reform &mdash;and examine the type of forum within which we could perhaps centralise many of these questions.  For example, the Rights Commissioner could operate on one level with the Employment Appeals Tribunal operating on the other.</P>
    <P>With the likelihood of growth in this area of legislation we must now tackle the difficulties which may increase greatly in the future.  Because of our involvement in the European Community and the legislation which is constantly <Col N="939" /> generated from Europe and which influences Governments &mdash; much of it very positive &mdash; the question is raised as to how we can cope with this in a way that is beneficial to the individual who is struggling against the system.  We cannot allow the system to become so omnipotent that the person simply cannot see his or her way forward to dealing with it. Serious questions arise in that context which must be examined and I ask the Minister of State when discussing this with her colleagues, particularly the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, to consider how best this question can be addressed.</P>
    <P>One of the questions that has been raised by the free legal aid centres&mdash; and I have no knowledge in this area&mdash; concerns the extension of their services to people who may require advice and legal aid to deal with some of the matters that arise specifically in this area.  I do not have first hand experience of what is taking place in this regard but it would appear that the legal aid centres are dealing with much of this type of legislation and the difficulties that arise therein.  Due recognition should be given to them to deal with this area.  I make that comment as an outside observer because I do not want to see this area become legalised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are to stop the requirement for the growth in that area I would rather see it handled in this way rather than allocating additional funding to the free legal aid centres to deal with these problems.  These two points are fundamentally joined and the way to proceed in this regard is to reduce that requirement.  Dealing with the issue in that way would be better than dealing with it the other way &mdash; on a long term basis&mdash;which would not be in the interest of the individual who would be required to go through such process at a time of trauma.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a number of amendments to be dealt with on Committee Stage.  I do not propose to go into those in detail as <Col N="940" /> the majority of them have been referred to already this afternoon.  However, I welcome in particular in this Bill the recognition of the sexual orientation of a person.  This is aptly timed given the indications from the Minister of State's colleague, the Minister for Justice, of other welcome substantive changes occurring in that area generally.  Discrimination of the type that could be construed in an unfair dismissals case should not be allowed to occur.  Some of the Government's indications in this area are welcome and I am heartened at its approach.  I realise they are only indications at present but they will be welcome when they are put into effect.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister of State concerning the issues of age and the travelling community and she was correct to have accepted the amendments in that regard.  It broadens section 5 of the Bill and gives it a clearer definition.  However, I do not see a definition of religious grounds but perhaps that is covered in the original Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case I am happy. The whole area of people being employed on a part-time basis, on a temporary basis and on contract work must be addressed.  The Bill does not go far enough in that regard because changes have occurred even in the past few months.  Talking to people who I thought were permanent employees of companies I was amazed to discover that they were not permanent employees even though they are employed for quite a long time. The old ideal of permanent employment has been, effectively, eliminated.  The definition and the encompassing of part-time workers, etc., in the context of this Bill must be expanded.  If it is not done in this Bill it will be required to be done in the not too distant future by further legislation.  The fact that the Minister of State is attempting to proceed in this direction in this Bill is an indication of what is happening in the marketplace with regard to how people are employed. The fact that the Minister of State recognises <Col N="941" /> the problems should encourage her to go even further than she has done in the context of the Bill.  It is always those who are the least well off and the least capable that are the most vulnerable and we must be conscious of that when dealing with this type of legislation.  We must ensure so far as is practical that as many people as possible have redress under this legislation.  When we come to Committee Stage I will be exploring how we can enhance the legislation in that area.</P>
      <P>On reading the definition of people who are employed through agencies &mdash; perhaps it is the way I read the legislation &mdash; I understand it to mean companies who recruit staff through these agencies. Many people who work, not for officially defined employment agencies but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in multiples, supermarkets and so on, for example, wine tasters, are employed on an agency basis. People who conduct cookery demonstrations, etc., in supermarkets and multiples are third party employees in the sense that an agency employs them for the manufacturer or producer of the product or for the multiple store.  There could be four potential employers in these circumstances and I am not sure that the Bill covers that point.  However, we will have time to consider that matter later.</P>
      <P>This is a matter with which I have been familiar in the past and difficulties arise in that people are sometimes abused, unfairly treated and unfairly dismissed. Because of the nature of marketing and the importance placed on demonstrations and so on people who are permanently employed for nine or ten months of the year may be unfairly treated.  There are rivalries in some cases, leaving people very vulnerable.  Perhaps this Bill could be extended to provide for these circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Good industrial relations are at the heart of successful companies.  They can make the difference between survival and failure.  If ever a company deserved to succeed it was Digital.  In spite of the fact that the company closed it did much for <Col N="942" /> the country in terms of good industrial relations and the professional manner in which it conducted its business.  I was very proud of and encouraged by that company in terms of industrial relations. Even though it did not succeed we can learn a lot from it.</P>
    <P>The involvement of worker directors in companies is vitally important in this area.  I am sure most people agree there is not sufficient involvement of worker directors&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would be delighted to accept that invitation, I am sure the same applies to my three colleagues.  Emphasis was placed on the question of worker directors some years ago but of late it seems to have slipped back on the agenda.  Communication is very important for good industrial relations. Although this matter does not relate to the Bill it is a fact we should not forget. Companies, indigenous or foreign, developed in the last decade have very good industrial relations.  There is a good understanding of this type of legislation in these companies.  I agree with my colleague that companies setting up concentrate on the grants they will receive, but part of the package of forming a company should be an understanding at management, trade union and employee level, of the rights and redresses available to workers.  Legislation such as this might never be required if there is such an understanding, prevention is better than cure.  Management of new companies should be aware of this legislation as it will lead to good relations and successful companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the provision relating to the four week award even when no financial loss is incurred by employees.  Nobody could construe the receipt of a social welfare payment as a bonus.  In many instances it is not just a question of the money involved but of people's dignity, how people perceive themselves and how <Col N="943" /> they feel they are perceived by others. This is a positive measure by which payment is made even though no financial loss has been incurred to the person wronged.  This is a very sensible approach.  I am concerned that four weeks may not be a sufficient timescale. One could pick any figure &mdash; it is a subjective matter in many respects, but it is an important measure and I welcome its inclusion in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the question of lockouts and people's status in the event of a lock-out.  Abuses may occur in the event of a lock-out, a strike or a company closure where some staff are reinstated while others are not.  That abuse occurred in the past and we would all welcome measures to prevent it.</P>
    <P>The Bill is welcome.  There is always room for improvement in legislation and the fact that the Minister accepted amendments in the Seanad is encouraging. I have always found the Minister reasonable in her approach, particularly when important and sensible amendments are being made.  I look forward to dealing with this Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome this Bill. But many Members will oppose the improvements in the legislation.  They strengthen the rights of workers and clear up many of the defects, some of which may not have been foreseen when the 1977 legislation was enacted.  I welcome the extension of the scope of the legislation to agency workers and to fixed contract workers in certain circumstances. I welcome the inclusion of sexual orientation among the grounds for automatic unfair dismissal, the provision of a new basic award and the new arrangements for the exclusion of social welfare payments and tax rebates in the calculation of compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many respects this is a practitioners' Bill.  It seems to come mainly from the experience of people working the 1977 Act, whether on the trade union side, lawyers, employer organisations, Rights Commissioners or people in the Employment <Col N="944" /> Appeals Tribunal.  The areas of the 1977 legislation which are being amended were identified by people with experience of the 1977 legislation.  The Bill should have gone further in taking account of the very substantial changes in the labour market since 1977.</P>
    <P>The Bill, welcome as it is, seems to come from the era of the &ldquo;job for life&rdquo; days of 1977.  I am not begrudging it and I am making my comments in a positive sense.  The world has changed since 1977 when Jack Lynch told us that any Government that allowed the level of unemployment to reach 100,000 did not deserve to be re-elected.  It is probably accurate to say that no Government has been re-elected, at least not in the form in which it went out, since 1977, so perhaps he was making a prediction.  In any event, the fact that unemployment is now three times the level Jack Lynch would have considered unacceptable in 1977 has very serious implications for what is happening in the labour market and for the relationship between employers and employees.</P>
    <P>The huge pool of surplus labour, one in five of the labour force, now creates a set of circumstances in which the bargaining power of the employee has significantly changed, where it is an employers' market and where the temptation to replace an employee is all the greater.</P>
    <P>Similarly, since 1977 there have been changes in relation to emigration.  In 1977 most people regarded emigration as a dark memory from the 1950s and many of the people who emigrated then returned in 1977 to work here in the new industries. In the intervening time they discovered that having come back to settle themselves and their families here they were faced with a situation in which members of their own families, albeit equipped with the highest academic qualification, had to go abroad to work.  That factor too is giving rise to a significant change in the labour market.</P>
    <P>There has been a huge technological revolution since 1977.  New technologies have affected offices, industries and services. Allied to that there was an ideological <Col N="945" /> revolution, particularly in Britain and the US, which reoriented the thinking between employers and employees, and broke down the kind of social contract that existed in the 1970s which gave rise to the kind of legislation that so excited Deputy Flaherty that she joined Fine Gael, although I recall that the Minister who introduced it was a member of the Labour Party.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Unfair Dismissals Act was enacted in 1977 there was a labour market in which the nature of the employment contract was very different from now.  A job in 1977, by and large, meant 40 hours a week for 40 years at the end of which there would be a pension.  For the most part it was a job likely to be unionised and if it was in one of the new industries it was likely to have been unionised in the form of a preemployment agreement.  The set of relationships and the procedures in 1977 and which the Unfair Dismissals Act assumed&mdash;no longer apply.  Many of the assumptions reflected in the original Act do not now apply, for instance the assumption that there would be a probationary period of one year, and that there would be redundancy procedures.</P>
      <P>There is an assumption in the 1977 Act that normal employment would be based on an agreement between the union and employer regarding selection for redundancy, or that the employment would have been there so long that a custom and practice would have built up.  That no longer applies.  The assumption that led to the two year maximum period on compensation assumed an ability to get alternative employment but that no longer exists.  If one is sacked today one's chances of employment are considerably less than they were in 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The nature of the employment contract is very different.  There has been a growth in part-time employment, fixed term <Col N="946" /> employments, casual employment and various kinds of irregular employment. We even have self-employment which, in theory, is self-employment but which in practice is essentially a relationship between employer and employee.  The building industry is now increasingly using forms of subcontracting and so on. Manual labourers in the building industry are now being contracted as selfemployed people even though the essential relationship they enjoy is of employees.  Because they are, in theory, self-employed, they are completely out of the scope not just of this legislation but of virtually the remainder of the normal employment protection legislation.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the penetration of trade union organisations has changed considerably since 1977.  For example, as a full-time public representative, I am often before the Employment Appeals Tribunal, in front of Rights Commissioners, representing employees who have been sacked or treated unfairly. They are not members of a trade union and, in many cases, never even thought of joining one because they thought the cards were stacked against them.</P>
    <P>There is exploitation of workers at present which needs to be addressed by legislation which takes account of the reality of the varying types of employment contracts.</P>
    <P>For example, in regard to the one year rule, a person is not covered under the provisions of this Bill unless he or she has been in continuous employment, which is unusual nowadays.  Some employers, aware that an employee has one year's continuous employment, try to circumvent the provision by letting the person go for a period and then reemploying him later.  I know that the Bill, in certain circumstances, seeks to remedy that loophole in the case of fixed term contracts.  I also know that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions made a recommendation that the 12 months should be reduced to six which is the kind of normal, accepted probationary period in employee relations generally.  There should be a general provision in the Bill &mdash;something we might address on Committee <Col N="947" /> Stage &mdash; which would allow for a dismissal to be examined irrespective of the period of employment of an employee or the nature of the employment contract, but which would recognise the rights of employers to a probationary period to assess the suitability of an employee.  A greater degree of flexibility should be given to Rights Commissioners and the Employment Appeals Tribunal to assess whether a dismissal was unfair.  Members have come across many cases of dismissals which were patently unfair but which could not be processed as an unfair dismissal because of the time limitation.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers referred to the need to consolidate the present employment legislation and referred to the tendency of the overall area of employment legislation to be increasingly the preserve of lawyers and legalised in that way</P>
    <P>FLAC and the Coolock Community Law Centre summarised the position in their submission as follows:</P>
    <P>It is to be regretted that this Bill has made no attempt to standardise procedures in labour law matters.  An employee who finishes work may have a claim under up to ten different pieces of legislation for wages, holiday pay, notice pay or a claim against the Insolvency Fund.  Yet, different procedures operate in several forums for each claim which may arise out of the one dismissal.  For example a claim for unfair dismissal can be brought before a Rights Commissioner or the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  Yet a claim under the Payment of Wages Act, 1991 must be brought only before a Rights Commissioner.  Furthermore a claim under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973 must be made before the Employment Appeals Tribunal and cannot be heard by a Rights Commissioner.  Moreover, if an employee wishes to appeal a notice pay determination he is obliged to go to the High Court on a point of law, yet where the appeal is against a decision <Col N="948" /> under the Unfair Dismissals Act, he has to go to the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder that so much of labour law has begun to slip into the domain of the legal profession, for whom it was never intended?  There is a very strong argument for the consolidation of labour legislation.  I disagree with Deputy Flaherty, it is necessary to go beyond simply consolidating the two Unfair Dismissals Acts of 1977 and 1991 because, quite clearly, many of the definitions and procedures of the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973, the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967, and so on are inter-related.</P>
    <P>A number of areas have been mentioned as being in need of additional attention under the provisions of this Bill. Pregnancy was mentioned by previous speakers, the most obvious difficulty, particularly in relation to the Maternity (Protection of Employees) Act, 1981, is the requirement of an employee to give four weeks' notice before going back to work.  I have come across many cases, certainly in the early days after the implementation of the provisions of the Maternity (Protection of Employees) Act, 1981, when people did not even realise they had to give four weeks' notice to their employer of their intention to return to work and employers used that provision to avoid taking such employees back.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions referred to section 6 (2) of the principal Act and wonders whether its provisions comply with the EC Directive on Pregnancy.  That area needs to be explored in greater depth on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The question of trade union membership has also been referred to by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  It draws attention to the extent to which the burden of proof is placed on the employee.  For example, if people are dismissed for trade union membership and want to pursue a case on those grounds, they must prove they were dismissed for being a member or for having been active in a trade union, which is virtually impossible.  Many employers <Col N="949" /> have tended &mdash; both in the area of trade union membership and generally in the operation of the provisions of the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977 &mdash; to find ways of shifting the burden of proof to the employee.  The classic case would be where an employer claims it was not a dismissal.  The first thing that happens, is that the relevant employee must establish that there had been a dismissal in the first place.  In the implementation of the provisions of the 1977 Act there has been an increasing tendency on the part of employers, obviously advised by legal people, to attempt to find ways to shift the burden of proof to the employee. As soon as the question of trade union membership is mentioned in an appeal &mdash;it may not constitute total grounds for dismissal although it may be a substantial part thereof &mdash; the employers' side will say that the case is based on trade union membership and that, therefore, the burden of proof is on the employee.  That is very difficult to prove.</P>
    <P>A number of areas have been mentioned in which unfair dismissals will take place &mdash; discrimination against, say, members of the travelling community or on grounds of age, religion, sexual orientation and so on.  I am surprised that discrimination on political grounds was not included.  Perhaps that area needs to be addressed, indeed in all employment. It also needs to be dealt with in the context of participation in politics.  I know that a debate took place in the Seanad on the whole question of dismissal on grounds of membership of the Oireachtas.  That is a matter about which I would have much to say if I had the time.</P>

      <P>I recall that when I was dismissed on the grounds that I was a member of the Oireachtas I did not feel that my rights as a citizen, protected under electoral legislation, had been infringed but rather my rights as an employee which I would have expected to be protected under employment legislation. Similarly, dismissal on the grounds of trade union membership is not dealt with in industrial relations legislation but in legislation dealing with dismissals. Furthermore, it is now proposed that dismissal on the grounds of sexual orientation should be dealt with not in the legislation which will be introduced by the Minister for Equality and Law Reform and under which homosexuality will be decriminalised but in employment legislation.  The issue should be dealt with in this legislation, and I ask the Minister of State to think again before&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of dismissal on the grounds of one's behaviour outside the place of employment also needs to be addressed in this legislation.  Reference has been made to the Flynn case which is probably the best known case where an employee was dismissed on the grounds of their conduct outside the place of employment.  There is a need for an amendment to the legislation which <Col N="951" /> would define the conduct on which somebody could be dismissed.  We do not want a situation &mdash; and this appears to be the case at present &mdash; where what one does in one's personal life is taken into account by an employer in coming to a decision to dismiss what is subsequently upheld by the Unfair Dismissals Tribunal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that but the problem in this case is the legislation. While I understand all of the arguments made in that case, the issue that needs to be addressed is the extent to which one's behaviour and conduct outside the place of employment can be used by an employer to justify dismissal.  I recall that a person was dismissed because he had been convicted of poaching, not trade union members&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>He had been convicted of poaching.  The employer said that he would get a bad reputation as an employer because there was a conviction against the person concerned and he produced all kinds of reasons to justify dismissal and succeeded in having it upheld.  Therefore there is a need to strike a balance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of selection for redundancy has been raised.  I am disappointed that in her own contribution the Minister of State ruled out dismissals on the grounds of redundancy, rationalisation or other organisational reasons.  The provision in the redundancy legislation is being widely abused.  I suspect that if the Minister of State was to take her own case which, as she indicated earlier, she might wish to take she could well find that reasons such as reorganisation, rationalisation or some other euphemism which is widely used now in the employment area would be used to justify dismissal. The Redundancy Payments Act dates back to 1946.  The problem is that, because of technological changes, it is <Col N="952" /> much easier to justify redundancy on the grounds of rationalisation and reorganisation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of health is omitted from the legislation.  I am thinking in particular of those people who have been dismissed following heart surgery or heart attacks.  In this regard I recall the case of a bus driver who had a heart attack but made a full recovery.  The employer claimed that the contract of employment was being frustrated and he could no longer have confidence that the person would be able to do the job properly because of his illness.  I have also come across cases of general workers in local authorities who, while they held temporary positions, sought permanent positions but were told that they would not be insured and could not be offered permanent employment because their cholesterol levels were high or they were suffering from a heart-related illness.  The question of dismissal on the grounds of health needs to be addressed in this legislation to prevent employers claiming in respect of someone who is unfortunate enough to suffer from a serious illness but has made a full recovery and is perfectly capable of continuing in employment, that the contract has been frustrated and the person has to go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of redress the Minister of State made it clear that the levels of compensation paid during the years have been small.  To a large extent this is because social welfare payments and tax rebates are taken into account.  Incidentally, this happened only when the legal profession became involved.  In the early years compensation was calculated by reference to gross pay.  It was only as <Col N="953" /> time went on that it began to be calculated on the basis of net pay.</P>
    <P>The one area where there is a need for legislation is in non-unionised, casual, irregular, low paid employment where workers are badly exploited.  This is becoming more common.  In those circumstances if workers are to be provided with the protection they need the legislation will have to be broadened to allow access to it by a wider range of employees.  I hope we will have the opportunity of dealing with this point on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding my reservations about the legal profession's involvement in the operation of this legislation, it is nevertheless a fact that many employers turn up with their lawyers and many employees, particularly those who are not unionised, go to legal aid centres to seek assistance with their case.  There is a necessity, therefore, to provide legal aid for people appearing before the Employment Appeals Tribunal, if they are not to be at a disadvantage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  Perhaps another way of dealing with it is by &mdash; and these are not mutually exclusive &mdash; extending the categories of people who by right may represent people at the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  As I understand it the 1977 legislation reserves to lawyers, trade union officials and employer representatives the right to represent.  In practice, other people do so by permission of the Employment Appeals Tribunal and I am not aware of any case where such permission has been refused, but it would be helpful if the representation could be drawn from a wider net.  People who opt to be represented by a member of the legal profession, particularly in cases where the employer has legal representation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to debate this legislation. Like Deputy Gilmore I have had some experience of this legislation down through the years.  I advise the Minister not to be rushed into concluding the Bill by a certain date because it will be at least 15 to 16 years before we have another opportunity to consider change in the legislation.  We should now try to rectify some of the difficulties that have arisen since the 1977 Act took effect.</P>
      <P>My clear understanding of the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, is that it was enacted to protect employees who were unfairly dismissed.  However over the years employers have availed of it to dismiss people legally.  That is an unfortunate development.  It would be unfair to brand all employers, because a great many have never had to attend the Employment Appeals Tribunal as they were able to solve their industrial relations problems through in-house mechanisms.</P>
      <P>Over the years a number of bad practices has developed.  I was interested to learn that, back in 1976, 20 per cent of industrial disputes related to dismissals and that this has been reduced to between 8 and 10 per cent.  That is still far too high as dismissal should not give rise to industrial disputes.  I know from my own experience that people have lost confidence in the Unfair Dismissals Act and are resorting to the Industrial Relations Act to deal with dismissals.  I can see this trend developing unless we make the necessary changes in the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The spirit of the 1977 Act is that the industrial relations mechanism would be applied in a similar fashion to cases of unfair dismissal instead of dealing with the problem in court.  However, a great many cases are ending up in the Circuit Court and this is certainly not in keeping with the spirit of the Act as introduced. I hope changes will be introduced to try to avoid this in the future.  As Deputy Gilmore mentioned, at a hearing before the Employment Appeals Tribunal the <Col N="955" /> employer will certainly be represented by a solicitor and perhaps even a barrister. Obviously if the employee is represented by a trade union, the legal profession will not be involved, in keeping with the spirit of the 1977 Act.  The tribunal is comprised of a chairperson and a representative of the employers' organisation and an employees' representative. They have a great deal of experience and will apply commonsense in determining each case.  It is intimidating for someone who has gone through the trauma of losing his job to try to prove he has been dismissed unfairly.</P>
    <P>The Unfair Dismissals Act has become a legal minefield.  When a case comes before the Employment Appeals Tribunal, precedents from as far back as the 1800's are being cited as reasons for dismissing somebody.  That is an unfortunate development and we should try to stem its growth by introducing amendments in the course of the passage of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Under the Industrial Relations Act a case heard by a Rights Commissioner may be appealed to the Labour Court whose decision is legally binding.  I see no reason therefore why the decision in a case appealed to the Employment Appeals Tribunal under the Unfair Dismissals Act should not be legally binding on the appellant.  It would give the individual who has been dismissed an option to decide which route to take, common law or the unfair dismissals legislation, which I believe should be amended.  At present if one takes that route one could end up not alone in the Circuit Court but in the High Court and that should be avoided.  It can take well over a year before a final determination is made in the courts and indeed if it goes to the High Court it can take up to two years. That limits the options of redress under the Act.</P>
    <P>Obviously the Rights Commissioner will hear the case after a number of weeks when the person has gone through the procedure of deciding whether to appeal. When there is an application to appeal <Col N="956" /> there is a certain timespan, in which the employer can object or accept, and many weeks can go by before a date is set.  If it goes from the Rights Commissioner to the appeals tribunal, particularly outside Dublin, it could take several months before the tribunal hears the case, apparently because of a system whereby members of the tribunal do the circuit at intervals, which takes time.  Having heard the case, it can then be appealed within six weeks to the Circuit Court. When it goes to the Circuit Court it may be listed for, say, July, but it may be the following July before it is heard.  Having heard the case in the Circuit Court somebody, on a point of law, may decide to appeal it to the High Court in which case it could be two, three or three and a half years before it is determined.  During that time the person may be unemployed or in part-time employment.  What possibility has that person of being reinstated in employment?  The chances of fitting in again in the employment are probably nil, indeed the employer may have employed somebody to fill the position. After 12 months that employee has rights under the Unfair Dismissals Act and cannot be removed to allow the other person to return.  Those are some of the practical problems that arise when a case takes so long to process.  I hope that aspect can be examined with a view to taking it away from the courts.  However, an employee should have an option in this regard.</P>
    <P>To take both options would not be in the employee's interest in the long term. The Minister said the average compensation payment is £2,660, a little over £800 more than the 1984 average.  This is very low compensation &mdash; based on the maximum 104 weeks net wages &mdash; for a person who has lost a job.  If that person is in receipt of social welfare or due a refund of income tax that would be welcome. If somebody who has lost their job &mdash; and gets two years' net wages &mdash; obtains employment that would be taken into consideration.  Effectively the maximum a person will get, if they have been employed during the course of their dismissal before the determination of <Col N="957" /> their case, is four weeks' wages.  That does not take into consideration the fact that somebody may have been 15 or 20 years in employment and may have accrued various benefits, not necessarily cash benefits, such as security, pension rights and various others which they would not have in their new employment, which may only last a year or less.</P>
    <P>If an employer unfairly dismisses somebody he should be made to pay dearly.  I do not believe 104 weeks net pay is fair compensation and that area will have to be examined.</P>
    <P>We have an opportunity here to redress many of the problems which have arisen.  Consideration should be given to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and indeed to the employers' representatives who experienced the difficulties at the coalface in the past.  We must ensure that cases are heard within a couple of months because if it goes beyond that period it is very difficult to reinstate a person.  The main objective of processing a case of unfair dismissal is to have the person reinstated.</P>
    <P>I know employees prefer to take compensation, for many reasons but in cases where there is a large number of employees it would be more practical for people to be reinstated.  If, after two or three years, people lose their skills, they will not fit in and for that reason we must take this matter out of the courts, which was the original principle behind the 1977 Act.  Let us deal with it as it was meant to be dealt with, as an industrial relations issue and try to consider, as I suggested, the Rights Commissioner and the appeal to the tribunal, making it legally binding on the appellant.  During the few weeks we have to consider the Bill I hope the Minister will introduce amendments along the lines suggested.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State who introduced her first Bill and I wish her success.  Everyone would see this as welcome legislation.  It is good housekeeping legislation in many ways in that it tidies up many loose ends in the earlier legislation.  Like others who have spoken, I share the belief that there is no <Col N="958" /> objective evidence that labour law has been an effective barrier to employment. The barriers to employment are probably being more throughly debated in a committee of this House where the Finance Bill is being examined as well as the disincentives in the taxation system, the attendant bureaucracy in the administration of the tax regime and the various anomalies affecting lower paid workers. That is where many of the barriers to employment arise, not in the labour law which employers and trade unionists accept has brought welcome stability to our industrial relations, contributed to a situation where people are being treated fairly and in which we are creating a better quality of employment.</P>
      <P>In the case of amended labour legislation, as a general principle there should be an attempt to include a statement, accompanying legislation, stating what effect this will have on costs.  This legislation will not have an impact on costs and there is no doubt that cost competitiveness is here to stay in terms of our competition within the EC.</P>
      <P>We cannot regard welcome reform in labour law or in other forms of law as a free lunch if, at the end of the day, significant extra costs will be imposed. As necessary and welcome reforms in labour law evolve, will the Minister ensure that her Department sets out a cost statement so that we know there will not be hidden costs or that in a couple of years the legislation is creating problems we did not envisage?  If there was to be such a cost statement there would be a far greater cost statement attaching to the Finance Bill today with a £130 million extra burden in income levies alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt it was envisaged that the whole procedure in relation to unfair dismissals would be an informal setting in which employers and workers and their representatives could resolve difficulties. That concept has been lost sight of and this has been particularly to the disadvantage of workers because, as a rule, employers will have more resources to get access to legal representation.  The procedures at the Employment Appeals Tribunal have become dotted with more <Col N="959" /> and more lawyers and a greater frequency of appeals to the Circuit Court, which is unsatisfactory and never envisaged. There is some chance for unionised workers who can get the necessary financial and legal support from their trade union.  This may not be the case for non-unionised labour for which in any event we should be more concerned to provide protection because they are less likely to be able to pursue redress.  There is no doubt that the present situation is creating obstacles.</P>
    <P>In the discussion document there was a general endorsement of the fact that the legalistic approach was resulting in lenghty and costy delays and that ordinary workers, for whose assistance the system was set up, are often intimidated by that approach.  We should try to go back to a more informal way of dealing with such problems and do away with the cost of appeals to the Circuit Court.  I am disappointed that the legislation does not seem to have covered that territory.</P>
    <P>Further on in this document there is a reference to the frequency of appeals to the Circuit Court and it notes, quite interestingly, that the Congress, the FUE, as it then was, and the Employment Appeals Tribunal all expressed dissatisfaction with the role of the Circuit Court; all three bodies considered that appeals to the Circuit Court should be limited to references of determination to the High Court on a point of law only. That seems to be the general consensus but it has not been reflected in the legislation. It would seem a missed opportunity that we did not go with the general consensus among the social partners and the tribunal itself.  In many ways that introduces the concept Fine Gael put forward in the Seanad of a different appeal mechanism.  Maybe that has sense in that it would short-circuit what is going on and, if it did not bring to an end the legalistic approach that is perhaps inevitable in these circumstances at least it would reduce the potential costs of pursuing cases.</P>
    <P>Another issue to which I would like to draw the Minister's attention, which I <Col N="960" /> hope she might consider by way of an amendment, is the very unsatisfactory situation in pursuing awards where a company winds up its operations.  I know of cases where it was only through the remarkable persistence of workers that an outstanding award of compensation was eventually secured through the insolvency fund after the winding up and liquidation of companies.  It is unsatisfactory that it should be left to the persistence of workers or unions in pursuing companies that may wind up to get those rights.  If, as I suspect, there is a defect in this area, the Minister should use this opportunity to table amendments that would protect workers in the event of a company winding up.  Perhaps, as a result of the new Companies Act it is not as frequent, but there was a time when &ldquo;shell&rdquo; companies operated one day and were gone the next and limited liability seemed to protect the directors from being pursued personally for the amounts outstanding relating to unfair dismissals awards.  If we are doing a good housekeeping job on this legislation the Minister should come back to the House with amendments that might accommodate that situation.  Perhaps we on this side of the House should also try to draft something for her consideration although we do not have the Minister's resources.</P>
    <P>I am not an expert in industrial relations but it seems inherently unfair that, where there is a dismissal but it cannot be proved there was a financial loss, the amounts would be limited to four weeks' pay.  It seems that someone should have the freedom to interpret the extent of culpability.  Why do we put in a ceiling without giving the Employment Appeals Tribunal the ability to assess the case on the facts presented?  It seems that these things should not be capped. Equally I do not see why, in the event that the employer has acted recklessly and dismissed someone without justification, both financial loss and fine should not apply.  Perhaps it is to contain the cost element of this legislation.  On the other hand if we are providing for redress for loss, I do not see why it should be capped.  One can envisage a situation <Col N="961" /> where there would be very significant losses and it seems artificial to impose limits on them.</P>
    <P>Another issue that I would be interested in hearing the Minister develop is this notion of &ldquo;back to back&rdquo; contracts.  I certainly welcome protection in this area.  I was amazed recently to meet a constituent, a young 18 year old builder's labourer who was being employed on the basis of these contracts at £140 or £150 a week.  He was on contract and the employer was not paying PRSI so, presumably, he was not getting the protection of labour law and so on.  I was shocked at how prevalent contract work had become.  The legislation is complex and hard to interpret quickly.  Am I right in assuming that if an employer breaks the contract by three months, the Employment Appeals Tribunal, the Rights Commissioner or whoever is involved does not have the chance to examine the situation to see whether these contracts were wholly or partly established purely to circumvent this law?</P>
    <P>In the case of workers like the one I described employed on contract with three months breaks, will this legislation make things more tenuous?  Workers get a spell of employment and then a spell of unemployment, they are kept on that kind of drip system.  Far from this reform getting over the problem faced by those workers, it will probably aggravate it in that there will be even more unreliable working patterns for them.  It begs the question whether this legislation gets to grips with the situation.  Perhaps we should consider why employers prefer to contract out work and whether other legislation can deal with that.  I suspect it relates more to PRSI than to labour law. Again, this raises the question whether, in the interest of continuity of work, we should be examining the burden of PRSI. Those are the main issues about which I am concerned.  I welcome most of the provisions in the Bill.  People will now have more confidence in its operations but we have missed an opportunity to deal with the legalistic aspect of the matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="962" /> The pursuit by the Minister's own Department of awards which have been fixed by the tribunal but not paid by employers leaves much to be desired.  I have dealt with cases in my constituency clinic which have taken an exceptionally long period of time to settle.  There appeared to have been a breakdown in communications between the Minister's Department and the solicitor involved. That is a lenghty and frustrating procedure and is unfair to a person who has received an award for an unfair dismissal. It is a traumatic experience for a worker to take an unfair dismissals case against an employer.  Obviously, they fear that there will be a black mark against them in future employment.  It takes a great deal of courage to go down the road of an unfair dismissals action and therefore, it is unfair that employers are not made pay up more promptly in such cases.  The Minister's assistance to workers in that position should be more streamlined and people should be kept informed of developments.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in the Bill which states that interest should accrue on such awards.  Indeed, I would contend that it should be a penalty interest.  The Revenue Commissioners impose a penalty interest on overdue tax liabilities and the same should apply to awards in unfair dismissal cases.  The Minister should examine the procedures in her Department for dealing with such awards.  She should examine also the procedures outside of her Department which are carried out under her instructions.  Are such cases being shunted to the bottom of a list in a solicitor's office because the sum of money involved may not be significant and, therefore takes lower precedence? Such cases may involve small sums of money but they are significant to the people who have gone through a traumatic experience in taking the case. Therefore, when they succeed in winning an award we should ensure they receive their money promptly.</P>
    <P>Finally, I appeal to the Minister to examine the injustice to pregnant women.  The Minister is endeavouring to introduce a fairer system and is committed to the recommendations in the <Col N="963" /> report of the Commission on the Status of Women.  It appears inconsistent with what she has said elsewhere that this injustice has not been faced up to and resolved.</P>

      <P>As somebody acting on behalf of the ordinary people, I am surprised at the tone and tenor of some of the comments.  I am not carrying a lawyer's hat by any means, but lawyers have helped in no small way to bring about some of the amendments to the principal Act and that is to be welcomed. The main focus is to update the 1977 Act. It was important that the Minister noted the shortcomings in that Act and set about eliminating them to ensure that the Act operates satisfactorily.  This commitment was given in the Programme for Government and is being honoured. People outside the House should note this because many commentators have condemned the Government for the slowness with which it introduces legislation. This legislation has been introduced speedily and the Minister and the Government should be complimented for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the proposal in the Bill for a minimum award of four weeks' pay following dismissal.  Employees deserve that because of the trauma and stress that many of them go through in taking an unfair dismissals case.  I welcome also the increase in the fine for failure to attend at hearings before the tribunal from the present measly sum of £20 to £1,000.  That fine can be imposed for refusing to give evidence or a failure or refusal to produce documents.  That gives teeth to the legislation. Persons employed through employment agencies will be covered <Col N="964" /> under the Bill and this is a welcome inclusion.  Section 5 includes sexual orientation as a ground for an automatic unfair dismissals case.  That is a welcome addition to the list of reasons for dismissal.</P>
    <P>The Bill sets out the role of the Circuit Court in relation to enforcement to ensure compliance with an award.  Some speakers, including Deputies from my own party, indicated that the courts should have a <i>de minimis</i> role in relation to this legislation.  That is a Utopian view. Where people have varying views on such matters it is obvious that cases will eventually make their way to the courts for final resolution.  This Bill sets out clearly the role of the Circuit Court in relation to enforcement in that regard. In view of the plethora of legislation relating to employment law, the Minister might consider publishing a comprehensive, simple guideline to the legislation which could be readily understood by lay people.  I appreciate that the Minister and her Department have published a number of booklets which set out clearly the precise details of the various legislative measures, for example, the Unfair Dismissals Act, the Maternity (Protection of Employees) Act, the Holiday (Employees) Act.  It would be a worthwhile exercise to bring those Acts together and make them available to enable ordinary people to be <i>au fait</i> with their rights and duties under the various enactments.  As the Minister stated, almost 8,000 cases have been brought under the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, of which about 1,750 have been allowed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in section 3 which allows for the extension of the legislation to temporary employees in health boards.  Contract work is now commonplace.  The majority of nurses are employed on a temporary basis. Heretofore they could not avail of the benefits of the legislation.  This Bill rectifies that anomaly and I welcome it.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides that payments to employees under the social welfare and income tax codes can now be disregarded. That is an important provision. In view of the relatively low level of <Col N="965" /> awards of approximately £2,660, it is vital that any payments the claimant receives under the social welfare or income tax codes should be disregarded in the calculation of financial loss.</P>
    <P>Members will be aware that prior to the 1977 Act very few protections were available to the employee dismissed in an unfair, arbitrary or unjust manner.  The 1977 Act was positive and progressive legislation which provided redress for people who were unfairly dismissed by the mechanism of reinstatement, re-engagement or compensation for the financial loss incurred.  The argument that the unfair dismissals legislation is so restrictive on employers that it forms a barrier to the creation of employment does not hold up to any objective scrutiny. I agree with the Minister's analysis in this regard.  The 1977 Act played a major role in the industrial peace and harmony which prevailed in the late seventies, throughout the eighties and into the nineties.  There is now a beneficial interaction between employers and unions.  The Act has served to give certainty in the workplace.  The legislation clearly sets out the rights, duties and responsibilities of employers and employees in this regard.</P>
    <P>Section 7 is novel, particularly in regard to the opportunity provided for the Circuit Court to outline reasons for its decisions.  Transparency has been brought to court decisions.  It will assist people in understanding how decisions are arrived at.  Consequent on that there will be a greater understanding of the legislative provisions and that will help more people in relation to this matter.</P>
    <P>I would be eager to ensure that the legal aid scheme is extended to cover claimants before the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  That would render nugatory any arguments in relation to the absence of legal assistance in cases where there may be non-unionised labour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not blowing a trumpet for the legal profession.  No one can say that the Free Legal Aid Centre represents solely the legal profession.  I am disappointed that there is no provision in this regard and I would venture to say that it is the only lacuna I would observe in what is otherwise an excellent Bill.  I appreciate there is a financial implication involved and I am sure the Minister will contact the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, in this regard.</P>
      <P>I am aware from experience that claims will often include the presentation of a technical point of law and, accordingly, it helps if someone <i>au fait</i> with the legalities of the legislation presents that point.  In relation to constructive dismissal, the onus is on the employee to prove that his dismissal was constructive and that is an exceptionally high standard. I would be grateful to learn from the Minister the number of employees who alleged constructive dismissal, who have been successful in taking cases as complainants to the tribunal.  It is a high standard to achieve and assistance should be given to employees in relation to the formidable barrier which they must overcome to succeed at tribunal level.  There is a need for representation especially in regard to non-unionised workers on low incomes for whom there is no other legal resource.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be profitable for the Minister to examine the possibility of bringing forward a consolidation Act which would consolidate the many legislative provisions. There must be 23 or 24 Acts and Statutory Instruments involved.  It is not as major a task as it might appear at first sight although the parliamentary draftsman might shudder at the thought of drafting such an Act.  A consolidation <Col N="967" /> Act would make it easier for employees and employers to understand the various remedies available to them in the labour law area.  There have been numerous promises in the past to reform the labour code and I am pleased that the Government has seen fit to bring this promise to fruition.</P>
    <P>I note with satisfaction the provision in relation to the enforcement of awards. The Minister should consider including the High Court in the provisions dealing with enforcement.  I am aware that the awards are low.  The Circuit Court has certain jurisdiction and if it was exceeded, which is doubtful, it might be worthwhile including the High Court in any amendment.</P>
    <P>A Free Legal Aid Centre submission outlines the case where an employee is awarded compensation.  Deputy Bruton asked earlier about the case of an employee who is awarded compensation but the respondent is a company which has ceased to trade and has not yet been formally wound up.  For the claimant to recover would necessitate bringing a petition to wind up that company.  That would be an extremely costly process.</P>
    <P>Reference was made earlier to the cost of entering the legal domain.  In view of the low level of awards it would not be an attraction for an employee who finds himself or herself in that position to take legal action.  In such circumstances the Minister of State should consider allowing the claimant to recoup any sum awarded from the insolvency fund to bring it into line with the redundancy package.  Not only would this bring the unfair dismissals legislation in line with the redundancy Acts but it would also make it easier for people in that position &mdash; they would be very few &mdash; to obtain assistance.  Legislation should always be broad enough to deal with unforeseen circumstances during the course of its transition through the courts.</P>
    <P>One area which the Minister of State might take a personal interest in &mdash; this was referred to by Deputy Bruton &mdash; is the maternity protection legislation. <Col N="968" /> Section 22 of the Maternity (Protection of Employees) Act, 1981 stipulates that an employee who is on maternity leave must notify her employer in writing within four weeks of her intended date of return to work and this must be confirmed within a further two weeks of the specified time. This requirement has been interpreted by the courts as being mandatory and very often through an oversight, if an employee fails to furnish this required notice her claim under the unfair dismissals legislation might well be defeated.  The Minister should consider amending this legislation and it might be an issue for the consolidation Act which the Minister will be examining.  The section should be amended to state that the notification requirements which I have alluded to, while they might be desirable, would not be mandatory.  That would address this problem and would be of assistance to employees, particularly women, who are returning to work following their 14 weeks maternity leave.</P>
    <P>A claim under the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1997, must be initiated within six months of the relevant date of dismissal. The Bill now confers on the Rights Commissioner and the tribunal the discretion to hear cases where exceptional circumstances prevail and they can do so within 12 months.  That is welcome and I would like to see the <i>prima facie</i> period for bringing a claim extended to 12 months.  However, we must recognise that the Minister of State has acknowledged the problem and has taken action consequently in this regard.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions in section 6 in relation to financial loss.  It is a worthwhile inclusion.  The Minister might consider in view of the low level of awards, extending the period under which awards are made from the present 104 weeks to 156 weeks which represents an extra year.  The awards are low and the two year time limit for the making of awards in relation to the calculation might be an influence.</P>
    <P>I wish to compliment the Minister of State on the speed with which she brought forward this much needed legislation.</P>

        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly)</i>: I wish to join in the compliments paid to the Minister of State, and the Government, for the speed with which this legislation was brought before the Seanad and now, the Dáil.  I note that the Bill was initiated in the Seanad.  The greater use of the Seanad for the initiation of legislation is another example of how serious the Government is about the question of Oireacthas reform and better use of both Houses.

      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly)</i>: &mdash;&mdash;and on occasion calls for bilocation.  I welcome this Bill and I look forward with confidence to the speedy introduction of the remaining reforms outlined in the Programme for Government.  This issue has been the subject of much comment and promise in the past and I am happy it is being implemented so quickly.</P>
      <P>As the explanatory memorandum points out this Bill is, in effect, tidying up &mdash; with the benefit of experience &mdash; the 1977 Act.  It is timely because the 1977 Act, which was welcomed when it was introduced, as experience has shown through changes in employment and so on, needs to be amended.</P>
      <P>Previous speakers referred to the fact that the area of work and employment is changing rapidly.  While the legislation deals with many of the needs the continuing change in the nature of work and employment means that the labour legislation must be given constant attention. It will not be sufficient to come back at ten, 15, or 16 year intervals to update laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my previous employment I dealt with many young people who were unemployed having left school.  I was helping them in the transition to the world of work which was often difficult.  They often obtained employment for three months, six months, or ten months but few of them obtained employment for <Col N="970" /> longer than 12 months at a time.  If they succeeded in obtaining a job soon after losing their first job they remained outside the scope of much of the employment legislation.  For that reason I ask the Minister to ensure that her Department keeps a constant watch on this area of labour law and introduce the necessary changes to cover temporary, casual and part-time work.  As the Minister is aware this affects women, in particular.  Many of them are part of families where unemployment is a feature and they try to earn extra money to support their families.</P>
    <P>Legislation such as this is only good if its provisions are implemented.  There is an element both of the carrot and of the stick in this matter and both elements need to be addressed.  In encouraging people to use this legislation and ensure it is complied with, there is a necessity for the updating of publications of the Department in the area of labour law and making them more attractive in terms of presentation.  These publications should be circulated much more widely than is the case at present &mdash; they are available through FAS offices, citizen information centres and other areas.  It is important that people be made aware, not alone in booklet form but through media such as television, radio and videos, which could be used in schools and so on, of the legislation governing the world of work.</P>
    <P>There is also a need to strengthen the industrial inspectorate, an area which has become very rundown, particularly in the last number of years, due to the recruitment embargo and other measures introduced in the public service to reduce employment.  When introducing legislation we must make provision to ensure it is enforced.  By expecting industrial inspectors to cover large areas without adequate support and back-up we are not ensuring that legislation is complied with.</P>
    <P>A number of significant improvements are being introduced in the area of unfair dismissals.  I compliment the Minister on clarity of presentation in this regard. With the change in the labour market here and abroad there has been a growth in employment agencies in the last number of years.  People employed <Col N="971" /> through employment agencies experience difficulties in claiming for unfair dismissal. I welcome the protection extended by this Bill to people working through an employment agency.  It provides that a person does not have to follow the employment agency to seek redress.  I also welcome the improvements regarding employment by contract, which is an increasing feature of employment.  I welcome the powers being given to the Rights Commissioner to examine contracts of employment to see if they are drafted with the intention of breaking the law.  This measure will be of benefit to many people who experience difficulties under the existing Act.</P>
    <P>I welcome the measure which provides that in exceptional circumstances an examination may be made and permission given for a claim to be lodged within a period of 12 months &mdash; under existing law the period laid down is six months. Normally one would expect a claim to be made very quickly after an alleged unfair dismissal but for many people the trauma involved and the difficulty in coping with financial, personal and family circumstances meant that it was some time before they lodged a claim.  I welcome the hardship clause which allows extreme cases to be readmitted and considered.</P>
    <P>I am aware that it is difficult in legislation such as this to take account of the needs of people working in the Defence Forces and the Garda Síochána.  Representative associations now exist not alone in the Garda Síochána but also in the Defence Forces.  I ask the Minister to bring this matter to the attention of her colleagues in the relevant areas with a view to improving the regulations covering the Defence Forces and the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to the removal of discrimination and promotion of equality in Irish society and this matter features prominently in the Bill.  It provides that cases automatically considered as unfair dismissal cases will include cases of discrimination on the basis of race, colour, sexual orientation, age and being a member of the travelling community &mdash;<Col N="972" /> the latter two being included in the course of the passage of the Bill through the Seanad.  This measure is very welcome. We may say we are not a racist people but that is because not very many people of other ethnic backgrounds live here.  In general people are tolerant but in some cases subtle forms of racism are practised. I ask the Minister to take up with the aliens section of the Department of Justice the problem of people who are discriminated against on racial or ethnic grounds.  Improvements in that area should be considered as a matter of priority.</P>
    <P>I welcome the elimination of age discrimination in the Bill.  As there are so many young people in this country and the labour market caters mostly for young people, at times the needs of older workers are disregarded.  The number of people over 65 years &mdash; in the region of 12 per cent of the population &mdash; is considerably in excess of the number on the unemployment register.  A feature of the last decade has been that older workers were pushed out of the labour market, sometimes on the justification that it creates openings for young people. This is a somewhat officially sanctioned form of ageism.  Instead of putting people on unemployment assistance or social welfare pension they receive a pre-retirement allowance which leaves them in limbo.  I am glad discrimination in this regard is being eliminated in this legislation.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the elimination of discrimination in relation to the travelling community.  This is an example of the urgency and seriousness with which the Government is tackling the problem of inequality in this area.  I do not know how many people will be affected by this measure because, as somebody who has worked in the area of training and education, I know it is difficult, even where travelling people participate in education and training, to have them placed in long term employment.  I hope that with this measure more of these people will find employment.</P>
    <P>When this Bill is passed it should be the subject of a publicity campaign by the <Col N="973" /> Department.  Much good work has been done in the area of health and safety, particularly in the last two years.  Part of the improvement in that area was brought about as a result of people's fear of being sued or having insurance claims taken against them in the event of non-compliance with regulations.  Here again there is the example of the carrot and the stick.  I ask the Minister to ensure that an effective campaign of advertising in the media is embarked on by the Department on the passing of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In the current circumstances of high unemployment there is a large &mdash; to use an old-fashioned term &mdash; reserve army of labour and it is easy for people to lose sight of the fact that those in work deserve protection.  There is a danger that the application of labour law will slacken because there are so many people ready to take up jobs if somebody is dismissed. The necessary resources should be put into ensuring that this legislation becomes reality on the ground.</P>

      <P>I fully support the Fine Gael motion.  I congratulate the huge number of people who travelled the length and breadth of the country to protest outside the gates of Leinster House on behalf of their relatives and friends at <Col N="975" /> the lack of a fair deal from a Government who have left many of our services stretched beyond their limit.  For coming here on the wettest day in May those people deserve our gratitude and support. Tangible support should come from the Government after 8.30 tonight when the Deputies from Fianna Fáil and Labour have the opportunity to vote on this issue.  The Programme for a Partnership Government states that the Government aim to have a health service of the highest quality so that people, particularly the elderly, can be confident that they will be well cared for when they need medical care.  The programme refers to the provision of charters for the mentally and physically handicapped and for patients' rights.  The programme recognises the importance of allowing people with disability to enjoy their full citizenship.  These are worthy sentiments.</P>
      <P>This year the Western Care Association, which provides the best possible services to people in the west, will incur a shortfall of over £400,000.  If this is not financed by the Government there will be severe cutbacks giving rise to serious hardship and the loss of approximately 30 jobs.  The director of the Western Care Association has already indicated that he cannot say how long his service can continue.  It is recognised that services in the area of autism, special schools and residential needs are at crisis point.</P>
      <P>This Labour Minister for Health guaranteed prior to the general election that sufficient funds would be made available, particularly for people with both mental and physical disabilities.  The Labour Party now has the opportunity to do something about it.  This morning we heard of Government action to allow a tax amnesty which might bring in about £300 million.  The people who are proiding loving care and attention for their disabled children and other family members are entitled to a better deal than they are getting from the Government.</P>

      <P>I spoke today to many parents who had gathered outside Leinster House to emphasise the seriousness <Col N="976" /> of the situation with regard to services for mentally handicapped children and adults.  One mother told me she has cared for 18 years for her son and when I asked her how, she said that she managed by never going out.  She said that parents provided the service themselves by working, by fund raising and by developing some services.  She went on to say that there have been some improvements in more recent times but that there were still dreadful shortages in the services. I also spoke to the father of a 12 year old boy who gave up his work four years ago to help care for his severely handicapped child at home.  He does not know where his child will go to school next year.  There is not a suitable service. I also spoke to a woman who is a voluntary unpaid worker looking after 25 severely handicapped children in the course of the week.  She was furious at the lack of services for these children and she said that this was particularly noticeable in the area of severe handicap. I heard about another woman who had a new baby recently but could not get State support or respite care for the six year old at the time of the birth.  The stories are never ending.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pay tribute to the parents and the families who have done such trojan work looking after their mentally handicapped relatives.  I also pay tribute to the voluntary workers who have worked and fought for so many years feeling that their voices were not being heard or their efforts rewarded.  There is no doubt that it is their effort rather than any response from the State which has brought about any change we see.  There is clearly a need to develop respite care, day care services and some residential care.  If properly structured day care services were available it would greatly reduce the pressure and the worry of parents, particularly those who are elderly.  Many parents are willing to make enormous sacrifices but they know it may not be possible for siblings to care for the handicapped child or adult in the same way. These siblings should be supported and appropriate day care services would be of enormous assistance. <Col N="977" /> For &ldquo;community care&rdquo; one can very ofen read &ldquo;family&rdquo; or &ldquo;mothers&rdquo;.  For far too long this is what community care has meant.  The concept of community care is excellent and the thinking is right but unfortunately resources have not always matched the aspirations.  There is certainly a crisis in the area of mental handicap.</P>
    <P>It is time for a quantum shift in the way we think and behave in relation to services for the mentally handicapped.  It is time to inject reality into &ldquo;community care&rdquo;.  I would ask the Government to take this seriously and to put the necessary resources into place.</P>
    <P>Eighty per cent of carers are female and an even higher proportion of carers who provide an intensive level of care around the clock, often giving up paid employment, are women.  The caring is seldom a choice on the part of the carer, but the response to an immediate and acute problem, a personal response and a wish to care.  In becoming carers many women have had to face isolation and forego the option of paid employment and all that means in terms of income, status and social welfare entitlements.</P>
    <P>I do not have time to go into the details of the report of the Commission on the Status of Women and their many suggestions in relation to the development of the community care service and the extension and development of the home help service which would also make quite a difference.  The commission said what the parents gathered outside Leinster House are saying today, that it is a priority that residential and day places should be provided for mentally handicapped people who need them.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party misled people with regard to their general intentions after the election.  Specifically, they misled the parents and families of the mentally handicapped about their intentions.</P>

      <P>Among its main priorities, this Government has identified the need for greater equality throughout society. This includes equality for women, people with disabilities and travellers, coupled with the elimination, as far as possible, of social disadvantage and poverty.  The Government regard as a priority the need to modernise our laws with regard to social legislation and the fairer application of laws throughout the whole spectrum of our public administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's intention is to implement the Programme for Government, in conjunction with the commitments contained in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and the <Col N="979" /> Community Support Framework agreed with the European Community.  The proposals in the Programme for a Partnership Government to enhance the rights of people with an intellectual disability include the following: the provision of sufficient money to speed up the implementation of the Needs and Abilities report; the enactment of legislation to put the rights of people with an intellectual disability on a statutory basis together with a means of redress for people whose rights are ignored; measures to ensure that the parents and families of people with an intellectual disability are adequately consulted and involved in the planning and decisionmaking process; measures to ensure greater co-operation among the agencies involved in such areas, for example, the assembling of financial and other information and the most rational and effective use of transport facilities; an educational programme based on the principle of choice; integration into mainstream schools and classes for those children whose families want it and improved staffing and facilities in special schools for others; the establishment of a vocational training centre for people with an intellectual disability on the campus of one of our universities, as a pilot project, to enhance the rights and perception of people with an intellectual disability and to encourage and facilitate research into their training and development needs.</P>
    <P>My present role in relation to persons with an intellectual disability is primarily a co-ordinating one.  However, one of my primary aims is to devise ways of increasing the effectiveness of the services currently provided by the various statutory and voluntary bodies to maximise their benefits.  I had discussions with various interests in relation to persons with an intellectual disability.  In taking decisions I will consult and consider the views of persons with intellectual disabilities, and their families, as well as service providers and voluntary bodies representing their interests.</P>
    <P>The role of social policy is to provide a framework which facilitates the fullest <Col N="980" /> participation possible by people in all aspects of society.  To achieve that objective, social expenditure should be recognised as underpinning the quality of life of all citizens, including those experiencing mental health difficulties as well as the enhancement of equality of opportunity for them.  Social policy cannot operate in isolation.  Responsibility for facilitating participation of people must also be a feature of economic, education, training and labour market policies as well as conventional social policies.  In turn, this requires co-operation between the public and private sectors, the social partners and individuals and the clarification of their respective roles and responsibilities.  The integration of policies to create such a coherent, co-ordinated framework is a major challenge. Many policy areas have implications for social policy.  In turn, social policy can, and does, impact on employment, education and other policy domains.</P>
    <P>Because of our determination to eliminate inequalities in the case of disadvantaged groups and recognising the need for greater cohesion in measures to combat discrimination, the Department of Equality and Law Reform was established under the Programme for Government, with responsibility for seeing that equality becomes a reality through institutional, administrative and legal reform.</P>
    <P>In pursuit of the Government's resolve the Taoiseach and I met representatives of the Forum for People with Disabilities on 5 May 1993 to mark it as Europewide day for highlighting discrimination against people with disabilities.  The Taoiseach and I confirmed that people with disabilities will be represented on the new National Economic and Social Forum which will hold its first meeting in June.  We also confirmed that the monitoring committee under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> on employment of people with disabilities would continue its work.  On that occasion we announced the establishment of a Commission on Disability, the terms of reference of which are to be drawn up over coming months by my Department in consultation with representatives <Col N="981" /> of people with disabilities and relevant Government Departments. My Department has already placed public advertisements seeking the widest possible input to the drawing up of the terms of reference of the new commission. I might add that 60 per cent of the proposed membership of the commission will be comprised of people with disabilities.  In conjunction with the work of the commission, the process to establish a permanent Council for the Status of People with Disabilities, to oversee in a coherent way implementation of action, to improve the position of people with disabilities, will also be put in train.</P>
    <P>As regards employment for people with a disability, the Government has undertaken to give a lead by honouring the pledge whereby the 3 per cent quota for employment in the public service for those with a physical or other disability will be observed.  My colleague, the Minister for Finance, has responsibility for employment in the Civil Service where at present people with a disability comprise over 2 per cent of the workforce.  Government Departments with low representation of staff with disabilities have been asked to increase that representation. I will be closely monitoring the implementation of the quota.  I have also asked the Ministers for Health and the Environment to make inquiries as to the position within health boards and local authorities respectively.</P>
    <P>I intend to give serious consideration, in consultation with the social partners, to formulating legislation for an employment quota throughout our economy.  In that context I hope to ensure that the employment prospects of people with an intellectual disability will be safeguarded and enhanced.</P>

      <P>As part of the commitment to equality in the Programme for Government I will be bringing forward radical and wide-ranging equality legislation which will introduce long over due <Col N="983" /> protection against discrimination for people with a disability and, indeed, for a wide range of other groups.</P>
      <P>Up to now most of the services for people with a disability have been administered by or on behalf of the Minister for Health and are closely linked with the general health and medical services. Discussions have taken place between my Department and the Department of Health to explore how the commitments in the Programme for a Partnership Government can best be implemented. The Department of Equality and Law Reform will be responsible for proposing new areas of support for all people with disabilities, physical and intellectual, and for allocating such moneys to all appropriate Departments.  Individual Departments will continue to be responsible for the delivery of specialist services.</P>
      <P>Work is at present being undertaken in relation to the preparation of the National Development Plan in respect of EC Structural Funds for the period 1994-97.  The main emphasis of the plan will be to secure the best long term return for the economy by increasing output, economic potential and long term jobs.  A second emphasis of the plan will be to integrate the long term unemployed, and those at high risk of becoming so, into the economic mainstream.  I am acutely aware of the high unemployment rate among persons with disabilities and it is my intention to ensure that Structural Funds are used to maximum effect to the benefit of the most vulnerable groups in society.</P>
      <P>In the short time it has been in office this Government has already taken a major step forward by agreeing to the establishment of the council for people with disabilities and the commission. The organisations representing people with disabilities requested the Government to set up these two bodies knowing that they would best represent their interests and include among their membership people who suffer from disabilities. The commission is to report within two years while the council will monitor developments on a regular basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="984" /> In addition, as I said, the preparation of anti-discrimination legislation within my Department is already at an advanced stage.  This will be a major, new qualitative input into Irish society indicating how we and this Government regard people with disabilities, who should be enabled to avail of their rights just like everybody else.  No previous Government in this country has done this but it has been done in many other countries in western Europe, the United States, Canada and Australia.  I am glad to tell the House that this legislation will be introduced by the Government and it will have major implications across society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I wish to thank the Minister for sharing his time with me this evening.</P>
      <P>While recognising that there is a sound philosophical structure and system in place to deal with the problems facing the handicapped and their families the one ongoing anxiety is the lack of adequate and consistent funding.  Such financial worries, particularly for voluntary bodies, sap the energy of those who are already stretched to provide the existing services and facilities.  Adequate moneys would lead to the implementation of a strategy to lessen the burden for carers who very often have to live life precariously as they devote themselves totally to their handicapped children. Surely, the stress involved in looking after a handicapped child and the burdens it can bring to other siblings in that family, to say nothing of the strain it can put on the marriage itself, should not be compounded by the ongoing worry of what is going to happen to the handicapped child on the parent's death.  Such anxieties are highlighted for the widow or widower and indeed, for older parents who are caring for their handicapped offspring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I welcome the increase in funding for the mentally handicapped I know the Minister would readily agree that we face a serious situation in the Mid-Western Health Board which I outlined to the Dáil on 29 April 1993.  Facilities, such as Lisnagry, Bawnmore and the sheltered <Col N="985" /> workshop in Ennis which is run by the Brothers of Charity, are filled to capacity. There is an absence of children's community services and adults are taking up children's places.  In west Clare there are 65 adults 50 of whom need a place in a sheltered workshop.  I understand that, due to the initiative taken by the voluntary group in that area with the generous help of the local community, work on such facility is now underway.</P>
    <P>Greater State money should be forthcoming to provide immediate residential and day care facilities, respite care and sheltered workshops which give the handicapped person dignity and purpose. State money must also be provided for early intervention services for children and for psychological services.  An interdepartmental approach to learning by the handicapped must be adopted, particularly by the Department of Health and the Department of Education.  I would like to see the emphasis being put by the Department of Health on the provision of local facilities.  As one can imagine it must be a wrench for parents who are very protective towards their handicapped child to send them far from home for residential care or tuition.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister on his statement to the House yesterday in regard to home support services and his plans for respite care for those on the waiting lists. However, the review group on the handicapped, set up in 1986, estimated that £50 million would have to be provided over a period of five years.  This was incorporated in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> but the money was to be spread over a period of seven years.  We have already heard that the Mid-Western Health Board needs no less than £6.295 million immediately to prevent existing services grinding to a halt.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Programme for Government with regard to the handicapped will be speeded up from 1994 to comply with the recommendations contained in the &ldquo;Needs and Abilities&rdquo; report, but I implore the Minister to trawl once again the Department of Health for extra funds and to seek extra funds <Col N="986" /> elsewhere to deal with the crisis immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I got the impression that the Department of Health believes that the services provided in the Western Health Board area for the mentally handicapped are quite good but I wish to answer this by saying that there are very good voluntary organisations, religious and lay associations providing these services and that in many instances the services are at a standstill.  For this reason I am disappointed that only £158,000 has been made available to the Western Health Board for services for the mentally handicapped out of the extra £8.5 million which has been provided.  This sum of £158,000 has to be divided five ways in the counties of Galway, Mayo and Roscommon.  Unfortunately, it represents less than 2 per cent of the total allocation.</P>
      <P>To be fair to the Minister for Health, when the sum of £20 million was provided to shorten the waiting lists we received over 10 per cent of this in the Western Health Board.  Unfortunately, as I said, we have only received less than 2 per cent of the funds allocated for services for the mentally handicapped.  It is time the Minister decided whether he should fund directly associations such as Galway County Association for Mentally Handicapped Children, the Western Care Association and the Bourne View Centre or else provide a decent allocation to the Western Health Board to fund these organisations.</P>
      <P>I share Deputy de Valera's concern on the question of ongoing funding.  The Galway County Association seems to encounter financial difficulties each year. Last year, for example, it would not have been able to maintain its service if it had not received a special grant from the Department of Health and lottery funding.  This meant that it had a deficit of only £50,000 at the end of 1992.  It is important that we ask if continuous grants and lottery moneys will be made available to associations, like the ones I have mentioned.  It is important that we get an answer to that question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="987" /> The Galway County Association has a waiting list for urgent cases.  At present there is an urgent need for 27 residential places in addition to 25 further places. Their big problem, which is also experienced by many other associations, is that the children they were caring for in the mid-eighties are now adults who need day care places as well as group housing, which I hope will soon be funded.  The accounts presented to me show that even with European Social Funding and their own fund raising, their projected deficit for 1993 is £345,000.  A similar case can be made for the Bourne View Parents Committee in Galway who are seeking £70,000 for the second phase of their development for children over six years of age.  They then will be able to proceed to the next stage.  It should be borne in mind that this sum is less than the cost of institutional care for those who avail of their services.  I hope the Minister will meet with members of that committee and respond to their needs.</P>

      <P>There is a case for issuing medical cards to the mentally handicapped and this should be considered again.  I have supplied information to the Minister which indicates that children with a mental handicap have a greater number of respiratory and throat infections.  There is medical evidence to back this up.  For some reason, however, not every health board agrees to issue medical cards to them as of right.  I believe we should set up an appeals system on a national basis so that parents could have recourse to it when they are refused a medical card for a mentally handicapped person.  All expenses should be taken into consideration when the guidelines for medical cards are being looked at.</P>
      <P>The review group on mental handicap services recommended the establishment of a data-base on people with a mental handicap and I understand from the Minister that agreement has been reached between his Department and statutory and voluntary agencies providing services for the mentally handicapped on the adoption of an information system that will be set up in the coming months.  I welcome that development.  I know the Western Health Board has taken the initiative in my area.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleague, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, for sharing his time with me.  During the short time that I was a Minister of State in the Department of Health I took a particular interest in this area along with other responsibilities and for that reason I am delighted to have the opportunity to contribute to this important debate.</P>
      <P>I will comment on a number of aspects of the services for people with a mental handicap which were raised in the course of the debate last night and earlier this evening.  I am well aware that while a great deal has been achieved a great deal remains to be achieved in developing services and back-up supports for those with a mental handicap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past many mentally handicapped <Col N="989" /> people were admitted to the psychiatric hospitals but this would not happen today.  The policy of successive Ministers for Health in recent times is that a person with a mental handicap should not be admitted to a psychiatric hospital unless there is an underlying psychiatric disorder which cannot be treated in any other way.  The report of the review group on mental handicap services entitled &ldquo;Needs and Abilities&rdquo; endorses this policy very strongly.  It recommends that an assessment be carried out of the circumstances and needs of each person with a mental handicap and where the assessment indicates that the mentally handicapped person no longer needs care in a psychiatric setting, the report recommends that he or she should transfer to a service for the mentally handicapped. In 1992 over 80 people with a mental handicap were transferred from the psychiatric services to more appropriate placements in the services for people with a mental handicap.  At the end of December 1992 there were 1,389 people with a mental handicap in public psychiatric hospitals.  However, 447 of their number have been accommodated in redesignated units associated with those hospitals which are now part of the services for the mentally handicapped. These patients are no longer regarded as being part of the psychiatric services.  The development of appropriate programmes and the assessment of the needs of persons still in psychiatric hospitals is onging and will, I believe, lead to a further reduction in the numbers remaining in the psychiatric hospitals.  This is a major achievement and has led to an improvement in the quality of life of those who have moved into more appropriate placements in the services for people with a mental handicap.  For many years the psychiatric hospital was also a last resort for the mentally handicapped with behavioural problems, whose behaviour was too difficult to manage at home or in a centre for the mentally handicapped. It is now quite unusual for a mentally handicapped person to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital.  While most people welcome this development it poses the <Col N="990" /> question as to how disturbed mentally handicapped persons are to be cared for. This is a particularly difficult question and I know it is being examined by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Up to 20 years ago the life expectancy of a mentally handicapped person was very low.  Many died in infancy and few survived their twenties.  Thanks to improvements in medical care the life expectancy of people with a mental handicap is, as the Minister for Health pointed out, approaching that of the general population.  One of the main challenges we face is to respond to the need and meet the current demand for training places and sheltered employment for young adults.  Since 1972 the European Social Fund has provided substantial resources which have enabled the country to develop and maintain a national network of vocational training centres for people with a disability. Through our participation in the Community Disability Action Programme, we have benefited enormously from our exposure to developments taking place in Europe and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Last night some Deputies expressed concern about the reduction in EC funding to agencies, which they claim resulted from a change in the rules.  I have had the opportunity to investigate this matter and I want to assure the House that no change in the rules has taken place in relation to European Social Funding and there is no reduction in the overall amount available.  However, the actual level of funding for a particular agency may indeed be reduced as clients leave the training programme.  I understand this money is then made available to other agencies who have eligible clients in training&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Discussions with the EC Commission have been taking place on broadening the scope of ESF eligibility to allow a wider range of activity aimed at economic integration of people with <Col N="991" /> disabilities to be assisted.  I understand these discussions are at an advanced stage and will result in the authorities being able to apply EC funding in a much more flexible manner than heretofore.  I was particularly pleased to hear the Minister's comments this evening on his intention to investigate the current employment levels of people with a disability in the public service.  When I had this matter investigated a year and a half ago I was saddened to find that the quotas had not been achieved, with a few honourable exceptions.  If the public service does not fulfil its responsibilities to employ people with disabilities, how can we point to the private sector?  It is extremely important that we improve the employment prospects for people with disabilities.  Where those with a disability are in employment, it has been shown that their employment can be very productive, economically rewarding and of course most helpful to both themselves and their families.  For that reason I was very pleased to hear the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, make that commitment tonight.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Liz McManus and the Fine Gael Party.  I support this motion from a Green Party, Comhaontas Glas point of view.  It is possible to paraphrase another well known phrase, that the greatness of a nation can be judged on how it makes provision for those who cannot assert rights for themselves.  I understand that those with a mental handicap cannot vote.  That should be a measure of our concern or, indeed, lack of concern and a clarion call for us to act together without reference to party and political differences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the disparity that exists between Departments on how we make provision for the mentally handicapped will be noted, whether it is the Department of Health, the Department of Education or any other Department that may have a role.  It is not appropriate that people can obtain travel allowances from one Department and not from another.  It <Col N="992" /> does not send out a coherent message to those depending on those services.</P>
    <P>In Dublin North I know many people who depend on St. Michael's House, an institution with a very fine record but its services are extremely over-stretched.  I understand their budget allocation last year was £23,000 when in fact they needed £50,000.  They are constantly trying to claw back savings and have to disappoint people in the services provided. Some may say that Cheeverstown House might be available but I do not think they really understand the difficulty of trying to live, travel and cope with the basic everyday activities of many of the people caring for or visiting those in residential care.  Residential care is not being provided for on anything like the scale that is necessary.  Some multidisciplinary residential help is badly needed in many areas but I am aware only of the tip of the iceberg.  Much more could be said on this topic if time permitted.</P>
    <P>The great army of people who are carrying the weight of the shortfall in our services are those caring for the mentally handicapped at home and, indeed, others who find it difficult to care for themselves. Whether lay or religious people they are not recognised in monetary terms.  No account is taken in the Estimates of what it would cost to provide for the carers of those who would otherwise demand an even greater level of service from the State.</P>
    <P>In dealing with mental health it is important to consider what we mean by work.  The amount of work that is done, the stress, the late hours&mdash;sometimes all night&mdash;does not receive any recognition although there is a carer's allowance which may be of some assistance.  If that is compared with the work involved and the remuneration people get by using the telephone &mdash; making a deal here and moving money from one place to another &mdash; it is difficult to reconcile the work of one sort with another.  If we defined what we mean by work we would begin to see a resolution of this problem.  Perhaps the way forward is by means of a guaranteed basic income, which I have mentioned previously, redistributing the State dividend <Col N="993" /> not as dole or a carer's allowance but as something in which we can all partake, recognising that we all contribute to society.  Looking at the nature of work &mdash; carers are doing some of the hardest work in the country &mdash; we may see a time when we will not need to put down motions such as this and that we can fund a little better those who are doing the work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that Fine Gael have put down this motion.  It is sad that mental handicap rarely hits the headlines and any opportunity that can be taken should be availed of to keep it on the map because it is such an important area.  The debate about mental handicap and the needs of the mentally handicapped have always been hampered in the past by a lack of the most simple information, such as how many people are we talking about.  Only recently we learned that the number of people in need of residential day care is actually 2,576.  That figure is probably an underestimation because it does not take into account people who are waiting for assessment.  It is a realistic figure when you consider what is needed, and we need to face up to the responsibility of catering for their needs, enormous though the problem may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The document &mdash; Needs and Abilities &mdash; to which many Deputies referred outlined a five year programme. It was accepted by the Government, costed at £50 million and included in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  Everything was done correctly except that when it came to the point of actually paying for it the money was never fully forthcoming.  That is an indication of the extent of the problem of mental handicap.  There are lots of aspirations and fine words but when it comes down to hard cash somebody else always seems to take priority.  Many people felt there was a change of heart with the new Government.  Among the mentally handicapped and those who support them there was a clear intention, at long last, the Government would face up to this problem.  This belief was underlined <Col N="994" /> by the commitment made by the Labour Party in the run-up to the election.  The clear message was that if you voted for the Labour Party this would happen.  The reality is that that was a sham.  I do not think we should let off Fianna Fáil in relation to this problem simply because the Labour Party proved to be opportunists. When the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, sat down to negotiate, if the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs had said that this was a central plank that was non-negotiable action would have been taken.</P>

      <P>We all know that but it did not happen.  The people who were outside the gates today and who are in the gallery tonight are left to cope with all the difficulties and problems of mental handicap.  If anything the problems are recognised as being more extensive because of the increase in the number estimated.  The difference in the approach is interesting.  In the previous Government when the devaluation crisis blew up there was an immediate response and the market development fund of £50 million was put in place to meet the needs of the business sector.  That money was considered important enough to be transferred in that way.  Today we have an extraordinary decision by the Government whereby the super-rich of this country will now be looked after and are being given a gift.  What the super-rich have done to deserve this is beyond me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>If the super-rich are entitled to be given a gift we might consider providing necessities for those people who care for the mentally handicapped. <Col N="995" /> Apart from funding &mdash; which is the essential problem &mdash; there is clearly a problem in relation to the long term planning of services.  At the moment services are not integrated, they are, in a sense, developing as separate entities and suffering from lack of co-ordination. They do a great job but, to get that integration, a long term plan is needed.</P>
      <P>I was concerned at the idea that there was a transference of this from the Department of Health to the Department of Equality and Law Reform.  I understand that it is not quite like that.  However, the Department of Equality and Law Reform was supposed to be the flagship of the new Government and an indication that the marginalised, disabled, women and travellers would all be treated as central to the new Government policy, which is a bit of a joke when one looks at the budget.  The budget of the Department of Equality and Law Reform is roughly the size of the budget of my local urban district council, or, to put it another way, half the budget allocated to the Land Registry office &mdash; we all know the vast resources at the disposal of the Land Registry Office and indeed local government.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State.  The fact that, certainly since I came into this Chamber, the Minister for Health has not been here, speaks volumes &mdash; I presume he does not intend to turn up tonight.  Of course there is no press conference or television cameras and, again, mental handicap is not the kind of sexy media issue that can attract the television cameras.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the question of mental handicap, we have to face up to the fact that we are not dealing with children, we are dealing with people who have full adult <Col N="996" /> lives.  We are dealing with a growing part of our population.  Neither of these two facts has been recognised and the reality that there are many hundreds of parents who are terrified of growing old is an indication of the kind of pressure and stress with which people continually live when they do not know what the future holds for them.</P>
    <P>We know about the £8.5 million, about the difference between the promised £25 million and the £8.5 million.  I do not have to go through that again but there is a simple question here that must be answered, it is part of this debate.  Will the Government put up the cash needed to provide services?  It would probably clear people's minds if the Government simply made up its mind and cut all the surrounding flimflam in regard to mentally handicapped people.  Get rid of the plámás and the nonsense and get down to the nub of the problem.  We are talking about the financial bottom line.  I would like to hear some indication &mdash; at this stage I would be grateful for good, bad or indifferent in regard to providing cash. Let us not have this response from the Minister who says how much he wants to encourage equality and to see the mentally handicapped participate as full and equal citizens.  We heard all that and now we want to hear about funding.  It is not just Members who want to hear it, the people, not just those outside the gates today but the silent ones at home who are coping heroically day by day, want to hear it and they have not heard it yet.</P>

Time and again he extolled the virtues of Labour's concern for the underprivileged, the hardpressed and the minorities.</P>
      <P>Now that he is in a position to do something he has virtually deserted every cause he espoused with such passion for the past six years.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>He spoke about the 1,000 parents whom he had met the previous night in the Mansion House and he almost moved the House to tears.  He told us that those who were there could see the pain and the hardship firsthand, the anger that had driven mothers and fathers to the point where they intended to march on the streets of Dublin the following Friday and demand their rights. Those are the very same fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters, aunts and uncles who are in the gallery tonight.  The pain, hardship and anger is now more intense than ever.  He went on to say that he could see the shame that we who call ourselves a Christian people, who often refer to the mentally handicapped as being special should reach the stage where this group of parents were reduced <Col N="998" /> to street tactics in the face of indifferent and intransigent policy makers.</P>
      <P>From 2 p.m. this afternoon the friends and the parents of the mentally handicapped have been parading in groups outside Leinster House in the pouring rain. These people have come from the furthest corners of the country.  They have been on the road since early morning. They have driven and walked in the most inclement weather, hoping that their presence and personal vigilance will bring about a substantial change in the indifference and intransigence about which Minister Howlin spoke when he was in Opposition on 6 December 1989.  He went on to say that words were not adequate to convey the pain, despair and the feeling of hopelessness expressed so eloquently by the carers and the parents that night in the Mansion House and that these people felt forgotten.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They feel tonight that they are very much the forgotten people because a mere six months ago, a matter of days before the general election, the Director of Elections of the Labour Party, Mr. Barry Desmond, gave a written commitment to the National Association for the Mentally Handicapped of Ireland.  He said that among the detailed proposals in Labour's programme was the provision of £25 million next year &mdash; that is this year &mdash; to catch up on the Needs and Abilities report prepared by the last administration and effectively shelved. There could not be a clearer, more unequivocal and absolute commitment. There were no &ldquo;ifs&rdquo;, &ldquo;buts&rdquo; or &ldquo;maybes&rdquo;. There would be no backing out of the commitment because of financial constraints. Labour would deliver and put the mental handicap services on a proper footing once and for all.  The mental handicap associations, parents and friends of the mentally handicapped all believed Labour.  How much did they get?  A mere £8 million, unevenly distributed throughout the length and breadth of the country with a mere £158,000 going to the Western Health Board area to cater for Galway, the second largest county in the country, <Col N="999" /> Mayo the third largest and County Roscommon. Unfortunately Minister Howlin is not here tonight but whatever about political and economic promises he simply cannot play around with the lives, welfare and the dignity of the mentally handicapped.  Does Minister Howlin really know the trauma and pressure on parents trying to cope with an autistic child?  Is the Minister aware that because of a reduction of £412,000 the Western Care Association will have to cut services, let 30 staff go and close down schools?  Do he and his advisers read the newspapers which are full of letters from distraught parents trying desperately to cope with the trauma and pressure associated with handling people with mental disabilities?  Does the Minister realise that many such parents are out tonight and for the rest of the year they are prisoners in their own homes?  Is he going to stand over the cuts in services he is implementing?</P>
    <P>I have a letter from the parent of a mentally handicapped child which I am forbidden to read in full.  This letter is from Christopher Pratt whose son is mentally handicapped and it states: &ldquo;We are desperate and we know that many others are in the same position&rdquo;.  Is it right that parents should have to become public supplicants in order to beg for the most basic facilities for their children?  Is it right that such parents should have to scrounge and beg on the doorsteps in their communities for voluntary contributions in order to scrape together the semblance of a service?  Is it right that these people should be told in the second week of November 1992 that if they vote Labour they will get £25 million and a mere six weeks later they are told that will have to be cut by £17 million?  How can any Labour or Fianna Fáil Minister have the gall to come into this House and recycle the speech, in more or less the same verbiage, which the former Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon, gave to this House in reply to the 1989 debate?  Does the Minister not realise that he is hurting the dignity of people by openly admitting that he intended making the money available, <Col N="1000" /> but that in the horse-trading for Government &mdash; to which Deputy McManus rightly referred &mdash; between Deputy Spring and the Taoiseach, on their own admission, compromises had to be made?  In other words, in crunch situations the minorities, the underprivileged, the weak and the disadvantaged and, in this case, the mentally handicapped are the first to suffer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is amazing, however, how money can be found for other causes and emergencies.  Approximately £50 million was made available at the drop of a hat to cushion companies during the currency crises.  There was no problem in appointing 15 new special programme managers at a cost of approximately £40,000 each and 15 new advisers at a cost of £40,000 each, a grand total of £1.2 million in the current year and £6 million minimum during the term of office of this Government.  There is no doubt that money can be made available; it is simply a question of priority.</P>
      <P>The Minister &mdash; if he is listening &mdash; could not have put it better or more prophetically when he concluded his contribution on 6 December 1989.  He stated:</P>
      <P>The Minister has in his hand the key to unlock the rights of those mentally handicapped people and their families and I urge him tonight to use that key and unlock those rights.</P>
      <P>Deputy Howlin is now the Minister for Health.  He has that key and he did not even turn up in the House tonight to give us a chance to urge him to use it.  Priority is what we are talking about, dignity, rights, entitlements, nothing more and nothing less.  All we want is a level of service commensurate with and adequate for these people's special needs.  The parents are rightly disappointed and angry tonight, but they can rest assured that as far as Fine Gael is concerned this is not the end.  This is the beginning and the fight will go on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>There are families <Col N="1001" /> throughout the country watching the progress of this debate with an intensity that no other public debate can command. These families randomly distributed throughout the country await the outcome of the debate as if their lives depend on it because in nearly all cases their lives do depend on it.  At the end of the day, there is little room for political point scoring when it comes to dealing with the problems and the needs of the mentally handicapped.  We must all share the blame for our failure as a society and as a political system to help the families of the mentally handicapped.  My colleagues and I feel a great sense of shame when we meet families with adult or child members who are mentally handicapped, knowing that we as a society are not giving them the support they need and deserve.</P>
      <P>The families of the mentally handicapped share a burden on behalf of us all.  Today we are being challenged not to allocate blame, but to care.  The burden of care must be distributed more evenly.  In my view, the parents of those children do not ask for much &mdash; a day centre, a school place, respite care and, in some cases, permanent residential care and emergency care when necessary.  As a people our desire to care for the underprivileged is legendary.  Any further abdication by this House of our responsibilities to the families of the mentally handicapped would be a poor reflection of the wishes of the people.</P>
      <P>The needs of the mentally handicapped have been well documented tonight and last night.  The special needs, the special facilities and the money required to meet those needs and facilities were all spelled out.  I feel strongly about the need to support the family in the home who is trying to care for their mentally handicapped child or adult for as long as possible. We must ensure that services are provided locally and not have families of mentally handicapped squabbling about the supply of continence pads and other issues that should be dealt with as a matter of course to meet their enormous problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should provide respite care so that <Col N="1002" /> families can care for their mentally handicapped for as long as possible.  There should be weekend and holiday care available for such families.  On a financial level, families who are caring for their mentally handicapped children are saving this State a fortune and the least we can do is ensure that we are standing beside them when they need a weekend or a fortnight's holiday.</P>
    <P>We must pay tribute to the voluntary sector, the nuns, the brothers and various other people who for years have shouldered the burden of the work in this area and continue to do so today.  There should be a balance between psychiatric and psychological services, but I do not have time to develop my thoughts in that regard today.</P>
    <P>We heard a great deal about ethics in Government.  What about ethics in electioneering and winning seats on the backs of the most vulnerable by promising something and then failing to deliver it?  The concern of ageing parents about what will happen to their mentally handicapped children when they have gone has been well documented by my colleagues on this side of the House.  Such people deserve cast iron guarantees having shouldered the burden for so long. They deserve cast iron guarantees that when they are gone or can cope no longer there will be full-time residential care for their children.</P>
    <P>It is a very sobering thought for those of us who have been dealt a kinder hand by fate as we criticise our teenage children about the level of noise from their ghetto blasters, how they wear their hair, for answering back or failing to get sufficient educational achievements.  It concentrates the mind if we consider the burden on other families in caring for their mentally handicapped children.  It puts the problems of life in perspective and is a lesson in what really matters.</P>
    <P>We need to create a culture of caring. We talk about community care, but the time has come to ask if the community really cares.  Creating an environment of equality can never be shown more clearly than by ensuring equality for the most disadvantaged and inarticulate segment of <Col N="1003" /> society.  The measure of a society is how well it cares for its most vulnerable members and as far as I am concerned this Government stands indicted on that measurement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the Minister for Health is not present and I am not here to speak on his behalf.  However, I would like to put on record that he is attending a European Council of Health Ministers meeting in Brussels.  He was present in the House last night and I do not believe anybody would wish him to forego his European business.  I am here to make my own case and, like Deputy Doyle, I am not interested in point scoring. That is a negative business.  Histrionics or opportunism are no good in the final analysis, especially when dealing with the mentally handicapped.</P>
      <P>The Minister has allocated the greatest amount of money ever in respect of the mentally handicapped, £209 million.  The Labour Party undertook to spend a further £16.5 million as it believes that money is necessary.  It hopes to spend that money in the next two to three years within the lifetime of this Government. The sum of £16.5 million would greatly help the mentally handicapped. However, money does not solve every problem with which the Minister has to contend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the last three weeks I have been lobbied by different groups representing health interests.  Two weeks ago I was lobbied by parents and social workers in relation to child abuse in our society. They called for the Minister to implement the Child Care Act in full and this would cost a further £40 million.  I fully support the implementation of that Act but £40 million does not come like manna from heaven.  I did not hear anyone say where that money would come from.  Last week I was lobbied by people representing the physically handicapped and I support their case also.  They wanted £X million but nobody has said where that money would come from.  I support the parents and friends of the mentally handicapped. However, there is no tap that can be <Col N="1004" /> turned on to provide the money.  I read recently where Deputy Yates called for a cutback of £200 million in public spending. How can Deputies on the one hand ask for public spending to be cut by £200 million and on the other advocate spending £16.5 million?</P>

Their commitment and dedication was exploited in the most cynical and political way by one party prior to the election.  It is ironic that the Labour Party document <i>Trust in Politics</i> has betrayed the trust of the parents and friends of the mentally handicapped.  It is ironic on a day when a major tax amnesty was given to many of the wealthy people here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The review group set up by the Government in 1986 to advise on services for the mentally handicapped presented its findings in May 1990.  It recommended that £50 million be spent over five years on services.  The Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, prior to the election promised that £25 million would immediately be put in place to make up for the delay in spending money on services.</P>

      <P>The review group in arriving at the figure of 1,700 mentally handicapped persons seriously underestimated the extent of the problem.  There are almost 2,600 seriously handicapped people.  The Government has reneged on the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> by seriously under-funding the services for the mentally handicapped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan outlined in detail the national position.  I will refer to statistics in relation to the Southern Health Board area and to comments made by the Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, to Mr. Ger South of Limerick.  The Minister said that the only complaints he received in relation to services for the mentally handicapped were from the Limerick area.  That is a gross untruth.  If that is all he heard, it is an indictment on Deputies from the rest of the country.  In Cork city there are 17 psychotic young people walking the streets with nowhere to go. Some weeks ago I spoke about a 13 year old who for two years did not attend school and was abandoned.  The Southern Health Board in 1992 drafted a plan for the mentally handicapped which the Government accepted.  The plan, now in its second year, is no longer relevant because the money promised by the Government is not forthcoming.  The <Col N="1008" /> £2.5 million expected this year has not been forthcoming and the plan is now redundant.  There are 879 mentally handicapped persons in the Southern Health Board area.  This Government has betrayed the trust placed in them by the families of the mentally handicapped and it has also betrayed the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> agreed with the social partners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion before the House has come about because of the anger, frustration, the serious concern and sense of despair amongst all of those people involved in the management and care of the most vulnerable section of our society, the mentally handicapped.  It remains one of the greatest anomalies of Irish life that in spite of the progress that has been made there is still far too great a reliance on voluntary input and not enough State support to encourage that voluntary work.  It is a sad fact of life that were it not for the courageous dedication of voluntary groups giving of their time and effort a great many of the needs of people with a mental handicap would be unfulfilled.  We have a responsibility to support that effort and endeavour by ensuring that a genuine measure of financial backing is made available from the resources of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is on record as one of the Labour Party's election promises that the now famous sum of £25 million would be allocated for the provision of services in the area of mental health.  It was a clear and unequivocal statement of intent with no strings attached.  It formed a significant part of Labour's election manifesto and I have no doubt that many of the electorate in my county of Tipperary supported Labour on the strength of this issue alone. I now witness the anger and frustration of those people at what they see as a reneging on that promise.  It is nothing new for a Government to fail to deliver on election promises but it comes as a bitter disappointment when that failure causes so much hardship and deprivation <Col N="1009" /> to a section of the community which is totally unable to defend itself and which is so reliant on outside support.  To have their hopes and expectations built up to such a degree on the basis of vote-catching and then to have those hopes and expectations so cruelly dashed is nothing short of a scandal.</P>
    <P>The dimensions of the problem can be measured under three broad headings. The first is the natural desire of parents to do the best they possibly can for their children to help them reach their full potential in life and to achieve their own niche in society.  That desire and aspiration is intensified when the child starts life with a handicap but to most parents this handicap merely serves to spur them on to greater effort.  Why should the attention and support given to such a child be any less simply because the child is different?  The parents can and always do offer the emotional and caring environment which is the first step forward. Emotional and loving support in itself is insufficient without an adequate community response.  That community response must come in the form of finance and services, and as the elected representatives of the community at large we must provide those services.  To do otherwise is failing in our responsibilities.</P>
    <P>The second broad area where we must examine this issue is in the provision of adequate workshop facilities for the training and guidance of young people. These workshops serve a two-fold purpose. They provide a platform for the training and development of the individual and for the nurturing of the innate talents that lie within.  In my constituency I was very conscious of the work being done by St. Cronan's and St. Anne's workshops in Roscrea and by the Guardian Angels pre-school in Thurles.  These organisations have been doing marvellous work for years largely as a result of committed groups of volunteers and helpers who are dedicated to the task.</P>
    <P>In recent times there has been a splendid initiative in Thurles whereby that work with young children has now been taken a stage further through the setting up of Thurles Workshop Trust to look <Col N="1010" /> after the needs of young adults.  As a member of the Mid-Western Health Board we were able to make an allocation of £52,000 towards the provision of facilities in a building which has been given to the workshop trust on very generous terms by the Irish Sugar Company.  The response of the community at all levels to this project has been nothing short of magnificent.  The Government must now do likewise by ensuring that adequate funding is made available to provide for proper staffing to ensure the future of the workshop.</P>
    <P>The third dimension is the great concern expressed by parents relating to the future.  How often do we hear, &ldquo;what will happen to our children when we are gone and no longer able to care for them?&rdquo; That is a question that is posed frequently by parents.  As of now there is no answer for them, nothing which could inspire confidence in the future, nothing which can allay the genuine fears which they have about the welfare of their loved ones.  This is an area where the Government must take the lead and ensure a natural progression of the child into adulthood.</P>
    <P>The budget allocations are totally inadequate and the Government's perspective on the important issues is clouded and uncertain.  It is no longer credible to state that money is not available. There was no problem providing money for programme managers, special advisers, for new offices in plush surroundings and for other trappings which most people would agree are merely propping up an already top heavy bureaucracy.  The Labour Party is now crying wolf on the issue and blaming Fianna Fáil for its failure to deliver.</P>
    <P>The sale of Government shares in Greencore and Irish Life has proved to be financially rewarding.  The Government has approved millions more than was anticipated.  What is happening to that additional money and where is it being spent?  Even the most lavishly equipped offices and excessive consultancy fees cannot account for the amount being generated.  We must seriously question the priorities of a <Col N="1011" /> Government that seems to be deeply divided on a number of crucial issues, a far cry from the rosy picture painted during the heady days of the unlikely marriage between the Government partners.  That marriage, and subsequent honeymoon, are now a thing of the past and unfortunately Labour is gradually coming to terms with the reality of their small status alongside the Fianna Fáil juggernaut which blindly streamrolls its way through Government as it has always done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank those Members who have contributed to the debate, particularly my many colleagues in Fine Gael and also the Progressive Democrats, Democratic Left and the Green Party for indicating their support for this motion.  It is most regrettable that the Government has refused to respond in any meaningful way to the points raised in this debate over the past two evenings.  It is sad that the motion appears to have elicited no response from Government.  The acute shortage of day care and residential places, the curtailment of European Social Funding and the serious consequences thereof and the absence of a coherent overall national policy for the mentally handicapped all remain unaddressed in the response of the Minister last night, his colleagues in the Labour Party and those on the back benches of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can only conclude, in the light of the fierce opposition of both Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party to this motion, that after only four months in office the Government has become submerged in its own arrogance.  This smugness undoubtedly stems from a feeling on the part of Government that with a huge majority of 35 there is little this House can do to prompt appropriate action.  I challenge the Minister for Health, or his partners in Government, to indicate how effective his much ventilated increase of £8 million has been or will be this year <Col N="1012" /> for those in crisis.  Does he accept that 1,400 residential and 1,300 day places are needed as a matter of extreme urgency? Does he accept that there are 3,000 people in this State with a mental handicap who have no service available to them?  Does he conveniently forget the commitment made by the Tánaiste and Leader of the Labour Party in the course of the recent election campaign?  Former Deputy Barry Desmond, a former Minister for Health, demonstrated some knowledge in the matter by way of a letter which has been quoted in the House. This is of little importance now that the Labour Party is in power and Mr. Desmond is a member of the European Parliament. How can the Labour Party say in November that £25 million would be allocated and six months later, having reneged on the promise, come into the House and compliment the Minister by saying that everything is now in order and there is no problem?</P>
    <P>The Labour Party has betrayed the people's trust in a callous and cynical manner.  Votes were cast and seats were won on deception and misrepresentation of a fraudulent nature.</P>

      <P>The report of the review group on mental handicap services, Needs and Abilities must be removed from the hidden shelves and dusted down.  I call now on those Labour Party and Fianna Fáil Party Deputies who wish to associate themselves with their policy and commitments on this matter &mdash; in this regard I compliment Deputy de Valera for coming into the House and calling for more funding &mdash; to support the motion thereby urging the Government to take seriously the recommendations of the review group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reality remains in mid-1993 that Fine Gael is the only party with a comprehensive policy on the matter and we have had it since 1991.  Thousands of parents, carers and friends of the mentally handicapped are stressed, depressed and anxious.  Hundreds can no longer <Col N="1013" /> cope.  The problem has reached crisis proportions and the adoption by the Dáil of this motion tonight will demonstrate cross party solidarity and indicate a willingness to raise the status of a forgotten people.  By supporting the motion Deputies can show the primacy of parliament by sending a message to Cabinet that the order of priorities needs to be <Col N="1014" /> changed and must be done as a matter of great urgency.</P>
    <P>I commend the motion to the House and call for all-party support on the matter so that once and for all we can join hands, put our heads together and address this particular problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Respect for the law is a cornerstone of any democratic society.  It must be seen that crime does not pay. People who commit offences must be subject to the due process of the law. These are fundamental principles taught to every school child.</P>
      <P>The tax amnesty announced by the Government last night for money illicitly taken out of the country and stashed in secret bank accounts abroad is, according to my estimate, the fifth occasion in not much more than five years when these principles have been breached by successive Governments in respect of large scale tax crime.  There is, it seems, one law for the tax-compliant citizen and a different law &mdash; or no law &mdash; for the super-rich who commit these crimes against society.</P>
      <P>We had, in 1988, a general tax amnesty, followed by amnesties for unpaid capital acquisitions tax, unpaid stamp duty, and unpaid PRSI.  Now to add insult to injury the Government introduces yet another amnesty for tax cheats on the very same day that the Fianna Fáil and Labour Parties voted through section 7 of the 1993 Finance Bill which adds a further burden on the PAYE sector in the form of the unjust 1 per cent income levy.  Is it any wonder that there is such a palpable sense of anger and frustration about this development among workers who must, week in and week out, meet their tax obligations to the community?  Clearly the policy of the Government in regard to the tax obligations of the rich continues to be all carrot and no stick.</P>
      <P>Those who will benefit from the extraordinarily benevolent approach of the Government are people who moved their money out of the country in contravention of exchange control requirements and with the specific purpose of illegally evading obligations to pay tax as required under Irish law.  This is not a &ldquo;victimless crime&rdquo;.  Every pound successfully evaded in this way means that another pound has to come out of the pockets and purses of PAYE workers.</P>
      <P>There are no sound economic arguments for &ldquo;Albert's Amnesty&rdquo;.  The country is awash with money following the inflow of almost £6 billion following devaluation, which in turn has driven interest rates to parity with or below the German rates.  Whatever argument may have existed at the nadir of the currency crisis for a fiscal boost to the economy, it certainly does not exist now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most likely effect of &ldquo;Albert's Amnesty&rdquo; will be to drive up property and land prices.  The typical tax cheat will find a block of flats at Mespil Road a <Col N="1017" /> more attractive investment than an empty factory in Galway.  With exchange controls gone, the super-rich who may be interested for whatever reason in regularising their position, may move their money out again as soon as it suits them. The rate of return from indigenous industry is too weak to attract the kind of investor who is prepared to break the law in the first place to evade paying taxes.  The net gain to the Exchequer is the proposed revenue windfall deriving from the 15 per cent off the top.  Any pretence that it has any wider economic considerations is wrong.</P>
    <P>Tax avoidance and evasion in this country has become almost an industry in its own right, with those who have the wealth to employ accountants and tax advisers availing of every possible device and loophole to limit or reduce their tax liability, while the thumbscrew is turned ever tighter on ordinary workers and those on social welfare.  The latest amnesty will simply reinforce the culture of evasion and avoidance which permeates sections of Irish business.  Why should the wealthy bother to pay taxes when they know that, if they can manage to evade paying up for a couple of years, they will almost certainly be around to benefit from one of the tax amnesties down the road?</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Albert's amnesty&rdquo; is the crowning achievement of the Taoiseach's own &ldquo;<i>annus horribilis</i>&rdquo;.  It is an own goal for the Cabinet who acquiesced in it and an insult to the trade union movement. Following on the 1 per cent income levy, the Greencore privatisation débâcle, the unprecedented hike in telephone charges, regrettably, it is further evidence of how quickly the Labour Party has lost touch with its own constituency. SIPTU, my own union, which has financially supported a great many Labour Deputies, has denounced any amnesty for tax cheats.  Indeed today the tax officials own union, IMPACT, has described it as &ldquo;an act of unpredecented irresponsibility which will undermine the stability and equity of the taxation base&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is no secret about the vehement opposition of officials in Revenue and <Col N="1018" /> the Department of Finance.  I understand that their advice to the Minister was backed up by outside independent expertise.  I regret very much that the Minister for Finance is not in the House but I take it that he did espouse the cause of his own officials in Cabinet because it would be a demoralising blow to the officials at the coalface who are attempting to tackle tax evasion and fight tax crime if the Minister for Finance did other than that.</P>
    <P>Rather than wiping the slate clean for tax cheats, the Government should be tackling the shortcomings in the administration of our tax system which allows this successful level of evasion to continue. We would not have a reported £2 billion out there if there were not defects in the system.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has pointed out that less than 1 per cent of those who pay under the selfassessment system have been subjected to full audit, and added that four out of five of those audited were found to be liable to additional payments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has decided to introduce a new once-off incentive for moneys which have not been disclosed for tax purposes.  This incentive will take the form of an amnesty involving a charge on the amount of funds not previously disclosed and will contribute to the productive economy.  The Government has asked the Minister for Finance to prepare, as soon as possible, a detailed scheme.</P>
      <P>The Government's initiative will benefit taxpayers in general and the Irish economy through the release of funds for productive use, for example, as investment capital; increased annual revenue for the Exchequer; an improved flow of funds throughout the economy, with spin-off effects in investment and job creation; and the improvement of our external reserves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new scheme is a final opportunity for those concerned to regularise their affairs and will be accompanied by the introduction of stringent penalties for the future.  The Government's intention is <Col N="1019" /> that the new amnesty will come into force as soon as possible and will be available for a short period only.  Those who abuse the new amnesty or who ignore it will do so in the clear knowledge that they will face stringent penalties which will be fully enforced against them.</P>
    <P>There are no reliable estimates of the amount of money involved &mdash; Deputy Rabbitte mentioned £2 billion; other Members mentioned other sums &mdash; but informed guesstimates suggest that the amount of money invested abroad, with profits arising abroad, or in accounts here within the country could be very significant. Previous experience with the 1988 amnesty showed that, while the initial estimate of take was £30 million, the outcome from that amnesty was in excess of £500 million.  I want to stress that, at that time, the highest estimate that all the officials involved could reach was £30 million.  Yet the ultimate yield was £500 million which has continued to flow into our economy to the benefit of our taxpayers ever since.</P>

      <P>The Government will be concerned to prevent any possible implications of the new amnesty for Revenue's ongoing enforcement and collection programme. This improved very significantly after the 1988 amnesty.  It is mischievous to suggest that the introduction of a further major amnesty at this stage could lead to a deterioration in compliance by normally scrupulous taxpayers.  My own experience with PRSI collection is that, far from undermining collection, an amnesty followed by penalties has brought PRSI collection to an all-time high.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Today is a wet, miserable day, the kind of miserable day to make one wonder, even if one had a job, whether one should get up but, for the 300,000 people who signed the live register today, or who will sign it tomorrow, I am sure when they looked out this morning they wondered whether there was anything worth getting up for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Scattered throughout the length and breadth of this country are communities in every niche and corner with social employment schemes at the ready, in the traps, all set to go, all awaiting the green light from the Minister.  They have been organised by FÁS, Manpower staff and placement staff.  They are avid communities who want to put in place recreation schemes, sporting schemes, <Col N="1021" /> cultural schemes in order to enhance their communities.</P>
    <P>One of the best schemes ever devised has been the social employment scheme because it has given, particularly the long term unemployed, an opportunity to face into the open daylight with dignity.  It has given them a sense of purpose and motivation.  It has enabled people who have been on the live register for three and four years, very often longer, the incentive to take a shovel, trowel, a saw, or spirit level into their hand and go out and engage in work and at the same time, contribute to their community.</P>
    <P>Surely it is economic lunacy, at a time when there is so much work to be done, so many people ready, willing and able to do it, to pay anybody £55 unemployment assistance when, for a mere £15 supplement, the same people could be engaged for one year on a social employment scheme as part of a team or community effort?</P>
    <P>I have been approached by people and communities in County Mayo, in particular, and in adjacent Counties Galway and Roscommon on the periphery of my constituency, who have been told that no further social employment schemes will go ahead in County Mayo in particular until November or December next.  We are facing into the summer season, with, I hope, better weather than we have had to date, into long, daylight hours and it is absolute economic lunacy to hold back on the stocks social employment schemes, not give them the green light until October, November or pre-Christmas. The obvious thing would be to give them the go-ahead and make money available to enable the communities concerned to harness and exploit natural resources, such as daylight, and to maximise the return.  I appeal to the Minister to use his good offices with the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to have additional means made available to enable those communities who are avid, willing, hungry and ready to go to proceed with work on the schemes in the next few weeks so that they can maximise the return during the summer months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Hyland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's concerns in raising this matter.  In the Book of Estimates an Exchequer allocation of £83.811 million was made available to FÁS for expenditure on the social employment scheme in 1993.  Recently the Government approved the provision of a further £13.5 million for the scheme bringing total funding in 1993 to £97.3 million.  This allocation will provide opportunities for an average of 15,500 people on the social employment scheme and the community employment development programme which replaced the social employment scheme in the 12 areas designated under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> area based strategy to combat long term unemployment each week.  The number of participants involved at any particular time will vary, depending on the number of projects in operation.</P>
      <P>The scheme is the principal manpower intervention aimed at the long term unemployed and has been in operation since 1984.  It provides opportunities, albeit on a part-time basis, for long term unemployed people, to become involved for a year in a work related situation. This provides the discipline of working again and gives an opportunity to learn new skills and practise existing skills which should improve the prospects for participants of obtaining employment when full-time employment opportunities arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Just over half of participants on the SES and CEDP are persons with adult and child dependants.  This level of participation by older long term unemployed people with dependants is very satisfactory and has come about due to the availability since 1990 of a child dependant allowance.  The current levels of payment to participants are £75 per week for a person without a dependant, £107.50 per week for a participant with an adult dependant and participants with children can also get up to £12.50 per week per child.  I am happy that these rates will be increased from July next to £77 for a participant without a dependant, <Col N="1023" /> £110.70 for a participant with an adult dependant, while the rate for a child will be up to £12.80.</P>
    <P>The scheme represents a successful collaboration between local communities and the State in that local groups sponsoring projects come forward with proposals for projects in their communities, many of which involve improvements to local amenities.  In addition, local communities must come up with a certain element of funding for the projects to supplement the assistance available under the scheme for materials and supervision.  A wide variety of projects is undertaken under the scheme ranging from projects improving the local environment, sports, arts, tourism projects to community development and all Deputies are well aware of the benefits to local communities and local unemployed people brought about through the scheme.</P>
    <P>The scheme is, however, to a certain extent a victim of its own success and one of the difficulties which has arisen over the years is that some voluntary groups providing services on a continuing basis at local level have come to rely on schemes such as the social employment scheme for assistance in providing their services.  As such the schemes are in danger of becoming project driven.  The social employment scheme, and Teamwork which is targeted at unemployed people under 25, were not intended to provide assistance on an ongoing basis for projects.  The intention with regard to the social employment scheme was that projects would be of a finite nature which would allow flexibility in providing opportunities for long term unemployed people where such opportunities were needed, having regard to the level of unemployment in different parts of the country and the available resources. Obviously it would be unfair if projects were automatically renewed each year as this would mean that new projects, no matter how deserving or necessary, could not be considered.</P>
    <P>Intake to the scheme must be managed by FÁS to ensure that expenditure is kept <Col N="1024" /> within the available resources and an equitable distribution of projects throughout the country based on local needs.  FÁS must have the flexibility to manage the scheme having regard to the needs of the long term unemployed throughout the country and the available Exchequer resources.</P>
    <P>EC support for the scheme is being sought in the context of the 1994 to 1999 round of Structural Funds with the aim of moving towards a doubling of participation levels to 30,000 each year.  The Government was very conscious that some long term unemployed people were not interested in participating in the social employment scheme because they would lose their secondary social welfare benefits.  The community employment development programme has replaced the social employment scheme in the 12 <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> areas on a pilot basis since last October.  Under the programme a training element is being provided on projects involving 15 or more participants who retain their secondary social welfare benefits such as butter vouchers, fuel allowance, etc.  The operation of the programme will be evaluated to assess its effectiveness in assisting persons who are long term unemployed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this important matter because I want to draw attention to a hidden expense borne by all publicans who provide musical entertainment on the premises.  They are obliged to pay royalties to the Irish Music Rights Organisation, the IMRO but these royalties leave the country and are, therefore, of no benefit to the Government or the taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is now common and, indeed, expected by the public that some form of entertainment will be provided in a public house, be it live or recorded music or, indeed, radio, television or video.  The playing of music in a private house does <Col N="1025" /> not create a liability to pay a licence fee to either the IMRO or the PPI, Phonographic Performance (Ireland) Limited. However, music when reproduced in public is deemed to be a breach of the copyright owned by the original composer of the music or the author of the lyrics unless there is agreement with the owner of the copyright to play it and a licence fee paid.  In this regard the IMRO claims to represent the owners of copyright and, accordingly, is entitled to a licence fee or royalties when music &mdash; live or recorded &mdash; is played in public.</P>
    <P>The IMRO charge varying rates based on the size of the premises, anticipated attendance and the form in which the music is to be played, a live band, television, radio, compact disc or tape. Invariably, the contract amount or licence fee increases and there is no price control or Government restriction, the price increase has not been related to the cost of living index in the past.  IMRO employees are now very active nationwide in demanding and collecting licence fees and this is becoming an increasing burden on publicans.</P>
    <P>The PPI claims that it holds the copyright in respect of recordings of music. This is in addition to the wholly independent licence fee charged by IMRO. When the recording is then played in public, PPI claims that it is entitled to a licence fee in respect of the use of its copyright in the playing of music by record, compact disc, tape together with recorded music played on television and on radio, excluding RTE.  The fee payable to PPI is additional to the fee payable to IMRO.  This in itself has caused confusion to publicans who simply cannot understand why two licence fees are payable in respect of playing one piece of music in public.  This is unsatisfactory and publicans are of the opinion there is a treble charge, which is unfair in the circumstances as RTE pays a licence fee to both IMRO and PPI.</P>
    <P>The publicans in my rural constituency of Sligo-Leitrim have suffered severely due to the economic recession, unemployment and emigration.  Many publicans <Col N="1026" /> are finding it difficult to stay in business.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to investigate the activities of IMRO and PPI and to take whatever measures are necessary to solve this problem.  I endorse the Vintners Federation's recent statement that the copyright legislation is unfair and I call on the Minister to deal with the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's concern.  I am, of course, aware of the system which exists for the licensing of copyright works and the collection of copyright royalties, and of the types of disputes in this area which have arisen in recent years.</P>
      <P>These are normal features of the international copyright system which could not function in practice without the use of collecting societies.  These societies licence the relevant copyright works and collect the royalties which form part of the remuneration of the songwriters, composers, record producers and other rightowners.</P>
      <P>The Irish Music Rights Organisation IMRO, is the licensing society for the songwriters, composers etc. and Phonographic Performance (Ireland) Limited collects royalties on behalf of record producers, with a special arrangement for performing artists.  Those commercial operators who use music for the entertainment of their customers, whether it be in a disco, hotel or wherever, need to have a central organisation from whom to obtain a licence.  If the songwriters and so on had no available representative to grant a licence, then disco operators, for example, could not legally play the music and so could not run their disco.</P>
      <P>It is a fact of life, therefore, that the copyright owners need a collecting society to license their music and collect the royalties, while the music users need a collecting society as a central source from which to obtain a licence.  It is, of course, possible for commercial music users to use music which is not covered by copyright but clearly there is most commercial interest in the most popular music which is, in general, licensed by the collecting societies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1027" /> In these circumstances it is inevitable that disputes will arise between the owners of the copyright and the users of the copyright works.  I am aware of disputes in this area covering the amount of the royalty fees, the bases by which the fees are charged and other related issues.  There are also complaints about the ways in which the copyright owners enforce their rights.</P>
    <P>However, the Copyright Act, 1963, provides for dispute settlement by the Controller of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks in such cases.  The controller is independent in the exercise of his statutory functions and I cannot, of course, comment on cases which are <i>sub judice.</i> I am informed, however, that there are 62 cases involving copyright disputes before the controller but most of these are in suspense pending the outcome of an appeal to the Supreme Court on a preliminary decision of the controller.  Copyright law in Ireland must, of course, comply with our international commitments in this area, notably the Berne Convention for the protection of literary and artistic works and the Rome Convention for the protection of performers, producers of phonograms and broadcasting organisations.  Increasingly, EC legislation is also having an impact on Irish copyright law.</P>
    <P>The copyright system is, therefore, an international one.  Similar, and often more stringent, copyright laws exist in other countries and our own successful international artists also receive significant royalties from collecting societies abroad.  Nevertheless, I have listened carefully to the comments made about the existing system and will take them into consideration.  In the near future Irish legislation will have to give effect to a number of EC copyright measures; to intellectual property provisions which may arise from the current GATT discussions; to the copyright provisions of the European Economic Area Agreement, and perhaps to a number of measures in other international agreements.</P>
    <P>To comply with all these obligations, <Col N="1028" /> amendment of the Copyright Act, 1963, will be required.  My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Séamus Brennan, announced in this House last week that it is his intention to carry out a review of the Act which will incorporate the necessary amendments to comply with the obligations referred to and to implement any other changes considered useful or beneficial in the Irish context. An aim in reviewing the legislation is to seek the correct balance between the protection of copyright owners and the users of copyright material.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Headage Payment Scheme.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to you, Sir, for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  It is an open secret that consideration is being given in Government circles to changes in the headage payment scheme which has been in operation since 1977.  Some weeks ago a Minister of State was openly canvassing the idea of changes in the scheme in the course of discussions in the context of these spurious so-called consultations on the next phase of EC Structural Funds. Her proposal was that some of the moneys should be taken from the headage payment scheme and devoted to other purposes.  More recently it has been revealed that an off-farm income limit for eligibility for these headage payments is being considered, apparently with the intention of restricting the application of the scheme mainly to smaller full-time farmers in the disadvantaged areas.  In my view those proposals are utterly misconceived and could be fatal to rural communities and to small towns and villages right across the disadvantaged areas of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the scheme very well.  I was working in Brussels for the Irish Farmers Association when the scheme was first conceived and I was working in the Commission when the scheme was born and for some years after it came into effect. I say with that knowledge that the clear purpose of the scheme is to channel a <Col N="1029" /> direct income subsidy into areas where farming is particularly difficult in order to ensure the maintenance of a reasonable economic and social structure and a reasonable level of population.  That was the sole aim of the headage payment scheme.</P>
    <P>It is outrageous that the Economic and Social Research Institute is seeking to justify proposals for diverting funds away from this scheme on the grounds that it is only an income subsidy scheme, as if there was something wrong with income subsidy schemes.  Let us be perfectly clear that this is an income subsidy scheme and it has never been represented as anything else.  It is efficient at fulfilling the purpose it was set up for and it is not in need of any improvement from the smart aleck Labour Party &ldquo;fairyland&rdquo; economics. With effect from 1990 there has been no off-farm income limit on eligibility for the scheme.  There was an income limit which was removed in 1989 on the basis of the income situation on farms at that time.  If anything the situation has got worse since then and income on farms in disadvantaged areas has slipped even further behind other incomes.</P>
    <P>There are studies quoted in that unpublished NESC report which show that very clearly.  For example, there were 80,000 farms in 1990 in the disadvantaged areas where income was below £5,000 from the farm and where the farm operator had no other income. Equally, it appears that in 1990 there were about 27,000 in disadvantaged areas where the farm income was less than £5,000 and where the farm operator had another source of income.  Those of us who are familiar with the disadvantaged areas will know that in the vast majority of those cases the off-farm income was small and frequently it is either sporadic or seasonal.  In 1990 45 per cent of Irish farmers were part-time in the disadvantaged areas where subsidies, including headage payments and other transfers, added over 50 per cent to appallingly low farm income figures.  A further 15 per cent of the total number of Irish farmers were full-time in the disadvantaged areas where subsidies, including <Col N="1030" /> headage payments, added another 25 per cent to very modest levels of farm family income.</P>
    <P>These data show very clearly that there can be no justification for the imposition at this time, or at any time, of an off-farm income limit for eligibility for this scheme.</P>
    <P>I need tonight, and I would like to have, a very simple direct response from the Minister.  All I want the Minister to say is that there will be no interference with the headage payments scheme.  If the Minister says any more than that, and if he qualifies his answer in any way, then I will know that the headage payments scheme is under threat and with it the economic and social fabric of a vast part of rural Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to respond to Deputy Dukes on a matter which is of considerable concern to the agricultural industry.  I accept that Deputy Dukes would have an interest.</P>
      <P>There are no proposals to impose an off-farm income limit for receipt of aid under the headage scheme.</P>
      <P>Funding for this scheme is covered within this Department's overall allocation under the existing round of Structural Funds 1989-93.  By the end of 1993, total public funding for this measure is estimated to be of the order of £436 million with £242 million of this coming from the European Community. This scheme is only one of a number of measures covered by the existing FEOGA allocation under the Structural Funds.  The other main ones are on-farm investment, marketing and processing of agricultural/fishery products, control of farmyard pollution, farm diversification schemes, small and community enterprises and forestry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the next round of Structural Funds 1994-99, my Department has put forward broad proposals to the Department of Finance covering the agriculture, rural development, food and forestry areas.  These proposals include provision for adequate funding for the <Col N="1031" /> continuation of the headage scheme, including commitments under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and the Programme for a Partnership Government.  As the Government has not yet made a decision on the allocation of funds to each Department, I am not in a position to decide on the specific amount which can be allocated to the headage or any other area.</P>
    <P>I should point out to the Deputy that it is a condition for seeking further Structural Funds in the post-1993 period that member states carry out an evaluation of the economic impact of existing measures.  In that regard the ESRI was asked by the Department of Finance to undertake a study of the whole Community Support Framework for Ireland and to make recommendations for seeking Structural Funds in the next six years in the light of the Government's main objectives of economic growth and job creation.  The Deputy will appreciate that some schemes would rate more highly than headage in this regard.</P>
    <P>In this context let me refer briefly to the question raised by the Deputy as regards the possible imposition of an off-farm income limit and the threat this would pose to rural communities.  I would not accept that an off-farm income limit would automatically pose such a threat. One of the main objectives of these payments is to enable farmers maintain a reasonable level of income in disadvantaged areas and it could be legitimately argued that those with a certain level of off-farm income do not need such support.  As the Deputy is aware, an off-farm income limit applied between 1979 and 1989 under several administrations <Col N="1032" /> and did not cause any appreciable problem in that period.</P>
    <P>In the context of the available funds from the European Community and our aim for the retention of the maximum number of farm families on the land, I would hold the view that the maximum level of support should be provided for those who are most in need.  Having said that, I want to reiterate the fact that there are no proposals to impose an off-farm limit in the context of the headage payment scheme.</P>
    <P>The main objectives of the headage scheme of maintaining a reasonable income for farmers, conserving the countryside from an environmental aspect and preventing further depopulation of rural areas apply throughout the Community and are acknowledged at Council of Ministers level as making a very valuable contribution to the maintenance of populations in rural areas. They thus will continue to be a major part of the FEOGA element of the Structural Funds.  The extent to which we target these payments within the disadvantaged areas in the future will obviously depend on the specific funding which can be allocated to these measures out of our overall allocation and also on the extent to which it is perceived by the Government that the most deserving people are being targeted under the various schemes.</P>

      <P>The total cost figure for Ireland's participation at EXPO '92 is still pending final settlement of accounts with main contractors, but is not expected to exceed £3,471 million.  Participation was funded by the national lottery, which provided £3,322 million, and the balance was provided by private sponsorship.</P>
      <P>Our participation in EXPO afforded Ireland a valuable opportunity to show all that is best about our country, including its attractiveness both as a holiday destination and as a location for foreign investment.  Any further invitation to participate at world fairs and expositions will be considered on its merits, having regard to commercial considerations, participation costs, and potential benefits to the Irish economy.</P>

      <P>Out total exports to the US in 1992 came to over £1.367 billion, an increase of over £58.4 million or 4 per cent over 1991.  This continued steady <Col N="878" /> growth was achieved despite slow demand in the US economy during 1992. The signs of sustained economic recovery in the US so far this year are encouraging and, if it continues, our exporters will be well placed to achieve an even better performance in 1993.</P>
      <P>An Bord Tráchtála plans for 1993-94 aim to expand Ireland's indigenous presence in North America.  This will be achieved through sourcing and promotion programmes and through a rapid expansion of the board's geographical coverage of the market.  A 15 per cent growth in indigenous exports to £560 million is targeted, incorporating an 11 per cent increase in the exports of indigenous industrial products such as engineering, electronics, telecommunications, print and software, bringing this sector to over £250 million. The 1993-94 programme includes presentations to major purchasers, buyer visits to Ireland, trade fair promotions and specialist missions.</P>
      <P>The US market is of vital importance for many small exporters of consumer products.  Over 300 US buyers visited &ldquo;Showcase Dublin&rdquo; in January 1993, which led to significant orders for many smaller craft companies.  In June I will be launching a major trade promotion in Chicago, featuring the products of 120 exporters, including 30 from Northern Ireland.  Food and drink exporters will continue to be supported through trade promotions and specialist events.</P>
      <P>An Bord Tráchtála operations in the United States are directed from its New York office.  Programmes are implemented through a network of trade consultants covering Atlanta, Boston, San Francisco, Chicago and Texas.</P>

      <P>The initiative referred to in the Deputy's question is an intensification of An Bord Tráchtála's ongoing regional office programme which aims to provide easy access at a local level to the agency's marketing services and overseas office network.</P>
      <P>The 1993 programme is specifically aimed at identifying new export opportunities for 2,000 small and medium sized indigenious companies who are either first time or existing exporters.  The initiative will involve a range of activities including seminars, workshops and overseas buyer trips.</P>
      <P>For example, as part of the 1993 programme, I recently opened the first in a series of four consumers and industrial product workshops which will be held in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway. These `Gateway' workshops are intended to assist companies to develop new markets in the Benelux countries.  An Bord Tráchtála considers the Benelux market to be an ideal introduction for first time exporters to mainland Europe as it is a very open market with a positive image of Ireland and excellent transport links for exporters.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from his visits to Belgium, Luxembourg and Denmark, where the Minister represented Ireland at EC Council meetings, the primary purpose of the visits he has made abroad was the <Col N="880" /> promotion of Irish tourism and foreign trade.</P>
    <P>The Minister's visits to the United Kingdom, Germany and the United States were part of successful trade promotions aimed at generating increased business this season from these three very important overseas markets for Irish tourism.  His visit to China and Hong Kong, he visited briefly en-route to China, identified potential opportunities for the development of trade with that region. The Minister led a delegation from the aviation sector in Ireland to China.  The results of that mission will be evident in coming years following the development of contracts established in the course of the mission.</P>

      <P>The Government believes that nuclear tests are unnecessary for military purposes, environmentally unacceptable, and harmful to the prevention of the spread of nuclear weapons, as set out in the preamble to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).</P>
      <P>The United States is aware of Ireland's views on the question of nuclear testing. Last year, the Government welcomed the steps taken by the United States towards limiting nuclear testing.  These steps, following similar ones by the Russian Federation and France, appeared to represent significant progress towards the cessation of nuclear testing.  At the same time, Ireland made clear, at the United Nations, that we regarded further progress in this area as necessary if the process of nuclear disarmament is to be made irreversible.  We also made clear our belief that the issue of a comprehensive test ban treaty should continue to be actively addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A resumption of nuclear testing carries risks for the international non-proliferation regime as a whole, at a time <Col N="883" /> when the North Korean authorities are being urged to reconsider their decision to withdraw from the NPT, and also at a time when negotiations leading to the extension of the NPT, which is due for renewal in 1995, have commenced.  I hope that the nuclear powers will consider very carefully all these aspects before any decisions on ending their current moratoria are taken.</P>

      <P>It is not practicable to identify the precise level of funding which the Office of Public Works will be devoting to the Robertstown area in 1993, as a distinct element of its overall canal spending.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal feature in the Office of Public Works' ongoing programme <Col N="884" /> towards upgrading the Grand Canal in the Robertstown area, apart from routine maintenance to maintain navigation, is a fisheries development programme.  In recent months, this has involved fish stocking, the cutting of &ldquo;swims&rdquo; through the bankside vegetation to provide access for angling and the provision of vehicle lay-bys along the canal banks for fishermen. Allied to this programme are research projects on aquatic plant management and water quality monitoring. These elements are all interlinked and are crucial to maintaining the high amenity status of the canal.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works has also facilitated the Robertstown Development Association in reactivating the running of boat trips on the canal at Robertstown this summer.</P>
    <P>It is also intended to provide a small jetty at Lowtown to facilitate people embarking on boats.</P>

It is an issue which is of interest not only in Dublin but throughout the country and is being considered by local authorities and the Department of the Environment as part of overall waste management policies. This examination of the potential includes a pilot plant in Tullamore.  The level of interest in the subject can be gauged by the capacity attendance at a seminar on the energy efficient treatment options for sewage sludge which Eolas organised recently as part of the energy conservation programme which they administer for my Department.  I would welcome the development of appropriate projects from an alternative energy perspective.</P>

      <P>I think I should dispel any misconception which may exist in relation to the timing of telephone calls.  There is no restriction, three minutes or otherwise, imposed by Telecom Eireann on the duration of calls from subscribers' telephones.</P>
      <P>The three minutes referred to in Telecom Eireann's rebalancing package is the time allowed per charging unit on local calls.  I have received representations on the matter but I would repeat what I said during the Adjournment Debate on 12 May, 1993, that:</P>
      <P>Based on accurate data at my disposal:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;almost 80% of all local calls will be unaffected by the timing restrictions;</P>
      <P>&mdash;over 72% of local calls made at peak periods will be unaffected;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="897" />&mdash;over 97% of local calls made at off-peak periods will be unaffected.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, I do not consider that the time allowed per unit on local calls is unreasonable taken in conjuction with the reduction in the unit price from 11.17p to 9.5p.  A longer time duration would result in a higher price per unit to produce the same revenue and would penalise the vast majority of calls.</P>

      <P>From information currently available within the Eastern Health Board region approximately 600 residential places are required to meet the needs of people with a mental handicap awaiting services. What is not clear, however, from the information available to my Department is the proportion of those on waiting lists for residential care who require immediate placement and the level of care which they require, those who with the provision of other services such as day care or home support services, may not immediately require residential placement and those who at some stage in the future will require residential care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="900" /> Agreement has recently been reached between my Department and statutory and voluntary agencies providing services to people with mental handicap on the adoption of an information system which will be set up in the coming months.  This system will provide information, on an ongoing basis, on the numbers of people with a mental handicap in each region, the number of services and awaiting services, their current and future needs and the level of support which is required to meet those needs.</P>
    <P>I would like to inform the Deputy that an additional £8.5 million has been made available in 1993 for the development of services for people with a mental handicap. Of the additional funding, £4 million has been allocated to the health board regions from which £1.750 million has been allocated to the eastern region. This is in addition to the £2.650 million made available to the region last year for the development of services for people with a mental handicap which is being repeated in 1993.</P>
    <P>The guidelines issued to the eastern region in relation to the expenditure of this additional funding proposed that additional emergency, residential (including respite care) and day care places be provided and that the home support services be extended.  Provision was also made in respect of the commissioning of additional facilities in the Daughters of Charity Services, Navan Road and towards the improvement of services in St. Ita's Hospital, Portrane.  The precise services to be provided in the eastern region have been agreed by the Regional Mental Handicap Planning Committee and are now being examined in my Department.</P>
    <P>A further £2 million was made available to strengthen the budgets of direct funded mental handicap agencies and to meet essential service needs.  As many of these agencies provide services in more than one health board area, it is not possible to say at this stage how much of the additional money is going to each area. A high percentage, however, would have been used in the Eastern Health Board area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="901" /> Provision has also been made for the capital investment necessary to support the initiatives which will be put in place this year.  The allocation of the £2.5 million capital funding made available in the budget will be directly related to the service developments agreed by the Regional Mental Handicap Co-ordinating Committees and approved by my Department.</P>

      <P>For the past few years my Department has made a special additional allocation available to the Western Health Board specifically for the development of orthodontic services.  This special additional allocation, amounting to £74,500, is now part of the Western Health Board's annual allocation for the continuing provision of the orthodontic services.</P>
      <P>The Government has provided an additional £2 million this year to provide for further improvements in dental services as part of the Programme for a Partnership Government and a portion of this amount will be allocated to the orthodontic services.  I have asked all the health boards to submit proposals, as a matter of urgency, on the most cost effective use of these resources.</P>

      <P>The Eastern Health Board currently has arrangements to pay subvention in respect of 2,436 dependent persons who are placed in nursing homes in the Eastern Health Board area.  Subventions are paid subject to a means test in each case without direct reference to the provision of services under section 52 (1) of the Health Act, 1970.  The arrangements to subvent the 2,436 dependent persons have been entered into with 90 of the private nursing homes which are approved to operate as nursing homes by the Eastern Health Board and with 12 voluntary nursing homes.  A list of these homes is included for the Deputy's information.</P>

      <P>As regards assistance from my Department, Irish students attending approved institutions in Northern Ireland are eligible for the award of grants under the Higher Education Grants Scheme. Irish students studying elsewhere in the <Col N="910" /> UK are not eligible for grants under the Higher Education Grants Scheme.</P>
      <P>However, in the case of students holding higher education grants in respect of attendance at approved institutions in Ireland, payment of grant may be continued for one year in respect of attendance abroad where</P>
      <P>(i)  the period of study abroad is shown to be an integral part of the student's course, and</P>
      <P>(ii)  the period of study abroad is a requirement of the course as laid down by college regulations, and</P>
      <P>(iii)  the student continues to be registered at the home university or college.</P>
      <P>As regards assistance from the UK authorities, that of course is a matter in the first instance for those authorities. However, broadly speaking, I understand that EC nationals at undergraduate level attending courses in the UK which qualify for mandatory awards have a similar entitlement to that of UK students in respect of the payment of tuition fees from the UK authorities.</P>
      <P>With regard to payments in respect of maintenance, I understand that there is a residence requirement in that students must satisfy the UK authorities that they have been ordinarily resident in the UK for the three years immediately preceding the commencement of the academic year in question.</P>
      <P>Irish students also have a small number of postgraduate scholarships funded by the UK Government available to them to study in the UK with preference given to science and technology disciplines, and these scholarships are reciprocated by the Irish Government for students from the UK who wish to study here.</P>

      <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the serious difficulty in Limerick where upwards of 160 pupils seeking entry to secondary schools for September 1993, have been refused a place in any school in Limerick; and the steps, if any, she is taking to rectify this position immediately in view of the distress it is causing to pupils and parents.</Quest>

      <P>My Department's primary objective is to ensure that all the schools in a catchment area have between them adequate provision to meet the demand for post-primary places from pupils in that particular area.  Intake policy is essentially a matter for each post-primary school management subject to the application of acceptable criteria.</P>
      <P>I am aware that difficulties have arisen in relation to admission to post-primary schools in Limerick city.</P>
      <P>I have met representatives of the parents concerned and I have assured them that no pupil will be left without a place in a second-level school next September. I arranged a fact-finding meeting which took place yesterday between officials of my Department and representatives of the Limerick Post-Primary Co-ordinating Committee to ascertain the extent and nature of the problem.  The position is now being reviewed as a matter of urgency to establish the further necessary steps to ensure that these difficulties are resolved within the current school year.</P>
