      <P>I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 30 to discuss the following urgent matter: to ask the Government to immediately reconsider its decision not to allow the President to co-chair a review of the future of the United Nations, given the opportunity that this presents to influence the peaceful evolution of the world and to promote Ireland in a positive way.</P>

      <P>On Private Members' <Col N="564" /> Business, it may be, depending upon the agreed time of the issue of the statement in respect of the communique, that statements by the Leaders in the House could eat into Private Members' time.  If that happens can I assume that the Government will offer Government time to complete the business?</P>

      <P>I wish to ask the Minister for Finance questions in relation to two matters.  First, can he tell us if a date has yet been fixed for the budget? The second question relates to the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) (Amendment) Bill, 1993 which is scheduled for tomorrow.  As the Minister is aware, I am sure, there is considerable unease amongst the staff of Deputies with regard to the terms of this Bill.  Will the Minister agree to the rescheduling of this Bill to the new year to enable discussions to take place between him and the representatives of the staff?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>On the first question, the usual practice will be followed.  The Government will announce the date for the budget on the last day of this session; January or February would be a good guess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister like to put it off?  He should be careful he does not disclose anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the second matter, I understand that discussions are taking place between the Whips and the trade unions involved and I think the matter would be best left to the Whips.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Mr. Shatter rose.</i>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Shatter wishes to raise a point of order, I believe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point, I accept what the Minister said, that the Whips will be dealing with the matter but business has been transferred from today to tomorrow which further diminishes the amount of time on a Bill that has just been published.  While some of the apprehension may not be well founded, it is important that time is made available to debate the Bill.  Having regard to the <Col N="566" /> fact that we are talking about different categories of staff and people with varying years of service, it is important to use the period to have further discussions with the union.  The union comprises the staff, not just what the union officials might say, and we must try to get agreement on this.  If the Minister indicates that that is the spirit of the Government's decision it would be satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Rabbitte that the matter is sensitive.  Discussions are ongoing and the Government does not wish to limit debate on this Bill in any way.  If time is lost because of business being transferred from today owing to the statements on the peace initiative, the time can be made up tomorrow but the Whips can best deal with that matter.  In order to avoid any confusion, I will agree now that if additional time is required tomorrow, the debate can be extended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure you will agree, a Cheann Comhairle, that in changed times this House should change its rules. Could I ask you, Sir, as Chairman of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, to reconsider within that committee &mdash; not in this House &mdash; the approach that this House can take to issues of a political nature when Government makes decisions which effectively muzzle the President.  It is wrong for this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for agreeing to allow more time but that was not the point I was making in respect of the Oireachtas Allowances to Members (Amendment) Bill.  The Bill was published today and, apparently, from what the Minister said, it is proposed to pass all Stages.  I am pleading with the Minister to agree that it is unwise to proceed to the enactment of it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand, if the <Col N="568" /> Bill is passed tomorrow, the Whips, in the name of all Members of both Houses, have given an undertaking, both to our staff and to the trade union, that the legislation will not take effect until the negotiations are completed.  It is an extremely fair position for the Members of the House to adopt with its staff, that the Bill, after it is enacted by the House, will not take effect from the point of view of any changes until the negotiations are completed.  Any other matters should be dealt with through the Whips because this matter, in one form or another, has been discussed throughout the year between the Whips and the staff.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Democratic Left has not been in a position to give such an undertaking and has not done so because it is not within the power of the Whip of Democratic Left, or any of the parties in Opposition, to say a Bill will not be enacted until a certain date.  That is in the hands of the Minister of the day.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Donegal South West):</i> A Cheann Comhairle, I should like to take this opportunity of thanking Members for their co-operation in relation to these amendments which were necessary to improve the substance of the Bill.  It would be remiss of me, on any debate relating to the Department of the Marine, not to take this opportunity of sending the best wishes of the House <Col N="573" />&mdash; and here I know I speak for everybody &mdash; to the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan, who is at present in hospital.</P>
      <P>I should also like to take this opportunity of congratulating and thanking all those involved in search and rescue operations, particularly in recent weeks, including the Air Corps, the Naval Service, the Garda, the RNLI, the National Safety Council and, of course, the many volunteers, including inshore lifeboat organisations and others who assisted.  In particular I pay tribute to all those involved in the search and rescue operaction off the Sligo coast some weeks ago when a number of surfers were brought safely to shore.  I should also like to congratulate and thank all of those involved in the search and rescue operation off the west coast last week when the crews of two fishing vessels were saved.  Of course, we also recall the trojan work of the crew of the Sikorski helicopter.  I should like to pay tribute to them and also to those involved in a search and rescue mission off the coast of Dungloe in Donegal last week when two fishermen were brought safely to shore.  It was a great week for search and rescue.  The commitment of the Department and the Government to such search and rescue operations is confirmed, now that the Irish marine emergency services are equipped with state of the art communications and computer equipment to enable them respond immediately to the needs of seafarers in distress.</P>
      <P>I should like to thank Members who participated on Second and Committee Stages of this Bill. These Seanad amendments provide proof of the valuable contribution the Seanad also makes to the framing of legislation.</P>
      <P>On this, one of the final debates on the Department of the Marine, I wish all those associated with the Department a very happy and peaceful Christmas and a successful 1994.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), lines 25 and 26, to delete &ldquo;and Aer Rianta cuideachta phoiblí theoranta&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle of this Bill is to enable the Minister to put £175 million of equity into Aer Lingus.  He has taken the opportunity to restructure Aer Lingus because, in effect, there was no such corporate identity.  Aerlinte is one company and now the Minister is seeking to establish a holding company.  I do not know why he <Col N="575" /> should use the opportunity of this Bill to pull Aer Rianta into the mix as well.  If the Minister wants to make corporate arrangements affecting Aer Rianta, I suggest he bring in a different Bill and allow us to debate it on its merits.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta runs the airports.  It is not an airline company, it is an airport company and yet it is being brought in under the definition of an airline company.  The restrictions which are being imposed in a variety of sections on airline companies will also be applied to Aer Rianta.  I cannot see the justification for it and it smacks of opportunism.  Somebody decided they wanted to put certain restrictions on Aer Rianta and they have used the opportunity of this Bill to do so. It is irrelevant to the main thrust of the Bill and in my view it should not be included.  I should like to hear the Minister's justification of it before I press the case further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Noonan's point.  When speaking on Second Stage yesterday I said I could not understand why Aer Rianta had been included in the various sections. I still do not understand the reason.  Essentially the purpose of the Bill is to provide the equity for Aer Lingus arising from the recovery plan.  The question of the restructuring of Aer Rianta and different arrangements for the establishment of subsidiaries and the appointment of boards was never raised.  I am surprised to find it included here.  The effect of this Bill would be that subsidiaries of Aer Rianta would have their boards appointed either by the chairman of Aer Rianta, with the approval of the Minister, or directly by the Minister.  This is a new provision in relation to Aer Rianta and I do not think it should be included.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think one amendment would have made that difference. This Bill is described as an Air Companies (Amendment) Bill.  Normally one would assume, then, that it would be dealing with air companies.  Aer Rianta is included in this definition although selfevidently Aer Rianta is not an air company but an airport operating company. There is a very substantial difference and the two companies really have nothing in common.  Operating an airline is totally different from operating an airport.  I do not know why the two companies are run in together in this legislation.  In a previous Act, the companies may have been put together for some reason, I am not altogether clear on that.  I had hoped to look up these things this morning but unfortunately I did not have that opportunity. On the face of it, there is absolutely no reason why an airport company should be defined in exactly the same way as an airline.</P>
      <P>In other countries the distinction between the two is very clear and indeed frequently there is quite a bit of conflict between them.  There has been some conflict between Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta but it is more marked in other places.  To have two companies that are so different and whose interests are quite contrary to one another defined together in the same way and governed by the same legislation appears to be entirely wrong.  I wonder if there is some hidden reason for this because there does not seem to be a logical reason for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is frequently the case that Aer Rianta, as an airport operating company, must be at loggerheads with air companies in the normal sense, whether Aer Lingus, Ryanair or a foreign airline company. <Col N="577" /> Obviously, Aer Rianta is trying to get as much money as it can from airlines for the use of the airport whereas the airlines in their own interests and in their passengers' interests try to keep down the payments as much as possible.  Therefore, to include both companies in the definition of &ldquo;air companies&rdquo; seems to be rather unusual, to say the least and, I would have thought, rather unwise.  I do not see any logic in it.  Perhaps the Minister will explain why this is being done and whether it has been done before.  In view of the nature of this Bill, the primary purpose of which is to pay £175 million into Aer Lingus, what is the point of dragging Aer Rianta into it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had contact with some people in Aer Rianta and basically they are querying why Aer Rianta is included in this Bill.  Aer Rianta is a separate semi-State organisation. Indeed, in the very real controversy on the Shannon stop-over, Aer Lingus took a distinctly different attitude from that of Aer Rianta.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's justification for including Aer Rianta in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I join other Deputies in expressing concern at the way Aer Rianta has been included in what is essentially an Aer Lingus Bill.  My suspicions are that, because of the ongoing difference of opinion on aviation policy between Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta, the Minister decided to put both together.  I do not know whether that is fully justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Cahill plan has brought about dramatic changes in previously established aviation policy and I would have thought the Minister would have had another look at the idea of separate airport authorities rather than trying to roll Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta together.  I would like to hear the Minister's explanation for this.  He seems to have formed the view that Aer Rianta did not have the proper attitude to the Cahill plan.  Some employees who expressed strong opinions about the veracity of the Cahill plan, as it affected Shannon airport, had <Col N="578" /> their opinions well dampened by edicts from the Department, whether they came directly from the Minister's office or from some other section.  People felt badly done by, and although I cannot expressly name any individual who got swamped or lost his job over it, people were very irate at the dictatorial attitude. If people do not accept Government policy, in a democratic state, they are entitled to express their opinion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I will address Deputy Carey's allegation of a hidden agenda.  In passing, let me say, and this is not relevant to the section or the amendment, it bemuses me that an agent of the Minister, as is Aer Rianta, would have a different policy from Government policy.  Its job is to pursue Government policy.  That is the past tense and I intend rectifying it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree totally.  That has always been my position and the Deputy can check it out.  If I accepted the amendments it would mean that sections 9, 10, 12 and 14 would not apply.  There is a fundamental misunderstanding here. This is an air companies Bill and Aer Rianta is an air company under the 1966 and 1977 Acts.  An opportunity is taken in this Bill to provide for the statutory application to Aer Lingus Group plc and Aer Rianta of controls which it has become the practice to insert in recent legislation establishing semi-State bodies.  These controls are for the most part already being applied to the air companies under the guidelines for semi-State bodies approved by the Governenc <Col N="581" /> ment.  They relate to the establishment or acquisition of subsidiaries, to investment and undertakings other than subsidiaries and borrowing by subsidiaries.  These controls are contained, for example, in the Irish Aviation Authority Act, 1993 and the Forestry Act, 1988.  Section 14 of the Bill provides that these controls shall apply to the air companies.  The Government would want them to apply to Aer Rianta in the same way as they apply to other State companies.</P>
      <P>Section 18 of the Bill repeals section 6 of the Air Companies Act, 1976, which provides for the remuneration and allowances paid by an air company to its chief officer, subject to the approval of the Minister given with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  Section 10 reenacts this provision and extends it to any subsidiaries of an air company which the Minister may specify.</P>
      <P>If Deputy O'Malley's amendment were accepted, this control would not apply to Aer Rianta.  If Deputy Noonan's amendments were accepted it would mean that Aer Rianta would no longer be an air company within the meaning of the Air Companies Acts.  I could not accept those amendments.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I will deal first with the item which has caused controversy.  In the course of the year an Aer Rianta internal document was published in <i>The Irish Times.</i> The document took a policy line contrary to the Minister's line, that a change in the status of Shannon Airport was in the best interests of the country.  The Minister ordered an investigation in the course of which a list of fax numbers to which faxes had issued from Aer Rianta offices, particularly in Shannon, was acquired. One of them was a fax number in this House.  Somebody close to the Minister began to spread the story that the fax was received by me and that I had given it to <i>The Irish Times.</i> That is not true.  A fax was not received by me from any Aer Rianta employee.  When the Minister rose to his feet today he made the same hidden allegation.  The innuendo was that if this issue was raised in the House many <Col N="582" /> of us would be hanging our heads and would be afraid to debate it.</P>

I did not seek or get a fax and the Minister's inquiry into the activities of Aer Rianta staff was disreputable in the way in which it was carried out.  Officers of Aer Rianta rang me at my private home number and here in Leinster House asking if I was the source of the leak and if I would confirm that I had got a fax because a Leinster House number came up on the list of outgoing faxes from Aer Rianta in Shannon and in Dublin Airport.  We are not dealing here with the KGB.  I do not know the officer in question but I understand that he is no longer employed at Aer Rianta and that he was treated very shabbily by both the Minister and the Aer Rianta authority.  If we want to have a debate on the leaked document, we can have it without making sly allegations.  I will now get back to the proposed amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The definition of an airline company is being extended to Aer Rianta and, apart from the fact that it is an abuse of language, it gives the Minister power over Aer Rianta which he did not have before.  Section 9 allows the Minister to appoint the boards of all companies defined as air companies and to appoint the board of every subsidiary company.  There are further restrictions in sections 14 and 15 in that no air company or any subsidiary thereof shall establish or acquire a subsidiary without the prior written approval of the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  Then there is a limitation on the aggregate at any one time of the investment of an air company or subsidiary thereof in undertakings.  It shall not exceed such amount as may be determined from time to time by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance. Borrowings by a subsidiary shall be subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance.  In section 15 there is a list of obligations imposed on Aer Rianta.  It will have to bring its memorandum and articles of association into accord with this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made a case that, because he has included section 18 to repeal section 6 of the Air Companies Act, there are certain consequences for Aer Rianta and this redefinition is necessary.  If the Minister did not repeal the section it would not be necessary.  The repeal of <Col N="584" /> the section in section 18 is a consequence of the Minister's redefinition in the definition sections, not a justification of it.  He is ensuring that he will be able to appoint every board member in all of the subsidiaries.  He already has the right to appoint the main boards and now wants to control in a political way the directorships of the subsidiaries right along the line.  The Minister is doing that in respect of the four new subsidiaries into which Aer Lingus will be reorganised and any other subsidiaries which they have.  Not being content with that, he is extending it to Aer Rianta as well by the backdoor.  Knowing the record of the Government, the appointments will be made on a party political basis and there will be little relationship between those appointed and their experience in running either airlines or airports.</P>
    <P>Section 14 is quite restrictive and is very detailed in the powers given to the Minister.  Commercial semi-State bodies must run on a commercial basis.  Once the commercial mandate is laid down there should not be interference in normal commercial decisions by the politician who heads the Department to which it must report.  Under section 14 commercial decisions will have to be referred to the Department and will need the permission of the Minister.  These restrictions could have serious commercial consequences for Aer Rianta.</P>
    <P>The problem with semi-State organisations is not the lack of political control but the prevalence of political interference. Commercial State bodies should be allowed to act in the best interests of the company.  This is a backdoor method to extend to Aer Rianta provisions which because of the record of Aer Lingus the Minister might seek to justify.  Aer Rianta has had an exemplary record over the years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to comment on a point made by the Minister, namely, that it is the function of semi-State bodies to carry out Government policy.  I have always believed it to be the function of the semi-State companies to carry out the functions set down in the Acts establishing <Col N="585" /> them.  Government policy is a fairly wide term and a movable feature even within a Government.  This raises the question as to the Minister's accountability to this House for semi-State bodies.  If I table a Dáil question about a decision taken by a semi-State body I will receive a letter from the Ceann Comhairle informing me that the Minister does not have responsibility to the House for such a decision.  The Minister's statement today throws new light on that and prompts me to phrase my questions differently in the future.  For example, let us take a very recent decision in regard to the sale by Telecom Éireann of its Ballsbridge site at a loss of £3 million. Was Telecom Éireann pursuing Government policy in losing £3 million on the sale of that site?  Did it have the Minister's approval for the sale?  This provision puts a whole new perspective on the Minister's accountability to this House for the activities of semi-State companies, especially those under his control.</P>
      <P>As the Minister insists on tying the activities of Aer Rianta into this Bill and to the fortunes of Aer Lingus, there is an issue I would like to pursue with him. Yesterday we had some discussion about the question of competition and the desirability of fair competition between airline companies here.  I am sure most Members would agree that there should be a level playing field for airline companies competing for business here, but the history of that deserves some examination. A matter in that regard was brought to my attention recently, although I did not receive a fax about it; perhaps the source might be better protected as a result.  The point was made to me that Aer Rianta's landing charges for Ryanair are lower than those for Aer Lingus.  I am not sure if that is true, but I would like to know if that is Government policy, as Aer Rianta is now pursuing Government policy.  If it is true it would put a completely different complexion on the level playing field concept in regard to competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with some disappointment to the tone of what the <Col N="586" /> Minister said, which would not come across in writing, but came across rather forcefully for those in the House.  I agree with Deputy Gilmore that the relationship between the Minister and the State company espoused here this morning is new and rather dangerous.  I agree with the examples given by Deputy Gilmore with the exception of his reference to Telecom Éireann who incurred a loss of £7.5 million on the sale of its Ballsbridge site, not £3 million.</P>
      <P>I have considerable experience as a Minister in a number of Departments, primarily in the former Department of Industry and Commerce and related Departments, during which time I had dealings with many semi-State bodies.  I never saw their function as simply carrying out Government policy at all times and in all circumstances.  A similar approach was adopted by the Minister's immediate predecessor because last year Aer Rianta issued a formal official statement in regard to the position of Shannon Airport in which it expressed a particular view that was not materially different from that expressed in the document to which Deputy Noonan referred.  It may have been expressed in different words, but essentially it was the same view.  Aer Rianta is entitled to express such a view. If it was not, the Minister's predecessor or officials in the Department would have said so.  That was not the case.  Semi-State bodies and various boards frequently expressed views with which I did not agree.  Nevertheless.  I did not think any less of them.  I asked them to justify their views, I expressed mine and frequently we reached a view that suited us both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Acts setting up many of those semi-State companies state that part of their function is to advise the Minister.  I am not sure if that is stated in the Acts relating to Aer Rianta, but it is certainly stated in a number of such Acts.  Apparently, that will now go by the board and State companies will not be entitled to express a view unless they express &ldquo;Big Brother's&rdquo; view.  That was the case in the former Soviet Union and places under its control but it is not the case at present. However, there is a danger it might be <Col N="587" /> the case again.  It is not healthy for that to be the case here.  Whatever about employees, who do not have much choice, people who want to act as conscientious board members may think twice about becoming involved if they are not entitled to express a view they have not cleared in advance with the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.  That is outrageous.</P>
    <P>Having listened to the debate on this amendment and the venom with which the Minister attacked Aer Rianta and told the House how he would put it in order, clamp down on it and ensure it did not say anything with which he did not fully agree in the future, I am somewhat clearer about the hidden agenda.  When I first spoke to this amendment I wondered what was the hidden agenda.  It is the episode about which Deputy Noonan and the Minister have exchanged comments in the past few minutes.  It is the Minister teaching Aer Rianta, who stepped out of line, a lesson so that it will not do so again.</P>
    <P>This Bill was supposed to deal with Aer Lingus, its associated problems and the fact that it lost £188 million in the 12 month period up to 31 March last.  Many controls and restrictions are being introduced under this Bill which, ideally, one would not wish to have introduced. However, it is understandable in the case of Aer Lingus because of what has happened, but why impose all those unusual restrictions and controls on Aer Rianta? Aer Rianta did not lose £188 million.  So far as I am aware it never lost any money, it makes a substantial profit every year and remits almost all of that profit to the Exchequer.  It is recognised as being commercially successful and runs its affairs in a sensible and successful commercial manner.  I am sure most Members welcome the fact that it has extended its operations beyond Ireland in recent years and has been successful in, among other places, the former Soviet Union where it has set up approximately five commercially successful establishments.  It is considering the possibility of setting up other establishments in Malaysia and a <Col N="588" /> number of other countries in South East Asia and perhaps further afield.  It should be encouraged to do so.  I do not know of any major mistakes it has made that would lead us to clamp down on it and impose additional controls.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that if my amendment were accepted all the controls which have been inserted specially in four or five sections of the Bill which he listed would not apply to Aer Rianta and that this would be unthinkable.  I do not accept this.  My attitude to State companies is that one should be reluctant to impose unnecessary controls and anxious to give them as much commercial freedom as possible.  Unfortunately, our experience during the years in respect of a number of them has not been great. Like other Ministers, I was forced to impose additional controls.  Unhappily for us, that is the case with Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>I have no objection in principle to the proposal that the controls outlined in the Bill should be imposed because of the recent history of the company but it is most unfair to lump in another company which did not have these problems or make these policy and other mistakes.</P>
    <P>So far as I am aware, Aer Rianta never got into the difficulties which, for example, Aer Lingus Holidays Limited or Sunbound got into.  Is it right therefore that it should be subjected to these controls? I do not see any reason it should be and do not accept the Minister's attitude to State companies generally which, if it were analysed, would be shown to be very dangerous.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Gilmore rightly said, the Ceann Comhairle will have to review all his rules relating to parliamentary questions because I, like other Members, constantly receive letters from him stating that a Minister does not have any responsibility for a certain matter, that it is a matter for the company concerned, even where major decisions, which would have national implications are to be made.  Nonetheless a Minister is able to convince the Ceann Comhairle that he does not have responsibility.  The Ceann Comhairle had better study what the Minister said this morning because it was <Col N="589" /> a totally new concept.  The Minister will have to answer for every minor decision made by these companies if he implements it.  I will not encourage him to implement what I think is his wrongheaded attitude to State companies by extending these controls unnecessarily. That is the reason I ask him to accept this amendment to ensure we will not tie up companies unnecessarily.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>In his reply the Minister did not indicate the way in which Aer Rianta surpluses will be dealt with in the future. I recall that Aer Rianta dealt effectively with each of its subsidiaries, whether in Shannon or Cork, and asked them to deliver, with the result that surpluses were recorded through the years in each area.  This money was paid directly into the Exchequer.  Is the Minister saying that he is going to change the system, that in future there will be a new control system?  Will the officers of Aer Rianta, especially those who want to plan for the future, be restricted?  Due to the new imaginative system put in place under the bilateral agreement there is an urgent need to provide extra accommodation at Shannon, given that the 747s will be based there, and to extend and modernise the facilities.  Is the Minister saying that all these decisions will be taken centrally, that both he and the Minister for Finance will make the major decisions about how Aer Rianta in Shannon and Dublin is to be run?  I would have thought that if one wanted to change the system one would have done so in another Bill instead of dealing with the issue in this one.  Because of the restrictions that will be imposed as a result of this Bill, will the company's own efforts to expand be dampened?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aer Rianta has played an important role in my constituency and I would like to see this continue but it appears there is a hidden agenda.  When the Department adopted a hands-on approach I could have complained legitimately in respect of some of the developments which had been sought, such as an additional cross runway, that we had to bow to the wishes of Aer Rianta in Dublin which wanted <Col N="590" /> to extend that airport.  Aer Rianta in Shannon was not able to expand as more and more money was required for developments in the capital city.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister saying that Aer Rianta will have greater latitude or that he will, as a result of his decision on the bilateral agreement, look more benignly at Shannon and accede to its request for an expansion of the terminal building, the bays, the fuel farm and all the other items mentioned in the list compiled by the company because the decisions will be taken centrally?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendments to section 1 relate to the question of whether Aer Rianta should be included in the Bill in terms of the controls specified in the Government guidelines relating to semi-State bodies.  I reiterate, for the benefit of Deputies, that Aer Rianta is not a semi-State company, it is an agent of the Minister.  I assure Deputy O'Malley, a former Minister for Industry and Commerce, that I have an open mind on a range of issues affecting semi-State companies under my aegis.  The record will show that since I took charge of my Department I have not got involved in the day-to-day management of those bodies.  The Government, as shareholder, sets the policy, but there is nothing new in this.  I am surprised that Deputy O'Malley who has long experience considers this to be a new phenomenon. As Minister there was no one better than he at laying down the law to certain semi-State bodies which he believed were not pursuing Government policy.  I find it amusing, to say the least, that he regards it as a new phenomenon in political life, that the shareholder should dictate policy.  I am sure if the Deputy were a member of a private company with a 51 per cent shareholding or even a 100 per cent shareholding he would accept that the people who are putting up the money should in some way dictate the broad policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley will find, if he looks at my record since I became Minister, that I do not have a hands-on approach, very much the opposite.  However, in deference <Col N="591" /> to the fact that I represent the shareholder, I do have strong views on the general policy objectives being adopted by semi-State companies.  It would be a dereliction of duty if I did not ensure that they were in line with accountable decision-making by Government as shareholder and I make no apology for that.  I do not accept for a moment that this is a new phenomenon.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of Aer Rianta is about what Deputy O'Malley often spoke of during his long and distinguished career. It is about accountability.  Does he want to see another Aer Lingus Holidays where we do not have a say in what is going on at the relevant time in relation to acquisitions, to remuneration of chief officers of subsidiary companies that may go outside the Gleeson recommendations? It is simply implementing the recommendations laid down by the Cromien committee in relation to semi-State bodies and giving them legislative effect when the opportunity arises.  In response to issues Deputy O'Malley raised, were those recommendations followed we might not have ended up as we did eventually.</P>
    <P>The Department does not have a hands-on approach.  It simply wants to be kept informed of major policy decisions and, on behalf of the shareholder, to have an input at the relevant time in relation to those decisions.  In regard to the specific company mentioned, the extraneous matters which I agree are totally irrelevant were not raised by me.  I am simply explaining that I would be aware of them and of the position.  Aer Rianta is not a semi-State company but an agency.  It is being treated substantively as a semi-State company to ensure that we do not delve into what are strictly management matters but we delve into major policy decisions on the basis that the taxpayer, as shareholder, should have some say.</P>
    <P>There are always accusations of political interference on the part of Ministers; I do not interfere politically.  That charge was laid by Deputy Noonan <Col N="592" /> before the setting up of the Telephone Users Advisory Group, the composition of which will show that its independence is beyond question.  Opposition Deputies usually level that charge when they have no substantive argument to make.  What is proposed here is to ensure that Aer Rianta, which is already an air company under previous Acts, will be subjected to the same guidelines as other semi-State companies decided upon by the Government of which Deputy O'Malley was a member.  There is no hidden agenda.  This is simply giving legislative effect to issues which are agreed, which are proper and which are in the domain of the shareholder and about which the shareholder should have some say at the appropriate time rather than have to react to situations which have led in the past to some of the problems mentioned by Deputies.</P>

      <P>With respect, these issues are best dealt with at Question Time.  I explained the context in which Aer Rianta is included in this section and its relevance to the Bill.  Questions about surpluses, dividends and general policy issues are not relevant to the section under discussion.</P>

      <P>I would be delighted to discuss the matter by way of supplementary question and answer at the appropriate time.  I explained the reason for Aer Rianta's inclusion in this section. There is no hidden agenda.  It is simply giving legislative effect to Government guidelines for semi-State bodies.  Further, the organisation in question is not a semi-State body but an agent of Government.  Until such time as it is a semi-State body the &ldquo;arm's length&rdquo;<Col N="593" /> relationship does not apply.  The commercial freedom given to Aer Rianta as an agent of the Minister has been such that there could be no question of the heavy hand of bureaucracy applying to the company.  As Deputy O'Malley and others noted, the company has shown a degree of innovation by seeking out opportunities far from Ireland which have proven to be productive in terms of the profitability to which Deputy Carey refers.  Those general areas would be more informatively dealt with at Question Time rather than in the context of section 1.</P>

      <P>Not just yet.  However, if Aer Rianta is not a semi-State body but operates as an agent, why is it in legislation dealing with Aer Lingus, a semi-State body, and various existing subsidiaries and ones to be created from time to time?  The Minister's argument could be taken either way.  It could be an argument for dealing with Aer Rianta under separate legislation or for extending this legislation to incorporate Aer Rianta as a semi-State body which, I think, is what it should be.  If it is operating as an agent, it has operated extremely widely and has done tremendous work.  It has been a first-rate commercial success and has carried the flag of Irish entrepreneurial skills around the world.  That was done without restrictions and I would not like to see restrictions imposed today although they are being imposed in the context of accountability, limiting that successful operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="594" /> As to the vexed question of who is determining authority, the Government, through the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications has responsibility to ensure that any semi-State body operating with shareholders' money is accountable, and must monitor that company closely, but that should not extend to interfering with policy decisions on operational capacity.  It may relate to policy decisions relating to direction but regarding operational capacity there must be a considerable degree of leeway. The provisions in this Bill assist that process.</P>
    <P>This legislation clarifies the position and provides transparency.  It provides for the restructuring of Aer Lingus. Hopefully, new subsidiaries will be established. We must ensure that there is transparency in relation to each body incorporated in the company in terms of its board membership.  The staff of Aer Lingus at every level should be represented on the various boards, for example, those of the holding company, the existing companies, Aer Rianta or any new subsidiaries established through consultation with the Minister.  I would like that matter teased out further.</P>
    <P>If representation is provided on the boards of those bodies they may make decisions and we will not find ourselves in the position that has been the subject of controversy across the floor today, about who made decisions, how they were made or whether there is uisce faoi thalamh &mdash; other agendas in the context of Aer Lingus or its associate companies. That is the kernel of the problem.</P>
    <P>This legislation will not restrict the existing commercial activity of any of the bodies to which I referred.  It represents the final stage of a package of proposals which will allow Aer Lingus to progress and develop in an open fashion, with sufficient monitoring functions and with its staff represented to ensure that a crisis similar to that which we are facing will not arise in the future.  We are debating this matter today because of that crisis and we cannot simply wish it away.  We <Col N="595" /> must face reality.  The provisions of this Bill address that reality.</P>

      <P>In relation to Deputies' contributions, including that of Deputy Costello, I acknowledge the excellent work being done by Aer Rianta.  I seek to set out its precise relationship by giving legislative effect to guidelines laid down for semi-State companies.  I seek also to ensure that existing air companies &mdash; this is the Air Companies (Amendment) Bill, not the Aer Lingus (Amendment) Bill &mdash; are consistently dealt with in relation to accountability.  The Bill provides for the type of issues that should be referred to us in terms of having an input.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not seek to delay or inhibit the entrepreneurial skills which we all acknowledge Aer Rianta has displayed down the years.  However, there is a need for consistency and that is why Aer Rianta is included in this section and why the various sections to which I have alluded will apply to it in the same way as they will apply to the restructuring of Aer Lingus.  On the basis of consistency, it is important that Aer Rianta be included in giving legislative effect to guidelines which apply to semi-State bodies.  Those guidelines have been drawn up so that lessons may be learned in terms of what may be perceived to be non-accountability in the past and matters about which the shareholder should have known about and would have known about had the guidelines been implemented.  We seek to ensure that consistency is applied to air companies which for the purposes of the legislation, when enacted, will mean that the same guidelines will apply to Aer Lingus <Col N="596" /> Group plc and Aer Rianta and that they will be given legislative effect&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The same hymn sheet to which Deputy Carey chorally alluded. The hymn sheet from which they will sing will be clear and unambiguous.  Despite interpretations that have been put on this matter by Opposition Deputies, this provision in no way dilutes the proper relationship that exists between the Minister and semi-State bodies generally.</P>
      <P>Semi-State bodies must be given commercial freedom to operate with Aer Lingus in this difficult period and the same freedom should apply to other semi-State bodies.  It is important that commercial freedom be given to the management and staff of companies to enable them operate commercially, compete in competitive sectors where monopolies exist at present and for those sectors to become more competitive in future.  That is all the more reason to insist that in the future, and certainly during my tenure of office, commercial freedom will be given to semi-State companies so that they can deal with the increasingly difficult commercial and competitive environment in which they must operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Commercial freedom does not mean non-accountability.  It means that, in respect of day-to-day management and the carrying out of bread policy objectives, operations should not be interfered with by the shareholder or for political considerations.  Hopefully, for the remainder of my tenure of office, while I have responsibility for many State bodies, that policy will continue.  The shareholder in this case has submitted substantial funds in terms of an equity investment or, in many other cases, has acted as guarantor for large borrowings in respect of development undertaken by semi-State companies.  At the direction of the Government as shareholder and in the national interest in terms of development and regional policy, I will insist that those broad policy objectives of Government be adhered to.  Decisions in terms of input which impinge upon the direction <Col N="597" /> of those broad policy objectives will be referred to me.  I will ensure that situations, similar to those referred to by Deputies where, because of non-accountability and the lack of information given in time, calamities occurred which might have been avoided had the shareholder been aware of the position, will be avoided.  That is the extent of the agenda.</P>
    <P>I have explained the intent of the legislation and my intention in that regard.  It stands up to scrutiny.  Having regard to recent experience in respect of matters which have arisen in semi-State companies, if the guidelines had been adhered to those situations might not have developed.  There are reputable reasons why Aer Rianta as an existing air company should come within the ambit of the controls which will be imposed upon Aer Lingus.  We, as the shareholder, are making a substantial investment. We want to make sure we get a return on our investment.  The taxpayer is entitled to that and the issues over which we seek control and prior notice are within the broad policy area as <Col N="598" /> distinct from day-to-day management positions.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 12, after &ldquo;amount&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;not exceeding £400 million&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I had to draft my amendments last night before the Minister replied to the Second Stage debate and the Bill was given a Second Reading and I had no opportunity to check the figures.  This amendment proposes to put an upper limit on the share capital of the holding company, Aer Lingus Group plc.  It seems to be very unusual to allow the Minister for Finance, after consultation with the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, to fix the amount at any figure he likes at any time in the future, which will be the effect of this section.  I imagine &mdash; I am subject to correction because it is very hard to check &mdash; that the present share capital of the company is close to £200 million.  Allowing a bit of leeway to add on the £175 million, this would give approximately £400 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very unsatisfactory to have to deal with the Committee Stage of a Bill which was only given a Second Reading at 10.30 p.m. the previous night.  If one does not put down amendments before the Bill is given a Second Reading there will be no amendments.  I do not propose tying the Minister to an exact figure.  What is important is the principle of putting some limit on the amount and not leaving it wide open to the Minister to change or increase it any time he wants.  It is normal in legislation where the share capital of a company is determined by the Oireachtas for some figure to be stated rather than leaving the amount entirely at the discretion of the Minister.  If this section is passed in its present form, there will be nothing to stop the Minister or some future Minister deciding that the share capital of the company should be £2 billion or £3 billion, even though the Oireachtas might be unwilling to agree <Col N="601" /> to such an enormous amount.  The amount of the share capital should be fixed.  It is not normally possible in an ordinary company to have open ended share capital which can be increased at any time.  The amount of the share capital has to be stated in the memorandum and articles of association of the company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The authorised share capital of the companies concerned, as at present constructed, is £80 million.  I do not see the necessity for this amendment because in any event the Minister for Finance can only subscribe to a maximum of £175 million in shares.  The section, as drafted, is in accordance with similar provisions in recent Acts, for example, the Irish Aviation Authority Act, 1993.  As I understand it, the Deputy is concerned that the Minister for Finance could willy-nilly go beyond the figure of £175 million if the Government felt that that was necessary, without any upper limit specified in legislation.  The fact is that it is State aid which is now subject to EU competition rules and, therefore, any further amount, which cannot be given in any event because this is a once off equity injection under the State aid rules, would require approval by this House.  I do not see the necessity for the Deputy's amendment.  I understand his concern but in practical terms the issue does not arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that the existing share capital is £80 million. Is that the capital of what are described in the Bill as the two existing companies?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Adding £175 million to that gives a figure of £255 million and, therefore, my suggestion of £400 million was not far wrong.  Does the Minister agree that any company has its share capital stated and there is a limit placed on it?  One does not have to issue all the shares in respect of the capital but at least there is some limit.  It may not be possible for the Minister for Finance to subscribe to a higher figure without the consent of <Col N="602" /> the Dáil but he can fix it.  It is unusual to have a company which, in effect, has no limit on its share capital, in which the shareholders can fix the capital from time to time as they see fit.  That is not the practice in the great majority of companies; in fact, I know of no company where it is the practice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure I agree with the Deputy on that point.  I am not aware that legislatively one imposes a limit on authorised share capital in that one cannot foresee circumstances in other cases where it would not seem appropriate to do so.  The Bill simply enacts general principles of <i>modus operandi</i> in terms of the share capital that can be issued.  The practical point I am making is that no further injections of equity can be made by the State without referral to the Oireachtas.  We do not see the necessity for imposing the upper limit on the basis that that control exists.  I can see what the Deputy is getting at but in practical terms it does not present a problem.  The Minister for Finance cannot surreptitiously, without accountability to the House, issue further share capital over and above what is agreed and is publicly announced.</P>

      <P>I pointed out yesterday on Second Stage that it was not clear on what basis these shares will be exchanged.  The existing shares are valueless because the company has no value at present.  Are they exchanged on a one-for-one basis?  In particular what happens then to Aer Lingus plc and Aerlinte Éireann plc?  If those shares are redeemed, who will be the shareholder? Will it be the holding company only and will those two companies remain in legal existence?  That seems to be implied, at least, by the section.  Will Aerlinte Éireann plc operate as the Aer Lingus-Shannon division and what will Aer Lingus plc operate as?  Will Aer Lingus Express be separate from Aer Lingus plc and under what name will the ancillary companies operate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The shares are exchanged on a one-for-one basis.  The existing companies, Aerlinte Éireann and Aer Lingus plc, remain as subsidiaries.  Aerlinte <Col N="604" /> becomes Aer Lingus-Shannon and Aer Lingus plc becomes Aer Lingus with responsibility for the European routes. Aer Lingus Express, obviously, will be set up separately and provision is made for that in the Bill.  Therefore, the share arrangement is that it all goes to the holding company and Aerlinte and Aer Lingus become subsidiaries of the holding company on a one-for-one basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no provision in the Bill in respect of Aer Lingus Express other than that there is provision to create subsidiaries generally.  There is no specific reference to Aer Lingus Express and, of course, that is the one that is causing most concern among the subsidiaries. Last evening the Minister said it was not envisaged that the existing Aer Lingus company would be divided into four divisions.  I would like him to confirm that there will be four separate companies and, if that is the case, it appears to conflict with what was announced by Mr. Cahill in June or July.  He specifically referred then to divisions, not to companies. I welcome the fact, if it is to be the case, that there will be four separate operating companies.  Presumably they will have separate accounts, will have to act independently and transparently, and will be unable to continue the subterfuge that went on in relation to Aer Lingus accounts for so many years.  For example, they used to charge things against the Atlantic division in order to make it look worse and render Shannon less defensible in order that they could get their way.  We want an end to all that.  People are sick of all that subterfuge and deception.  When Aer Lingus foolishly bought two 767s some few years ago they charged the lease payments of those aircraft against the Atlantic division even though the planes were never used on the Atlantic.  As a result they gave false figures in relation to the economics of their operation on the Atlantic division.  That was indefensible but they seemed to regard it as fair to cod the public.  I hope the Minister does not take that view and that we will have transparency in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="605" /> It was also noteworthy that when Aer Lingus sold their three 747s, as they did some years ago, they credited the capital sum to the main holding company of the airline, what is referred to here as Aer Lingus plc, but they charged the payments on the lease back against the Atlantic division.  If they want to credit the sale price to the main company they should also charge the lease back payments against the main company.</P>
    <P>Those are two examples of the kind of activity that took place.  It is one of the reasons many of us are so suspicious in relation to the way this airline has been run over the years.  I gave another example last evening, when speaking on Second Stage, in relation to Irish Helicopters Limited.  When a huge windfall profit was acquired by them in 1991, it was used by way of cross-subsidisation against other contracts.  The sooner that Aer Lingus desists from that kind of activity the better.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of this section &mdash; where all the shares are being exchanged from the existing companies &mdash; I would like the Minister to give the House an assurance that there will be full transparency, that we will have no further repetition of the deliberate misleading of the public and of the Dáil in this respect in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome the establishment of the four separate companies. When Aer Lingus Europe is established, I would be happy if Aer Lingus were to discover they needed routes to Europe out of Shannon.  At least that would be something to which we could look forward in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I spoke last evening I expressed my abhorrence of the accounting system adopted by Aer Lingus.  It would appear they were postponing the evil day.  I do not know what was their intention in resorting to such methods.  Last evening I made the charge that it had been politically motivated, that the people in charge avoided taking a serious decision, not wanting to take on board the bad news that Aer Lingus was in deep trouble, that it had been like a loose <Col N="606" /> cannon on the Cabinet table for three to four years.</P>
    <P>The Minister says there will be greater transparency in the future.  When the reports of these four separate companies are available, at least we will be able to ascertain who is making progress and whether there is any real intention to adhere to the Minister's claims about there being a bright future for them, with members of the Labour Party contending that the worst is over and a bright future is on the horizon.  I hope it will materialise to the extent they predict.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the Minister has not really alluded to his disappointment at the manner in which the accounting system evolved within the company.  He appears to have no regrets about what has happened.  I am disappointed he has not availed of this opportunity to say something about that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite clearly I look to the future.  I do not become involved in the apportionment of blame.  The requirement of the European Commission will be full transparency and accountability, which will be in the interests of shareholders given our experience to date.  There is no problem whatever at departmental or Government level in ensuring that that will be the case.  It is important that cost transparency in all these operations be obvious so that one can ascertain the precise performance of each subsidiary company.  I can confirm for Deputy O'Malley that these will be subsidiary companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the Cahill plan, all I can say in regard to the terminology used is that they could not anticipate the restructuring decisions of Government in regard to the new arrangements.  The Cahill plan sets out the broad strategy but could not anticipate a decision of Government in ensuring that there would be cost transparency. I confirm that the provisions of this Bill will ensure cost transparency. As Deputy O'Malley said, there is not specific reference to Aer Lingus Express but obviously that subsidiary will be established on the same basis as a cost transparent subsidiary company.  I outlined <Col N="607" /> in my introductory remarks on Second Stage the procedures that will be adopted before Aer Lingus Express starts up.  That is in the interest both of Aer Lingus Express, as a prospective lowcost airline, and of the group itself, in ensuring that it will be a success and will operate on the basis of profitability and internal viability.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 37, after &ldquo;Finance&rdquo; to insert or any other person.</P>
      <P>This is the principal section of the Bill in as much as its provisions authorise the Minister for Finance to subscribe the sum of £175 million, more than double the existing share capital of the company. The Minister has just told us that the authorised share capital of the two existing companies, Aer Lingus and Aerlinte, is of the order of £80 million.  I presume all of that is subscribed.  Aer Lingus has been in existence for upwards of 50 years. It is a great pity that, virtually in one fell swoop, its share capital has to be more than trebled because of the losses it has sustained.</P>
      <P>My concern in this amendment is to seek to give an opportunity to people other than the Minister for Finance, to subscribe to shares at some time in the future in the holding company that will be formed after this Bill is passed.  There would be no point offering shares in Aer Lingus because nobody would subscribe to them or wish to make any investment in it but hopefully the position will improve.  Management has already changed significantly and may change more.  I hope in future the policies pursued by the airline and the holding company will be different and will be commercially successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="608" /> We are entitled to be optimistic in the midst of all the gloom associated with Aer Lingus.  If we were optimistic we would say that in five, seven or ten years time the holding company may be profitable and it may be possible to get people to invest in it and thus relieve the Exchequer of some of the burden it will incur, following the passage of this Bill. If the Minister for Finance could get back some of the money invested that would be all to the good or if further funds which were needed could be obtained from other sources that would be all to the good.  At present that cannot be done. Under the provisions of section 4 only the Minister for Finance can subscribe to the shares.  There is an arrangement in the listing companies where people hold one share each but they are purely nominal for the purpose of being directors. It has nothing to do with the reality of financing the airline through share capital.</P>
    <P>It is desirable that Aer Lingus should be, at least, partly privately financed as soon as possible.  It is generally true to say that the State owned airlines in Europe are a disaster.  They have been a disaster from two points of view, first, most tend to lose money and some tend to lose very large sums of money and, second, they engage, between themselves in all kinds of restrictive practices. In particular, they operate cartels which keep air fares very high in different parts of Europe and the consumer suffers very severely.  Aer Lingus were to the forefront of operating cartels in the past, particularly in the days when British Airways was a State-owned airline and in a loss-making position.  It is a different matter now as British Airways has been privatised and it has been transformed from one of the least efficient in the world to one of the most efficient and profitable airlines.  There are other examples throughout the world where that has happened successfully.</P>
    <P>The Commission is being approached &mdash; and has been during recent years &mdash; not only by Aer Lingus, but also by Air France, by Iberia and by TAP Air Portugal &mdash; all of which are State-owned. <Col N="609" /> Generally the State-owned airlines, both in Europe and throughout the world, are the least successful while those privately-owned are the most successful.  We have an example here of a privately-owned airline which, in spite of the practices used against it during the past seven or eight years, has been able to survive and I hope will continue to survive.  I hope, following the passage of this Bill, that the kind of practices carried out against it will not be repeated in the future.</P>
    <P>I do not see any prospect in the foreseeable future of anybody, other than the Minister for Finance, wanting to subscribe to shares in the holding company, but I am optimistic and hope they will want to in five, seven or ten years.  If that was the position other investors should not be precluded from making that investment.  It would be a huge benefit to Aer Lingus and to the State as well as to the economy and, in particular, to the Exchequer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>This is where I would disagree most profoundly with Deputy O'Malley.  The provision as expressed in section 4 is correct and I would be totally opposed to amendment No. 3.  It is a strange irony that we have established, through the European Union, deregulation, an open skies policy.  That is what we are responding to and, indeed, we should have responded to it five or six years ago in terms of air transportation in Ireland.</P>
      <P>There is no longer any monopoly in air transport.  I would be more concerned about private monopolies being established. If one considers just how tiny is our air transport industry one would realise how easily we could be swamped if any person with enormous backing could come in and, in a private capacity, take over an established monopoly.  We have seen this happen in the newspaper industry where large moguls with huge funding have been able to control large sections of the so-called free and open media in various parts of the world.  Indeed, we have seen it here in Ireland.  I do not see this amendment as being the answer to any of our problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="610" /> We are going down a much safer road when we talk about providing a 5 per cent equity to the employees of Aer Lingus and in section 5 where we provide for 5 per cent profit-sharing for the employees.  We should give the staff a stake in the actual industry in which they participate, which they will be proud to be part of and will do their best to ensure that its future is maintained and expanded for the good of all concerned.</P>
    <P>If we need to expand in the future there will be many question marks.  What we are doing today and what we have done during the past number of months will not solve all the problems.  Anybody who thinks so would be very unrealistic.  We are a small part of the overall air industry. Because of competition in recent years and the problems facing so many other air companies throughout the world, we have to recognise we are in a very large playing field.  Rather than think in terms of allowing ourselves to be taken over by some of the bigger players it would be more expeditious and in the interest of this country that we think in terms of joint ventures with other players in the field.</P>
    <P>For that reason I do not regard Deputy O'Malley's amendment as being helpful. It would further dilute the strength of our holding, the extent of power in Aer Lingus and would weaken our hand in arriving at a deal on an international basis whereby we could co-operate and work in a strategic fashion, through a joint venture, some time in the future.  I am not saying that will happen but in order to look ahead we must be prepared to identify our strengths and weaknesses.</P>
    <P>I believe the section as formulated is correct and I would not like to see it amended as proposed by Deputy O'Malley.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated on Second Stage, one of the principal objectives of the Bill is to authorise the Minister for Finance as shareholder to inject £175 million equity into Aer Lingus.  It is the Government who will make this investment as its contribution to securing the <Col N="611" /> future of Aer Lingus.  Deputy O'Malley's amendment seeks to suggest that someone else should make an additional investment in the future.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage I spoke about the question of strategic alliances, joint ventures, marketing alliances, cross shareholdings, matters that can be looked at on their merits in terms of the future commercial interests of Aer Lingus.  If the suggestion he raises were a reality, it would arise in the case where the Minister for Finance was selling off his shareholding in the company.  That is not on the immediate horizon in commercial terms.  It would not be a question of requiring in this section that a person be allowed inject equity in the company.  If the Minister for Finance were to sell his shareholding &mdash; I am not saying it will arise &mdash; the amendment would not be appropriate.  A requirement that some third party, corporate or otherwise, inject further equity into the company would happen only in terms of the sale or some arrangement of cross shareholding and would not require an amended section as proposed by Deputy O'Malley.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that what the Minister has said is right.  What I have suggested is the insertion of the words &ldquo;or any other person&rdquo; so that the Minister for Finance or any other person may subscribe to further shares if they are prepared to do so in lieu of the Minister for Finance.  He is not going to take up the whole £175 million of equity at once.  If any other person is prepared to do so at some time in the future there should be legal power to enable him to do so.  If we were fortunate enough that some fairy godmother arrived in the morning with £50 million in her hands and told Aer Lingus management that she wanted to invest it in their airline they would legally have to turn her away.</P>

      <P>Section 2 governs that:</P>

    <P>The share capital of the Holding Company shall be such amount as may be determined from time to time by the <Col N="612" /> Minister for Finance after consultation with the Minister.</P>

If the words I suggest, &ldquo;or any other person&rdquo;, are inserted I do not think it will cause problems.  I do not see a queue of people willing to subscribe out at Dublin Airport.  Deputy Costello in his speech on this amendment seems to think that it would be entirely wrong that anyone other than the Minister for Finance should hold any shares in the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyone other than the Minister for Finance and the employees. He thinks the section should be left as it is to ensure that nobody other than the Minister or the employees would be able to hold shares.  I do not agree.  I have a fundamentally different point of view and I think the view I hold is common sense and followed throughout the world, not just in Europe.  We are very foolish to bury our heads in the sand and try to run a limping post-socialist economy by codding ourselves into believing that only the State is a worthy shareholder in an airline.  The transformation in the well-being of British Airways is an example near at hand and there are plenty of others.  If British Airways had continued as a State-owned airline it would have continued to limp along with State subsidies.  Now it is a major airline, one of the most profitable in the world, and is a major contributor to the British economy and its Exchequer.  I would like to see Aer Lingus becoming <Col N="613" /> the same rather than remaining a drain on the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>This House should not deprive people of the opportunity to take up shares in the company in the future.  The sooner we accept the necessity as well as the validity of privatising as many State companies as we can, the better.  We are living in some kind of post-socialist cloud cuckooland.  We are trying to hang on to so-called old principles but the sooner we ditch them the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to this amendment.  Deputy O'Malley has articulated a different attitude from that which prevails in Government and in the Labour Party.  I am very pleased that he has outlined his views and the public are entitled to assess the situation as he sees it.  He has articulated clearly that he wishes the legislation to leave the company open to privatisation.  He suggests that a fairy godmother may come along with a sum of money which she wishes to invest in the company.  As far as I am concerned, however, there is no free lunch and if someone wants to inject a large sum of money in the company he has another agenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a great many problems in Aer Lingus and the Bill and the amended Cahill plan attempt to deal with them. There is a commitment by staff, mangement and the Government to try to bring that about.  One of the main problems in Aer Lingus was the lack of equity over the years.  In the 53 years of its existence, Aer Lingus got approximately £73 million from its main shareholder which is perhaps indicative of Government's lack of commitment to the national airline over the years.  It has been very obvious in recent years as deregulation emerged in America and Europe that there were problems which had to be dealt with.  Obviously, that information was available from the mid1980s onwards but nobody was prepared to grasp the nettle and deal with the problem.  Deputy O'Malley was in Government for some of that period and perhaps his attitude as outlined this morning was in many ways responsible <Col N="614" /> for the Government not dealing with it until recently when it came to public attention.</P>
    <P>It is all very fine for Deputy O'Malley to say that we want freedom and choice, but national airlines have received support from Governments in Europe with approval from the Commission.  The Minister, and speakers last night, referred to the sums of money injected into companies with the support of the Commission.</P>
    <P>While in the past the private sector has been reluctant to invest in Aer Lingus I have no doubt that on the basis of this proposal individuals will see the opportunity that was provided on the backs of the management and workers who made major sacrifices to produce this package which I hope will secure the future of Aer Lingus.  I am confident that the proposed package will bring Aer Lingus back into profitability and the private sector will consider investing in Aer Lingus.  In the past when the State made companies profitable only then did the private sector consider them seriously.  If we accept this amendment Aer Lingus will be open to privatisation.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in many contributions in the past year, suggested that joint ventures should be considered in order to ensure the future of the company, but we should not prepare for privatisation which is what would happen if this amendment was included in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if one accepted the principle of Deputy O'Malley's amendment, the company can issue shares only under its memorandum and articles of association with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  The question of future restructuring in terms of joint ventures, strategic alliances for cross-shareholding must be decided by the Government as the main shareholder in broad policy terms.  It is not possible to accept Deputy O'Malley's amendment under the memorandum and articles of association but, even from a broad policy objective, it is not right that a semi-State company in which the Government is a 100 per cent shareholder should be allowed to take <Col N="615" /> equity from a third party without the Government having a say.  That is not to predetermine the attitude of the shareholder in any given circumstances.  We are talking here in national terms.  Whatever is in the best commercial interest of the company must be the primary consideration.</P>
      <P>We agree also that in practical terms it will not arise in the foreseeable future.  It is not possible under the memorandum and articles of association, as at present constituted, nor will it be possible under the new memorandum and articles of association of Aer Lingus plc to accept Deputy O'Malley's amendment and comply with the Bill.  Apart from that no such decision can be taken by the company without the shareholder having a determining say in policy terms.  It would be a major strategic decision which would change the corporate status of the company and will not arise in the foreseeable future, as the Deputy has acknowledged.  Even if it does the shareholder will have prior notice and a determining position on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The argument that this would not be in compliance with the memorandum and articles of association and that, therefore, the Minister cannot accept my amendment is wrong on two grounds.  We are talking about the holding company, the memorandum and articles of association of which have not yet been drafted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>If it was in conflict with the memorandum and articles of association of one of the existing companies or if the holding company memorandum had been drafted, section 15 of the Bill clearly would cover that.  It states that if there is any conflict between the provisions of the Bill and the memorandum and articles of association of any of the companies the provisions of the Bill prevail because it is public law and the memorandum and articles of association <Col N="616" /> have to be amended to comply with the provisions of the Bill.</P>

      <P>The Minister's argument is not correct.  The Minister then stated that, apart from that, he sees a difficulty because if this amendment was accepted management could go out and make a deal and the shareholder would not know about it.  The management of any company cannot bring in a new shareholder without the consent of the existing shareholders.  That is not a real argument. What is important here is not just the legal objections that the Minister is putting up, which do not stand up, but the principle of whether or not we want to have investment by somebody other than the State.  That is what I am in favour of.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that that is Deputy O'Malley's stated position, but even if that was to arise, the non-acceptance of his amendment does not preclude that possibility in the future on the basis that the Minister for Finance, as shareholder, will be selling a percentage of the shares of the company.  I am saying that it is not envisaged.</P>
      <P>When Deputy O'Malley and I are no longer Members, I hope there will be an Aer Lingus to talk about which is the whole purpose of the Bill.  I am saying that to suggest that non-acceptance of his amendment precludes that possibility is not correct as the Minister for Finance would be selling shares, not buying them.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the Task Force on Jobs in Services has now completed its report and presented it to me.  The report which was considered at Government yesterday has been placed in the Oireachtas Library.  The report contains recommendations as regards organisational changes &mdash; within Departments and agencies; changes in incentives &mdash; grant and equity support, and taxation measures; and proposed measures specific to particular service activities.</P>
      <P>In accordance with its terms of reference the task force identified measures for implementation in the short term and those requiring further study.  All of the recommendations will be borne in mind in the formulation of the 1994 budget. However, the Deputy will see from the report that, in relation to the more fundamental taxation options, the task force has highlighted the need for further in-depth evaluation bearing in mind, in particular, the taxation position of services in Ireland relative to other countries. Those options need to be examined from the standpoint of cost-effectiveness in terms of job creation.  I do not believe it will be possible to undertake the valuation required before the 1994 budget.</P>
      <P>I decided to publish the task force's report at this stage to allow for a full examination of the complex issues it covers.  After the normal process of consultation with Government Departments, individual proposals formulated in response to the task force's recommendations will be put to Government for decision.</P>

While recognising that some of the corporation tax proposals require further study, will he accept that the proposal in relation to reducing PRSI for persons earning under £10,000 per annum, which is advocated for the service sector, could be considered specifically for the 1994 budget?</P>

      <P>Will the Minister of State agree that 165 townlands without a living soul in them confirms the extent of rural decline?  Will he agree that special measures akin to the urban renewal scheme are necessary in that regard?  Perhaps a rural renewal scheme could be set up to stem the tide.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy and assure him that the Government has recognised for many years the necessity to sustain people in rural communities. A Minister of State with responsibility for rural development was appointed in 1989 and the Government adopted various other policies in that regard.  The Government takes into account factors affecting rural populations in all its policies. It appointed a Minister of State, Deputy Hyland, with specific responsibility for rural development, who I am sure most Members will agree is doing a very good job.</P>

      <P>It is clear that the Minister of State and I are of the one mind on this.  Does he accept that the measures taken to date have not been successful in halting the drift from the land?  Does he agree that more radical measures are needed and that, despite <Col N="620" /> the best efforts of the Minister of State, Deputy Hyland, we should have a Cabinet Minister for western development with responsibility for the 12 western counties to ensure that this continued drift from the land is halted?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Art, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I proposed to take Questions Nos. 4, 11 and 97 together.</P>
      <P>Temple Bar Properties Limited which comes under the aegis of the Minister for the Environment, is involved in the development of Dublin's cultural quarter in Temple Bar, including the adaptation of the former Church of St. Michael and St. John for use as a Viking museum.  I understand that planning permission for the development has been granted by Dublin Corporation and upheld on appeal by An Board Pleanála.</P>
      <P>I am aware of this development and of the concerns of An Taisce in relation to it.  An Taisce claim that much of the interior of the former Church of St. Michael and St. John, deconsecrated in 1989, is to be destroyed and require that this building be re-opened as a multidenominational church to serve the community in the area.  However, I am not aware of any organisation which is seeking to purchase and to reinstate the church for ecclesiastical purposes.  At any rate I am informed that the developments for the interior of this building do not involve its destruction but are so designed as to be totally reversible at a later date if required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I am in the early stages of developing my architectural policy, I am impressed by the approach of the developers in this instance, in particular their concept of a museum inserted within the <Col N="622" /> restored fabric of the existing buildings. It may well be that in many cases the future preservation of such old buildings. will best be served by adopting them to new uses, but in a manner which leaves the process reversible if required in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms F. Fitzgerald Ms F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that An Taisce said that irreversible alterations will be made to this historic building? I agree with the Minister that Temple Bar Properties is the flagship when it comes to sensitive developments but is the Minister concerned about this development in terms of conservation?  I understand that a number of features of this old church, one of the first Catholic churches in Dublin where pennies were collected and bells were rung for the first time in 300 years in the 1800s, will be damaged?  For example, the ceiling is to be removed.  Does the Minister agree that this poses very serious questions about the balance between development and conservation?  Will the Minister meet with An Taisce to examine the matter once more?  While this development may be legal is it the right way to proceed? What is the reason we should replace a genuine historical article with a phoney?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern in relation to the balance between conservation and development. Recently I discussed these matters with the Royal Institute of Architects, including the appropriate strategies for the future.  I am well aware also of An Taisce's observations.  The Deputy mentioned that the original building will be destroyed but in many senses under the proposals the original will be revealed because the ceiling to which she referred is being taken down in sections and stored so that it may be used if, for example, potential users in the future want to use the building for a purpose other than that proposed by the planners.  The taking down of the ceiling reveals the oak beams of the previous building on the site, namely, those of the Smock Alley Theatre.  I agree this is a sensitives matter, is one that I intend to monitor in <Col N="623" /> so far as I have a role to play.  As I said in my reply, the strategy in this case of removing the ceiling and putting it into storage to allow the present proposals to be reversed in the future is a sensible one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms F. Fitzgerald Ms F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision to remove the ceiling to expose the beams is questionable.  In view of the amount of money that will be available to protect our heritage and conserve our old buildings &mdash; I am aware that the Minister has a personal interest in this &mdash; will he meet Temple Bar Properties and An Taisce to see what lessons can be learned and if guidelines should be drawn up to cover future developments to ensure that the genuine article is preserved?  This is a very old Catholic church in Dublin with unique features.  While I respect Temple Bar Properties I am genuinely worried that we are losing the genuine article for the sake of developing a Viking centre.</P>

This is the wise course.  The approach of my Department has been to respect the autonomy of bodies that are separated from us but I am open to the possibility of consultations in the future, as I have been since I assumed office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking Questions Nos. 5, 17 and 40 together.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputies to my reply to Questions Nos. 3, 15, 26, 43 and 81 on 4 November 1993, columns 1130-1134 of the Official Report of that day, on this issue.</P>
      <P>My position has always been that the Order under section 31 (1) of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, as amended by the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1976, was not a matter for automatic renewal.  I have indicated that I would be examining the operation of the Order under this section prior to the question of its renewal being considered by Government.  I have now completed this examination and have put proposals to Government.  In line with standard procedures, I am sure Deputies would agree, it would not be appropriate for me to discuss my proposals before the Government has had the opportunity to considered them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of my examination, I asked the RTE Authority to let me have the guidelines which they would propose to issue to staff in the event that the Order under section 31 was not renewed next January, and, in relation to matters at present covered under the terms of <Col N="625" /> the current section 31 Order, that the Authority had to comply with the provision of section 18 (1A) of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, inserted by section 3 of the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1976.</P>
    <P>This section prohibits the Authority, <i>inter alia,</i> from including in any of its broadcats anything which may reasonably be regraded as being likely to promote, or incite to, crime or as tending to undermine the authority of the State.</P>
    <P>It would be a matter for the Authority, to decide whether to publish the guidelines under which it would operate in these circumstances.  RTE is autonomous in relation to its day-to-day activities under the broadcasting legislation and I have no statutory functions in relation to the content of any guidelines the Authority may issue to its staff in relation to programme matters.</P>
    <P>The current order will expire unless renewed on 19 January 1994.  The form of any order which might be made under section 31 (1) is governed by the section itself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms F. Fitzgerald Ms F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the Minister is not saying at this stage what his proposals are in relation to section 31.  That must be put in the context of today's declaration.  My party and I hope that the men of violence will say they will no longer engage in violence and then section 31 will become irrelevant.  The Minister mentioned the guidelines RTE propose to issue to staff and I would like to hear his views on those guidelines?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated my views on the issue of guidelines.  As Minister with responsibility for broadcasting I have to tread a delicate path in relation to broadcasting matters.  I do not interfere with RTE in matter of programming; yet, as part of my review, I had to envisage many different situation, for example, the previous guidelines, guidelines that had been changed but that RTE would wish to put in place.  That correspondence between the RTE Authority and myself took place as part of a very thorough review of the whole issue <Col N="626" /> and content of section 31 (1).  I am grateful to the Deputy for the sensitivity with which she approached this question, particularly today.  I gave a commitment earlier that I would have a review in place in plenty of time for the Government to consider all the issues, including the balance of issues of criminal law, broadcasting legislation and the circumstances of the time.  That is now in place and before Government for decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms F. Fitzgerald Ms F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Minister said about not interfering with RTE but surely if the Minister recommended any change he would have to be satisfied that incitement to hatred would not be possible on the air waves and he would have to explain to this House whether he was satisfied.  Depending on the response from the Provisional IRA today, section 31 may not be needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy need not be confused in the slightest.  I did of course consider this dimension, as I said repeatedly, when I was reviewing the entire issue.  In the course of my review I addressed the issue of the legislation which has existed since 1989 on the prohibition against incitement to violence and hatred and so on.  It is very important legislation.  I reviewed the different relevant sections of the legislation.  There is no question of our acting precipitously without considering these issues.  I have been criticised for taking the time to thoroughly examine the implications of what is at stake.  The advantage of my not automatically renewing the order is that I have been able to place before Government a very thorough review which includes a consideration of guidelines in all possible situations.</P>

      <P>Tógfaidh mé Ceisteanna Uimhir 6, 7, 10, 22, 30, 37, 51, 99, 104 agus 110 le chéile.</P>
      <P>Tá an Rialtas tar éis cead a thabhairt dom treoir a thabhairt do RTÉ tús a chur láithreach leis an obair thógála ar ghréasán tarchuradóirí, i gcaoi is go mbeidh an glacadh is foreleithne is féidir ag tús craolta na seirbhíse, agus ar nascghréasán microthonn agus áiseanna láithriúcháin agus clár-léiriúcháin a ghabhann leo, ag ceanncheathrú Theilifís na Gaeilge, a bheidh lonnaithe i gceantar Bhaile na hAbhann/An Tulach, i nGaeltacht na Gaillimhe, agus freisin i nDomhnach Broc, i mBaile Atha Cliath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá an Rialtas tar éis údarás a thabhairt dom freisin treoir a thabhairt do RTÉ gurb iad a bheidh freagrach as earcú fóirne agus as coimisiúnú cláracha don tseirbhís nua, fad is atáthar ag ullmhú struchtúr reachtúil neamhspleách do Theilifís na Gaeilge.  Táthar ag iarraidh ar RTÉ Comhairle naonúir a cheapadh faoi alt 21 den Acht Craolacháin, 1960, chun comhairle a chur ar Údarás RTÉ maidir le fostú fóirne ar chonradh agus <Col N="629" /> maidir le coimisiúnú cláracha roimh thús craolta na seirbhíse nua.  Bhí cruinniú agam cheana féin le Cathaoirleach Udarás RTÉ agus leis an bPríomh-Stiúrthóir chun iad a chur ar an eolas maidir le cinneadh an Rialtais.</P>
    <P>Déanfar maoiniú ar an gcostas capitil a ghabhann le bunú na seirbhíse as an mbarrachas airgid, £17.9 milliúin a bhí carntha de bhreis ar an srian a bhí i bhfeidhm ar ioncam fógraíochta RTÉ. Chuir RTÉ £13.4 mhilliún den iomlán sin ar fáil don Státchiste faoi réir an Achta Airgeadais, 1993.  De réir na meastachán atá curtha ar fáil dom, beidh costas iomlán caipitil £17.35 mhilliún ag dul leis an togra seo.  Caithfear tuairim £6 mhilliún den méid sin sa bhliain 1994. Tá an t-airgead seo i dtaisce i gcuntas ar leith ag RTÉ agus ní bheidh aon airgead Státchiste ag teastáil chuige seo sa bhliain 1994.  Beidh costas reatha £3 mhilliún i gceist, áfach, sa bhliain 1994 agus caithfear an t-airgead sin ar earcú fóirne, ar chúrsaí oiliúna agus ar ullmhú cláracha. Cuirfear an costas reatha sin ar fáil i bhfoirm deontais-i-gcabhair do RTÉ trí Vóta mo Roinne-se.</P>
    <P>Mar a mhínigh mé i bhfreagra don Teach ar 4 Samhain, meastar go gcosnódh trí uair a chloig de chláracha in aghaidh an lae tuairim £16 mhilliún sa bhliain.  Anuas ar sin bheadh costas £5 mhilliún breise in aghaidh na bliana i gceist i ndáil le costais reatha eile na seirbhíse.  Tá sé i gceist, áfach, go gcuirfeadh REÉ, mar chuid dá sheirbhís phoiblí, uair a chloig de chláracha ar fáil in aghaidh an lae, gan chostas do Theilifís na Gaeilge.  Chiallódh sin go mbeadh glanchostas reatha £16 mhilliún sa bhliain ag baint le Teilifís na Gaeilge i luachanna an lae inniu.</P>
    <P>Idir seo agus an túsdáta craolta, tá fúm fiosrú a dhéanamh foai na bealaí ina bhféadfaí na meastacháin sin a laghdú. Beidh mé, i gcomhairle leis an aire Airgeadais, ag fiosrú modhanna ina bhféadfaí an caiteachas sin a mhaoiniú.  Faoi mar atá luaite sa Chlár le haghaidh Rialtais Chomhpháirtíochta, tiocfaidh an chuid is mó den airgead ón Státchiste.  Nílim ag smaoineamh ar aon ardú a chur ar an táille do cheadúnais teilifíse chun <Col N="630" /> maoiniú a dhéanamh ar Theilifís na Gaeilge.  Tá tús curtha le comhráitíle feidhmeannaigh de chuid Aontais na hEorpa féachaint an féidir cistíocht a fháil ón bhfoinse sin agus leanfar leis na fiosruithe sin.</P>
    <P>Meastar go gcuirfear tús le craolta na seirbhíse nua i bhFómhar na bliana 1995. Ag glacadh leis go mbeidh maoiniú sásúil caipitil ar fáil don togra i 1995, bheinn ag súil go mbeadh suas le 90 faoin gcéad de dhaonra na tíre in ann an tseirbhís a ghlacadh ó thús craolta.</P>
    <P>Tá dóchas agam go mbeidh an tseirbhís nua, ach í faoi lánseol, in ann fostaíocht a bhunú agus a bhuanú do bhreis agus dhá chéad duine san earnáil closamhairc, sa Ghaeltacht agus taobh amuigh di.  Measter go mbeith suas le tríocha duine ar fad ar fhoireann bhuan an stáisiúin nua.</P>
    <P>Faoi mar is eol do na Teachtaí, bhunaigh mé dhá choiste comhairleach, An Coiste Bunaithe agus An Coiste Teicniúil, mar chabhair do dhréachtadh na mion-mholtaí maidir le Teilifís na Gaeilge.  Chuir mé san áireamh na moltaí a rinne an dá choiste sin agus mé ag ullmhú mo chuid moltáí féin, atá anois glactha leo ag an Rialtas.</P>
    <P>Scrúdaigh an Rialtas an rogha faoina bhféadfaí an tseirbhís nua a chur ar cheann de na cainéil atá ag RTÉ cheann féin ach diúltaíodh don rogha sin ar mhórán cúiseanna.</P>
    <P>Dearbhaíonn an méid atá sa Chlár le haghaidh Rialtais Chomhpháirtíochta gur mar chainéil ar leith a bhunófaí Teilifís na Gaeilge agus tá an Rialtas ag seasamh leis an dearbhú sin.  Cuireann RTÉ sceideal comhlántach cláracha ar fáil ar an dá chainéal teilifíse atá faoina stiúir. Dá mbeifí chun Teilifís na Gaeilge a chur ar cheann den dá chainéal sin, chaithfí sciar substaintiúil de sceideal an ardtráthnóna ar cheann de na cainéil a thabhairt don tseirbhís nua.  Chuirfeadh a leithéid de shocrú srian iomarcach ar fhorbairt Theilifís na Gaeilge agus chuirfeadh sé isteach go mór freisin ar sceidil RTÉ. Bheadh deireadh leis an sceideal comhlántach atá RTÉ in ann a sholáthar faoi láthair agus bheadh deireadh freisin leis an solúbthacht sceidil a chuireann ar <Col N="631" /> chumas RTÉ oll-chlúdach nach féidir a shárú a dhéanamh ar mhór-ócáidí.</P>

      <P>The Minister said it will cost RTE £5 million annually to supply one hour of television per day to Teilifís na Gaeilge.  Is that not a conservative estimate?  Will the cost to RTE not be greater?  In the question I tabled I asked what cost per hour on home produced programmes the Minister used in his calculation.  Will he agree that he has built a low cost per hour figure into his calculations?  Is the Minister optimistic about European funding and what criteria will have to be fulfilled for Teilifís na Gaeilge to be eligible for European funding?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the cost per hour, the Deputy who is familiar with broadcasting will know that costs differ for boardcasts of one hour for different types of programmes.  I am happy that the figure of £5 million is conservative in that it is a high figure.</P>
      <P>In relation to the source of European funding, officials of my Department have been in touch with many different sections of the European Community in relation to funding.  It is clear that rather than funding coming from a single source within the Commission of the European Union, there are many different sections that can assist different parts of the operating costs and procedures.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="632" /> Is it intended to use the channel for other purposes during the day given that Teilifís na Gaeilge will be broadcasting for some time for three hours per day?  I am mindful in particular of community television and it might be considered worthwhile broadcasting the Oireachtas live for those who would like to see it as it would improve the democratic deficit we have in this State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Gabhaim buíochas leis an Teachta De Rossa as ucht a fháilte roimh Theilifís na Gaeilge.  Bhí a pháirtí d'aon ghuth ina fháilte roimh an tseirbhís, rud nárbh fhíor i dtaobh gach páirtí. Tá sé ar intinn agam, an tseirbhís a chur ar fáil don oileán ar fad chomh fada agus is féidir liom.  Bhí cainteanna agam cúpla seachtain ó shin leosiúd a bhfuil cúram cúrsaí craolacháin an Tuaiscirt orthu.  Tá deacrachtaí teichniúla ann ach táimid tosnaithe orthu sin a shárú.</P>
      <P>Bhí ceist ag an Teachta De Rossa faoin úsáid is féidir a bhaint as an chainéil nua. Of course, this new channel should be seen as an important contribution to the broadcasting infrastructure of the state. I accept the Deputy's suggestions.  The new channel provides wonderful opportunities in so far as financial and other possibilities permit to use it for enhancing citizenship.  I agree with the Deputy in that regard.  The new channel may be used for the teaching of languages and for distance learning.  It may be used also for educating people in regard to citizens' rights.  It may be used also for broadcasting proceedings of the Oireachtas. All those potential uses will be considered by the new advisory group that will be established to handle the founding of the new channel.  It provides an exciting contribution to the broadcasting infrastructure of the State.</P>

      <P>A legitimate question on funding should not be seen as an attack on the Irish language.  I want to see policies that support and encourage the development of the Irish language and ensure that more people will speak Irish fluently.  I regret that policies in this area have failed in the past.  Regarding <Col N="633" /> funding, where will the remaining £11 million come from?  I understand the idea of a levy or tax on videos may be contrary to European law.  Has the Minister ruled out that possibility of funding?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Deputy reads the translation of my remarks she will see that I did not accuse her of being against the Irish language.  I complimented Deputy De Rossa on the unequivocal and unanimous welcome for the new service given by his party.  In relation to the funding, capital funding is explicitly referred to in the Programme for Government.  It will come from the accumulated surpluses under the cap which was occasioned by section 3 of the Broadcasting Act, 1990.  Regarding the running cost, it has been made clear that it will be covered by Exchequer funding. The Deputy asked a question in relation to raising funds from levies on videos. She did not refer to raising funds through the television licence fee.  There is no one designated source of funding for Teilifís na Gaeilge.  It will be funded by the Exchequer and, therefore, is open to my colleague, the Minister for Finance, to review all means of funding.</P>

      <P>The question relates to the signing of the charter &mdash; I am not writing the charter.  The issue arises as to the definition of a minority, lesser used or regional language, and this is part of the difficulty I had to resolve.  On the one hand I wanted to protect the constitutional position of the Irish language and also to look at the whole issue of the various departmental views.  I want to be explicit on this matter.  I will not allow the signing to be delayed for reasons of tardiness in receiving the views of any Department.  The Deputy raises an important issue.  All the evidence seems to suggest that people who speak two languages can more easily speak three or four languages.  With the setting up of Teilifís na Gaeilge we will have important broadcasting infrastructure that will advance the Irish language in new circumstances and will also have the technical capacity to introduce the teaching of other languages.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1993 the amount allocated to the National Gallery for acquisitions was £100,000 and I have secured a significant increase, of the order of 50 per cent, on that sum for 1994.  While it would be true to say that no amount of funding could match our aspirations in this area, the Deputy can be assured that the allocation will be kept under review to take account of the gallery's needs in an increasingly buoyant art market.  Of course, I would not like to let an opportunity like this pass without paying tribute to the generosity of the donors in the private sector who have enabled us to build up the national collection. <Col N="636" /> The most recent example of this extraordinary generosity was that of the Jesuit community who presented Caravaggio's magnificent &ldquo;The Taking of Christ&rdquo; on indefinite loan to the National Gallery.</P>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to compliment the gallery's staff under the leadership of Sergio Benedetti on their magnificent work on the restoration of the painting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all delighted with the fairytale story of the Caravaggio painting and I pay tribute to the Jesuits for making it available to the public through the National Gallery.  Would the Minister accept that the £150,000 referred to is a miserable sum for acquisitions by the gallery?  If it is to continue to have pride of place, as should be the case, an adequate sum should be provided to the gallery.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The more money that can be provided for the important work of the gallery the more I will be pleased, but I think the Deputy will agree that 50 per cent, admittedly of a low sum, in the current year is a significant increase.  In this area as in many others I inherited a bleak landscape.  In the last year there has been a very significant and positive change in this regard.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister accept that when the national lottery was set up the original idea of the Government, of which I was a member, was that funding would be available for two main objectives, sport and the arts?  Would the Minister accept that that thinking was not followed through and that the vast sums of money now available through the lottery are being spent, as described by the Comptroller and Auditor General, in a haphazard fashion?  Would the Minister agree that thought should be given to giving sport and the arts higher priority in terms of the allocation of national lottery money?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Those who favoured expenditure on the arts and had the <Col N="637" /> opportunity to allocate money to that area in those early days should perhaps have been firmer in their resolve in making significant allocations.

      <P>While one is delighted with the discovery of the Caravaggio painting, there is a danger that other such paintings of significance may be removed from the country.  Has the Minister's Department any plan to prevent this from happening, as the generosity shown in the case of the Caravaggio painting may not be experienced again?  Will the Minister say what is the value of the Shaw bequest to the National Gallery and how long more is it anticipated that this bequest will be available for funding of new acquisitions at the gallery?</P>

I am open to looking at whatever legislative initiatives are necessary to ensure the protection of what is part of our heritage.  On the question of the Shaw bequest, as the Deputy knows, this bequest is very important to the gallery.  If the Deputy puts down a question on the matter I will give him a history of the funding to date and the benefit likely to accrue therefrom.  I should say that the Shaw bequest is not perceived by me as an exclusive alternative to the obligation on the State to fund the gallery adequately.  I hope in the years to come to put the gallery and other cultural institutions on a more sound basis.</P>

      <P>The future of the arts should not be made the matter of a squabble &mdash; it is above that kind of nonsense. To answer the Deputy's question very straightforwardly, I was very pleased yesterday to received on behalf of the museum for the purposes of exhibition the diary of Michael Collins.  I am delighted that the minor rumble, as I referred to it, which arose 30 years ago has been resolved by the generous members of the Collins family who gave the diary to the National Museum staff.</P>

I wish to ask the Minister about the matter which is very closely connected to this issue, that is, the proportion of national lottery funding available for the arts.  Has the Minister made a submission to the Government on the proportion of money available from the national lottery for the arts and culture?  Is he satisfied with the present level of funding?</P>

      <P>One of the consequences of my appointment as Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht is that, I, as a full member of Cabinet, have been able to make submissions for funding under the Structural Funds for the different cultural institutions.  I am sure that the Minister previously responsible for these areas would have wanted to take advantage of this source of funding. I have availed of all the opportunities afforded me to secure Structural Funding for cultural institutions.</P>

Mar adúirt mé cruthaíodh 11,258 bpost nua lánaimseartha agus is iontach gur chruthaigh <Col N="641" /> an tÚdarás na jobanna sin sa Ghaeltacht, atá ar imeall na tíre seo agus ar imeall an Chomhphobail.  Is é an rud atá ag cur isteach orainn go mór ná gur cailleadh 10,079 bpost sna blianta sin. Cailleadh go leor de na postanna sin sna sean tionscail traidisiúnta, mar shampla cniotáil agus fíodóireacht.  Cailleadh jobanna ansin de dheasca ath-struchtúrú a bhí ag dul ar aghaidh sna comhlachataí éagsúla &mdash; níos mó meaisíní ag déanamh jobanna in áit daoine.</P>

Ar ndóigh tá fadhbanna breise againn-ne os rud é go bhfuil an chuid is mó den Ghaeltacht ar imeall an Chomhphobail.

Bheadh ar chigirí ansin cuairt a thabhairt ar na teaghlaigh agus ar na scoileanna go léir a chuirfeadh isteach ar an scéim. Ceist airgid i seo freisin ach is ceist phraiticiúil í go bunúsach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Section 4 provides that the Minister for Finance may subscribe for further shares up to an amount not exceeding £175 million. Deputy O'Malley seeks to amend that section by providing that the Minister for Finance or any other person, which introduces the concept of private investors coming in and buying Aer Lingus shares.  In present circumstances the only investor who is interested in Aer Lingus shares is the Government.  On any kind of open market there would be no offer for a tranche of Aer Lingus shares.  We need only recall that there were accumulated debts of £540 million and losses of £188 million in 1993.  Who would want to buy into a company, in terms of equity, with that kind of profile?  Even after the restructuring which has taken place on the cost base and the intention of the <Col N="711" /> Minister to sell subsidiaries and put in equity, on the best case scenario it is difficult to see Aer Lingus being profitable in the short term and it is difficult in the medium term to see a dividend being distributed.  The issue of private shareholding in a public offer, along the lines of the amendment, is not a practical possibility at present.</P>
      <P>The future of Aer Lingus, like the future of many European airlines, is contingent on arrangements being made with other large airline companies.  The national carriers of Europe are forming alliances and there will be four or possibly five mega-carriers within a short time, some of which are in place already.  There are groups of airlines centred around British Airways, Lufthansa, Air France and SAS and another may be centred on Alitalia or Iberia.  It is not possible for Aer Lingus to continue on its own under the guise of being a national carrier when it is becoming increasingly regional in its activities.</P>
      <P>I am not sure what the future of the North Atlantic holds under the arrangements being made by the Minister.  Following changes in the bilateral agreement, Aer Lingus will be competing with American airlines whose cost base is 40 per cent lower than the average European cost.  Aer Lingus will also be competing indirectly with the same group of airlines into London and backtracking into Dublin.  If the Minister's plans are successful for Aer Lingus Express on the Dublin-London route and if the competition which one expects comes in on that route &mdash; I understand six or seven airlines have indicated an interest &mdash; this will be a very low cost route for several years ahead.  That has an implication on the transatlantic route also.  If one can backtrack from London to Dublin at shuttle costs it makes it a very attractive option to fly from one of 25 American cities directly to Heathrow and backtrack to Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think Aer Lingus has a future in the medium term unless arrangements are made with other European carriers and perhaps with American carriers.  SAS <Col N="712" /> is a very big airline company but originally it was an amalgamation of the national airlines of Sweden, Denmark and Norway.  Individually they were three small national carriers.  It is interesting to see how this has developed. We now have a merger of Swedish Air, Danish Air and Norwegian Air into SAS. Last year SAS announced they were teaming up with KLM, Swissair and Austrian Airlines.  SAS, KLM and Swissair each plan to hold 30 per cent in a new operating company.  The smaller Austrian Airlines will take 10 per cent. That is the kind of arrangement that is being made between the smaller national carriers &mdash; a holding company with three taking 30 per cent and one taking 10 per cent.  That is the type of arrangement Aer Lingus will have to consider in the future rather than a public subscription to shares.</P>
    <P>I do not believe Aer Lingus can survive as a national carrier in anything but name without making arrangements with some of the other European carriers.  As we move towards the open skies policy and the free market policy to which most Ministers of Transport in Europe have now pinned their colours, there will not be an independent airline carrier for each country of Europe.  The days of the individual national carrier, almost being an arm of Government as a state company and flying all the national routes on a closed shop basis, are over but the fallout is commencing.</P>
    <P>An enormous number of arrangements operate now following Danish Air, Norwegian Air and Swedish Air coming together to form SAS and then entering into a partnership arrangement in a holding company with KLM and Swissair with a 10 per cent holding for Austrian Air.</P>
    <P>KLM, in which it is in partnership, has a minor stake in American North West, in Swissair, in Delta Airlines and Singapore Airlines.  Air France, for example, has teamed up with Sabina and CSA; Air Canada has invested in American Continental.  Even American Airlines are taking on partners and that company has a partnership arrangement <Col N="713" /> with Lufthansa.  British Airways plans to set up an airline in Russia.  It owns 49 per cent of Deutsche BA, a new German airline and it took a 25 per cent share in Quantas in 1992.</P>
    <P>It is not the detail but the pattern that is important.  While the arrangements for four or five mega carriers are being made in Europe, Aer Lingus is struggling with bankruptcy.  It is not a question of Aer Lingus being a company for which there is a queue of investors if only the reluctant Minister would open the door to the private sector.  That is not the reality.  If it were not for the Government's commitment to the rescue plan, Aer Lingus would have gone belly up and nobody from the private sector would come in to rescue it until the liquidation sale.</P>
    <P>We hope that the combination of the cost-cutting measures, the injection of equity and the disposal of subsidiaries will return the airline to profitability.  It is only at that point that Aer Lingus will be on a par with other airlines, which made such decisions but they had been properly run for the past three or four years.  Aer Lingus will then have to make the key decisions for the medium term and this must involve partnership arrangements.  I know the Minister is putting matters rather softly but I do not think joint ventures is the way things will work out.  It will be organised on the basis of either a holding company, in which a number of partners have a shareholding or a reciprocal arrangement where Aer Lingus buys an equity stake in its putative partner and the partner buys into Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>We have gone beyond the stage where the equity holding of Aer Lingus can be preserved totally in the hands of the Government.  It is not because there is an ideological drive towards privatisation but simply because of the way the airline industry is going, this is the nature of the arrangement that will have to take place. Whether it can open up further and the Irish investor in the future can buy shares in the publicly quoted Aer Lingus company on the Dublin Stock Exchange, I do not know but, again, there are straws in the wind that suggest that is what will <Col N="714" /> happen eventually.  There is not much point in giving the workers of Aer Lingus up to 5 per cent of the equity of the company unless the shares have a market value.  If the Government is the only investor it seems that there is not any market value except what the Minister decides from time to time might be the value of the shares.  Certainly, I doubt if the workers will be able to cash in their shares at the nominal value.</P>
    <P>I am glad Deputy O'Malley tabled this amendment as it opened up the debate. However, in the way it is cast it is premature. If one were trying to privatise Aer Lingus it would require a major privatisation Bill rather than an amendment to a provision that allows the Minister to inject equity into the company.  I am not advocating that route but in my view it is inevitable that there will be arrangements where the Government shareholding in Aer Lingus will of necessity be diluted as Aer Lingus enters partnership arrangements which are necessary for its medium term survival.  Beyond that point it is a question of whether individual shareholders can get involved subsequently or not.  I believe that is the way it is going to go.</P>
    <P>The unions negotiated an arrangement with the management team, with the goodwill of the Government, to enter into profit-sharing arrangements by way of equity.  I suggest that that arrangement only makes sense if ultimately the Government's shareholding is diluted and where it reaches the point that the value of the share has a measurable external value and is simply not an internal estimate by the Minister and his Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the general thrust of the arguments on future arrangements put forward by Deputy Noonan.  Before strategic alliances, joint ventures or cross-shareholding arrangements can be considered both parties have to bring something to the table.  Aer Lingus is not in a position because of its commercial problems to bring a great deal to the table and that is why a State equity injection is required to stabilise and consolidate the <Col N="715" /> position of the company as part of an overall package.  Because of the level of indebtedness, referred to by previous speakers, that of itself will not resolve the problem.  The core operational problems have to be addressed, and are being addressed, and the debt overhang of £540 million has to be addressed in terms of the judicious disposal of assets.  The cost reductions and the injection of equity taken together offer the best prospects for viability in the circumstances.</P>
      <P>I agree it is not possible to foresee what the future may hold.  However, the Government, as the shareholder, is open to suggestions for consideration in terms of what is in the best commercial interest of Aer Lingus at any given time.  Some marketing alliances have been entered into.  Earlier in the year Aer Lingus concluded a memorandum of understanding regarding a worldwide interline feed arrangement with British Airways on passengers and a similar agreement has recently been concluded on freight.  Aer Lingus believes it may have to wait until the strategy is fully operational and the airline has achieved the necessary financial targets to enable it to be in a much stronger position to seek a partner in the future.</P>
      <P>These issues are not in the immediate future and, perhaps, it is slightly ponderous to seek to indicate with any degree of accuracy what will be the outcome only to say that whatever is in the best commercial interest of Aer Lingus has to be the primary criteria from which one looks at prospective partners, alliances or marketing arrangements.  For that and other reasons outlined earlier, I am not in a position to accept Deputy O'Malley's amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Noonan says it could be quite a number of years before the possibility of anyone taking up shares would arise.  I said that twice this morning. I said that even being optimistic it could be five to ten years before the possibility arises.  If one was pessimistic it might never arise and all one might ever see is the sale of assets which I hope will not be the case.  It should be open to people, including the Government, without recourse to further legislation to encourage investors if and when the time comes.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan portrayed a scenario of partnerships and cross-shareholdings and so on, which is happening in many parts of Europe and the US.  I accept that there may be such developments but he is not correct in his references to SAS. That proposal for a merger between four airlines, one of which was SAS, has fallen through and Mr. Carlzon has resigned as President and chief executive officer of SAS as a result of his failure to get agreement. That means there are four airlines in Europe who are not spoken for, who are not tied into some form of alliance. This may well be the last opportunity that Aer Lingus will have after the passage of this Bill to make some kind of an arrangement with some one of those.  If one moves away from the centre of Europe to the periphery there is not much point in Aer Lingus making arrangements of that kind with somebody like Tap for example, with Olympic of Greece or with Malev or one of those at present in central or eastern Europe.  It would have to make an arrangement with some airline in the central part of western Europe.  This opportunity may be available only to Aer Lingus for six to 12 months after the passage of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If an arrangement of the kind Deputy Noonan talked about was on offer it would not be possible for one of those <Col N="717" /> airlines to take a shareholding in Aer Lingus after the passage of this Bill and that is wrong.  I will not labour the point any further nor do I want to return to the matters we debated this morning. However, I have not heard any Member disagree with the logic of my strong feeling that we should do what other countries have done and not retain the State unnecessarily in enterprises in which it does not have to be involved.  I have heard several people say that they do not agree with me, but nobody has contradicted the logic of it.  It seems to make abundant sense and to be foolish to try to remain in some kind of time warp as if this was not happening.  It is obvious I have no support in the House for that point and for that reason I will not press the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 38, after &ldquo;£175,000,000&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;provided that the consent of the European commission is obtained to such subscription&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister may well say that what is contained in my amendments is self evident because it has to happen, but it seems to be putting the cart before the horse to come along with this legislation in respect of a proposal that has been put to the Commission, before the Commission has consented to it.  If the Commission does not consent to it this will be law in Ireland but it will be unenforceable and ineffective.  Under European law the Minister for Finance will not be allowed to make the investment.  To make that absolutely clear it is common sense to say so in the Bill and that would allow for the consent of the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other way to deal with this would be to postpone this Bill until the consent of the Commission is forthcoming.  There <Col N="718" /> is no point in us trying to legislate potentially in the teeth of the Commission. The Minister has been assured of the Commission's consent and they may well consent but, perhaps, only with conditions. Conditions have been applied to large investments of State aid in numerous cases not just in relation to aviation.  With every month that passes the Commission become stricter because they are fundamentally opposed to the concept of State aids being given to any industries who are competing with private companies that have no subsidy from any taxpayer but who are in fact paying taxes.  I am glad the Commission take that view as it is eminently sensible. I am glad that they are becoming more strict and the stricter they become the better because for too long we have had the abuse of State commercial power. Both here and in the Community companies aided by the taxpayer have constantly acted to the detriment of those who do not receive assistance.  A classic example of it here, apart from Aer Lingus, is CIE who get £110 million annually to subsidise their losses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>As is the wont in modern State commercial accountancy, they are called something else but the reality is that they are losses and CIE up to now has been allowed to act in a way which is unfair to those competing with it who do not receive any subsidiary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to accept this amendment although it would be more appropriate for the Bill to be delayed until the consent of the Commission is forthcoming.  My amendment No. 5 seeks to ensure that the conditions which will be imposed will be complied with because there might be an anxiety not to comply with such conditions.  If consent is forthcoming, and we are told by the Minister that it will be, it is unlikely that it will be forthcoming without conditions if we are to judge by previous experience and the experience in other countries.  Some of the conditions imposed will be quite stringent <Col N="719" /> and could have quite an effect on the prospects for the revitalisation of Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>The debate on this Bill will be less than meaningful if we do not know if consent will be forthcoming and the conditions, if any, that will be attached to it.  It is similar to legislating for a position we know will change dramatically in a short time following the enactment of the Bill. In normal circumstances if a Minister came into the House and requested us to legislate on a <i>carte blanche</i> basis, the House would suggest that he should wait until all the circumstances were known. In an attempt to cover those points before becoming aware of what they are, I have tabled those amendments and I ask the Minister to accept them.</P>

      <P>I want to make a couple of points arising from Deputy O'Malley's contribution.  It is a great mistake to put forward the proposition that the only companies which benefit from State aid are State companies.  It would be difficult to find any company here, public or private, that has not benefited from some form of State aid.  It has been a feature of Irish industry that substantial State aid, such as IDA and training grants, tax breaks and so on, is provided to industries.  Unfortunately, we do not often hear about such aid.  What was the £20 million given to GPA through SFADCo if not a form of State aid?  The only time that aid was questioned was when an RTE journalist put a pointed question to a Government Minister and nearly lost his job as a result.</P>

      <P>It is somewhat like the fax.  The amendments propose that the legislation should not take effect until the European Commission gives its approval.  I am concerned that the European Commission should have to give its approval to what is proposed in this House.  We are talking about Irish taxpayers' money and it is ironic that we are <Col N="720" /> passing legislation in what is supposed to be a sovereign Parliament and it is being argued that we must await the approval of the European Commission.  Do we seriously intend to hand over to the European Commission the last vestiges of sovereignty and the effective decisionmaking for our economy and public life? I do not accept that, particularly when I consider what is happening in other member states of the European Union who, whenever they like, can extract themselves from the commitments of membership.  The United Kingdom had no difficulty in ducking out of a number of commitments under the Maastricht Treaty.  Denmark was effectively able to renegotiate sections of the Maastricht Treaty whereas we were told here that could not be done.  During the currency crisis last year, Germany faced no great difficulties in regard to the conditions attached to the Maastricht Treaty, yet we cannot pass simple legislation relating to a company owned by the State, which proposes to provide equity from the pockets of the Irish taxpayer to the company, without the approval of the European Commission.  I cannot accept that, particularly as stringent conditions were not attached to similar equity and assistance given to companies in other member states.  The Minister challenged my comments in that regard yesterday.  I share the concern that we are debating this legislation not knowing where we stand in regard to the European Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the end of October the <i>Official Journal of the European Communities</i> set out seven conditions it wished to impose on the £175 million being provided for Aer Lingus.  The Minister stated that a response was given to that.  Nevertheless, we are entitled to know the up-to-date position with regard to the Commission. What type of conditions does the Commission intend to put on the £175 million being provided for Aer Lingus?  We are being asked to pass legislation which, on the face of it, is about giving £175 million to Aer Lingus, but on the basis of the recovery plan for the company announced last June.  If the conditions indicated in the EC journal more than <Col N="721" /> one month ago were applied, the basis on which the money is being provided would be changed significantly.  We are entitled to know the current state of play from the European Commission.  I presume the Minister has a more up-to-date picture than the public and he should inform the House of that picture so that we know exactly what we are being asked to legislate for.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I agree with Deputy Gilmore and ask the Minister to come clean with us in regard to the conditions imposed by the European Commission.  The injection of equity, the cost cutting programme and the rescue plan for Aer Lingus are interdependent and if conditions attach which dismantle the rescue plan before the equity can be put in, this will not be a fruitful exercise. In the course of passing this legislation we should be given all the information the Minister has in respect of the conditions which might apply.  As is the case with all legislation passed in this House, we were briefed from various sources.  I have been informed that a firm of English solicitors, Soames and Company &mdash; a distinguished son of a distinguished political father &mdash; took up the cause of British Midland with the Commission.  One of the most expensive, extensive and competent lobbying efforts ever conducted on behalf of a private company is being conducted by those solicitors in Brussels on behalf of British Midland and it is rumoured that they are having an element of success. It has been stated also that our former colleague and ex-Commissioner, Ray MacSharry, is doing an excellent job in Brussels on behalf of Ryanair and is pinning down the Aer Lingus lobby and succeeding in getting conditions attached which will restrict the activities of Aer Lingus, particularly Aer Lingus Express.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those rumours are circulating openly and range in status from high class rumour to actual briefing.  This is the key section in the legislation.  The Minister wants the Dáil to sanction the injection into Aer Lingus of £175 million in equity. That will be Irish taxpayers' money, it will not come from Europe.  What will <Col N="722" /> come from Europe is the permission to do so, with attaching conditions.  The Minister has an obligation to bring us up to date in regard to the conditions.  There is not much merit in Deputies debating something with only half the information and perhaps discovering during the Christmas recess that the plan is off the rails because of the stringency of the conditions applied by the Commission.</P>

      <P>In relation to amendment No. 4 there was never any question of the Commission querying the amount of money to be made available, rather it was a question of whether restrictions should be imposed or regulations implemented.  The sum of £175 million is a tiny amount in relative terms.  The procedure adopted by Air France and some of the other airlines was to provide the money in advance and await the response of the Commission.  Deputy O'Malley is arguing that we should await the decision of the Commission and then consider the matter.  The sum of £75 million <Col N="723" /> is the critical element of this package and if it is not possible to inject this sum into Aer Lingus it will be unable to carry on.  Therefore the question we should address is what steps should be taken to ensure the development of the company in the future.</P>
      <P>It is normal procedure for a private shareholder to inject equity into a company from time to time.  There are few companies which have not received State funding from time to time.  Why should we cavil therefore when a State company receives State funding, especially when we consider that Aer Lingus has received little by way of funding?  It has not swallowed up a large amount of taxpayers' money.  It is an extremely efficient company which has provided an enormous number of jobs, expanded into international markets, competed with much larger airlines and secured some prized developments in other countries.  In this legislation and in the programme agreed with the trade unions and the staff we are giving it the kiss of life.</P>
      <P>It should be borne in mind that we are an island State on the periphery of Europe without direct links to the central markets.  Structural Funds have been and will be provided to lessen the impact. Because it is critical we have access to these markets we have all the more reason to argue that restrictions should not be imposed on Aer Lingus.  We have to travel either by sea or air, otherwise we cannot get off the island.  We do not have a channel tunnel.  We should adopt a positive approach and make no excuses when we say that we are prepared to make money available to ensure Aer Lingus remains viable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned about statements that I have read that both British Midland and Ryanair are lobbying the Commission to ensure restrictions are imposed.  There was no talk of restrictions until Aer Lingus applied for permission for the equity injection of £175 million.  All previous proposals were agreed to without so much as a murmur, even though billions of pounds were involved.  All of a sudden objection have been raised with <Col N="724" /> the European commission which has been requested to impose restrictions and introduce regulations.  The purpose of lobbying the Commission is to ensure that Aer Lingus Express will not be able to operate on lucrative London-Dublin routes.  Private companies do not want Aer Lingus competing on that route.  The sum of £175 million is the key element of the entire package and it must be injected with the minimum number of restrictions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed at a time when the European Commission is considering the case put forward by the Government that we are having this debate in Dáil Éireann.  If other Governments in Europe made a submission to ensure the survival of the state airline I doubt that amendments would be tabled to a Bill required to guarantee its survival to ensure restrictions would be imposed.</P>
      <P>Earlier Deputy O'Malley made a solid case in favour of the privatisation of Aer Lingus in perhaps ten years time.  He also made the point that no one would be interested unless this sum was injected and the survival plan was successful.  We are all in agreement that the sum of £175 million is required to ensure the survival of the company.  I question whether it is enough.</P>
      <P>We should compare this with submissions made in the past by our competitors which are much larger and stronger airlines.  The sum of £1.28 billion was injected into Sabena while on separate occasions the French Government injected £400 million and £200 million into Air France and subsequently sought the approval of the Commission.  The larger countries support, and are seen to support, their airlines and here we have a suggestion pointing to restrictions.  I am very disappointed but, perhaps, I should not be surprised given the line put forward by Deputy O'Malley and his party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>British Midland is using Aer Lingus.  It is not that Aer Lingus is a threat to any airline.  Does any Member think that Aer Lingus is a threat to Air France or British Midland?  It is not, but British Midland is using their political clout in the EU to <Col N="725" /> set precedents in relation to Aer Lingus in order to get at Air France.  That is the scenario that is described and we must be very careful about that.  If we are to get the go-ahead from Europe we should not be talking about restrictions.  In the context of the EU there should be a level playing field.  My constituency colleagues tend to use that kind of phrase but it is relevant.</P>

I have no doubt that when the money is provided the Commission will ensure that there will be no unfair competition. For years we have been seeking an opportunity to compete.  The Minister should go to Brussels and, perhaps entice the Taoiseach to go with him.  I know he has been to Brussels twice or three times in the past fortnight.  However, before the decision is made he should go to Brussels and make the strongest possible case to show the Commissioners that the Government is serious.  We should be going to Brussels and supporting the case on behalf of Aer Lingus with a united voice.  If one is to judge by these amendments we do not seem to have that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is the central feature of this Bill.  I congratulate the Minister on bringing forward this Bill and securing Government approval for the injection of £175 million into this company. Let no one think that this £175 million represents an act of charity or a hand-out.  This is an investment by the owner of a particularly profitable company that has gone through difficult times in the past two or three years.  This was a profitable company that served this country well.  It provided good employment. The workers paid for that employment with their loyalty to the company and to the State.  The employees, and their families, have made major sacrifices in the past 12 to 18 months.  They had great concern in relation to their future and that of their families.  Almost 1,000 <Col N="726" /> of them have taken voluntary redundancy and there is also the situation in regard to TEAM.</P>
      <P>The workers in Aer Lingus have gone through a difficult period and the company needs an injection of equity.  The sum of £175 million which has been put forward by the Government is not a small amount.  Only time will tell whether it is adequate.  I hope it will be.  What we do not want at a time when this is being debated and examined by the European Commission is division in the House on the entitlement of this company to an injection of equity.</P>
      <P>It is vitally important that we have a national carrier.  With the opening of the Channel Tunnel we will be the only island state left in Europe.  Therefore, it is vital that we have secure air routes and connections. That can be achieved only if we have our own airline.  Like all businesses an injection of funds is required from the shareholders every now and then.  In this case the shareholder is the State and we should not send cross-signals from this House that could damage our national interest.  The maintenance of a strong and commercially viable Aer Lingus is in the national interest.</P>
      <P>The workers in Aer Lingus have shown their loyalty.  They have taken difficult decisions, some of them never to work again, by accepting voluntary redundancy when they are in their fifties.  Those who remained have taken major decisions by adopting changes in work practices, overtime etc.  They voted massively to accept these cutbacks because of their commitment to their company.  We should not, for party-political purposes or some ideological reason, send out cross-signals from this House which could be used by the Commission to impose further conditions.  In the October statement the Commission suggested conditions which were not imposed on Sabena Airlines and others when they got injections of equity from their Governments.  I am afraid that we as a small country are being made an example for future cases such as that of Air France.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a very dedicated Minister and <Col N="727" /> I know he will fight off these attempts by the Commission.  The £175 million is not charity or a hand-out.  The Government is not the St. Vincent de Paul Society helping an unworthy company.  This is an injection of equity.  In the case of private companies Governments encourage further equity injections to allow the business to be maintained and expanded.  I hope the Minister will take the opportunity when responding to the amendments, to announce that the Government will not be barred from injecting further equity into the company if it is necessary, although I hope it will not be necessary. Shareholders would be allowed invest in a private company and what is wrong with the State investing in its own organisation. I am not asking for a blank cheque.</P>
    <P>However, the workers have taken on board the company's difficulties, redundancies and changes in work practices. The State has enjoyed the benefits of that airline for many years in respect of taxes and PRSI contributions paid by its employees.  The Minister and the Government have worked to ensure its future will be secure but I would like the Minister to give an assurance that he will fight again for that company if necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of issues have been raised and I will respond to them as fully as I can and explain the context in which the issues raised under the amendments should be considered.</P>
      <P>I am not prepared to accept Deputy O'Malley's amendments because, as the Deputy knows, we are subject to the Treaty of Rome.  The consent of the European Commission is required in cases of State aid.  As members of the European Union we are bound by that treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore questioned why we should be subject to those disciplines. The Deputy is entitled to his personal opinion, but the Treaty of Rome supersedes our national law.  The supremacy of European law over national law is a fundamental legal principle in European Union law, otherwise there would not be <Col N="728" /> uniform application of EU law.  When we acceded to the Community on 1 January 1973 we incorporated the principle enshrined in Article 27 (4) of the treaty into our Constitution and a blanket amendment to our Constitution was agreed by the majority of our people in a referendum.  While people may prefer the position to be otherwise, the treaty provisions are legal and binding on us and supersede any national considerations.</P>
    <P>Article 92 (3) (c) of the Treaty of Rome relates to competition policy.  The treaty provides that, save as otherwise provided in the treaty, any aid granted by a member state or through State resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods shall, in so far as it affects trade between member states, be incompatible with the Common Market.  Article 92 (3) (c) states that aid to facilitate the development of certain economic activities or of certain economic areas where such aid does not adversely affect trading conditions to an extent contrary to the common interest shall be compatible with the Common Market.  The Commission in considering our State aid application for the provision of £175 million equity injection into Aer Lingus will consider that article and home in on that subsection.</P>
    <P>From 1 January 1993, the Commission has a competence in this area in terms of the establishment of a Single Market in the air transport sector.  It is somewhat unfortunate that our State aid application is the first to be considered in this area.  I have been asked to indicate the State of play in regard to this issue.  It would be unusual for the Commission not to insist on some conditionality so as to ensure compliance with Article 92 (3) (c) of the Treaty of Rome.  I am confident that the Commission's decision will not affect the integrity of the plan or stop Aer Lingus doing what it sets out to do during the term of the &ldquo;Strategy for the Future&rdquo;. That is the fundamental substantive issue.  The Commission has an agenda and a reason for imposing conditionality in respect of State aid applications.  There <Col N="729" /> are other applications in the pipeline. We must ensure that the conditionality is such that substantively Aer Lingus's commercial freedom as envisaged under the plan is not in any way hindered or obstructed.  I am confident as a result of many meetings between my Department and the Commission at official, ministerial and commissioner level that we will succeed.</P>
    <P>Third parties who are interested in this area, our commercial competitors, have made representations for their respective cases and they are entitled to do so.  On 28 October the Commission opened up the procedure by inviting interested parties to make their case in relation to State aid applications.  That is a reasonable measure and is the reality of competition. We have always believed that the strategy agreed by Government is one which has the requisite level of transparency and commerciality which will ensure that a State aid application will be successful.  We are not interested in applying State aid for the purpose of wiping out competitors.  The purpose is to redress a serious imbalance in the balance sheet to make sure that the further viability of that company can be assured.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore referred to what he termed the seven conditions.  They are not conditions but queries which have been raised in relation to specific areas of the &ldquo;Strategy for the Future&rdquo;.  We have responded comprehensively.  The Deputy can be assured that I discussed those issues with the CRC in Aer Lingus who were happy with the responses we were in a position to give in relation to those seven areas outlined by the Commission. At all stages there has been a comprehensive approach by the Government as shareholder to ensure that the £175 million State aid application is agreed by the Commission within the parameters I have outlined.  It would be unrealistic to expect no conditionality but we will ensure that the integrity of the plan is maintained.  That is our fundamental requirement.</P>
    <P>It has been claimed that there was no conditionality in relation to previous State aid applications, but that is not the <Col N="730" /> case.  I refer to my Second Stage speech and my response to contributions on Second Stage which outlined, albeit it cursorily, the conditionality that applies to Sabena and Iberia.  That conditionality applies in respect of applications submitted prior to 1 January 1993 before the Single Market and the full competence of the Commission was established in relation to the air transport area.  Further details can be supplied to Deputies on request in relation to that level of conditionality. I am satisfied that as a result of much negotiation, lobbying and discussion by my officials and me at the highest level in the Commission we will succeed in ensuring that whatever conditionality applies will not in any way impede the consolidation and expansion envisaged within the three years when the State aid is invested in the company.</P>
    <P>For that reason and because of the legal supremacy of the Treaty, the amendments proposed by Deputy O'Malley are superfluous.  That position is catered for under the treaty provisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to the conditions that might be imposed by the Commission.  Deputy Ryan seemed to suggest that I am almost encouraging it to do that and that, by tabling this amendment, I am trying, of my own volition, to create conditions, but that is not the case. Will one of the conditions that might be imposed as a result of the various representations being made quite lawfully by private companies, particularly one Irish and one British company, be that Aer Lingus could not establish one of the subsidiaries mentioned or could establish it only subject to strict conditions in regard to competition?  Is the Minister and Aer Lingus prepared to accept that, or will it cause a rethink of the whole position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not require the Commission to ensure that I have respect for taxpayers' money.  As I said on Second Stage, Aer Lingus Express will be a stand-alone subsidiary company based on full commercial principles.  As outlined in Strategy for the Future, which has been <Col N="731" /> adopted by the Government, it must be a low cost airline.  The comprehensive business plan will have to be submitted to me as a prerequisite to the setting up of that company to ensure that Aer Lingus Express does not become a drain on other subsidiary companies in the group.  It is important that Aer Lingus ekes out every niche of the market, including low cost, low fare operations.  I do not require the Commission to impose a condition to ensure that that happens because clearly it is in our interests to ensure, as shareholders, that the venture is a successful one based on full commercial criteria.  Management and unions are discussing this issue &mdash; I wish them well in their deliberations &mdash; and everybody will know precisely what will be required to get the company off the ground.</P>
      <P>Deputies opposite have said that it is wrong to bring forward this Bill before Commission approval is granted.  It is urgent that the first tranche of State equity be injected into this company at the earliest possible opportunity.  As soon as EU approval is given to this State aid application &mdash; I am confident approval will be given &mdash; we must be in a position to immediately arrange for the injection of the £175 million into the company. This is simply a facilitating Bill in that regard and we should not have to await approval of the Commission before passing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy O'Malley said, what we are doing is increasing the authorised share capital of the company by £175 million. Therefore, if in the very unlikely event that the State aid application is not approved the position in regard to Aer Lingus will not be changed.  It is important that we pass this Bill in the coming weeks so that when the application is approved we will be in a position to inject into Aer Lingus the first tranche of equity.  I am confident that whatever condition is attached to such application &mdash; given the level of equity envisaged some condition will be imposed by the Commission &mdash; it will in no way upset the <Col N="732" /> arrangements and plans of Aer Lingus management and unions for the next three years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to two contributions from the Minister since we asked about the up-to-date position in relation to the conditions that might be imposed by the Commission on this investment in Aer Lingus, I am none the wiser as to where the Commission stands on this matter.  We have been aware of the Aer Lingus plan since last June and the Minister stated last night that it was made known formally to the Commission last July.  I find it extraordinary that in mid-December when we are putting through the House a Bill to provide equity for the company the Minister apparently is not in a position, or is unwilling to tell us what exactly is the Commission's definitive position on the conditions that may be attached to this application.</P>
      <P>Did the Minister inform the Commission that this legislation would go through the Oireachtas this week and did he seek from the Commission a decision so that we would all know where we stand on this matter?  It is well known that British Midland and Ryanair have been camped in Brussels since the Aer Lingus plan became known, lobbying for conditions to be attached to the Commission's approval.  It is also known that the Ryanair effort was led by the current chairman of Ryanair, former Deputy Ray MacSharry, a man who well knows his way around Brussels.  It is generally believed that the Commission intends to impose conditions on the Aer Lingus investment which will have the effect of restricting Aer Lingus' operations on the UK routes, which are of interest to British Midland and Ryanair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Query No. 5, as the Minister called it, in the Commission's communication of 28 October pointed out that the Commission needs to be assured that the aid to Aer Lingus does not have unacceptable competitive effects on certain routes where traffic level is very high and competition is intense, such as London-Dublin routes.  I understand that to mean <Col N="733" /> that British Midland and Ryanair are succeeding in persuading the Commission to impose a condition on the State investment in Aer Lingus which will have the effect of Aer Lingus Express, the company to be established to trade in a competitive way on the UK routes, not being established or being established in such a way that it cannot compete effectively with British Midland and Ryanair.</P>
    <P>Instead of the Minister and the Government being prepared to defend that position, what they are doing is standing back from it and putting legislation through the House so that in a couple of weeks time when the bad news comes from the Commission the Minister will be able to wash his hands of it and say it was the Commission who imposed this condition, that it has nothing to do with him.  It is incredible that the Minister does not know what conditions the Commission intends to impose on this investment. It is also incredible that he has not taken the precaution of extracting from the Commission a decision in this regard before introducing legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>This State aid application has been made to the European Commission quicker than any other application. If the Deputy checks the records he will see that certain procedures have to be adopted by the Commission to ensure that a full range of interests are given the opportunity to put forward their views on the matter.  I reject the suggestion that this decision should have been given sooner.  It will be made faster than any other decision in relation to a State aid application.  If the Deputy was <i>au fait</i> with the procedures he would know that. I know the Deputy likes using emotive language &mdash; it is okay to have a diversity of opinions on these issues; people have legitimate interests &mdash; but I totally refute any insinuation in his Marxist remarks about democracy that in some way people are camped, itinerant-like, outside the front door of the Berlaymont Building watching Mr. Matutes going in every morning&mdash;&mdash;</P>

No one can suggest that the Department of the Government, through the Department, have been remiss in their responsibilities in ensuring that the Commission has received the full information requested by it on numerous occasions, in answering further queries, in having further meetings and discussions and making further representations.  Nobody has been in Brussels more often than we have been there, the simple reason being that we are very interested in ensuring this application is accepted.</P>
      <P>If Deputy Gilmore is putting himself up as the only prospective saviour of Aer Lingus, as the only person interested in the State aid application, I should like to tell him that the evidence does not suggest that this is the case.  Nobody involved in this issue &mdash; the trade union movement or management &mdash; will tell him that the Government was remiss in any way in dealing with this issue.  The initial seven queries raised at the beginning of the procedure were comprehensively addressed and the proposals put forward were understood and agreed by the CRC and others who had an interest in this matter. When further information is required from Aer Lingus it is channelled through to the Department which passes it on to the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy's contribution was full of assertions without anything to substantiate them.  All the experience suggests otherwise than was stated by the Deputy.  If the Deputy has any State aid application in his file which has been dealt with quicker I should like to have it.  I would be very amused if the Deputy had such a file as I do not believe it exists. The Commission will deal with this issue on 22 December.  This issue can be dealt with only by the Commission.  With all <Col N="735" /> due respect, it is not possible for me to find out the likely decision on 22 December because Deputy Gilmore asks me a question on 15 December.  Maybe this is possible in &ldquo;Socialist International&rdquo; but it is not possible in terms of member states&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Second, on the basis of the information available to him within his Department, can the Minister say if there is merit in the Ryanair and British Midland case which charges that Aer Lingus was involved in uncompetitive practices in the past and continues to act uncompetitively on certain routes and whether conditions will be attached to the Commission decision to correct that?  Does he think that the condition will simply be a general condition arising from the application of the general article of the Treaty of Rome or does he envisage specific conditions being attached to the investment of £175 million in equity?</P>

With regard to whether the fares policy pursued by Aer Lingus in the past was anti-competitive, it certainly was not commercially smart &mdash; the company lost a lot of money.  As I said, I am not going to get involved in the apportionment of blame game, but I can assure the Deputy that from now on strictly commercial criteria will apply in all aspects of the company's operations, including its fares policy.  The company will pitch its fares against the competition they should be directed at rather than pursuing a fares policy which, on the one hand, seeks to provide a low cost airline fare and, on the other, provides a cost base which is more in line with a better quality product.</P>

      <P>I welcome the points made by the Minister about the transparency of the accounts and operations of the proposed company, Aer Lingus Express, and the fact that Aer Lingus will not be able to engage in certain practices in the future.  If it is not going to be allowed to act in this way in the future can the Minister arrange for the company not to act in this way at present?  At present it is possible to fly from Dublin to London, where there is competition, at a cost of approximately £60 while the minimum cost of flying from Dublin to Bristol, where there is no competition and where the distance is much shorter, is between £175 and £250.  The same is repeated in respect of flights to all destinations throughout Britain.  The fares are extremely low where there is competition from either Ryanair or British Midland or both but they are extremely high where there is no competition. Would the Minister agree with me that that is entirely unsatisfactory, that it is unfair to the consumers, it is unfair to the competitors and if the Minister is to put a stop to that in the future, after the Commission have agreed to this proposal, <Col N="739" /> why in principle would he not put a stop to it now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of Deputy O'Malley's views in relation to these matters.  I am satisfied that Aer Lingus is acting in a way which is in its own commercial interests.  It is a national airline, it covers many routes.  It is not a regional airline and it obviously has a fares policy to meet its full range of products. One can identify specific issues which I would have to examine but the Deputy can be assured that under the new management team, and the direction the board is receiving from the shareholder, commercial principles will be primary in terms of how it conducts its business.  I believe the decision that has been made, which takes £50 million out of the cost base of the company, allows it to provide fares which may be similar to those in the past but which now, because the cost base has been much reduced, remain competitive.  The Deputy may not be comparing like with like when he compares present fares policies with previous ones because the cost base factor has been seriously addressed.  I would have to take up issues of a specific nature with the management directly and come back to the Deputy in due course.</P>

No. 2 states that the second and third tranches of the investment would be subject to the company achieving well specified and quantified targets.

Is the Minister satisfied, from what <Col N="740" /> he knows about the agreements that have been made, that those targets will be met and is he confident that when the legislation is passed, Aer Lingus, on the basis of the agreements that have been made to date, will receive the full £175 million?</P>

    <Title>Joint Declaration on Peace in Northern Ireland: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Today, we pray, will be an historic day for peace in Ireland. This morning, the British Prime Minister John Major and I, at our third meeting this month, made a joint declaration which creates a framework for the beginning of a peace process.  This, we hope, will be the fist step on the road to a just and lasting peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Joint Declaration, which I am laying before the House, contains a central message for people of every political outlook in Northern Ireland, Republican <Col N="741" /> and Loyalist, Unionist and Nationalist. That is, that their ideals for the future and their interests in the present can be pursued and protected much more effectively through the democratic process, and need not resort to violent threat or coercion.</P>
    <P>My guiding principle has been that we should not seek to prejudice or predetermine the shape of a final political settlement.  Finding a political solution is a matter for all-round negotiations between the Governments and the democratic political parties in Northern Ireland, the prospects for which would be transformed by peace.  The Declaration preserves a careful balance between the rights, identities and aspirations of the two political traditions on this island.  I consulted very widely in both communities in order that this might be achieved.  It would be my hope that people of every political outlook would be able to identify with the Declaration and with its overall thrust.</P>
    <P>This is an unusual declaration between Governments.  It does not just reflect the views and interests of the two Governments or provide some compromise between them.  Instead, it seeks to comprehend the deeply held positions of all who find themselves caught up in the narrow ground of a conflict with ancient roots within a part of this island.  It makes clear that the British Government is in no sense an enemy to the rights of the Nationalist tradition, and the Irish Government is in no sense an enemy to the rights of the Unionist tradition.</P>
    <P>The overriding objective, the overriding criterion for the language of this Declaration is whether each statement in it makes a contribution to peace, and whether it adequately reflects deeply held fears and essential interests.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that nobody should be afraid of peace.  The purpose of this Joint Declaration is to help remove conflicts of interest, and fundamental differences in the sense of identity out of the arena of violence, and to place them purely in the political and democratic arena.  There are many on different sides, who feel that up until now the framework has been loaded <Col N="742" /> against them, undermining, as they see it, the normal rules of democracy.  The Declaration in my views helps to create a level political playing field, which no longer leaves any excuse for violence. The road is open, on the one hand, to a united Ireland, if it can be achieved by agreement and consent.  But equally, it is clearly reaffirmed that there will be no change in the constitutional status of Northern Ireland without such agreement. It is the essence, indeed the unique virtue of the democratic system, that it allows peaceful competition between conflicting ideals and provides a civilised method of settling conflicts and disputes.</P>
    <P>The purpose of a framework for peace would be to advance general principles accepted by the two Governments, which guarantee to all the right to pursue their aims by democratic means and to have the results of the democratic process put into effect.  The Declaration does not replace or affect the validity of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, nor is it a substitute for a more comprehensive agreement which might transcend it.</P>
    <P>There was never a better opportunity for everyone to bring the troubles and appalling violence of the past 25 years to an end.  That violence has created intense human misery.  It has wrecked lives and caused wanton destruction.  It has divided communities.  It has cast a pall of shame over the whole island.  It has held back the whole country in terms of economic opportunity, especially tourism, trade and investment.  The conflict has also been senseless.  No one engaging in violence has been able to further their political aims to any worthwhile degree. Both sets of paramilitaries have directly or indirectly inflicted, no doubt unintentionally, considerable damage on their own communities as well as on others.</P>
    <P>Everyone wants peace.  Peace has been the paramount consideration for me.  A political settlement, which will involve difficult negotiations, will come much more easily in conditions of peace.  What Ireland needs now above all else is peace. We all appreciate that the political differences in Northern Ireland run very <Col N="743" /> deep.  Every attempt over the past 20 years to construct a political settlement has failed.  There have been many ambitious efforts, the most imaginative being Sunningdale and the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  But none of them succeeded in their central objective of creating conditions for peace.</P>
    <P>Continuing violence has made the ongoing search for a political settlement difficult, and would probably work to try to frustrate the effect of any poitical agreement that was reached.  Can we not agree, as a first step, a framework for peace where all could recognise their basic concerns were reflected, and which all could properly and honourably avail of, without prejudice to their principles, in the necessary task of negotiating our future?</P>
    <P>I was not prepared through inaction to condemn the people of Northern Ireland to another 25 years of violence.  They deserve better.  I am convinced that peace cannot and need not wait upon the uphill task of trying to find a comprehensive political settlement in the midst of all the violence, unless there is no other path available.  What is necessary is to convince those engaged in violence that there is no point to that violence, and that their basic political objectives can be more effectively pursued exclusively by democratic political means, whether they are republican or loyalist.</P>
    <P>There has also been a policy of placing in political ghettos and marginalising, not only the people directly engaged in violence, but very often the communities from which they spring.  That too has failed.  Belatedly, we have had to try to reach out to the marginalised and the alienated, and to try to comprehend the motives of those whose acts have filled us all with abhorrence.  It has involved on the part of the two Governments, and many of the Northern political and church and community leaders, the taking of risks, and acts of courage. Those involved in the paramilitary groups and those responsible for leading them will also show the greatest courage, <Col N="744" /> if they now seize the new opportunity for peace.</P>
    <P>There are two sets of paramilitaries engaged in violence, both republican and loyalist.  The loyalist paramilitaries claim that their violence is reactive.  I am informed on reliable authority that their violence would cease after a cessation of republican violence.  It would seem to me that if a cessation of republican violence could be procured, in a manner that does not in any way prejudice the democratic rights of the Unionist population, then a cessation of violence should follow.  In this regard, I deplore the tendency on the part of some politicians to exploit the threat of a loyalist backlash, in a way that is often, I am informed, disapproved of by the same loyalist paramilitaries.</P>
    <P>This country has up until now never enjoyed a sustained period of peace.  The two traditions, while they agreed to differ at the time of the first Anglo-Irish settlement in 1920 and 1921, have never yet reached in four centuries a mutual accommodation on how they are to share this island peacefully in harmony and co-operation. The ideals of Wolfe Tone and the United Irishmen were unfortunately quickly frustrated at the time, though they may yet come to inspire us more in the future.</P>
    <P>Creating a satisfactory mutual accommodation is our task over the coming generation, to which all of us must apply ourselves, if we are to create a far better future on this island for all our people, especially the young.  We need to create a new political framework, built on respect of difference and a desire to engage in fruitful partnership and co-operation.</P>
    <P>At my first press conference on being elected leader of Fianna Fáil in February 1992, which was in the aftermath of particular atrocities, I declared the achievement of peace in Northern Ireland to be my foremost priority.  As I have recounted elsewhere, at my first meeting with Prime Minister John Major shortly afterwards, we agreed that we would make a real effort to bring peace to Northern Ireland, and to spare the people another 25 years of bloodshed and <Col N="745" /> conflict.  Anyone who goes back over my speeches will note that I, for one, spoke from the very beginning of the importance of finding a formula for peace.  I have also had a passionate desire to try to bring about peace.</P>
    <P>The leader of the SDLP, John Hume, ably supported by his deputy leader Séamus Mallon, and other members of his party, have throughout played a crucial role in the development of this process. I would like to pay tribute to John Hume's tremendous courage over the years, not merely as a persistent advocate of peace and purely democratic methods, but as somebody who has been prepared, especially in recent years, to take enormous personal risks in the pursuit of peace.  More than any other political leader over the past 20 years, his has been the voice of sanity in Northern Ireland. He rightly enjoys respect throughout the world for him immense contribution. Despite his unremitting opposition to paramilitary violence, accepted by all, I believe, he enjoys the thrust and respect of the entire Nationalist community, for having been willing to come to grips with their most deep-seated problems, recognising this as the price which has to be paid for leading that community, as a whole, away from violence.</P>
    <P>Having explained the backgrounds to our proposals, I now want to explain the proposals themselves for the benefit of the House.  They take the form of a Joint Declaration by the Irish and British Governments.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 1 is a statement of the problem and the need for the development of an agreed framework for peace, based on a number of key principles enunciated by the two Governments over the past 20 years.  Paragraph 2 speaks of the inestimable value of healing divisions and ending conflict.  It states as their aim the fostering of agreement and reconciliation, leading to a new political framework. Paragraph 3 is a brief reference to the importance of the European dimension.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 4 is a key one.  It states that the British Government will uphold the democratic wish of a greater number of <Col N="746" /> people of Northern Ireland, whether they prefer to support the Union or a sovereign united Ireland.  This is followed by a reiteration by the British Prime Minister that the British Government has no selfish, strategic or economic interest in Northern Ireland, which is one of the foundation stones of this whole declaration. The British Government also says it will encourage, facilitate and enable the reaching of agreement among the people of this island.  They accept that such agreement may, as of right, take the form of agreed structures for the island as a whole, including a united Ireland achieved by peaceful means.  The principle of self determination to be exercised by the people of Ireland alone is accepted on the basis of consent, freely and concurrently given, North and South.  Any agreement arising between the people of Ireland, whether on a united Ireland on any other basis, will be legislated for.  By way of comment, I would like to say it is not new for national self-determination to be expressed by different parts of a country concurrently. That indeed is the way the states of East Germany were reunited with the Federal Republic.  It would be absolutely normal procedure for any country that has been divided, whether Korea, Cyprus or China.  In paragraph 4, I believe, there is full respect shown for the basic principles of republican philosophy, but in a manner that is consistent with safeguarding the democratic rights of Unionists.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 5 is a statement by me that stability and wellbeing cannot be obtained under any political system which is refused allegiance or rejected by a significant minority.  I believe there are very few in this State who at this stage want to coerce the people of Northern Ireland into a United Ireland against their wishes.  We have no interest in creating by force a united but unstable Ireland. We have no ambitions to take over the territory of Northern Ireland, but ignoring its people.  Unless and until we can persuade a majority of the people of Northern Ireland to join with us, there will not be a united Ireland.  The Unionist <Col N="747" /> population should welcome the unequivocal acceptance of the principle of consent in several places in the declaration.</P>
    <P>Paragraphs 6 to 8 reflect my desire to respond to Unionists' fears.  They include a willingness to accept and examine representations by them across the negotiating table with regard to any aspects of life in the South, which they believe to be discriminatory or which threaten their way of life.  In the Declaration I also ask them to look on the people of the Republic as friends, who share their grief and shame over the suffering of the last quarter of a century, and who want to develop the best possible relationship with them, in which trust and new understanding can flourish and grow.  In it I also pledge to consider how the hopes and identities of all in relation to constitutional matters can be expressed in more balanced ways, which no longer cause division.  I have stated that the Irish Government will, as part of a balanced constitutional accommodation, put forward and support proposals for change in the Irish Constitution, which would fully reflect the principle of consent in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 9 reflects a commitment by both Governments to create institutions and structures to enable the people of Ireland to work together in all areas of common interest.</P>
    <P>Paragraphs 10 and 11 address the problem of admitting democratically mandated parties to the political process as soon as possible after a cessation of violence.  They contain a commitment by me to establish in consultation with other parties a Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, after a real cessation of violence. This will probably quickly guarantee a place in the political process, without prejudice to a participation in wider talks.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the Declaration respects or is consistent with every basic principle and obligation enunciated by the two Governments.  It honours equally the Republican position and the Unionist position, and does not seek to predetermine <Col N="748" /> what position will prevail in the future.  In the spirit of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, it keeps open the option of an evolution towards a united Ireland and the encouragement of closer North-South co-operation.  In the case of the Irish Government, the Declaration seeks not merely to state the underlying principles of Irish Nationalism but to reach out to Unionists and to understand and respond to their fears.  If the Declaration has flaws or deficiencies or omissions from any point of view, are any of them so vital as to warrant condemning the people of Northern Ireland to the indefinite continuation of violence? I believe, and everyone else in this House I am sure believes too, that the use of political violence today has no justification in any circumstances whatever. The merit of the Joint Declaration is that it convincingly demonstrates this.</P>
    <P>To the Unionist and Protestant people of Northern Ireland, I would say &mdash; we want to end the centuries of conflict forever. We want to take the gun out of Irish politics for good.  We want to develop a new atmosphere of trust and co-operation, to establish a new era of détente, which is the only way forward.  Even if we are not able at present to agree on very much, let us at least establish peace between us once and for all.  I have consulted some of your leaders best placed to interpret to me your fears and your needs.  I have also taken account of some of the positions put to me on behalf of Loyalist organisations, who are as much a factor in the situation as their Republican counterparts, and whom I have been determined not to make the mistake of ignoring.</P>
    <P>The Nationalist community suffered neglect and discrimination for over 50 years.  It is the duty of the Irish Government to ensure that that never happens again.  Even from outside our jurisdiction, Northern Nationalists attach a special value to their membership of the Irish nation, which will never be disowned by us.</P>
    <P>I appeal directly to the Provisional IRA to respond now to the wishes of the Irish nation clearly and emphatically <Col N="749" /> expressed on repeated occasions to stop the killing.  If the self-determination of the Irish people has any meaning or application, it surely applies above all else to the repeated rejection of support for violence at the polls by the large majority of both communities on this island.  Once violence permanently ceases, the political leadership of Sinn Féin can join the rest of the democratic politicians on this island in working for a better and freer future for us all, for true peace with justice. Let us be prepared to bring everyone who has been excluded in from the cold. While we will never accept the terrible deeds for the last 25 years, committed on all sides, let us remember that the blame for them lies in more than one quarter, and that some of it is very deep-rooted in Irish history.  For the first time ever, the right to self-determination of the people of Ireland is acknowledged, subject only to the condition of consent. The British Government have pledged to work for agreement, and will respect the democratic choice of the people of Northern Ireland as to their constitutional status, whether it be future Union or a sovereign united Ireland.  There is no Unionist veto, only the requirement for the consent of a majority.  The task now is to find a political settlement.</P>
    <P>I call on everyone of goodwill both in Ireland and abroad to join now in ensuring that the beginning of peace becomes a reality, before this year is out.  Let us together open a new era in our history. Just as the 1918 election 75 years ago this month involved a new beginning in the development of Irish democracy, let December 1993 be the moment we begin to resolve the conflict in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>If anyone's nerve fails or falters at this point, dark clouds are looming on the horizon.  The danger of renewed and more intense conflict is very real.  The dogs of war are waiting to be unleashed, and the Shankill and Greysteel atrocities could be a foretaste of the future.  A continuation of violence could have very grave consequences for everyone on this island.  The IRA and Sinn Féin should recognise their tremendous responsibility <Col N="750" /> to the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland, in particular, who have suffered so much in the past, and who could stand to suffer more than most both physically and politically, if the wrong decision is made now.</P>
    <P>I have only one vision in relation to Northern Ireland &mdash; that is to accomplish peace with the help of all who can give it.  Here I want to acknowledge the great contribution made over the last 12 months by the Tánaiste towards the same objective.  It was a team effort, and our two offices have worked together extremely closely.  I would like to thank all the Opposition parties, and their leaders, for the degree of patience and understanding they have shown in the national interest over the past few weeks, and for their broad support.  Above all, I also want to thank the many tireless workers for peace in Northern Ireland, the community leaders, the clergymen of all denominations and others, who have done all they can to advance the process, and without whom the undertaking of this initiative would have been made quite impossible.  I am taking steps today to inform foreign Governments and other interested parties of the initiative between the two Governments.</P>
    <P>I have annexed the Joint Declaration to the next of my speech.</P>
    <P>It now falls to others to consider their position and to respond after mature deliberation.  They should be given space by everyone to do so, and helped to reach a positive decision.  The Chief Rabbi wrote to me recently, expressing the hope that we might yet see in our land and between these islands the fulfilment of the vision of the prophet Isaiah &ldquo;that nation shall not lift up sword against nation, they shall learn war no more&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have done everything I can to reach this point, and to give peace the best possible chance.  All I can say in conclusion is this.  No one should be afraid of peace.  Here is the opportunity for peace.  Here let us all make our stand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have supported the Taoiseach in his efforts to find a formula for peace, giving occasional warnings <Col N="751" /> along the way about things that could go wrong.  I believe a very good day's work has been done this morning.  I am very hopeful, indeed confident, that it will achieve the results that are being sought.</P>
      <P>The debate, however, is also important because a number of questions will be raised by those who speak and I hope the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, in his reply, will respond to the questions that have been raised by Members.  We are all part of the process and we wish to play our part constructively &mdash; occasionally we are critical but we offer constructive criticism.  In addition to commending the Ministers who have been involved in this process I commend the officials of both Governments, who have worked very hard over many long days and nights to reach today's Declaration.  I compliment also the courage of John Hume, who in a sense initiated the process.  I know there will be many arguments about where the process started, but very few would take from John Hume a large part of the credit for initiating the process.  Equally, I would like to commend the patience and fortitude of James Molyneaux and John Alderdice, without whom it probably would not have been possible to reach today's agreement.  All three men deserve the appreciation of all Members of this House because they have all played a very big part, together with, of course, the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister and the relevant Ministers in achieving what has been achieved.</P>
      <P>The Joint Declaration is, I hope, the catalyst for all who live on this island to start talking to one another about how we can make this a truly peaceful place in which to live, an island at ease with itself and with its neighbours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even if the terrorist organisations do not accept this unprecedented opportunity to stop their pointless campaign, it is essential that the constitutional parties use the Declaration as a framework for dialogue and get on with the talks process. Urgent talks between constitutional politicians are needed to build a prosperous <Col N="752" /> and harmonious future for all the people of this island and its neighbours. Too many people who should be talking directly to one another are not doing so and are still communicating to one another through intermediaries or through the media.  It is only through face to face discussions that real progress can be made.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister on agreeing this important Declaration.  It reiterates, in a common Declaration, many things they said already; indeed most things that have been said here have been said by either the Taoiseach, the Prime Minister or their predecessors on many previous occasions.  In some respects it is surprising the length of time it took to agree to the formula of words.  But if the time that has been taken leads to a definite, final and irreversible cessation of violence, the time will have been well spent.</P>
    <P>I highlight in particular the declaration by the British Government in the Joint Declaration:</P>
    <P>The British Government agree that it is for the people of the island of Ireland alone, by agreement between the two parts respectively, to exercise their right of self-determination on the basis of consent, freely and concurrently given, North and South, to bring about a united Ireland, if that is their wish.</P>
    <P>In view of this declaration in black and white, there can be no conceivable jusification for any organisation such as the IRA to continue to attempt to coerce by arms the British people into agreeing to something that they have already plainly agreed to in this Declaration.</P>
    <P>I join with the Taoiseach in hoping that over time a meeting of hearts and minds will develop which will bring all the people of Ireland together.  I join with him also when he &ldquo;acknowledges the presence in the Constitution of the Republic of elements that are deeply resented by Northern Unionists&rdquo;.  The Taoiseach confirms that in the event of an overall settlement he would put forward proposals for changes in the Irish Constitution that would further reflect the <Col N="753" /> principle of consent in Northern Ireland. The Taoiseach says he would do that in the event of an overall settlement, having acknowledged, however, there are elements of the Constitution that are deeply resented by Northern Unionists.</P>
    <P>The all encompassing concept of an overall settlement needs closer analysis. It may be possible to agree on answers to 90 per cent of the problem and still disagree on the remaining 10 per cent.  I hope that we will not defer action on the 90 per cent that is agreed simply because we fail to agree on the remaining 10 per cent.  I hope that the formula that everything has to be agreed will not be used as an excuse to defer all action on constitutional reforms which the Taoiseach acknowledges as necessary in his own Declaration.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned at the lack of any clear timetables or specified mechanisms for the resumption of serious political talks between constitutional politicians or soon to be constitutional politicians.  I hope the resumption of talks will not be deferred for very long and indeed that the great progress that was made in the talks that ended in October 1992 will not be forgotten or, worse still, rendered obsolete because of changed personnel in the parties concerned or changes in the political landscape.  We cannot afford to allow the tremendous number of concessions that were made in those talks to be simply set aside or forgotten.  We should ensure that that deposit in the bank is not allowed to fritter away but rather that when we come to reopen our account that interest has been added.</P>
    <P>The talks need to be resumed quickly so that the progress that has been made is not lost.  Building a settlement, be it for an overall settlement or a 90 per cent settlement, will require endless hours of talking, arguing, drafting and consulting. There is a measure of confusion in the Declaration as to where all this work is to take place.  The term &ldquo;dialogue&rdquo;, appears several times in the Declaration, but there is no specified place in which this dialogue is to occur.  Will it be a resumption of the three strand process, the so-called Brooke-Mayhew process, <Col N="754" /> or will it be in the new body proposed by the Taoiseach in paragraph 11 of the Declaration &mdash; a forum for peace and reconciliation to be set up unilaterally by the Irish Government?</P>
    <P>It is very important that we do not have two competing institutions trying to solve the same problem, creating endless misunderstandings and misinterpretations between them and giving rise to conflicting timetables, which would be the least of the difficulties caused.  Institutional rivalry would develop.  Anybody who disbelieves that need only look at the Council of Europe and the European Community, two bodies which have an institutional rivalry between their respective sets of civil servants.  I hope the Tánaiste will clarify where these talks will take place.  We should aim to have just one body accepted and attended by everybody who uses peaceful methods through which all the problems can be talked out.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach wants to go ahead with his proposed forum, about which I have some doubts, I would advise him to negotiate privately and in advance with all the intended participants in the forum on its terms of reference and purpose. The Taoiseach should not act unilaterally in the first instance and he should ensure that, as a declared purpose of the forum in paragraph 11 is &ldquo;agreement and trust between both traditions in Ireland&rdquo;, both traditions are represented in the forum because otherwise it is doubtful that it can achieve its objective in a way that would be accepted by the people concerned. It is not just the words on paper that are important in getting an agreement, it is whether or not the people concerned or affected feel that they have a part in writing those words.  That is perhaps more important than the words. Any forum that by intention, omission or by sheer accident excludes a relevant party will not promote the trust needed, because no matter how good the declarations emanating from that body, the excluded party will not feel that they had a part in formulating those declarations.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that the permanency of <Col N="755" /> the cessation of violence which we hope will come soon must be verifiable.  It is reasonable to ask the arms which are hidden by both loyalist and provisional terror organisations be either handed up or visibly destroyed.  People who retain access to caches of arms with the possibility, however slight, of taking them up again can hardly be considered to be normal participants in political dialogue. It is not unreasonable to wish to verify, to use President Gorbachev's term, the intentions of formerly violent organisations. One has only to read the message that the Provisionals sent to the British Government after the Warrington bomb to see how wide the gap can often be between words and deeds.  Shortly after the Warrington bomb the Provisional IRA sent the following message to the British Government.</P>
    <P>It is with total sadness that we have to accept responsibility for the recent action.  The last thing we needed at this sensitive time was what has happened.</P>
    <P>It is the fate of history that we find ourselves in this position, all we can think of at this time is an old Irish proverb: God's hand works in mysterious ways.  Our hope is that this hand will lead to peace and friendship.</P>
    <P>Those were the words of the Provisional IRA, yet these fine words were followed by the Shankill bomb, by further murders of British soldiers and by murders of RUC members.</P>
    <P>A Provisional-Sinn Féin renunciation of violence requires a reversal of an Ard Fheis resolution of that party which commits all Sinn Féin candidates to support the arms struggle.  I hope, as I know the Taoiseach does along with every other Member of this House, that that Ard Fheis will pass a resolution reversing that present binding resolution on all Sinn Féin public representatives within a matter of weeks.</P>
    <P>Today's declaration between the Prime Ministers builds on the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  It reiterates its principles. Indeed, the trust between two Governments and between two Prime Ministers <Col N="756" /> that made this declaration possible is trust that was created by the workings of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  In a very real sense, to use the phrase of Michael Collins, the Anglo-Irish Agreement was the stepping stone upon which this declaration was built.  That Anglo-Irish Agreement for the first time in the 50 year history of Northern Ireland gave the Nationalists community a guarantee, a voice, a sense of belonging in the land in which they lived, something which they have never had before.  It was followed by an evolution in political thought on the part of the SDLP.  They devised a new way of expressing national self determination &mdash; the idea that it is possible to express it in the North and in the South simultaneously with either part being able to adopt a different view.  That was a tremendous development in thinking on the part of the SDLP and John Hume. It was accompanied by a tremendous change in Unionist thinking.  It is important to recognise that in the Unionist proposals for a Bill of Rights, in their acceptance of the idea of all-Ireland institutions actually exercising significant functions, in their proposals for the working of an assembly which will effectively allow a Nationalist veto on many proposals and a 65 per cent majority for all legislation, they have radically changed their thinking just as the SDLP changed its thinking.</P>
    <P>Having spoken to both parties I perceive that the problem has been that each is so conscious of the concessions it has made that it tends not to realise that the other side has also made concessions. There has been a dialogue of the deaf and in fact no dialogue at all because at the moment, as we know, the unionist parties are not talking to the SDLP, at least formally, or to the Irish Government. As somebody who has frequently voiced unionist concerns here, that is a major fault on their part.  They should talk to the Tánaiste and to John Hume. I hope that as a result of this declaration they will start talking.  I earnestly appeal to them to do so.  I have spoken to them and have found them to be eminently reasonable people who want to do business <Col N="757" /> with the rest of us on this island just as does the SDLP and the Alliance Party. It is a grave tragedy that they are not talking to one another.  There is more talent in politics in Northern Ireland than there is in politics in many jurisdictions which are ten or 12 times as large as Northern Ireland.  It is a great pity that that talent is blocked and those people cannot express their abilities in something more constructive than media interviews, talking past one another.  I hope that arising from this declaration it will be possible for the dark pall of war to be removed, that shadow which prevents people from talking to one another, so that people in Northern Ireland can be human again.</P>
    <P>There are two characteristics which could be attached to all categories of Irish people, and the more I listened to spokesmen of the unionist parties speaking, the more I realised, whatever they-say, how Irish they are in their expression and in their stubbornness.  They are just as stubborn as we are, no less and no more, but they also have a similar capacity for compassion.  I hope that in this Declaration we have created the catalyst that will allow compassion to subsume stubbornness so that we on this island might start living harmoniously together in conjunction with our closest neighbour and our neighbours in Europe as we should have been living for many years in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, compliment both Governments on what is an historic achievement in drawing up this Joint Declaration.  In particular I compliment the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and the many people involved in the process.  Deputy Bruton referred to the constitutional political leaders in Northern Ireland and I share his views in that regard.  The Unionist leaders, James Molyneaux and Martin Smyth, showed remarkable restraint in recent times when they may have felt threatened, isolated and alienated and that restraint led to the Declaration agreed by the two Governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Joint Declaration between the <Col N="758" /> Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister is an historic step forward in the pursuit of peace and reconciliation between the two traditions on this island and in further improving relations between our Republic and Britain.  The value of the Declaration is that it established ground rules by which the democratic wishes of the Irish people, North and South, Unionist and Nationalist, can be articulated, developed and pursued, without undermining or threatening each other. The Declaration offers a unique opportunity for the men of violence and those who support them to pursue their political goals by democratic means.</P>
    <P>The principle of consent to any change is central to the Declaration.  The rights of the two communities in Northern Ireland are acknowledged in language which is clear and unambiguous.  The roles of the two Governments are clarified beyond dispute.  The implications of Article 1 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, which have long been the subject of ambiguity and ambivalence, have been teased out and set forth in language that no one could misinterpret.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats, I welcome the Declaration, which I regard as balanced and fair.  It clearly breaks new ground in the age-old search for peace and reconciliation on this island.  It marks acceptance of the principle set out in Article 1 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement that the status of Northern Ireland can only be changed by agreement and can never be changed by violence.  Paragraph 4 of the Declaration states:</P>
    <P>The British Government agree that it is for the people of the island of Ireland alone, by agreement between the two parts respectively, to exercise their right of self-determination on the basis of consent, freely and concurently given, North and South, to bring about a united Ireland, if that is their wish.</P>
    <P>On the basis of those words alone, it will never be easier for the men of violence to come in from the cold and join the democratic process.  The Declaration <Col N="759" /> goes as far as any democratically-elected Government could go to create the circumstances in which those who resort to political terror and murder are given the democratic means to renounce the evil of violence and take up instead the challenge of democratic, peaceful politics.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that as far as Nationalist violence is concerned, political support shown for the armalite and ballot box approach has always been less than 2 per cent in the Republic and only 10 per cent in Northern Ireland.  Taking the island as a whole, Sinn Féin has never received support from more than approximately 4 per cent of the electorate. There has never been a mandate for violence, and now there is an overwhelming political demand that it must end.  Any figleaf of justification for the campaign of violence, based on a perverse view of history, is completely swept away by the British Government's assurances in paragraph 4 of this declaration.</P>
    <P>The violence of the Provisional movement now stands totally exposed as not anti-British violence, but rather as violence directed towards undermining the democratic will and aspiration of Unionists on this island, fellow Irish people.  Perhaps that fact clearly explains the reported willingness of the Provisional movement to contemplate ending what they have termed the &ldquo;armed struggle&rdquo;.  Virtually every bullet and bomb has been directed at fellow Irish people and their democratic rights.</P>
    <P>This agreement is balanced and fair and the credit for that must go to both Governments for ensuring that violence is not being rewarded, but exposed as being politically bankrupt.  Over the past number of weeks I consistently expressed concern that a peace formula might be attempted to satisfy the men of violence at the expense of constitutional Unionists in particular.  I am happy to acknowledge that my concerns have not come to pass and I pay tribute to both Governments for that.</P>
    <P>However, welcome as this Declaration undoubtedly is, and generous as the language most certainly is, the realities of <Col N="760" /> Northern politics still remain.  Although there is an acknowledgment that pursuit of a united Ireland is the democratic right of Nationalists on this island, we must accept that for the foreseeable future the great majority of people in Northern Ireland will exercise their right to self-determination by upholding the Union with Britain.  The creation of an atmosphere of trust and the pursuit of a political settlement on this island, therefore, must be grounded on the reality that it is within the United Kingdom that a radical transformation of Northern society must now be attempted to make it an inclusive and viable political community.</P>
    <P>Unionists can take heart from many of the provisions of the Declaration.  In particular, the acknowledgment that self-determination on this island must be exercised separately, North and South, and the promise of constitutional change by our Government.  However, the fact remains that the challenge of transforming Northern society into a viable political community poses huge questions for that Unionist community and requires them to abandon the unyielding politics of &ldquo;not an inch&rdquo; which has characterised their approach for too long.</P>
    <P>Unionists must be prepared to make huge political changes to bring about a viable political community which can earn the wholehearted allegiance of all the people of Northern Ireland.  Instead of &ldquo;not an inch&rdquo;, they must now be prepared to go the extra mile.  Ulster must stop saying &ldquo;no&rdquo;, and start saying &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to the demands of political viability.  The initial response of Official Unionist representatives to the Declaration today is encouraging.  However, they must realise too the need for major changes to accompany and flow from this Decclaration if Northern Ireland is to function as a civilised political community, enjoying the political allegiance of both communities there.</P>
    <P>The Irish dimension therefore must be expressed by a new deal for Nationalists within Northern Ireland and by the creation of a new relationship between North and South, based on institutional links, which reflect political, economic <Col N="761" /> and social realities within the island and the wider European Union.</P>
    <P>It would be foolish to work up a political momentum based on the open and generous language of this Declaration which is not based firmly on what is politically possible.  Nothing could be worse than a breakdown in the goodwill which this Declaration should bring about; a breakdown arising from the pursuit of unrealistic political aims in a manner which further divides and polarises the two communities in the North.  The Progressive Democrats set out detailed and realistic proposals which we believe fall squarely within the principles laid out in today's Declaration and which are capable of establishing progress and reconciliation on this island, and particularly between the two Northern communities.</P>
    <P>The proposal of the Taoiseach, set out in paragraph 11 of the Declaration envisaging arrangements within the Republic to enable democrats to consult together about the political future, requires careful evaluation before a final judgment can be made.  I note that the forum is merely a possibility, and I welcome that fact.  Recent press reports that &ldquo;a Forum for Peace and Reconciliation&rdquo; would, in essence, constitute a forum for working out a common Nationalist position for presentation to the Unionist community are not encouraging.  However, while the Progressive Democrats will be generous in accommodating any democrat in the process of political dialogue, we believe that undertaking a monolithic Nationalist approach might not be helpful and could be contrary to the very spirit of the Declaration.  Is the forum being suggested as a way of bringing Sinn Féin into talks before getting involved in wider talks with the Unionists?</P>
    <P>Creating cross-community understanding is far more important than trying to simplify the major division in Irish politics on this island into two opposing blocks.  The real barriers to be breached on his island are between Unionism and Nationalism and they will not be broken down merely by Nationalists talking to one another.  The real border on this island lies between the two communities <Col N="762" /> in Northern Ireland and the sooner they start talking to each other and find a political settlement under which they can work together the sooner we will have lasting peace on this island.</P>
    <P>In regard to constitutional change, I welcome the Government's commitment to alter Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution to accommodate a new settlement based on the principle of consent regarding any change in the status of Northern Ireland.  The claim made in 1937 that this Parliament and our Government could, as a matter of right, exercise jurisdiction over Northern Ireland in accordance with the terms of that Constitution was always dubious in value but now it is a major obstacle to political reconciliation between Unionist and Nationalist.</P>
    <P>An aspiration to unity based on the principle of consent was, as long ago as 1967, seen by the Members of all parties in this House to be a far more sensible statement of the Nationalist position.  In the 25 years that have intervened nothing has happened to undermine that judgment; in fact, everything points towards change.</P>
    <P>In the last analysis this Declaration offers those who have masterminded the campaign of political terrorism a way out of the evil in which they have immersed themselves and the rest of us.  Within days of this Declaration, however, they have engaged in violence both in Ireland and Britain and have killed innocent members of both Northern communities, presumably to try to boost their political position.  Whether such people can ever be convinced by persuasion of the evil nature of their anti-democratic campaign is now being put to the test.  With them and them alone lies the choice for democratic politics.</P>
    <P>I presume the Government, because of the contacts it has had, is optimistic that this will provide a forum for the men of violence to change and become involved in the democratic process but when we talk of a cessation of violence it is important that this implies a renunciation of violence.  In no sense can we allow those who say that violence has <Col N="763" /> ceased to come to the table for talks and leave their weaponry outside and allow them the opportunity to go back to the gun and the bomb if they do not get their way at the talks table.  It is extremely important that cessation implies renunciation.</P>
    <P>Regardless of the choice that the men of violence make I am dedicating myself and my party to the pursuit of reconciliation on this island based on open, generous and inclusive political principles. This Declaration is good in so far as it goes but its publication only marks the starting point of building reconciliation on this island.  What is now needed is a level of political commitment from all sides which we have never witnessed in the past.</P>
    <P>The momentum for a political settlement exists in the hearts and minds of ordinary people right around this country and, indeed, in Britain.  It is for their elected representatives to transform emotion for peace into a durable and honourable political settlement of the age old issues that have damned our affairs and torn apart our lives and prospects for generations.</P>
    <P>We always thought that there were many watersheds in the context of the violence in Northern Ireland &mdash; Enniskillen was one and Warrington was another &mdash; and were very optimistic that these would mark the end but, unfortunately, this was not the case.  We were also optimistic when the Sunningdale Agreement and the Anglo-Irish Agreement were signed.  I agree with Deputy Bruton that the Anglo-Irish Agreement is the foundation stone on which this Declaration is built but none of these has led to peace.  This is the best opportunity that the extremists and those who have engaged in violence will ever have to come in from the cold.  Ordinary people are sickened and fed up &mdash; they want no more.</P>
    <P>I want to use language that is reasonable, fair and not in any sense emotive as I do not want to make it any more difficult for them than it will be because what all of us want to see is peace followed by a <Col N="764" /> political settlement which is long lasting, fair and reasonable.  I urge them on everybody's behalf to seize this opportunity and join with the rest of us in trying to find a political solution to the age old difficulties which have confronted our people and led to 3,500 deaths during the past 25 years.  Enough is enough; now is the time to say yes.</P>

      <P>The Declaration produced today following the meeting of the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister is a document of potentially major significance which offers the best prospect for peace and political progress we have seen during the past tragic 25 years.  I welcome it with a sense of relief that a balance has been achieved.  My one fear during the past few months was that it would be difficult to achieve the necessary balance and that it would escape the clutches of those involved in the negotiations.</P>
      <P>It is a substantial document not just in terms of its length but also in regard to the ideas it puts forward and the issues it seeks to tackle.  It clearly merits careful consideration by all sides and the interests of peace will not be served by a rush to judgment on the detailed proposals it makes.  The Declaration is the fruit of a long process of dialogue and consultation between the two Governments and it has to be said the final text is a tribute to the drafting skills of some of the best brains in both the British and Irish public services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps one of its most significant features is that it marks an end to the false belief that there can be any simple solution to the problem of Northern Ireland or that peace can be achieved through victory by one side or another.  Today's Declaration is a serious attempt, in my view as Leader of Democratic Left, to recognise the complexities and the conflicting interests at the heart of the problem <Col N="765" /> of Northern Ireland.  Inevitably, it will be seen as offering something for everyone and perhaps that is no bad thing.  On the other hand, nobody has got everything they were looking for but we have always said that a solution to the problem is dependent on a willingness to compromise on dearly held aspirations.</P>
    <P>The fifteenth of December may turn out to be one of the most significant dates in the history of Ireland.  Politicians in this House and in Northern Ireland and, indeed, the citizens of this State and Northern Ireland have a responsibility to ensure that it does not turn out, as so many times before, to be just another false dawn.  What is new is that that responsibility now also lies with the paramilitaries and the IRA in particular because it is not the Members of the Dáil or of the British Houses of Parliament who have been waging a bitter war against the people of Northern Ireland for the past two decades.</P>
    <P>The Declaration represents the collective position of the democratically elected Governments of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland and reflects the wish of the overwhelming majority of people for a total cessation of all violence.  It is now up to the paramilitaries to respond to the democratic wishes of both Governments and peoples by ending without further delay their campaigns of murder and destruction or face the consequences.</P>
    <P>The principal source of paramilitary violence in Northern Ireland has been the Provisional IRA and while the Loyalists have shown an equal viciousness they claim that their evil activities have been a reaction to the ongoing Provisionals campaign.  It is now up to the Provisionals to respond.  The British Government in this Declaration has gone as far as it is politically possible to go to meet Republican demands in regard to self-determination and have gone a distance that would have been considered inconceivable even a few years ago.  If the Provisionals spurn this opportunity, responsibility for the continuing violence will more clearly than ever before be seen to rest totally with them and the Irish and <Col N="766" /> British Governments and the Irish and British people will never forgive them for it.</P>
    <P>The Provisionals cannot be allowed to preach peace and practice murder.  The repeated acts of violence at a time when they were claiming to be seeking peace, such as the murder of two village policemen in Tyrone at the weekend and the placing of a 1,000 lb. bomb in the densely populated markets area last night, raise very serious questions about the bona fides of the IRA leadership.  It is now make your mind up time for Gerry Adams and his colleagues.  Put bluntly, it is time for the leadership of the Republican movement to put up or shut up. Adams and the rest of the leadership of the Republican movement must now grasp the olive branch they have been offered or face the political and security consequences.  The political consequences of rejection should be total ostracisation of Sinn Féin by the democratic political parties.</P>
    <P>Political progress required compromise also from the Unionists.  Like many other people, when I first saw the Declaration I was anxious to find out the reaction of the Unionist community and their democratic representatives.  The response of the Democratic Unionist Party with its talk of &ldquo;sell-out&rdquo; and &ldquo;betrayal&rdquo; was as inevitable as it was predictable.  It was always likely that, irrespective of what agreement was hammered out between the two Governments, Dr. Paisley would see in it not the potential to achieve peace but the opportunity to make political mischief.</P>
    <P>The attitude of the Ulster Unionist Party has been much more complex and considerably more thoughtful.  They have earned great credit for their restrained attitude: it cannot have been entirely easy to take this position when they knew that Dr. Paisley would be beating the Loyalist drum at their door, seeking to whip up fears among the Unionists and take whatever political advantage could be extracted.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong to imply the Ulster Unionist Party spokesman had endorsed the Declaration &mdash; clearly they have not <Col N="767" />&mdash; but neither have they rejected it. Those I have heard have taken a balanced view on the document, listing those things which they regard as positive &mdash; the fact that there is no reference to &ldquo;joint authority&rdquo;, specific guarantees that there will be no change in the status of Northern Ireland without the express wish of a great number of people living there &mdash; but have expressed disappointment at other aspects, especially the failue of the Irish side to deliver more specific guarantees in regard to amendment of Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>In fairness to the Taoiseach, it must be acknowledged that in section 7 of the Declaration which states: &ldquo;in the event of an overall settlement the Irish Government will, as part of a balanced constitutional accommodation, put forward and support proposals for change in the Irish Constitution which would fully reflect the principle of consent in Northern Ireland&rdquo;, he has gone further than he or any of his predecessors have been prepared to go in the past.</P>
    <P>However, it is clear from the response of the Unionists that the speed and the extent to which the Taoiseach is willing to act on this promise will have a major impact on whether or not the necessary political follow-through to the Declaration will take place.  In this regard I hope that Deputy Reynolds heard the lunch-time remark of the secretary of the Ulster Unionist Party, Mr. Chris McGimpsey, that had the Taoiseach been prepared to make a similar commitment at the time of the talks last summer, the whole process might have been successfully completed by now.</P>
    <P>Promises of political generosity are fine as far as they go, but the people of Northern Ireland have a right to know exactly what form any proposed amendment to the Constitution would take.  The Taoiseach has refused to talk in anything other than generalities on that issue.  It is now time for him also to put on the table in relation to Articles 2 and 3, a detailed statement as to what form the amendments specified in Article 7 of the Declaration will take.  This could provide <Col N="768" /> an impetus towards rapid progress.  Failure to deal with this issue may seriously hinder the prospects for progress.</P>
    <P>Now that this phase of talks between the two Governments, culminating in the publication of this Declaration, has concluded, an urgent priority must be the reopening of serious dialogue between the democratic parties within Northern Ireland.  We have always stressed that a solution cannot be imposed by the two Governments over the heads of the people of Northern Ireland.  The matter is urgent as no time must be given to the paramilitaries to enable them to regain the initiative.  In their Declaration, Dublin and London have set out a framework which it is hoped, will lead to the creation of a new future for Northern Ireland which will recognise the diversity of political aspirations and cultural identities there and which will be capable of winning broad support.  The democratic parties in Northern Ireland must now be deeply involved in working out the nuts and bolts of any new arrangement. Without their early involvement, the whole project runs the risk of running aground.</P>
    <P>There are many aspects of today's Declaration that require much more consideration and explanation.  It will clearly not be possible to deal with them today. However, I would ask the Tánaiste when replying to this short debate to spell out in much more detail exactly what is involved in the proposal in section 11 for a &ldquo;Forum for Peace and Reconciliation to make recommendations on ways in which agreement and trust between both traditions in Ireland can be promoted and established&rdquo;.  Can the Taoiseach indicate when such a forum will get under way? Will it be before talks resume on Northern Ireland or will it be after or during those talks?  Will its deliberations be confined to questions relating to the Republic?  What would its agenda be, and what its membership?</P>
    <P>What is the intended role for this forum and how will it be constituted?  Is the Government talking about a coming together of democratic parties in the Republic to discuss ways of addressing <Col N="769" /> what is referred to elsewhere in the Declaration as elements in the democratic life and organisation of the Irish State that are considered by the Unionist community to be a real and substantial threat to their way of life and ethos?  If so, what way, would the role of such a forum differ from the role this Dáil would play through a Dáil committee?</P>
    <P>If, on the other hand, what is envisaged is a forum made up of the political parties in the Dáil and the Nationalist parties in Northern Ireland, then I can see little value to it.  Indeed it could constitute an impediment to progress.  The real need is not for talks between the different Nationalist parties, but for dialogue between Nationalists and Unionists.  It may be that the purpose of this forum is to provide a platform for Sinn Féin, a carrot to encourage the cessation of violence by the IRA &mdash; if this is the purpose of the exercise then we should be told.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of any reservations or questions I have, I recognise the importance of this Declaration and believe that it should be made available on the widest possible basis to the people of Northern Ireland and of the Republic.  People should be able to read it for themselves and make their own judgments on it.  It should be possible for people who have queries about it to have them answered in a straightforward way.  The Declaration should be made available in libraries, in schools, in Government offices and other suitable locations.  The Government took the trouble to have a document on the Maastricht Treaty distributed to every home in the country.  This Declaration is potentially as important.  On that occasion freefone services were established to answer questions from the public.  I urge both Governments to do the same in regard to this Declaration.</P>
    <P>For far too long the people of Northern Ireland have been allowed to endure political stagnation and an unspeakable campaign of terror.  Thousands of lives have been taken away, tens of thousands of people have been maimed and hundreds of millions of pounds worth of property destroyed and thousands of jobs lost.  At many times in the past 20 years it <Col N="770" /> appeared that the people of Northern Ireland had been robbed of everything, including the right to hope.  Nobody would be so incautious as to claim that today's Declaration is a complete formula for peace and political progress, but it does offer a potential for peace and political progress.  It offers a chance to hope again.  Anyone, politician or paramilitary, who undermines that hope deserves nothing but the contempt of the people of this country and of Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, I want to record our gratitude to the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, Prime Minister John Major their Governments and officials for bringing peace that much closer, I pray, with this Joint Declaration.  On behalf of the Greens, a party born of the peace movement, I appeal to those who believe in or who practice paramilitarism to enter into the dialogue towards a settlement.  As a member of the Church of Ireland, elected by all creeds to this House, I have nothing to fear living and working for all my constituents in Dublin North.  I appeal to Protestants in Northern Ireland to be courageous in coming to speak with others who share different political views.</P>
      <P>All sections of society have much to learn about respecting the rights of minorities, their concerns and legitimate aspirations whether these concerns be cultural, linguistic, religious or political. In seeking a consensus for peace and justice for all, the Greens will not be found wanting.  The Green parties of the republic, Northern Ireland, Scotland, England and Wales have since 1983 had common policies on the Northern crisis. The Greens will continue to support all peaceful means to end violence through trust and co-operation.</P>

      <P>I will be brief as I have not prepared an eloquent speech like the Leaders of other parties.  I would not put myself in the category of a party leader but nevertheless I have a voice.  There is an adage, &ldquo;if evil is to succeed it is sufficient <Col N="771" /> for good men to do nothing&rdquo;.  For a long time we, as a nation, have being doing less than we might, but there has been a change today.  I compliment the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister for going the extra mile to lay the ground rules and set the pace for peace in this country and on this island.</P>
      <P>For 25 years the paramilitaries on boths sides in Northern Ireland have dictated the pace and have brought their communities down a certain road which has led to death and the destruction of families and property.  They now recognise that that road has been a <i>cul de sac.</i> The way forward is for the constitutional and democratically elected politicians to take their various communities down the road of peace which has been officially opened today.  I appeal in particular to Unionist politicians in Northern Ireland, those who have been so vocal and vociferous in condemning any involvement by the Irish Government to seek a solution to this dreadful problem.  The troubles have been going on for too long.  Too many people have died.  Irish men have killed too many Irish men and, unfortunately, many of those who came to our shores suffered the same plight.</P>
      <P>I pray for the success of the peace process.  The Irish people through their democratically elected Parliament and the British people through theirs have spoken to all concerned.  They have spoken to the men of violence, to the constitutionally elected politicians and have sent out the message that we want peace.  We are at a crossroads.  Let us take the right road.  The people abroad, particularly in the United States, who have lent some succour to the organisations of violence on one side or another should take note of the democratically expressed wishes of the people of these islands.  There is only one way forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a member of the minority in this country, as an independent politician who has been elected by people of various political and religious beliefs, I send <Col N="772" /> a message to all the people of Ireland, particularly the Unionists, that we do not want to take anybody over.  We want to live in peace.  That can only be achieved by people living with one another in their communities.  We have given them the opportunity and I would ask them through their elected representatives to take it.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank Deputies Bruton, Harney, De Rossa, Sargent and Fox for their contributions to this debate.  The tenor of the debate, ably led by the Taoiseach and responded to by the other speakers, will be noted in Northern Ireland and in the UK.  The conciliatory tone of the debate should be well received and it reflects the spirit and generosity prevalent in Irish politics in relation to dealing with the problem of Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>In 1865, at the height of the American Civil War, Abraham Lincoln said:</P>
      <P>With malice towards none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in: to bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow and his orphan; to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves.</P>
      <P>The Declaration agreed today by the British and Irish Governments can be the first step towards binding up the nation's wounds and the first step towards a just and lasting peace.  Since I began by quoting President Abraham Lincoln, it is perhaps fitting that I should continue by referring to a statement issued within the last hour by President Clinton in which he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this season of hope, the call for peace on earth has a special resonance in Northern Ireland.  No side which claims a legitimate stake in the future of Northern Ireland can justify continued violence on any grounds.  I call on those who would still seek to <Col N="773" /> embrace or justify violence to heed the words of Paul and cast off the works of darkness and put on the armour of light.</P>
    <P>What has happened today has a simple yet profound significance.  The British Government has declared, in a way that puts it beyond all doubt, that they are not the enemy of Irish national aspirations. The Irish Government has declared that we are not the enemy of Unionist rights and aspirations.</P>
    <P>The problem is not a problem between Britain and Ireland.  The problem concerns relationships on this island.  Those relationships have been founded for too many years on hatred and mistrust, on fear and terror.  In making the declaration that was made today, the British Government affirmed that it is for us on this island, and us alone, to determine our own future on a basis of new relationships built to consent and trust.</P>
    <P>No British Government has ever made such a declaration, in such a formal way, so succinctly and expressly as that.  I found myself in an unusual position today in Downing Street, as the only politician present who had also been in Hillsborough in 1985 when the Anglo-Irish Agreement was signed: That agreement, too, held out the opportunity of self-determination based on consent, to the people of this island.  But even that was not as clearly expressed in words that are immediately understandable to everybody.</P>
    <P>I do not believe there can be any room for misunderstanding what has been said today.  I want to make it clear, for my own part, and I think on the part of everyone in this House, that we do not want a future on this island based on mistrust or on fear.  We do not want the false unity that comes from coercion.</P>
    <P>In making this Declaration, we have adopted the role of persuaders.  When I say we, I mean we the Irish Government and we the people of the Republic of Ireland.  Irish unity will only be achieved, in the words of the Declaration, &ldquo;only by those who favour this outcome persuading those who do not, peacefully and <Col N="774" /> without coercion or violence&rdquo;.  In short, the search for Irish unity must become for all of us a search for unity of hearts and minds, for unity of purpose, and not merely a search for unity of territory.</P>
    <P>I have spent many weeks, in common with several of my colleagues, seeking out opportunities to speak, frankly and openly, with people who disagree with the aspiration for unity.  That process, which has been conducted in an atmosphere of confidentiality in order to protect them, has led me inexorably to the conclusion that nothing could be more worthwhile than the effort to build new relationships and to build confidence.</P>
    <P>Again and again, I have sought to assure the people to whom I have spoken that they have nothing to fear from the attitude which the Irish Government is bringing to these negotiations.  Again and again, they have told me that fear is inbuilt in the community of Northern Ireland, that the divisions between the two traditions in that community have sometimes made hatred palpable.  Again and again, they have told me that the single request I have made to them &mdash; that they should learn to trust the good faith of the Irish Government in regard to their tradition &mdash; is the hardest thing I could ask.</P>
    <P>I hope that as they read and study this Declaration, they will come to realise that in all the meetings they had with me, they were told nothing less than the truth. I hope it will now be possible to begin the long, slow, and painstaking process of ending this conflict between traditions on our island.</P>
    <P>The first prerequisite is the removal of violence.  When I spoke in this House on 27 October on this subject, I pointed out that many of the activists of the Provisional IRA have been involved in violence and terror for all of their adult lives.  Many of them now have teenage children.  They have a choice &mdash; they can condemn their children, and their children's children, to lives of violence and terror.  Or they can stop.  If they were to stop now, it would provide hope that politics can replace terror as a means of achieving political objectives.  It would <Col N="775" /> free their children from the shadow of the gunman, and empower them for the first time in their lives to contribute to the well-being of their own communities. Now they have that chance.  The peace process in which they have claimed an involvement, and which has been pursued so diligently and courageously by John Hume, Séamus Mallon and others has given them that choice.  It has shown the way to an end to killing and to the beginning, at last, of the road to addressing the relationships on this island in the way that they need to be addressed.</P>
    <P>In the speech I referred to a moment ago, I set out six democratic principles which must underpin the search for peace and progress.  Those principles were widely welcomed in this House and elsewhere. They are all contained, implicitly and explicitly, in the Declaration we are now considering.  They add up to one simple proposition &mdash; the need to balance the right of the Irish people to self-determination with the right of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland to give or to withhold their consent to constitutional change.</P>
    <P>As the Declaration makes clear, we will, in the appropriate circumstances, ask the people of Ireland to enshrine the paramount importance of consent in our Constitution.  And in doing so, we will accept fundamentally the obligation to persuade.  We cannot enshrine consent in the Constitution without at the same time implicitly rejecting and repudiating coercion, force, or terror.</P>
    <P>Now is a time for everybody in this House to reach out.  We must reach out to those who are prisoners of their own terrorist tactics, just as we must reach out to those who have been bereaved by those tactics.  We must set out to work with people of goodwill to build a process of peace and reconciliation.  In this regard, I hope it will be possible, on due consideration, for those in Opposition in this House who have expressed reservations about such a coming together, now that they have read the Declaration, to reconsider their positions.</P>
    <P>I welcome the support for this Declaration <Col N="776" /> and the contributions made in this House today and for the support from outside the House and I hope that many more declarations of support will be made for the position taken by the British and Irish Governments today.</P>
    <P>A number of points were raised by Deputies Bruton, De Rossa and Harney and I will deal with those now.  I understand we will have a fuller debate on all these issues next Friday when this House will have an opportunity to give its full support for this Declaration.  This would give a very strong signal to the people of this island in relation to this process.  That is a matter that will be discussed between the Whips.  I certainly will urge that we will have an opportunity of going into the detail of the matter, as requested by Deputy De Rossa.</P>
    <P>On the question of Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution, the Taoiseach and myself as well as other spokespersons on behalf of the Government, have been very explicit in recent months in our acceptance of the necessity for constitutional change.  It is not our intention to use the formula as quoted by Deputy Bruton to hold up progress or to act as an inhibition.  Deputy Bruton was concerned that there is no timetable.  We hope the timetable is implicit in this Declaration and that we can bring a new dynamic into the peace process based on the efforts of both Governments.  As we said in London today, we are very anxious to resume the three-strand process of dialogue.  The Government solemnly believes that a cessation of violence would transform politics on this island.</P>
    <P>Questions were raised on how to determine a permanent cessation of violence. We are talking about the handing up of arms and are insisting that it would not be simply a temporary cessation of violence to see what the political process offers.  There can be no equivocation in relation to the determination of both Governments in that regard.</P>
    <P>Concern was raised by Deputies Harney and De Rossa about the question of establishing a forum for peace and reconciliation.  Many Members of this <Col N="777" /> House were in the past involved in the New Ireland Forum, a very worthwhile process engaged in by the parties on this island.  We favour as much dialogue and consultation as possible and I would like to think that there will be widespread consultation with all the parties in this House and all the democratic parties on this island before we engage in any forum or new form of talks.  The Opposition parties have a major role to play in building on the dynamic which this peace formula will establish.</P>
    <P>Criticism has been proffered in relation to the 1937 Constitution.  We should not for a moment feel that the conditions of 1937 are similar to those of 1993.  There has been an amazing change in the politics of this island.  The debate taking place here this afternoon could not have taken place in the politics of the 20s and 30s, and I hope that will be understood in Northern Ireland.  The atmosphere of politics has changed, as is strongly reflected in the debate this afternoon.</P>
    <P>The future of Ireland is in the hands of the people of Ireland.  The people of the United Kingdom, our nearest neighbour in geographic terms and one of our most important partners in economic terms, want nothing from us except that we will be willing to work together.  The people of Ireland demand that all of us in this House, as equals, should be prepared to take whatever risk is necessary to keep the process, now begun, alive and strong. I was very honoured to lead the Labour Party in these negotiations.  From my earliest discussions with the Taoiseach before the Government was formed, he was very forthright in his determination to do whatever possible to establish peace of this island.  He has always put all the cards on the table in relation to Northern Ireland.  I was very honoured to work with him during the last number of months and I appreciate the leadership and negotiating skills shown by him over many months.</P>
    <P>We must make no mistake about the opportunity that exists.  This Declaration is the first step in a process of peace. The second step will be a cessation of violence, which we all hope will happen, <Col N="778" /> but the process of building a peace that can be sustained will be long and painstaking. Today this Government has made a good start and we are grateful for the support of the Opposition parties in this matter.  Let up hope that our generosity will be reciprocated in Northern Ireland and that we can all work towards a peaceful existence on this island.</P>

      <P>I can understand why the Minister is not present in the House to night.  Before the debate was adjourned last night I had started to quote from the final paragraph of her speech in which she stated:</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Bilocation would be very handy at times in this House.  I do not like talking about the Minister behind her back, but I want to make the points I would have made last night if I had had the time and she was present in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am extremely disappointed that a young, able and new Minister would allow herself to be used like many previous Ministers, who may have been appointed because of the geographical <Col N="781" /> location of their constituencies, etc., and accept an irrelevant amendment to a very clear motion.  The Fine Gael motion clearly calls on the Minister for Finance to instruct all local authorities to pay outstanding grants to students immediately and to change the date for the issuing of application forms to April.  The history of the higher education grant schemes given by the Minister was about as relevant as talking about Santa Claus to children.  The amendment had nothing whatsoever to do with the motion.  I cannot understand why an able Minister would accept an amendment formulated by a civil servant or adviser under which she outlined the history of the higher education grant schemes.  I get depressed at times when I look at the way the Dáil works.  I often wonder if we could score even two out of ten points in a study on the relevance of what we discuss in this House.</P>
    <P>Why should any Minister propose an amendment which has no relevance to a serious motion?  Perhaps the first part of the motion, which calls on the Minister to instruct all local authorities to pay outstanding grants immediately, could be amended by including the words &ldquo;where all necessary forms are completed&rdquo;.  That would be a justifiable amendment.  The second part of the motion could be amended by substituting May, June or July for April.  I am extremely disappointed that the Minister proposed an amendment which is totally irrelevant in terms of the motion.</P>
    <P>The Government backbenchers who came into the House to give the Minister both vocal and moral support referred to pre-primary education and primary education during this debate on the late payment of higher education grants and the date for applications.  How relevant are the Opposition parties and does it make any difference what kind of motion we put down?  The amendment congratulates the Minister on setting up an advisory group, another subcommittee, to examine the administration of the grants scheme.  Two previous Ministers for Education, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and <Col N="782" /> Employment, Deputy Séamus Brennan and Deputy Mary O'Rourke, both set up subcommittees to deal with the issue of third level grants.  Yet the amendment congratulates the Minister on setting up yet another committee to deal with third level grants.  Kieran Fitzgerald, who was captain of the Irish rugby team, would have asked the Minister where was her pride in moving an amendment which congratulated her on setting up a third committee to deal with third level grants. I am sorry that this new Minister is carrying on the old tradition where no Opposition motion is dealt with seriously by the Government.</P>
    <P>This motion deals with a very serious matter.  Students who have to pay for their accommodation from September but who do not receive their grants until December are left in a crisis.  This is similar to the crisis in which substitute teachers who are not paid regularly find themselves.  However, that is a matter for another day.  Any Deputy or Minister who worked hard from September but who was not paid until December would certainly table a lot of parliamentary questions to the relevant Minister asking why he or she was not being paid.</P>
    <P>It is important that the application forms for higher education grants be simplified to such an extent that there are no difficulties in regard to the details required.  The excuse given last night for the late payment of grants was that different local authorities were waiting for additional information from students.  It would be a pity if the complex nature of application forms were to cause problems in this area.  May I ask the Chair to clarify the position in regard to the time at my disposal?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I will <Col N="785" /> be brief as I want to share my time with Deputy McGrath.</P>
      <P>A closing date of August or September for the submission of application forms for grants is ludicrous.  I hope the Minister will take note of the proposal in our motion in that regard.  If the application forms were made available to students in April they could be dealt with without any rush and the staff would be available in the offices to deal with them.  I have been told that some students might not qualify for a grant &mdash; for example, they may not get the required number of honours in their leaving certificate, etc.  If the applications were dealt with at an earlier date this would save much trouble later. The greatest difficulty is that the Department of Education will not send out the details of the higher education grant scheme until late August.  For many years at county council level the practice has been to approve in July that year's applications for higher education grants.  I proposed a motion at a meeting of Carlow County Council last year to refuse to approve the scheme in advance because of previous warnings given by us in this regard.  Why can the details of the scheme not be issued in April?  The variation is very little.  If there is to be a change in the limit on parents the Department should ensure that these details are announced in April.  We approved the applications in advance but no action can be taken because the details of the scheme are not available and Members who are involved in county councils will be aware of this problem.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister of State to ask the Minister for Education to issue details of the higher education grant scheme sooner than at present so that county councils will have adequate time to deal with applications.  There is little point in applying for grants in April if the details are not available and the longer the delay in issuing details of the scheme, the longer the application will be delayed.</P>
      <P>The duplication of the work of county councils and vocational education committees will be dealt with by another Deputy but it is a problem we could do without at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="786" /> This motion is too serious to be side-tracked by an amendment which bears no relationship to the problem.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that students who are experiencing delays in decisions on their grant applications receive their grants as quickly as possible.  In order to prevent delays occurring next year the application form should be simplified and there should be no demands on applicants to supply information they do not have.  I realise the importance of providing all the necessary information but if that process is causing confusion it should be addressed.</P>
    <P>Finally, I appeal to the Minister to ensure that the application forms are sent out earlier than has been the case up to now because this is causing most problems. That can only be done if the details of the higher education grant scheme are circulated earlier rather than at the end of August as is the case now.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank Deputy Browne for sharing his time with us.  I welcome this debate on third level education. It is important that we examine our third level grants scheme in order to highlight the inadequacies that exist at present.  Deputy Jim Higgins has done a good job in moving this motion which is worthy of support.</P>
      <P>For some time third level grants have been a source of annoyance to people in the PAYE sector in particular because they have not been able to avail of them. The system is very inequitable in that many self-employed people can easily qualify for the grants but those in the PAYE sector receive no assistance to send their children to third level colleges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A psychiatric nurse I met recently told me he had spent £52,000 in the past four years putting his children through third level education.  Last year he received a partial grant for one of his children.  That begs the question of why somebody like <Col N="787" /> him should be expected to put his children through third level education against such odds.  The system is inequitable and I support the work of the review group in this regard.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister of State forgotten the promise made in the election a year ago by the then Minister for Education, Deputy Séamus Brennan, that Fianna Fáil, on returning to power, would grant free third level education to everybody? That idea seems to have been shelved and I wonder what the Minister's response will be to that.  The Labour Party told the electorate that on returning to power it would have third level eligibility determined on net pay.  Unfortunately, this has not come about either and I understand the Minister is quoted as saying that that idea was simply not practical and could not work.  The Labour Party was able to make that claim in Opposition to win votes but yet it did not see it through.  That party is bringing the political process into disrepute by making promises it could not fulfil.  Despite that, the Fine Gael motion to give tax allowances to people who send their children to third level education was rejected by the two Government parties.  That does not seem reasonable.</P>
    <P>A problem was brought to my attention recently which the review group might investigate.  Perhaps the Minister will relay it to that body.  He will be aware that mature students over the age of 23 can qualify independently for grants to pursue third level education.  I recently received a letter from an irate mature student who accepted a place in the Dublin Institute of Technology.  He was advised by the institute that since he was a mature student he would qualify for a grant and as he was a native of Westmeath he should apply to the local vocational education committee.  Following a number of telephone calls, and clarifications, he was told that because he was not residing in Westmeath on 1 October 1992 he did not qualify for a grant in County Westmeath.  I accept that that is the regulation.  The applicant was advised to apply to County Dublin <Col N="788" /> vocational education committee for his grant which he did.  Again, following a number of clarifications and telephone calls, his grant application was accepted and he was delighted to hear he would be approved for a grant.  However, he received a shock when he was told that his maintenance grant for the year would be £582.  That is not what he was expecting and it leaves him in an impossible position.  As a mature student he was living in a flat and as he was living in Dublin for grant purposes the so-called adjacent rate of £582 applied.  That is totally inadequate to cover that man attending a third level institution.  There is a gross inequity in a system that allows that and it must be reviewed urgently.</P>
    <P>If a student is to be an independent student, why give him this small adjacent rate which, I understand, is meant for students who are living at home and do not have the expense of accommodation. Surely it is more important in the case of independent students to take their place of abode and type of accommodation into account.  The grant of £582 is totally insufficient and should be changed forthwith. I appeal to the Minister to take this up with the review group before it prepares its report.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the processing of grants.  There are two systems of processing, one is carried out by the county councils and the other by the vocational education committees.  Both do a worthwhile job.  This is certainly the case in my area but it seems strange that there should be two separate bodies processing third level education grants within a small area such as in Westmeath, which has a population of 63,000.  I am sure there is no need for two bodies to be engaged in this.</P>
    <P>There is also a certain amount of inequality within the system.  There is no recoupment of the expenses of the local authority &mdash; in this case Westmeath County Council &mdash; by the Department of Education.  For example, there is no recoupment of the interest that must be incurred by Westmeath County Council in paying those grants in advance because, as the Minister well knows, the <Col N="789" /> relevant local authorities are recouped retrospectively.  It is estimated in Westmeath County Council that it costs us in the region of £80,000 to administer third level grants annually.  Let us take the example of our friends down the road in the vocational education committee whose total expenses, I understand, are recouped by the Department of Education. They can obtain something towards their administration costs and all other costs incurred by them are totally recoupable.</P>
    <P>I wonder why we should have that dual system.  I can see the reason for the relevant local authorities continuing to process such applications, because their staffs will have built up a lot of expertise over the years; indeed, the staff of Westmeath County Council are particularly able in that respect.  But why should the Department recoup one body and not another?  It seems a very strange practice.  Perhaps the Minister would let me have his observations on that matter.</P>
    <P>The time has come for me to give way to my colleague, Deputy Bradford.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleagues for their generosity in giving me a little of their time to enable me express my support for the motion before the House. Realistically, I suppose most of the political antennae are rightly elsewhere, today.  However, in the general run of politics higher education grants usually are a fairly emotional subject affecting thousands of people nationwide.  Very few other problems cause politicians as many difficulties as do these grants. Questions are raised about people's entitlement to them, delays in having them sanctioned and delays in their payment.</P>
      <P>The motion tabled at least causes the matter to come before the Minister for discussions once again.  We have stated our party's view on this issue on more than one occasion in this House.  I hope that the Minister's advisory group will bring forward some proposals leading to more realistic circumstances surrounding the granting and payment of these grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Delays in their payment sometimes can <Col N="790" /> result in students sitting their first year examinations without at that point knowing whether a grant has been sanctioned. Such delays are inexcusable.  Most students in their first term should at least have had a decision given in relation to their application for a higher education grant.  Indeed, in the majority of cases the hope would be that payment would already have issued.  All of us public representatives have on our files details of applications going back to September and October last in respect of which decisions have not yet been taken.  That is inexcusable.  No student should have to wait so long for a decision to be taken on their application.  In many cases it results in their having to obtain loans from financial institutions, which loans and their attendant high rates of interest would be unnecessary if only the administration of the scheme was improved. Admittedly, the staff of the relevant local authorities nationwide are doing their utmost to resolve the problem, but there are so many anomalies in the scheme that they need to be addressed as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>We must remember that at the end of the day there is little saving for the State in allowing the present system to continue since the delays in these payments do not result in any windfall for the Exchequer.  Whenever a grant is sanctioned it must be paid, whether that be in the week following a student's entry into first year at college or 12 months later.  The money still comes out of the State coffers.  Therefore, it would be much better for all concerned if the money were paid at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>The allegation of victimisation of PAYE worker parents needs to be addressed also.  I heard some of my colleagues here this evening speak of the inequity, as they perceived it, of the higher education grants system from the point of view of applicants whose parents are PAYE workers.  Certainly, such people can produce very transparent documentation, such as a P21, when an early decision is usually given.  But under the present inadequate income limits <Col N="791" /> many deserving applicants are deemed to be ineligible for grant aid.  Many of these are forced to obtain student loans to take them through their years at college and, in a minority of cases, they are forced to forego their places in college because they simply cannot afford to pay the total cost.</P>
    <P>It would be my hope that in her review the Minister would look more favourably at a more generous income limit which would take cognisance of the fact that the present system based on gross income does not allow people with even a reasonable level of income to obtain a higher education grant.  That is one side of the equation.  The other side of the equation, something about which I feel strongly, is the view abroad that every self-employed person and member of the farming community can obtain a higher education grant without any difficulty whatsoever, whereas nothing could be further from the truth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>Hopefully, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe will quote figures in respect of people still awaiting grants because those most need to be highlighted.  Perhaps I may be allowed to make my point without interruption.  In regard to the self-employed and farmers, it would be my hope that audited accounts would be accepted by the Revenue Commissioners as representing their true income and would suffice in regard to their applications for higher education grants.  I am sure that many Members will be aware that many genuine expenses incurred by the self-employed, such as interest repayments, depreciation and so on, are not at present allowable in calculating income for higher education grant purposes &mdash; another anomaly needing to be addressed.  On Monday last I saw the file of a person who had been declared to have absolutely no taxable income whatsoever, the Inspector of Taxes having been quite willing to certify that that person's income amounted to £4,000 or <Col N="792" /> £5,000 per annum.  But he was deemed to be ineligible for such a grant because his interest repayments last year, amounting to £20,000, had not been taken into account.  They were simply added back to his income of £4,000 or £5,000 and he was told he had an income of some £24,000 or £25,000.</P>
      <P>Depreciation and interest repayments make a huge difference to a large number of applicants, and that matter needs to be addressed.  I make that point to refute the argument abroad &mdash; obviously we will hear something about it later &mdash; that all self-employed people and members of the farming community write or draw up their own accounts.  That is far from being the truth.  There are countless people nationwide who suffer on account of those two anomalies, the non-allowance of depreciation and interest repayments as an expense in calculating income for higher education grant purposes.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Within the context of the Programme for Government, Fianna Fáil have given a commitment to ensuring wider access to third level education and a continued improvement in the students' support scheme.  There have been significant improvements effected in the making available of such grants to students, most notably those to mature students.  There is no doubt but that the increase of £2,000 per child in third level education did help many parents who had two or three children <Col N="793" /> attending third-level institutions and who had been subjected to tremendous pressure.</P>
    <P>There are many complaints in relation to eligibility for grant aid, the means test and the lateness of payments.  I asked Donegal County Council how many applicants there were and when they were paid.  Three hundred applications for higher education grants were received in Donegal County Council this year, of which 245 were approved.  I commend the council in that almost 200 were paid by 29 October.  That is an excellent record.  A total of approximately 800 applications had to be dealt with by Donegal County Council this year, including new applications, renewals, etc.  We are all aware of the problems we have to deal with in this regard.</P>
    <P>In relation to means and income limits something will have to be done.  A review for taxation purposes would certainly help the new poor.  They are the people who are under pressure.  They have to pay all kinds of bills, tax is deducted at source and they do not have recourse to any aid.  I hope the Minister, within the expert group, will be allowed to deal with that matter.</P>
    <P>In County Donegal many students apply under the UCAS system &mdash; the Northern Ireland system &mdash; in November and December and under the CAS system in January.  I ask the Minister to ensure that the list of the approved colleges and courses for the forthcoming session should be finalised before Christmas each year so that students and parents can make an informed choice. We have tremendous career guidance teachers but students cannot always make the right decision and are not always aware of what courses are approved.  We have enormous problems from August to November when people apply for a grant for a course which is not approved.  It is then too late to change.  If parents were given a list of approved courses it would go a long way towards improving decision-making by students and parents.</P>
    <P>Maintenance allowances should be approved for any course in an approved college in Northern Ireland, subject to <Col N="794" /> the entry requirements and the awards of the college being of equivalent standard to those in the Republic.  There are too many problems with colleges and private institutions in Northern Ireland who do not have approved certification lobbying and trying to get students to come from the Republic to keep up their numbers. If there were equivalent standards I would see merit in working with them.</P>
    <P>The students' support scheme should be extended to England, Scotland and Wales.  I realise it is very expensive and I appreciate that some £84 million was made available in 1993.  That is an astronomical amount of money for third level education grants.  If the students cannot get places here we will have to seek additional places or help them to go to other institutions.</P>
    <P>I am not long out of college and I regret the fact that the points system has got totally out of hand.  One is now expected to have seven or eight honours to do a B. Comm.  That is not on.  A genius could do a B. Comm. but may not make a brilliant accountant or a good commerce teacher.  I ask the Minister to keep a keen eye on the points system because we are putting tremendous pressure on students to perform very well in the leaving certificate. That is not a bad idea but we are putting undue stress on them.  It is very disappointing for those who would like to undertake a particular course but cannot achieve the required number of points, yet can go to England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland and do that course. That is not fair.  We should do something about providing additional places in this country.</P>
    <P>I should like to make two other points. I see merit in a single authority for grant aid.  There is too much confusion in this regard.  We made great progress with the dual application form but I see a need for a single authority.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter which is outside the range of the motion but perhaps the Minister would deal with it.  It is totally unfair of colleges and universities to insist that they have a letter of approval from a county council or a vocational education committee before they can <Col N="795" /> register.  Every student who is accepted in a college should be accepted at registration and the technicalities can be dealt with later.  This system is unfair as students cannot use the library and are lost when starting in college.  University College Galway is the only college that allows everybody to register and they deal with the technicalities afterwards. Perhaps the Minister would take that issue on board.</P>
    <P>Recoupment of expenditure to local authorities is on an annual basis.  In the context of this debate perhaps we could examine the question of recoupment on a quarterly basis.  Most county councils cannot afford to carry the overdraft facilities. While we have made some progress, more is required.  I do not see the need for a division in this House because most of us have the same agenda which is to support third level education.  Many changes could be made quickly without necessitating huge expenditure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a great pleasure for me to speak in this House on this historic day.  At present, about 80,000 of our young people are in third level education, which is a rapidly growing sector.  By the end of the century there will be over 100,000 in third level education.  Up to now the greatest strain on our resources has been on the primary sector but increasingly the strain will be on resources at second and third level.  There have been increases in all third level sectors.  The regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology have expanded rapidly.  Since 1980 student numbers there have increased from 10,500 to 31,000.</P>
      <P>This increased pressure on higher education resources is against the background of increased spending in education.  As a nation we have allocated 19 per cent of Government spending to education.  This compares with 13.2 per cent in 1965.  Times have changed.  It is fair comment that we have changed with them.  As many more places for students have been provided, so has support for these students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="796" /> Wexford County Council, of which I am a member, and County Wexford vocational education committee, of which I am also a member, have a proud record in that very few, if any, demands are being made on the public representatives at this stage to have grants paid.  I do not dispute that more should be done but, given our total pool of resources, we are doing as much as we possibly can.</P>
    <P>Particular gains have been made in relation to support for mature students. Any mature student who gets a third level place is deemed to qualify for a grant. The ridiculous situation where mature students were means tested on their parents' income has been done away with. Of significance too was the increase in income eligibility limits for third level grants.  This has brought into the grants system many middle income and farming families who were previously excluded. It should also be noted that maintenance grants were increased, as were fee grants. This year 46,000 students are being supported in one way or another from public moneys.  That figure compares with only 12,000 in 1982.  The sum of £84 million this year compares with £75 million and represents a 12 per cent increase.  I challenge the Fine Gael spokesperson, Deputy Higgins, to state whether Fine Gael in Government ever gave a 12 per cent increase in the student grant to support students and their hard pressed families. He knows his party's record in Government was lamentable.  He knows also that his position on this issue is opportunistic.  If this is the best use the Fine Gael Party can make of Private Members' time it is not fit to be the official Opposition.</P>
    <P>In the motion they call for payments to be made to qualifying students on commencing college.  This must be examined very carefully because, as we all know, some students leave college very shortly after commencing.  In instances such as this does Deputy Higgins propose to recoup the moneys paid?  That question must be asked.  Scoring own goals and exposing himself to ridicule is not the function of the Deputy, as the Opposition <Col N="797" /> is supposed to embarrass the Government and not itself.  I wonder if Deputy Higgins consulted with his colleague, Deputy Yates, the spokesman on finance, on how Fine Gael proposes to finance the increases suggested.  When one considers that the Leader of the Fine Gael Party did not consult Deputy Yates on the tax amnesty, I suppose the Deputy could be excused.</P>
    <P>The Minister has recently set up an expert advisory group that will, among other things, make recommendations for the most effective administration of the grant schemes.  This is certainly to be welcomed.  Everyone accepts that there is room for improvement in the delivery of student grants.  I welcome the Minister's commitment to making major improvements in this area.  Administration is not primarily an educational matter but we should have the political courage to acknowledge that it is an example of a wider problem of productivity and efficiency in the public sector.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education uses 19 per cent of our public resources.  Dáil Éireann has a duty to ensure that none of the scarce resources is wasted in any way.  I commend the amended motion to the House.  I congratulate the Minister and I commend her and the Minister of State at her Department for the many necessary initiatives that have been taken.  In the recent past I had a difficulty but I found her good office most acceptable. When one approaches the ministerial office one can run up against a stone wall but in this instance commonsense prevailed.  I compliment both Ministers on this.  I hope the spirit of their initiatives in the area of third level education grants will extend to those two prestigious institutions of learning already mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to put on record the ongoing commitment of the Fianna Fáil Party to higher education.  Part and parcel of that commitment is to ensure that more and more young people gain access to third level education.  Our record speaks for <Col N="798" /> itself.  As Deputy Byrne mentioned, half of the total intake of students are in receipt of third level grants and this is testimony to the fact that Fianna Fáil has done its work on access to educational opportunities at third level.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael motion calls on the vocational education committees and local authorities to pay the grants.  While that is ideal it does not take account of the realities on the ground and I can illustrate this.  I understand that UCC in early November provided a list of its students to Cork County vocational education committee and to Cork County Council but UCD did not provide its list of students until late November and therein lies the dilemma.  How can the local authority pay out third level grants if the institution concerned has not provided the information on students?  We need to look again at the application forms for third level grants and design a form which includes a special section which would indicate that one is an applicant for a grant and a further section that can be sent off immediately which indicates in fact that one has been awarded a grant.  That would help people operating the scheme in the local authorities. Certainly those to whom I have spoken consider the format of the form leaves a great deal to be desired and needs further improvement.  It is also fair to say that applications that have not been fully completed are returned in dribs and drabs to the local authority. They have to be sent out again to be completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think this is a timely motion because there is not a great difference in Members' attitudes to higher education grants.  Obviously, I welcome the setting up of the expert advisory committee and I am glad they will report to the Minister before the end of the year.  If one examines the available statistics one certainly concludes there are inequities in the system, for instance in Cork County Council the children of &ldquo;poor farmers&rdquo; got 27 per cent of the total number of grants awarded last year; students whose parents are in the PAYE sector were fortunate to get 25 per cent of the grants <Col N="799" /> and, believe it or not, the children of the unemployed got 25 per cent also, 2 per cent below the farming community. Obviously those statistics give rise to a number of questions.  There is a perception that the self-employed are getting &ldquo;away with murder.&rdquo; Is it possible to overhaul the system and make it more transparent?</P>
    <P>Last year we spent £84 million of public money on education and I have no difficulty in asking the Minister to make public the beneficiaries of education grants.  What is wrong with that?  Is there any reason why an elected member of a local authority should not be made aware of those in receipt of grants right around the county?  I cannot see any difficulty with that because we are responsible for the expenditure of public money.  I raised this issue at Cork County Council but the motion was defeated on the basis that it could cause difficulties in the implementation of the Data Protection Act.  Perhaps the Minister might address that issue.</P>
    <P>I foresee that the funding of higher education grants will be a major difficulty in the future.  The projected number of students for the year 2005 is 122,000 third level students and funding will then be a major issue.  We need to reform the system to ensure that it is fair and equitable. There is a perception that the system is not as fair as it should be.  In introducing the reforms of the third level grant system, the then Minister for Education, Deputy Séamus Brennan, enabled many young people to go to college who heretofore would have been unable to do so.  He has made a major contribution.  He is an unsung hero.</P>

      <P>I am somewhat disappointed by this motion.  It is a very conservative motion in that it envisages changes and reforms in the context of the existing system.  I appeal to the Minister and to the expert advisory group to have a fundamental review of the whole system. Local authorities should not be the bodies to administer the higher education grants system.  It should be administered by the vocational education committees or processed within third level institutions. That fundamental decision should be taken by the Minister and I appeal to her to accelerate the timetable towards such change.  I am not casting any aspersions on the capacity or efficiency of local government because in many ways local government staff are extremely efficient and effective in dealing with the system.  Their problem relates to the huge volume of work.  It is clear that local authorities want to rid themselves of this burden because the recoupment of the money required to administer the scheme is only paid to the local authority 12 months later.  In Cork Corporation last year it cost the local authority £350,000 on interest alone to administer the scheme although we are very hard pressed for cash.  It makes sense that the administration of this scheme should be in the context of education institutions.</P>
      <P>The existing scheme discriminates against the PAYE sector.  There have been significant improvements in recent years, in the increase of the threshold limits and so on, but the figures still show that the PAYE sector suffers in terms of the allocation of third level grants. Everybody attending third level institutions should receive some form of financial support.  The ESF grants were not means-tested for many years although I know that has changed to some degree. Given the fact that the self-employed have their own regulatory system in terms of tax returns, as do the farming community, and given that the PAYE sector have no choice, any grant system based on the present taxation system will inevitably discriminate against the PAYE sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of anomalies in the system <Col N="801" /> needs to be eliminated.  Families with three members attending third level institutions do not receive grant assistance because, the first student went in 1991. Because the changes which took place are only effective from the date of their introduction many students who did the leaving certificate prior to the introduction of these improvements still do not benefit from them.  These anomalies should be dealt with effectively.  I appeal to the Minister to introduce a more streamlined simplified system.  In fairness, the Minister mentioned that in her speech.</P>
    <P>We have had significant problems this year in the payment of grants to students. In many ways we are victims of our success as evidenced by the increased participation in third level education.  The significant increase in the numbers attending third level institutions will continue to the end of the decade and into the next century.  We should urge all students participating in second level education to engage in some form of further education and we must put in place a financial structure to support such a process.</P>
    <P>Post-leaving certificate courses have developed as a new tier of third level education throughout the country.  We in Cork have over 3,500 students attending the College of Commerce, Scoil Stiofáin Naofa and Scoil Eoin Naofa using an exciting and innovative curriculum dealing with tourism, heritage, childcare and so on, courses which are accredited with outside institutions but which need a national recognition system along with funding.  Most of these students are not in receipt of funding and they require support.</P>
    <P>I am glad of the opportunity to contribute to the debate and I thank the mover of the motion in that he has given us an opportunity to make interim comments on a changing situation.</P>

    <P>I welcome the oportunity to speak on this subject and I welcome the setting up of the special advisory group to examine the administration of the grant scheme.  I look forward to the proposals.  There is a need for radical reform in the administration of these schemes in order to achieve equity.  Rather than having an absolute cut off point in going from eligibility for full fees or maintenance to eligibility for half fees or maintenance and then to no fees and no maintenance, there should be a gradual decrease in eligibility as income increases.  That would ensure that a person would not lose valuable grants because they earned £50 or £100 over an arbitrary income limit.  Arbitrary income limits are the curse of this country.</P>
    <P>We should look at the possibility of taking mortgage interest payments into account when assessing income.  The reason why farmers, for instance, can maintain higher living standards than PAYE people is that many of them do not have high mortgage repayments.  A simple way of balancing things would be to allow mortgage repayments to be taken into account.  Perhaps the tax system needs to be reformed to redress the balance <i>vis-à-vis</i> the PAYE sector and the self-employed.  I have come across cases in which it has been shown that the tax system is stacked against the self-employed person.  The system does not allow for capital write-offs or capital payments in cash or for interest payments. A person with an actual income of £3,000 a year who declared interest payments and capital payments that had to be made was deemed ineligible for third level grants.</P>
    <P>We need also to review the system with regard to once-off payments.  Somebody who inherits £10,000 can be refused a grant because he inherited the money in the wrong year.  We must look, too, at the treatment of a person who is under <Col N="803" /> 23, is married and applies for a grant. Such a person is assessed on his parent's income and not on the income of the husband and wife.  That is nonsense in this day and age.</P>
    <P>We need radical reform of the administration of the scheme.  Either the vocational education committee, the local authority or the CAO should process all grant applications and it should be possible to start processing the grants in advance of leaving certificate results. Means-testing could be carried out in the summer.  In my experience the greatest cause of delays relates to means-testing due to people being delayed in getting their tax affairs in order.  If this process was started in early summer, affairs would be in order by the time students go to college.</P>
    <P>I want to take this opportunity to raise the scandal of the very large deposits being sought by some third level institutions, particularly universities, who are seeking deposits of £900 for intending students two months in advance of courses starting.</P>

      <P>This is a money making racket by the universities and I call on the Minister to take action to ensure that all third level colleges seek a nominal registration fee.  If some colleges can do that, they all can.  This is an importanmt issue which should be tackled once and for all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two issues in relation to the question of funding which must be addressed, first, the manner in which the current system operates and, second, the fundamental question of access to third level education.  I am sure most Members will agree that the number of parents attending constituency clinics <Col N="804" /> with problems in relation to third level grants for their children has increased greatly.  Those people are entitled to grants; they are not looking for something to which they are not entitled, but they cannot get them when required. That is a cause of great concern and a nuisance for people.  The failure of the Government to operate a sufficiently flexible system which informs the public at an early date is the subject of much justified criticism.  From my experience local authorities, as far as practicable, process grants as quickly as possible, the time constraints under which they operate being frequently outside their control. However, some local authorities use an approach which is absolutely inexcusable. For example, in some cases they hold up or interfere with grants to which students are entitled because their parents have not paid their service charges. That should be made illegal.  What the parents do should be of no concern to the local authority and should not have a bearing on a student's entitlement to a grant.  A student has no power over the manner in which his or her parents pay their service charges.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education has responsibility to resolve the difficulties being experienced in respect of third level grants and I welcome the movement in that regard.  At present a ping-pong game is taking place in that the local authorities blame the Department and the Department blames the local authority, but at the end of the day it is the student who suffers.  There is a need for transparency in this area; people should know exactly what is happening.  If they cannot receive a grant quickly they should be told why and what redress they have.  People are going around in circles, from one body to another, in an effort to get satisfaction. We should not underestimate the hardship and misery caused by late grant payments. It frequently means parents going into debt and puts students under unnecessary pressure in regard to whether they should take up courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It also means that students must go without educational necessities and renege on rent payments and other financial <Col N="805" /> commitments at a time when they are very often under enough pressure because of taking up new courses and moving to a new environment.  If the money they require has not come through the system it adds to their stress and difficulties.  I am aware of a local authority who has yet to pay a grant to a student attending Maynooth who will shortly be commencing second term.  This is an urgent problem and I am glad it was raised by Fine Gael in Private Members' Time.  It deserves much consideration.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk about introducing a free fee scheme for third level education and that should be pursued. Irish students are an exception in the EU in regard to grant payments.  The strongest argument against the introduction of free fees centres is on the principle of fair distribution of resources or the attitude that they should pay if they can afford it.  In reality those who would derive most benefit from free fees would be middle income earners in the PAYE sector.  I am sure those on the Government side recognise that that group are the ones losing out in that regard.</P>
    <P>Presumptions are made about families that are no longer tenable in all cases, namely, that the parental home is also the residence of the student and that parents will subsidise and help their offspring during his or her time at college.  We are all aware of cases, whether through estrangement, marital breakdown, alcoholism or whatever, where students do not have that type of support and assistance, but yet may have the ambition to attend third level education.  Such persons may not have the normal family supports that others enjoy.  We should not ignore their plight.  We should consider introducing localised grant and financial assistance appeal bodies which would consider individual cases and make a decision on grant eligibility.  In that way, the factors surrounding students might have some bearing.  The restriction in respect of the 15 mile limit sets an arbitrary line, whereas in reality every family's requirements are different. <Col N="806" /> The rigid regulations in regard to, for example, the means test and 15 mile limit do not take account of the manner in which some families are burdened with individual problems which are not the norm for every family.</P>
    <P>Let us take the example of students with children.  I am struck by the number of lone parents with a child of one or two years who are determined to take up third level education.  Such lone parents increasingly get a great deal of flak and criticism and are frequently branded as spongers and irresponsible people who should not receive any money from the State.  Those trying to break out of that trap are the ones finding it most difficult. It must be recognised that lone parents are frequently literally alone.  In some cases because they have a child they cannot live at home and they do not have the support to care for themselves and their child and go on to third level education which would release them from the depedency trap and enable them get employment or create employment for themselves.  That is a real phenomenon and it would be foolish to pretend otherwise. We should encourage such young women in particular to create a life for themselves and their child through taking up third level education if they have the intelligence to do so.  In the long term that would mean they would not be dependent on the State.</P>
    <P>There is a cost to third level education which has nothing to do with fees or travel; it concerns the daily existence associated with having a young person who is not contributing at home.  Everybody who has teenage children is aware that they cost money, and this is an additional cost which some families cannot afford.  Those who fare worst are the unemployed.  It is ludicrous to expect a family who cannot even make ends meet to spend more than one-third of their annual income educating one of their offspring.  It is small wonder that those from unemployment backgrounds should be so under-represented in third level education.  How often has the point been made that it is important for parents to instill in their offspring the belief that <Col N="807" /> they can go to college?  Whenever ideas on improving participation in third level education among lower income groups are exchanged that opinion is usually expressed.  Their is a basis for believing that parents who have not gone to college are less likely to encourage their children to do so.  However, a fundamental question remains unanswered.  Even if a positive attitude towards an ability to attend college exists, at the end of the day affordability will be the main barrier.  If people cannot afford to pay college bills, no amount of encouragement would change the position.</P>
    <P>From 1984 to 1990 there was an overall reduction in the numbers of students attending college from unskilled manual, semi skilled manual, intermediate non-manual and agricultural workers.  That is a matter of great concern.  I am aware of the argument about who will pay for a free system that will enable more people take up third level education.</P>
    <P>There is one sector in society which benefits enormously, that is the business and commercial sector.  This sector benefits automatically and it would be no harm if it was asked to pay in some way. There is no reason this could not be done if there was the political will to do so. Many poor and unemployed people could thus be liberated and enabled to realise their full potential.</P>
    <P>Donogh O'Malley opened the door to second level education because he found himself in a position where he could make a difference.  He transformed the position in relation to the right of access to second level education regardless of a person's background.  We need to move on and do the same in regard to third level education. We need to open the door for those who cannot afford to attend third level education courses but who have the right to equal access along with the better off.</P>

Many of those suggestions would find favour with me, having been a member of a local authority for 18 years and of a higher education grants committee.</P>
      <P>I reiterate, on behalf of the Government, that we are committed to the development of a reformed and comprehensive student support system for students at third level.  This is in accordance with the commitment in the Programme for Government, in the interest of justice and equity, to widen acces to third level education generally and to remove barriers to access that may exist at present for certain disadvantaged groups.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister is giving careful consideration to the report of the expert advisory group and that she intends to publish the report by February next at the latest.  I look forward with interest to the recommendations of the group as it comprised acknowledged experts on the following important issues in the student grants system: the question of the definition of income for tax purposes; participation rates by different socio-economic groups in higher education and the significant role that improved access to higher education can play in combating disadvantage for both individuals and communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also welcome the Minister's commitment to continued urgent action with a view to putting in place simpler and more efficient organisational arrangements for the delivery of the grants service to students.  While I acknowledge that solid progress was made in that regard in 1993 I, in common with Deputies on all sides of this House, am well aware of the difficulties still being experienced by students and parents in this area.  This has also been highlighted in the media.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has made it her major priority for 1994 to ensure that the specimen <Col N="809" /> scheme and related documentation issue on or before 1 May so as to provide students with a more timely and enhanced service, including earlier payment of grants.</P>
    <P>The Minister rightly identified the extremely cumbersome nature of the present system as the source of the problem. The fact is that three separate schemes developed on a largely <i>ad hoc</i> basis over a considerable period of time. There is an unbelievably large number of bodies involved in administering the schemes and this has, undoubtedly, contributed to inefficiency and confusion. Clearly, an operation of this size and complexity must be reformed in a systematic and coherent way and the report of the expert advisory group will provide the basis on which to do this.</P>
    <P>I want to respond briefly on some of the issues raised by Opposition speakers. On the question of the late issue of the 1993 scheme documentation, I would accept that the comparatively late issue this year may have contributed in some instances to delays in grant payments. This was, unfortunately, a consequence of the major revamping which took place of the documentation relating to the schemes.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the complexity of the 1993 application form and notes. They are daunting documents, but we must remember that the complexity of these documents is largely unavoidable and arises in no small measure from the conditions of the scheme in relation to what is defined as reckonable income for grant purposes.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that there had been a perception for many years that persons were obtaining grants who should not in equity be receiving them. This point was made several times tonight.  As a result there has been persistent pressure for the introduction of more transparency and equity in income assessment procedures.</P>
    <P>More rigorous procedures linked to the tax assessment process and with greater involvement of the Revenue Commissioners to ensure a full return of income from all sources were put in place <Col N="810" /> in 1993.  As experience had shown that there were many combinations of income sources, all possible sources had to be provided for in a comprehensive application form.</P>
    <P>We know that the new application form was excellent in 1993 because local authorities and vocational education committees have told us so.  In previous years forms had to be returned to applicants with income queries two, three or even four times.  This was not, generally speaking, a problem in 1993.</P>
    <P>Reference was also made to the very detailed nature of the application form notes and the checklist of 42 items.  Of the 27 items with notes, all but five items are related to aspects of reckonable income for means-testing purposes.  Most of the reckonable income notes concern the self-employed only whose income affairs are generally dealt with by professional accountants.  Accordingly, specialist information of an accounting nature is included with the object of assisting accountants preparing grant applications from the self-employed. Despite adverse media reaction to those notes, local authorities and vocational education committees have found that they solved many problems for them in 1993.  Similarly, the checklist is set out clearly as a full listing covering all circumstances &mdash; nobody suggested that all items arise in any one single case.</P>
    <P>On the positive side, therefore, as regards 1993 the feedback which the Department received from local authorities and vocational education committees on the revamped 1993 documentation was that overall it certainly speeded up the processing of grant applications.</P>
    <P>As regards the timing of grant payments, the suggestion was also made that the students themselves and their needs were regarded as being of minor importance. I want to refute that suggestion, even though I accept that the standard of service falls far short of what is desirable. As the Minister indicated, we are working to have the standard of service improved as a matter of urgency.  This will be achieved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="811" /> A number of other matters were raised and these have been noted.  In conclusion. I welcome the major improvements implemented in the student support system in 1992 and 1993.  I would not deny, however, that much more needs to be done.  I also welcome the Minister's commitment to continue this process as a priority in 1994.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that 14 Deputies, apart from the Minister and Minister of State, contributed to this debate shows the importance that Members on all sides of the House attach to this matter.  I thank them for their contributions.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ahearn highlighted the need to recoup the amount due to local authorities earlier and cited as an example her own local authority in South Tipperary which had to pay £100,000 in interest. Deputies Broughan and Costello showed their versatility by rambling into the area of first and second level education. However, they proved to be good spear carriers for the Minister.</P>
      <P>Deputy Keogh offered the full support of the Progressive Democrats and highlighted the anomalies in the system. Deputies Browne and McGrath showed, because of the fact that regional technical colleges are located in their constituencies, that they are sensitive to the needs of students.  Deputy McGrath argued the case for farmers but I should make the point that we wish to level the playing pitch for everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Coughlan mentioned that there was a need to increase the thresholds. The point we are trying to make is, because there are anomalies and inequities in the system, no matter how much we increase the thresholds it will not work as the scheme is based on gross rather than net income.  Mortgage repayments and medical bills are not taken into account.  Increasing the thresholds will not solve the problem.  I agree that we should extend the maintenance grants scheme to cover students overseas. Indeed, four months ago Fine Gael tabled a motion in this House but the <Col N="812" /> opposite side of the House voted against it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne asked where would the money come from.  There is no money involved; it involves a simple administrative procedure whereby the calendar would be rolled back by four months and the forms would be sent out on time.  It is obvious that the Deputy did not read the text of the motion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Batt O'Keeffe made an extremely good contribution in which he highlighted the need for equity in relation to certain socio-economic groupings. This point was also made by Deputy McManus.  The figures published yesterday show that the PAYE sector is very heavily discriminated against.</P>
    <P>Deputy Martin accused Fine Gael of being over-conservative in drafting the motion.  It was a clear simple prescriptive motion which means much to thousands of students.  The motion is before the House for consideration.  When we produced radical proposals to ease the burden on the PAYE sector, Deputy Martin was one of the first to vote against them.  He adopted a similar attitude in relation to the ESF grants, the income tax allowance and the anomalies in the PAYE sector.  He and his colleagues voted against them.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom aontú leis an Teachta Éamon Ó Cuív agus aontaím go hiomlán gur thug an t-iar Aire Séamus Brennan a lán feabhais isteach go mór mhór ó thaobh teorainneacha ioncaim ach ag an am céanna ní dhearna sé morán athruithe.</P>
    <P>I wish to thank Deputy McManus for her short but extremely comprehensive treatment of the motion and for her support. I wish to thank the Minister of State, Deputy Aylward, for agreeing to the changes proposed in the Fine Gael motion.  We asked the Minister to ensure that all local authorities and vocational education committees make the higher education grant application form available from the month of April so that in future processing can be completed and first payments made to all qualifying students without exception on the commencement of college.  In her response to the motion last night the Minister <Col N="813" /> relented.  She said: &ldquo;My major priority for 1994 in relation to the administration arrangements will be to ensure that the specimen scheme and related documentation issue on or before 1 May to ensure a more timely and enhanced service is made available to students and that grant payments, as a result, will issue in good time.&rdquo; That is what we sought in our Private Members' motion and that is what we now propose.  We will not argue about the fact that &ldquo;before 1 May&rdquo; actually means April which is what the motion seeks.</P>

      <P>Had the Minister accepted the motion in toto and resisted the temptation to table a rather bland amendment, the entire affair could have been agreed and wrapped up last night and the Minister would have been free to go to the Labour Party Christmas party earlier.  As we demonstrated last night, it is a simple workable prescription to streamline the administration of the higher education grants scheme, to speed up payment and ensure that much of the hardship that is part and parcel of a student's life, waiting weeks on end for the first cheque to arrive, is eliminated.</P>
      <P>There is now no reason application forms should not be processed and finalised by September.  Each student should know whether he or she is eligible for a grant and payments of first instalments should be made to each student within the first week or two of commencement of college.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been pressing for an overhaul of the higher education grants scheme for the past three years.  Last night the Minister advised the House that she has been in possession of the report from the expert advisory group for a number of weeks and that the report will be published in February together with recommendations for change.  The changes will have to be major and far reaching.  Unless they root out the basic inequities and injustices of the current higher education <Col N="814" /> grants scheme the exercise will have been futile.</P>
    <P>I received a letter from a lady in Tipperary, the Minister's constituency, who has three children.  Her husband had an income of £18,000 a year when the first child entered university three years ago. He was over the income limit to qualify for a grant and had to fork out full fees and maintenance which cost just under £5,000.  When their second child sat for the leaving certificate two years ago he was still outside the income threshold.  In order to send this child to college the mother had to return to work.  She earns £8,000 per annum bringing the total family income to £26,000.  To any independent observer that looks like a nice substantial sum, that is, until one looks at a breakdown of the income.  Income tax in this case amounts to £5,300 which leaves £20,700; PRSI and levies amount to £1,200 leaving £19,500 and the £40,000 mortgage on their home costs £4,100 a year to service.  That reduces the £26,000 to £15,400.  The couple then face the real &ldquo;biggy&rdquo;, £8,700 for college fees &mdash; and that is a conservative figure &mdash; and maintaining two children in college.  The £26,000 has, at this stage, dwindled to a mere £6,700.  The couple do not qualify for a medical card because, like so many other entitlements, eligibility for medical cards is based on gross rather than net income.  They have to settle for the lowest level of cover in the VHI, Plan A, which costs £463.33.  The gross income of £26,000 is now down to a net figure of £6,237.  One does not need to be a mathematician or use a calculator to see that that amounts to a mere £119.94 per week. In five major swoops the £26,000 has whittled away to a bare subsistence level of existence.  One could not exist on that income.  That is the lot of thousands of middle income families today.</P>
    <P>This family, with an income of £26,000 from the husband and wife going out to work on a daily basis in order to educate their children, would be better off on the dole.  On unemployment assistance they would not have to work and would receive £123.10 per week.  By going out to work they are losing £3.16 a week. <Col N="815" /> Indeed, they are losing more because if they were on unemployment assistance they would qualify for full medical cover under the medical card scheme; they would get a free fuel allowance of £5 a week during the winter months; the children at primary school would qualify for the footwear and clothing allowance and, most important of all, they would qualify for full fees and full maintenance at third level.</P>
    <P>As was pointed out, this system is riddled with inequities and anomalies.  It was not today or yesterday that they occurred.  Last night the Minister almost went back to the Battle of the Boyne telling us about the evolution of the higher education grant scheme.  It is amazing that as the scheme evolved, instead of the anomalies being ironed out, they became more ingrained as various rules and regulations were added on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  Changes have taken place but these are minor and were carried out mainly on the fringes of the scheme.  The root and branch reform has not taken place.  It will have to.  That is why we hope that when this advisory group reports, there will be a total review of the scheme.  Unless this happens the whole exercise will have been in vain.</P>
    <P>What comes across forcibly in this letter, and in numerous other letters <Col N="816" /> received, is that jobs are being held down by people who would gladly forego them but they simply cannot afford to do so. They must go out to work to educate their children.  The lady who wrote this letter readily admits that the only reason she goes out to work is to put their children through college.  She would have stayed at home otherwise.  There are hundreds of people who would long since have retired but they must continue working beyond normal retirement age to pay back the money borrowed remortgaging their houses to educate their children. Additional jobs are lost because parents who normally would not bother are forced to work overtime in order to educate their children.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's announcement that she has accepted our proposal and there will be general acclaim for it, but I regret she did not follow the example given two weeks ago by her colleague, Minister Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, in accepting a Fine Gael Bill in toto in this House.  Last night and tonight was another test of Labour's so-called adherence to openness, transparency and receptivity but, then, these buzz-words are fast becoming mere memories.  I thank Members who contributed and promised their support.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 38, after &ldquo;£175,000,000.&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;The Minister shall satisfy himself that all competition rules both domestic and of the European Union are observed by the Holding Company and all its subsidiaries.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This topic was referred to on Committee Stage and I thought it was appropriate to put down this amendment on Report Stage.  It is evident to anybody looking at the matter even half objectively that there has not been observance of the competition rules, either domestic or of the European Union, in respect of some activities of what is called in this Bill the holding company, or Aer Lingus, as it has been known up to now.  I gave some examples in this respect on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it very difficult to accept that there is such an extraordinary disparity in air fares between Ireland and Britain. It is possible to get a £59 return fare with any of the companies flying the Dublin-London routes.  That fare was originally <Col N="819" /> set by a privately-owned airline and it was immediately followed by Aer Lingus. A significant proportion of the people who travel on that route are happily able to avail of that fare, which has been of enormous benefit to consumers.  As I demonstrated yesterday, it has led to a considerable increase in the number of passengers using the route and a substantial increase in the number of people visiting this country who would not otherwise do so.  To that extent it is very welcome.</P>
    <P>If we contrast the Dublin-London fare with the Dublin-Bristol fare &mdash; I need hardly point out that Bristol is more than 100 miles nearer to Dublin than is London &mdash; incredibly the lowest fare that can be obtained on the Dublin-Bristol route is £175 and in some cases it is substantially greater.  Similarly, the fare on the Dublin-Glasgow route is many times that on the Dublin-London route, even though the distance from Dublin to Glasgow is approximately the same as that from Dublin to London.  Because there is competition on the Dublin-Liverpool route the fare in that case is low. However, on other routes such as Bristol and Glasgow where there is no competition, the fares are very high.  In fact, at one stage when Ryanair was flying to Glasgow but not to Edinburgh, the Aer Lingus fare to Edinburgh was on average more than double the fare to Glasgow even though the two cities are only a very short distance apart.  It was perfectly evident why this was so &mdash; Aer Lingus responds to competition on the routes between Britain and Ireland.  Even though its cost structure is very much higher than that of either of its present main competitors and it must inevitably lose money, it persists in doing this.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage the Minister gave the impression that that sort of non-commercial activity would not happen in the future.  I asked him &mdash; I think quite relevantly &mdash; why if he disapproves of this activity for the future, does he approve of it at present?  If this kind of activity will be wrong in the future it must be wrong now.  The Bill will give the Minister <Col N="820" /> greater controls in this respect.  He told us today that semi-State companies would do his bidding and that was it. I again invite the Minister to consider whether something which hopefully he will forbid in the future should be allowed to happen now.</P>
    <P>Of course, the purpose of the very low fares charged by Aer Lingus, which has a very high cost structure and which will inevitably suffer losses, is to get rid of its competitors on these routes.  Aer Lingus has succeeded in getting rid of some of its competitors in the past and others left by agreement when the cartel broke down.  However, it is not acceptable to the European Union or Commission that companies would operate in that way.  In particular, it is not acceptable for a semi-State company to deliberately incur losses in order to try to force a private unsubsidised competitor out of the marketplace. This practice is illegal.  In some countries this kind of anti-competitive activity is not just against the civil law but is a criminal offence and people can end up in jail for engaging in it.  That is not the case in this country.  But if some countries feel so strongly about it that they take steps to deal with it under their criminal law, then obviously there must be something very seriously wrong with it.  Therefore, it seems to be entirely wrong that, after an investment of £175 million of taxpayers money, there should be any question of Aer Lingus being allowed to continue some of the dubious commercial practices in which it has engaged in the past.  I have proposed the inclusion of this amendment in the Bill to make it abundantly clear that those kind of practices cannot be allowed to happen in the future.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the Irish-British routes, and the same principle applies to flights to and from provincial airports within Ireland.  The House will recall that for a number of years Aer Lingus was not prepared to provide flights from certain provincial airports, but once Ryanair started to provide flights from Knock and a number of other provincial airports suddenly Aer Lingus, which had said it was not economic to provide such flights, started <Col N="821" /> to provide flights from Knock airport in direct competition with Ryanair. When Ryanair reduced its fares, which it felt it could do, Aer Lingus also reduced its fares.  While Ryanair provided direct flights from provincial airports to airports in Britain, Aer Lingus, through Aer Lingus Commuter, provided flights for £10 from provincial airports to Dublin, provided the passenger was taking an Aer Lingus flight to Britain after that.  The economic cost of a flight from any provincial airport in Ireland to Dublin is clearly very much more than £10 and obviously Aer Lingus's competitor could not survive on that basis &mdash; Aer Lingus could survive because the taxpayer was picking up the tab.  As a result Aer Lingus's competitor had to pull out of that market.  Of course, once it pulled out the Aer Lingus fares shot up.</P>
    <P>It is worth contrasting the £10 fare charged on this add-on basis by Aer Lingus from places like Galway and Knock with its return fare of £55 from Dublin to Shannon, a route on which it says it does not make much money. Shannon is approximately the same distance from Dublin as the other provincial airports &mdash; if anything, Shannon may be marginally further from Dublin.  If Aer Lingus cannot make any significant money on a £55 fare how can it claim it is doing anything other than deliberately losing large sums of money on a £10 fare for the same distance?</P>
    <P>These practices are well known, but they have been condoned and tolerated for a long time.  Like many other people who want to see a situation in air services other than one of total monopoly, I am anxious that those kind of practices should not be allowed to continue.  The taxpayer should not in the future have to come to the aid of an airline which deliberately runs up losses because it is paranoid about trying to get rid of its competitors.</P>
    <P>It is sad that this is the position.  I made a similar argument in 1984-85 when we had experience of another Irish private airline, Avair, being put out of business. Happily, this airline has been very successful <Col N="822" /> since outside Ireland, where, unfortunately, it was unable to survive. At that time I was very anxious to ensure that if another private Irish airline appeared on the scene it would not go the way of Avair.  Ryanair has managed to survive through very difficult times because somebody associated with the main shareholders was able to carry the losses.  However, I do not think that man will be available to do that should losses be incurred again in the future.  Therefore, it is vital that that airline does not incur substantial losses again, which or course it is not anxious to do.</P>
    <P>The examples I have given &mdash; I could give many other examples &mdash; make it clear that it is vital for the Minister to satisfy himself that competition rules are observed.  The Minister may well reply that competition rules are part of the law, either of the land or of the European Union, and therefore we do not need to include such a rule in an Act to make it law again.  The purpose of including such a rule in legislation is to draw attention to the fact that it exists and, in particular, to put an obligation on the Minister to ensure that the laws are observed.  Those laws are not dreamed up just for the sake of regulation, they are for a good public policy purpose and for the benefit of the consumer.  Where any predatory company, whether an airline or other business, succeeds by using its strength and its State subsidy to put competitors out of business, the inevitable outcome is that as soon as the competitors disappear, fares rocket upwards.  That has happened several times; it happened every time a competitor went out of business on a particular route and the consumer was then held up to ransom.  That is unacceptable and it should not have been tolerated.  Over the past number of years in particular I expressed strong objection to it on a number of occasions.  I have been heavily criticised by Aer Lingus for doing so and I am held up by the senior management and its staff as someone who was trying to harm the company instead of doing it good.  We are told that anything Aer Lingus does, is, by <Col N="823" /> definition, right and that virtually it can do no wrong.</P>
    <P>I hope we do not return to the bad old days prior to 1986 when aviation policy in this country was largely dominated by Aer Lingus.  I hope we have entered a better era than that of the 80s and I hope, by the acceptance of this amendment, the Minister will show that he is determined to ensure that fair play, both for competitors and, most importantly, for consumers, is maintained here and that the status of the State and access to taxpayers money of any one company will not be allowed to act to the detriment of the consumer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I have disagreed with Deputy O'Malley in regard to all of his amendments so far.  In his amendments &mdash; and I have examined them all &mdash; he is questioning the bona fides of Aer Lingus. He seems to be constantly sniping at Aer Lingus.  None of his amendments are of a positive nature, they are all of a restrictive or questioning nature and seek to impose restrictions on Aer Lingus as though Aer Lingus alone is a player in the market place which seems to engage in dubious practices.</P>
      <P>This seems to be an unnecessary amendment.  As Deputy O'Malley will be aware, we are party to the Treaty of Rome and the Maastricht Treaty and we are bound by whatever laws emanate in relation to competition from the European Union and we must enshrine them in our domestic law.  Indeed, if this superfluous amendment was to be worded in a proper competition style, in addition to the words &ldquo;The Minister shall satisfy himself that all competition rules both domestic and of the European Union are observed by the holding company and all its subsidiaries&rdquo;, it should have included the words &ldquo;and by its competitors.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley seems to be expressing a rather jaundiced view of Aer Lingus in all his amendments and in the context of what we are seeking to do here today they are not very helpful.  The purpose of this Bill is to increase the competitiveness <Col N="824" /> of Aer Lingus and to streamline it in order to ensure that any failings in the structure and representation of the boards are eliminated.  In regard to the management there have been certain failings on its part in looking towards the future, in planning ahead and certain decisions that were taken were not in the best interests of the future of Aer Lingus. However, that is no reason to suggest that in some way Aer Lingus is a questionable operation.</P>
    <P>In the past competitors of Aer Lingus whether of a State or private nature, have been bankrolled by various funding.  The nature of the market place is that competitors must determine their own strengths.  The same can be said in a corporate capacity and whether one is talking about the private or the State sector the tendency has been to go towards monopoly.  That takes place in the private and the public sector.  Essentially, the European Union is saying that we cannot have monopolies, whether they are of a State or private nature. We are abiding by that and we have a favourable record of being good Europeans.</P>
    <P>This amendment is unnecessary.  It very much questions the integrity of Aer Lingus and suggests that the Minister should be more concerned with ensuring that Aer Lingus is kept on a firm rein in relation to competition rather than ensuring that there is transparency and accountability.  I would like to see decisions being taken that are in the best interests of Aer Lingus.  This amendment does nothing to improve the position in the provisions that it seeks to amend.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick-East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick-East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick-East):</i> When we examine the problem of air fares, we should set it in the context of what is happening internationally.  It is beyond question that internationally there is more airline capacity than there are passengers willing to pay the economic fare to travel the routes.  There was a huge increase in air travel in the 80s and the capacity of airline companies was increased to match that.  Deregulation was introduced in the United States, the <Col N="825" /> first phase of which involved new companies being set up to compete with the traditional companies and additional capacity was also provided.  Then the Gulf War broke out and resulted in a downturn in aviation travel and internationally there was an enormous over-capacity. That was evident here when Aer Lingus purchased two modern aircraft to fly the Los Angeles route.  A change in policy took place and despite the fact that the company was paying $750,000 per month in leasing charges, the aircraft were left on the runway at Dublin Airport because neither Aer Lingus nor any other company had any use for them.</P>
      <P>We have all seen photographs of areas in the outback of the United States which had airstrips in deserts lined with aircraft surplus to need.  Attempts are made by various airlines, when the high season is finished here and tourism is finished in Europe to lease their aircraft in the southern hemisphere to coincide with the high season there.  Air companies have responded, as any company will respond, by slashing fares and becoming highly competitive.  Internationally they have become involved in a low cost fare war. It is the seats at the front of the aircraft that pay for the aircraft and if sufficient business seats are not sold, aircraft will not fly competitively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the background against which we are examining all these things.  While the Aer Lingus record has been very bad over the past four or five years &mdash; and I have been as critical as anybody else of Aer Lingus &mdash; it is important to set it within the context of international aviation. The freedom of the skies, lauded so much in the early stages of Ronald Reagan's presidency, has ended up with the airlines of the US incurring combined losses in excess of $4 billion in the last four or five years.  There is also gross over capacity there.  I saw figures recently of, I think, 22 airline companies which closed down last year in the United States and another 26 which set up.  This is happening in Europe as well.  It is understandable, when the business is so competitive, that fares will be slashed on <Col N="826" /> competitive routes, because everybody is vying for the market.  If a carrier has a monopoly on a particular route, they will charge the economic fare, or a little more &mdash; whatever the market will hold.</P>
    <P>On the Dublin/London route what Aer Lingus tried to do was unconscionable. Not alone did they sell everything below cost but wrecked their own company in the process.  They did provide a very good service and very cheap fares for a long time, together with their competitors, Ryanair, British Midland and some others who had been plying the route at an earlier date.</P>
    <P>It is not merely competition between airline companies that is the cause of the problems.  If one looks at the B &amp; I Line, one discovers a huge transfer of business from the ferries to Dublin Airport when air fares went below a certain point.  Traffic was increasing at the airport but simultaneously reducing on the ferries. Overall more passengers were brought into the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley is right that the fares charged by Aer Lingus from the regional airports into Dublin are high; for example, £55 from Shannon.  Iarnroíd Éireann intend running trains from Cork to Dublin in two and a quarter hours from May next when they obtain their new locomotives.  If they maintain their fares they will be providing a service from the centre of Cork city to the centre of Dublin in a shorter time than it would be possible to fly the same route.  That competition will have an effect on Aer Lingus charges on that route.</P>
    <P>I have great sympathy with Deputy O'Malley's amendment.  I would support it because of the way in which Aer Lingus behaved in the past and because of the fears expressed by competitors that, unless their activities are absolutely transparent, they will behave in the same manner in the future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello questioned the drafting of the amendment, contending that it should apply to competitors as well.  We have to remember the circumstances in which we are debating this Bill.  Committee Stage finished at 7 o'clock.  This is a new amendment which Deputy O'Malley <Col N="827" /> had to submit between 7 and 7.30 p.m.  It was not subject to great scrutiny. The intention is quite clear.  If the Minister favours the principle it is easy to amend it to make it technically compatible with the Bill and take into account Deputy Costello's concerns.</P>
    <P>To say that the principle of the amendment is already enshrined in domestic legislation and in the Treaty of Rome does not fully meet the point.  That is true, but the amendment places a statutory onus on the Minister to satisfy himself that all competition rules, both domestic and European, are observed. That is totally different from the <i>status quo.</i> It would be up to an aggrieved individual or company to process the case, either in terms of domestic or European law, to vindicate the position.  This amendment actually places an onus on the Minister to vindicate the position on behalf of the travelling public in the first instance and, in the second, on behalf of competitors.  I consider it to be a good amendment.  The Minister is taking quite a number of powers to ensure the transparency of the company, by way of reporting systems, requesting a statement of accounts, ensuring there is an amendment to the memorandum and articles of association of the company.</P>
    <P>The provision of this amendment would require the Minister to satisfy himself that all competition rules, both domestic and of the European Union, are observed both by the company and its subsidiaries.  It is totally in line with the way the Minister is going in the Bill.  I support the provisions in respect of Aer Lingus, but it is unjustified to apply the same criteria to Aer Rianta.  If the Minister is really interested in ensuring that he and his successors have authority to ensure the transparency of Aer Lingus and its subsidiaries, he needs to enshrine in the Bill an amendment along these lines.  If the Minister incorporates this in the Bill, the possibility of the Commission attaching more onerous conditions to the £175 million equity will lessen because they will see that he is enshrining in domestic legislation a provision <Col N="828" /> whereby there is an onus on the Minister of the day to satisfy himself that the primary conditions of domestic law and of the Treaty of Rome are complied with.</P>
    <P>I would certainly support this amendment. I congratulate Deputy O'Malley on having produced it so quickly, taking into account that Report Stage followed so soon after the conclusion of Committee Stage and the fact that the primary business of the House today was the statements on the Joint Declaration on Northern Ireland.  Against that background it is a very fine amendment.  I would ask the Minister to consider it very carefully.  I think it would be helpful to his case in Brussels.  Certainly it would strengthen his ability to ensure the transparency of the holding company and of subsidiary companies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Aer Lingus companies will have commercial freedom and a commercial mandate.  The European Commission has a regulatory role and aggrieved competitors can seek redress should there be any predatory pricing on the part of Aer Lingus.  I would suggest that that will not be the case.</P>
      <P>I have outlined on a number of occasions that what is important here is the yield rather than the market share exclusively.  What we have to ensure is that the yield is right.  There is no point in having a larger market share and not making money.  What one seeks to do is maintain one's market share and expand it if one can but the important bottom line is one's yield.  It is essential to make money on one's routes in order to survive commercially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the new management took over, if one looks at the Dublin/London route, for example, one finds they have been increasing their yields.  It was Aer Lingus who moved up prices a little in order to improve their yield.  This was not followed up in the case of Ryanair or British Midland.  The average Aer Lingus yields on the Dublin/London routes are much higher than those of Ryanair or British Midland.  The suggestion that Aer Lingus is involved in a cut price operation <Col N="829" /> for the purposes of being anti-competitive or predatory does not stand up.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not here to go over old ground or examine the fares policy in the past.  Anybody looking at the overall position will realise that the fares policy was such that there were losses on practically all routes, the major problem being that the cost base of the company was so high.  Their fares were not much different from those of their competitors but the costs incurred by the company meant that the yield was non-existent on those routes.  The issue is being addressed.  You cannot take as much as £50 million costs annually out of a company and say that by continuing with a slightly different fares policy that in some way the old habits will remain.  If the cost base is correct then the yields will be such that you will be in a far more competitive position.  Everybody in Ireland, including Aer Lingus, is subject to EC competition rules.  These rules are in the EC Treaty and are also enshrined in domestic legislation in the Competition Act.  While I understand the reason the amendment has been tabled and the discussion which has taken place, it would be superfluous to insert this amendment, given the legislative arrangements already existing in domestic law as well as the EC Treaty requirements as outlined on Committee Stage.  On that basis I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fares policy of Aer Lingus in the future would be to improve yields rather than as in the past have an obsession exclusively in terms of market share <Col N="830" /> which meant there were losses on all routes due to the cost base in the company. That matter has now been addressed and even this year yields have improved.  Because of the changed fares policy on the London route those yields will further improve, due to the cost base reductions which have been agreed and negotiated in the company recently.</P>

      <P>Obviously, the Holy Ghost has not reached Upper Kildare Street yet.  If he gets a nice predatory fare from a State owned airline he may very well make it.  The reply the Minister gave was the one I forecast.  I know something about both domestic competition law and European Union competition law.  The great drawback in regard to both is that it is terribly difficult, long winded and expensive to enforce your rights under either.  It can take several years and it costs a huge sum of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the criticisms made in this House in 1991, when I introduced the Bill which subsequently became the Competition Act, 1991, was that it was self enforcing and was not enforced by the Minister.  I acknowledged at the time that there was a problem in making it self enforcing because individuals and small companies would find it difficult to take on some big companies.  In particular <Col N="831" /> they would find it very difficult, if not impossible, to take on any company owned by the State which could fall back on the taxpayer.  I could not do anything about it at the time because we could not have afforded the enforcement mechanism that would have been needed generally under the Competition Act to cover every sphere of commercial activity.  This side of the House strongly urged that the Act be enforced not by individual people and companies who were aggrieved and damaged and suffered loss but by the Minister.  I could not do it for that reason.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that he should do it here under this Bill because he is being asked to do it only in respect of one narrow field.  There are only three companies trading in Ireland to the public at large at retail level: Aer Lingus, British Midland and Ryanair.  There are small companies from whom one can hire planes but I would not call that retail level to the consumer.  Therefore, he does not need a big staff to do this.  In fact, one of his existing staff can do it in their spare time.  I would urge him very strongly to do it.</P>
    <P>I have to confess that one of the weaknesses of the Competition Act, 1991, is the very point made to me in the House that because it is self enforcing and not enforced by the Minister, it is not used very much and, therefore, it is not nearly as strong or as powerful as it should be. I have to acknowledge that that is right. I could not build up an inspectorate of dozens of people because there were too many things to watch.  Here the Minister is being asked to watch one narrow segment of the market in which there are only three players, all of whom have to publish their fares, so it is easy to do it. The Minister would be most unwise if he does not accept this amendment.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult, even for a company like Ryanair, to take enforcement proceedings either at Irish or European level under the Competition Act or under the Treaty of Rome because the cost and the delay combined for such a company is quite serious.  If it takes two years to get <Col N="832" /> such a case heard the damage that could be done to them in the meantime is enormous. They simply could not withstand the power and weight of somebody like Aer Lingus.  The Minister should take this on himself and my amendment allows him the opportunity to do so.  I would ask him to reconsider it and to satisfy himself that the rules are being observed.  He speaks with great confidence that the rules will be observed.  He could only speak with confidence about the future. If only he could speak with confidence about the present and the recent past, but he cannot because the laws of this country and of the European Union are being flagrantly broken by Aer Lingus.  I do not think they even bother to deny it any longer.  Everybody knows they are breaking them and they have been doing so for the past number of years.  As I pointed out earlier, the Irish competitor was only able to remain in business because it had somebody with deep pockets to whom it could turn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">

While he was speaking I was looking at the submission from the 54 <Col N="833" /> chambers of commerce in Ireland to the European Union on this very point.  I recommend it to Deputy Costello and others who think everything is rosy and that normal laws and so on are observed to see what is going on.  The 54 chambers of commerce in Ireland represent thousands of firms, both large and small.</P>
      <P>Deputy Costello and others think all is rosy and that the normal laws are observed, but the 54 chambers of commerce in Ireland, representing thousands of firms, large and small, are concerned at what is going on.  The very phrase that Deputy Costello used is echoed in their submission which states: &ldquo;We further doubt the bona fides of Aer Lingus&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems that the Minister has made the case for my amendment.  I think he should accept it.  It is very easy to enforce and costs nothing to implement.  It is in one of the most sensitive areas of all, but it is a very narrow field in which there are only three companies involved.  It will transform the position of Irish aviation. It is very necessary, at least until such time as we are able to change the enforcement procedures of both domestic and European Union competition law.  Some form of fast track enforcement will have to be introduced both at European and Irish level, otherwise the law which is <Col N="834" /> perfectly adequate and admirable is unenforceable.</P>
    <P>I invite the Minister to avail of the opportunity this amendment gives him to bring in a fast track enforcement procedure in respect of one narrow field of commercial activity, civil aviation.  There are only three players &mdash; in fact there is a fourth now&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 38 and 39, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Monies from this subscription shall not be expended in any subsidiary of the Holding Company unless separate accounts are kept and published for that subsidiary showing that it operates independently of all other subsidiaries.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing in that amendment which does not reflect what the Minister has said in the course of the debates on Second and Committee Stages.  Because there is nothing which conflicts with what the Minister has said, I hope he will be in a position to accept it.  Otherwise, it is a bit futile that all these amendments, which have been strongly argued, have been put down only to be rejected out of hand.  This amendment in particular does not conflict with the Minister's statements and intentions under this legislation. The Minister told us that separate accounts would have to be kept for each subsidiary and he has made provision for that in section 14.  That is a great advance because in the past the Minister was not able to get separate accounts from the various subsidiaries and some of them, such as Aer Lingus Holidays, got themselves into serious difficulty.  If the Minister receives separate accounts no doubt they will be published for people to analyse. Not alone is there no transparency as between the various subsidiaries at present but it is obvious from the limited <Col N="837" /> information available that there is cross subsidisation.</P>
    <P>I gave a number of examples of such cross subsidisation, and one other example is that of TEAM Aer Lingus which was set up two or three years ago. That company had substantial assets and a workforce of between 600 and 700. We were told it was doing well and that appeared to be the case for the first year or two.  As Minister for Industry and Commerce, I was invited to visit the plant and did so in July 1992.  I spent several hours there and was very impressed by its operations.  I asked various questions and was told the company was profitable, successful and could look forward to further expansion and profits.  At the end of 1992 or the beginning of 1993 it became evident that Aer Lingus was in serious difficulties, but many people assumed it was just the airline until it was discovered that many of the subsidiaries, including the ancillaries, were also in serious difficulties. One of the subsidiaries in serious difficulties was TEAM Aer Lingus which was losing a great deal of money and had to let go approximately 200 of its workforce.</P>
    <P>It then became evident that something I had been told one year earlier, which I did not believe because I was assured by the company there was no truth in it, was in fact correct.  TEAM Aer Lingus was charging the airline company approximately double the going rate for the work concerned and slightly more than double that which it was charging customers not connected with Aer Lingus.  That was outrageous and it dragged down the airline. Also, it deceived the public and the shareholder, but it seemed to be par for the course and nobody appeared to be upset about it.</P>
    <P>That is another example of the cross subsidisation endemic in the group.  If any practice, good or bad, is endemic in a group it is difficult to stamp it out quickly unless the shareholder, in this case the Minister for Finance, intervenes dramatically and does so with the support of the law.  My amendment would provide the Minister with that opportunity.</P>
    <P>The amendment in no way conflicts <Col N="838" /> with anything the Minister stated because he assured the House that separate accounts will be kept, that they will be published, that each subsidiary will operate independently and that there will not be any cross subsidisation in the future. However, it is necessary to provide for that in law because I am sure it is the Minister's intention that there will not be any cross subsidisation in the future and that all malpractices will cease, but unless he has the support of the law I doubt he will be successful.  This is an admirable opportunity for him to arm himself for the battle I fear is ahead in that regard.  I urge him, therefore, to accept this amendment which is on all fours with the sentiments he expressed during the debate on this Bill.</P>

      <P>I agree that will be the case, but the assumption behind the proposed subsection is that the £175 million will go towards the subsidiaries or be used to improve trading performance. That will not be the case.  The proposed equity investment will be made to the holding company only, the Aer Lingus Group, and it will be used to reduce the debt and restore the company's balance sheet to a healthy position.  It will not be used in any of the subsidiaries.  The Deputy's amendment is based on the premise that the moneys will be used in the subsidiaries for unnamed purposes, but that will not be the case.  A total of £113 million was lost in the GPA share price issue.  Even from that point of view, an equity injection would only redress the problems associated with the balance sheet of the company.  The three tranches will go to the holding company.  There is no question of a requirement to ensure transparency in respect of subsidiary company accounts in relation to the money because the subsidiaries will not be getting any of it.  The Deputy's amendment has given me the opportunity to clarify the matter, but there is no merit in it.  If money was to be put directly into some of the subsidiaries there would be some merit in the amendment.  That will not be the case and, therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>It is noteworthy that the Minister did not disagree with the principle of what I said.  He could not because he had already committed himself to that principle.  However, he will not accept the amendment on the spurious ground that the money will not be put into the subsidiaries.  In my amendment I did not state that the money will be put into the subsidiaries.  My amendment states that moneys from the subscription shall not be expended in any subsidiary. I did not refer to the investment of the money, but to its expenditure.  There may be up to 20 subsidiaries in Aer Lingus and if an investment is made in such a holding company one does not give £X million to one subsidiary, £Y million to another and a few hundred thousand pounds to the smaller subsidiaries.  That is a matter for the company.  The shareholder, in this case the Minister for Finance simply writes three cheques payable to the holding company and it is up to that company to distribute the money among its subsidiaries if it so wishes.</P>
      <P>Some of the subsidiaries may have survived all the vicissitudes of the past year or two and may not require any money.  I am not talking here about the investment of money by the Minister in subsidiaries but rather about the expenditure of money in subsidiaries&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy is equally good at both.  This amendment relates to the 5 per cent shareholding which the unions have negotiated in the current arrangements with Aer Lingus. We are seeking a guarantee that this shareholding will not fall below 5 per cent.  It is quite possible, given the way the company has been structured, that if the Government was to increase its shareholding or if a private shareholder was to invest in the companies concerned, the shareholding held by the workers could fall below 5 per cent.  As I said, we are seeking to ensure that it will not fall below this figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="842" /> This shareholding was negotiated painstakingly by the unions concerned and agreed to, along with many other painful changes in work practices, numbers and so on.  We should take steps to guarantee that this share will be maintained. It was the minimum that the workers in the company were prepared to accept in lieu of the redundancies and restrictions sought.  It is therefore incumbent on this House when dealing with this issue to guarantee that this shareholding will be maintained.  Therefore I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 5 is an enabling provision to allow for the employee shareholding as agreed between the Government, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the affiliated unions representing the employees in Aer Lingus. The agreement provided for a maximum of 5 per cent of the shares in issue to be held by employees.  As I stated, following a meeting between the Cabinet sub-committee on aviation matters and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Government announced that the question of participation by the employees in the future success of the company should be dealt with as a tangible form of recognition of the additional contribution being asked of the workforce.</P>
      <P>The employees of Aer Lingus have contributed greatly in the past in building up the airline and the Government is aware that a stronger commitment than ever before will be required from all the staff in Aer Lingus throughout the organisation. Therefore, on 17 November, agreement was reached between the Government, which was represented by myself and the Minister for Finance, and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the affiliated unions representing the employees in Aer Lingus, on an imaginative arrangement for participation by employees in the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this agreement 10 per cent of the profits before tax will be allocated to the employees so that the employees can receive the equivalent of 10 per cent of the issued share capital of the company, split 50-50 between shares and cash.  The <Col N="843" /> Government then agreed to issue 5 per cent of the shares of the company in issue to the employees up front on a partly paid up basis in return for a nominal payment. The balance of the payment for the shares will be paid out of the annual distribution of profits.  At the discretion of the employees some or all of the 5 per cent cash payment may be used to accelerate the payment of the balance of the share price.  Distribution will cease when the threshold of 10 per cent of the issued share capital has been reached.  This Bill gives effect to this agreement by providing for the employee profit-sharing scheme.</P>
    <P>As I said, 5 per cent of the shares have been allocated up front on a partly paid up basis, the balance to be paid out of the distribution of profits.  There is no question of a reduction until such time as they are paid.  The position is as I have outlined and it was agreed in detail at those negotiations on 17 November.  The Bill, as drafted, is in line with the agreement.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 5, to delete lines 34 to 48, <Col N="844" /> and in page 6, to delete lines 1 to 3 and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(3)  The terms of section 23 (as amended by the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1988), of the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1977, shall continue to apply to each of the existing companies, and shall apply to any subsidiary company established under the terms of this Act.</P>
    <P>(4)  Every person who immediately before the commencement of this Act was a director of the existing companies by virtue of the Act of 1977 and to whom section 23 (2) of that Act applies shall, notwithstanding anything contained in the Companies Act, continue to serve for the period of time for which he or she was elected.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Essentially what we are seeking is to guarantee that those who are already worker directors will continue to act as such until the term of office for which they are elected expires.  We are also seeking to ensure that worker directors may be elected to subsidiary companies of the holding company.  The current Bill seeks to provide for worker directors to the main holding company but there is no provision for directors to be elected to the subsidiary companies.</P>
    <P>I would particularly refer to the new company which has yet to be established, the Aer Lingus company which will be going to London primarily.  I urge the Minister to accept the amendment.  A number of Government Deputies are also anxious that a similar kind of amendment be accepted by the Minister.  I urge him to give serious consideration to the proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what Deputy De Rossa is seeking to do in amendment No. 6.  It is appropriate that we should have worker representation on the subsidiaries that will be formed.  At present it is proposed that there will be worker directors of the holding company only and the existing companies, Aer Lingus plc and Aerlínte, would lose their worker representatives.  We want to ensure a <Col N="845" /> greater role for the employees in the activities of the company.  Although it might not be appropriate to have full worker participation in every subsidiary &mdash; there could be a large number of subsidiaries &mdash; the principle should stand for all the subsidiaries.</P>
      <P>The Minister's amendment does not go far enough.  What he is talking about is having a representative of employees' interests.  I would have thought that every member appointed to a board would represent the interests of the employees.  It is quite a wide-ranging phraseology that is used here.  The least the Minister could do is ensure that there would be one statutory representative of employees' interests on every subsidiary to which the amendment applies and also on subsidiary companies that may be established by the Minister in due course. Certainly it is intended that one very substantial subsidiary would be established, namely Aer Lingus Express, which will ply the London-Dublin route. It would be unreasonable not to allow worker representation on the board of a major subsidiary which probably holds much of the future of Aer Lingus in its hands.  I ask the Minister to give reasonable representation of employees' interests in terms of the existing companies and of future subsidiaries.</P>

      <P>This is an historic day in many ways.  The peace agreement was reached in London.  There was agreement on the GATT negotiations and, as we come to 10.30 this evening, there is agreement on the Air Companies (Amendment) Bill, putting in place the amended Cahill strategy which it is hoped will ensure the future of Aer Lingus and the staff there.  I compliment the Minister on what he has achieved to date in conjuction with the staff and management of Aer Lingus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the pain the staff have suffered, the changes in work practices etc. that they have agreed to, I am a bit disappointed that the Bill is defective.  I am a firm believer in the concept of industrial democracy and its development.  This Bill sets up the new structures and provides <Col N="846" /> for a holding company with worker representation. Last night and today we, as Labour Party people, have done everything we can to get an accommodation. The amendment proposed by the Minister relates to section 9 (1) (a).  It refers to the existing companies.  It does not refer to subsidiaries that may be established in the future to cater for the Dublin-London express route.  The Bill provides for representation of the workforce in relation to the existing two subsidiaries, but such representation must apply also in respect of the third subsidiary referred to in the Cahill plan.</P>
    <P>How does the Minister propose to provide for such representation?  Amendment 9 (a) states, that the directors shall include a representative of the employee interests.  My preferred option would be a mechanism similar to that in CIE which provides that one of two worker directors be transferred to new subsidiary companies.  How does the Minister propose to provide for the representative of the employee interests?  Accepting that the Minister has the power to nominate a director, would such appointment take place following consultation with, for example, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, so that a mechanism could be put in place to ensure that the nominated representative had the support of the workforce?  Another Government may adopt a different approach and nominate a political representative who may not represent the employee interests.  We need a commitment from the Minister that if he is not prepared to accept the amendments, he will copperfasten and tighten up this matter.  Will he indicate how he would address the problem associated with the Dublin-London express route?</P>

      <P>We have heard glib comments from Deputies who could be termed spokespersons for British Midland who made a case for that company. The Aer Lingus holding company is effectively being asked to fight with one hand tied behind its back.  Aer Lingus Express and other major air transport companies which may be established <Col N="847" /> under the new holding company should play a vigorous role in developing a profitable base and future for Aer Lingus.  As my colleagues have eloquently expressed, we feel that since the workforce has already a commitment in regard to 10 per cent of the profits and 5 per cent equity, those new companies should have a representative on the board of the holding company.</P>
      <P>I agree with what my colleagues have said in relation to section 9 (1) (a).  I would prefer if the Minister's proposed amendment on employee interests included paragraph (b).  Will he indicate in what way the future development of the core air transport business could safeguard the interests of the employees as workers and shareholders in what will hopefully be a much revived and strengthened airline?  This House must take primary responsibility for that airline because of its impact on our economy, particularly the north Dublin economy.  The Government should make Aer Lingus and not a Birmingham airline its primary responsibility.</P>

      <P>Since the announcement of the Cahill plan and during the debate on Aer Lingus we were told that the restructuring plan was a package. Workers tried to negotiate their side of the deal, but the point was always stressed that the plan was a package and must be accepted as such.  That package comprised three elements: the sacrifices made by the workers in respect of the reduction in the cost base, the injection of equity and the development of new business and routes.  We must accept that package and allow Aer Lingus develop new routes and new business and expand so that its future will be secure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night I referred to the need to put as much pressure as possible on the European Commission in order that restrictions would not be placed on the injection of equity.  It is essential that Aer Lingus Express is established in the near future and given as much freedom as possible.  The workers have made sacrifices during the past year and it is essential <Col N="848" /> that they have representation on the board of the holding company.  Because the proposed new company is not covered under the Bill, it is not possible to make allowance for worker representation in that regard.  I accept the Minister has gone some way towards meeting our request to cover that position but his proposed amendment has not gone far enough.  I appeal to him to go a little further and include the provisions in subsections (1) (a) and (1) (b).  We all want Aer Lingus to survive in the future.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> There is very little time left and I do not intend to take up the last few minutes of the debate.  I hope the Aer Lingus rescue plan is a resounding success.  Its purpose is not to create some type of national monument or primarily to sustain the maximum number of good jobs, though that is important.  The purpose of a vital national air company is for it to provide a good service for the Irish people and the business community.  The ordinary travelling community and the tourist community should have a good service.  I hope there is not a return to the position already referred to, that Aer Lingus will operate on the basis of wiping out competition on particular routes.  Some of the comments made that Deputy O'Malley and I had at heart the interests of British Midland and Ryanair were unfair.  We have at heart the interest of the consumer. The consumer will get scalded unless there is competition.  We do not want a position to develop where there is no competition on the routes.  Competition is the best protection for the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding representation on boards, I am unhappy about the Minister's provisions in relation to section 9.  I tabled a number of amendments in relation to this matter.  People involved in aviation companies should know something about aviation.  The traditional method of appointing State boards here, where the first consideration was party affiliation, is not the best way to run a commercial State body or an airline company.  If there are 12 members on the board of the <Col N="849" /> holding company, including four worker directors, I am sure four of its members will have experience of the aviation industry.  I tabled an amendment which proposed that two of the eight remaining directors should also have aviation experience.  That is reasonable.  It is not enough that they may be worthy business people and have experience in other areas, some consideration must be given to the requirement of aviation experience.</P>
    <P>Under section 9 the Minister is responsible for the appointment of all members of subsidiary boards.  Up until now the board of the parent company appointed members to the boards of its subsidiaries. This provision brings the Minister's influence to a level of company activity which poses a danger to the commercial viability of the company.  I presume the hotel group of the company would appoint people interested in the hotel business.  Its primary concern would be the commercial operation of that subsidiary. It is now proposed that the ministerial appointment system will operate throughout the subsidiaries and that the members of all the boards will be appointed by the Minister.  If the Minister does not make the appointments, he can notify the chairman by giving him permission in writing to make such appointments. The chairman will be the Minister's political appointment on the board.  I am concerned about this matter and I am sorry there was not more time to discuss it.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;2.&mdash;Section 5 (4) of the Principal Act is amended by the inclusion after the word `made' where it first occurs, of the words `by the Minister or'.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is aware of my views on this matter as I elaborated on them extensively on Committee Stage.  I had hoped that before Report Stage the Minister would have accepted the arguments made to substitute the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for <Col N="851" /> the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in order to place a legal requirement on the Minister to implement the provisions of the Bill.  The Bill states that the Minister may do certain things, but that wording is unsatisfactory. I hope the Minister will at this late stage accept my amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Molloy, I made as strong an argument as possible on this matter on Committee Stage.  This Bill proposes to introduce certain measures, yet the wording states that the Minister &ldquo;may&rdquo; introduce these measures.  This is a very nondescript way of wording any Bill.  In response to my attempt to ban coursing the Minister gave a commitment to bring in certain regulations which he felt would eliminate the kill, reduce cruelty and clean up this whole murky activity, but the Bill does not state that he &ldquo;shall&rdquo; do any of these things; it states that he may do so.  The implication of this wording is that in one year's time or four years' time another Minister may undo these things.  It makes a nonsense of the Bill not to accept this amendment.  If the Minister is intent on introducing these measures he should state in the Bill that he shall bring in regulations.</P>

      <P>The purpose of amendment No. 1 is a little different from that of amendment No. 8 even though they are linked in a very obvious way.  In amendment No. 1 I propose to insert an appropriate provision in section 5 (4) of the principal Act so that regulations made by the Minister under this legislation would go through the normal parliamentary process.  That subsection provides that regulations made by Bord na gCon under the Act have to be brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas in the normal way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a lengthy discussion on this matter on Committee Stage and although the Minister went to some length explaining it the burden of his reply was that it would be nonsensical to put this provision into the Bill because the only thing the Oireachtas can do under that procedure <Col N="852" /> is accept or reject the regulations.  The Government appears to have contempt for the democratic system because on the only occasion regulations came before the House which Members wished to debate the Government would not make time available to do so.  This attitude on the Government's part makes me deeply suspicious.</P>
    <P>The purpose of my amendment is simply to apply the same procedure to regulations made by the Minister under this Bill as applies under the principal Act to regulations to be made by the board.  The Minister thinks it would be ridiculous if, having passed this Bill into law, we were to give ourselves the option of changing our minds.  He may or may not wish to maintain that argument, but that procedure is available to the House to deal with regulations of this kind.</P>
    <P>I wish, as perhaps does the Minister, although I have not heard him make this case, the House would have the option of proposing amendments to regulations rather than simply accepting or rejecting them.  That would make much more sense than the present procedure.  However, I did not hear the Minister of State, or any other member of the Government, making a proposal to that effect.  The Minister of State said he wants the regulations made by the Minister under this Bill to be put in a different and privileged category from other regulations.  None of the reasons given by the Minister on Committee Stage is sufficient for doing so.  I ask the Minister to reflect on this provision.  If the Oireachtas took the view when the principal Act was passed in 1958 that regulations made by the board should be brought before the House, what is different about the regulations to be made by the Minister?  If the Oireachtas takes the view, as it does, that this House should have the option of looking at all regulations made under legislation and either accepting or rejecting them what is so different about this Bill that this special privilege or immunity should apply to the regulations made under it?</P>
    <P>I think the Minister will agree that nothing he said on Committee Stage in <Col N="853" /> any way justifies a departure in this case from the hallowed procedure which has been laid down in this House in regard to regulations.  It is simply not good enough for the Minister to say that since the Bill will be passed anyway there is no point including in it a provision which will enable him to change his mind and decide to reject certain things.</P>
    <P>The Minister should take his courage in his hands, do the democratic thing and adhere to normal parliamentary procedures, limited as they are, and accept this amendment.  By accepting this amendment he will not damage the Bill, his personal position, the status of his Department in this great public service of ours or be neglecting any advice he may get from the Attorney General. Rather he will be doing a very small thing to maintain the principle of parliamentary democracy, which I am told his party accepts.  The Minister should not be led into rejecting this principle for the very short term, expedient reasons he gave on Committee Stage.  I invite the Minister, in all openness and frankness, to accept this amendment in the knowledge that in it there is no trap, snare, delusion or denial of anything he wants to do.  Rather he will be ensuring the proper establishment of parliamentary procedures in so far as this Bill is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made his position on amendment No. 1 clear on Committee Stage.  It appears that the only question which could be put to the House is whether the requirement that greyhounds be muzzled should be rejected.  As I understand it, that is what Deputy Dukes is seeking to do &mdash; it is the only change which can be made.  I do not think this would be the wish of anybody.  Therefore, I do not understand the reasoning behind this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to amendment No. 8, obviously some Deputies do not know about the new regulations on muzzling which have been put in place by the Irish Coursing Club since the beginning of the coursing season.  Under these regulations greyhounds have had to wear muzzles <Col N="854" /> since the end of September last.  The regulations state:</P>
    <P>The muzzling of greyhounds shall be introduced as and from the commencement of the 1993-1994 season. Greyhounds shall be muzzled in the semi-finals and finals of all stakes.  Such muzzled coursing will be monitored and the situation will be reviewed after a period of four to six weeks.</P>
    <P>A monitoring committee set up to review the use of muzzles has been very effective to date.  The regulations continue:</P>
    <P>Initially, muzzles for each greyhound will be allotted by the Control Steward on the day.</P>
    <P>The Control Steward will ensure that each greyhound is wearing its correct collar and muzzle.  These will again be checked by the Slip Steward.  In the event of any dispute with the Slip Steward regarding the collars or the fitting of the muzzle, the Control Steward shall be the final arbiter.</P>
    <P>The club shall appoint a person or persons to retrieve the muzzles from the greyhounds after each course and return them to the Control Steward.</P>
    <P>It shall be a condition of entry in each stake that greyhounds participating in the semi-finals and finals of all stakes shall be required to wear muzzles until further notice.</P>
    <P>The requirement that greyhounds wear muzzles until further notice was put forward as a result of the monitoring of their effectiveness.  On 11 November a further directive was issued to all coursing clubs by the executive committee of the Irish Coursing Club.  This directive stated that all greyhounds running in coursing trials should be muzzled and that the type of muzzle used should be to the satisfaction of the officers of the club holding such trials.  In addition, all dogs and bitches running in Derby and Oaks trial stakes would have to wear muzzles as and from the first round.  As I understand it, as and from early January it will be compulsory for dogs running in the first round of all events to wear muzzles.</P>
    <P>I do not see what more the Minister can <Col N="855" /> do at this stage to improve the position in regard to muzzling.  The muzzling of greyhounds is being monitored by a committee. It may not be necessary, having monitored the situation this season, for the Minister to introduce any regulations in regard to muzzling.  However, changes may be recommended in regard to the quality of the muzzle used and the other aspects dealt with in section 3 which amends section 36 of the principal Act.</P>
    <P>The Minister's job in regard to muzzling has been made extremely easy by the Irish Coursing Club which had the foresight to eliminate an aspect of coursing which was unacceptable to many people.  The point was made very forcibly by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, last June that it was his intention to eliminate the kill from coursing.  Many steps have been taken down this road already this year and I believe the elimination of the problems highlighted during the debate last June, and earlier this month, will enable coursing to go from strength to strength.  For that reason I do not see why we need waste any more time on this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said on Committee Stage, it is vital that the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; be included in this section so as to ensure that no questions will arise about the Minister's intentions in this regard.  While I compliment the Irish Coursing Club on the regulations it has introduced in regard to muzzling, nevertheless there are no guarantees about what will happen in the future.  Therefore it is necessary for the Minister to bring any regulations regarding muzzling before this House.  If this legislation is to have any credibility with the people who are concerned about the kill aspect in coursing, this amendment will have to be inserted.  I appeal to the Minister to accept this important amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to deal with amendment No. 8 first.  What is at issue here is whether the Minister should have any <Col N="856" /> discretion in the making of the proposed regulations.  For instance, Deputy Deenihan suggested that regulations in regard to muzzling should be introduced immediately.  I do not believe that is the proper way to approach this issue.  What is taking place in the coursing fields this year, by agreement with the Irish Coursing Club and on a voluntary basis, is experimentation with the use of muzzles. A leather muzzle was used initially which did not prove successful and a plastic muzzle is now being used.</P>
      <P>The Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry set up a monitoring committee which was represented at all coursing meetings.  As I said during the select committee meeting last week, we are independently monitoring what is taking place at coursing meetings.  At the end of the coursing season we will examine the types of muzzles that have been used, how the various veterinary controls are implemented and so on.  That is the appropriate time to draft the necessary regulations, not immediately.  Rushing legislation through this House is not beneficial; it must be carefully examined.  In many cases two minds are better than one and that is how we should proceed. I do not accept the wording &ldquo;the Minister shall immediately introduce regulations&rdquo;. Indeed, if one is using the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, it must be indicated by what date the Minister shall introduce the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>On a small point of information, if we are doing this by amendment to an Act that is already on the Statute Book, the introduction of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; means that it occurs immediately.  The obligation is already there since the Act to which the amendment is being made is already on the Statute Book.  The word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; becomes operative immediately.  That is why there is no provision in this Bill to bring the Bill into operation by a particular date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with the Deputy.  The word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; standing alone does not mean that it will be done by <Col N="857" /> 1 January or 1 February.  It does not specify&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>But if it is being done by amendment to an existing Act, &ldquo;shall&rdquo; means that it will be done now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already explained why I believe that is the inappropriate way of progressing.  I believe the Minister should have discretion and I am not convinced by the Deputy's arguments, which I have genuinely considered.  I indicated on Second Stage that this legislation was not cast in stone.  I want to get the best possible legislation through the House and through the Seanad, where this Bill will go tomorrow.</P>
      <P>I wish to point out also that most Acts passed by the Oireachtas in recent years have allowed Ministers to retain this discretion, including the Environmental Protection Agency Bill, 1992, which was championed by the present Leader of Deputy Molloy's party.  We must be consistent in what we present to the House and I see no reason on this occasion to introduce the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; rather than the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  Where, in my judgment, such regulations are necessary I can assure the House that I will act with the utmost speed to introduce them. Therefore, I cannot accept that particular amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dukes has put forward an amendment we dealt with at the select committee which essentially seeks to extend to the Minister the powers given to Bord na gCon in the 1958 Act.  I put it to Deputy Dukes that in the context of sport &mdash; some people will say coursing is not a sport, but that is not an issue we should become involved in now &mdash; it is important that there is as little outside interference as possible and that should be the case in industry also.  This Bill and the further legislation which will be introduced will provide the framework for the greyhound industry to progress. At that stage the Government will have appointed a new board that will not be in power for five years, as has been the position heretofore, but will operate on a three year basis with two places on that <Col N="858" /> board coming up for renewal each year. We must be absolutely sure that the board is working effectively because the bottom line is what can be achieved for the industry.</P>
    <P>Governments do not run sports, they do not run industry either, with the exception of some areas.  That point must be made.  Legislation goes through this House and the Seanad, a board is appointed and that board gets on with the job.  It was not envisaged in the 1958 Act that the Minister would be making regulations.  A particular difficulty arose when I came into office and had to be dealt with.  The task force had been set up by the Minister last year to deal with the three areas I mentioned previously, namely, the declining attendances at tracks, the control of the industry and coursing.  Having examined coursing thoroughly, I came to the conclusion that the problem with regard to coursing would not be solved by going from one extreme to the other; one extreme being the outright abolition of coursing and the other being to maintain the <i>status quo.</i> The eventual solution was one which I believe met the legitimate concerns of the majority of people in regard to the most unacceptable aspect of coursing, namely, the kill, and much has been achieved this year in that context.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes made the point that there should be provisions in the Dáil whereby, for instance, we could amend regulations.  I sympathise with that approach because I believe there should be accountability across the board, but I believe we are over-legislating in this regard.  Let us look at this issue in its proper context.  Some of the areas that are dealt with in regulations brought in by Bord na gCon are of great significance to the sport.  For instance, the level of levies payable by licensed bookmakers on course bets.  Bord na gCon would make regulations which would have to be presented to both Houses of the Oireachtas in respect of them.  In addition the board has the power to make regulations for the control of the training of greyhounds for reward and the power to <Col N="859" /> regulate the control of the holding and conduct of public sales of greyhounds. Those issues have a great impact on the sport generally.</P>
    <P>The Statutory Instruments Act, 1947 places an obligation on the Minister to lay any such regulations before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Therefore, it should clearly be seen that these regulations would be placed before the Houses of the Oireachtas and under the 1958 Act, we can only annul those regulations.  The Bill states that the Minister may bring in regulations.  It is pushing credibility too far to say that the Minister could make regulations that would be of such moment in terms of their unsuitability or inappropriateness that, first, if there were to be a Dáil vote on them either the Government would have to provide time or the Opposition parties or an Opposition party would have to take up the matter in Private Member's time.</P>
    <P>If there was widespread disagreement with the regulations the pragmatic thing for the Government to do would be to instruct the Minister for Agriculture of the day to amend them.  That is what would happen in practice.  If the Opposition parties, or an Opposition party, felt very strongly about the inappropriateness or otherwise of the regulations they have the option of taking appropriate action in Private Members' time.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to delay the House very much longer other than to say that I find the approach of the Minister of State astonishing, not just his refusal to accept the amendments tabled to this Bill.  I am thinking more of his rejection of the principle enshrined in the two amendments we have been discussing.  It is extraordinary that the House has before it a Bill which gives effect to the widely expressed views on greyhound racing expressed in the course of a debate in June last on greyhound racing, when the desire of the House was clearly expressed that some measures should be introduced to remove the kill in the coursing of greyhounds. The solution to that was the introduction of a requirement that all greyhounds being coursed would have to wear muzzles.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958 Bord na gCon is given very wide-ranging powers to govern the greyhound industry here and has the power to make regulations.  Those regulations must be placed before the Dáil.  Any Member of the Dáil may seek to have those regulations annulled if he or she so wishes; that is established practice in relation to many regulations.  In many cases it would be preferable if the Dáil were required to pass a motion but, if that were accepted in all cases, there would be a plethora of regulations which would take up an inordinate amount of time of the House.  The practice has been that the House has the opportunity and right, if it so decides, if it does not like or agree with the regulations, to vote against them and annul them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dukes' amendment proposes that, now with the Bill before the House giving the Minister power to make regulations with regard to the muzzling of greyhounds, the same requirement would apply to any regulations he would make, as applies under the 1958 Act to <Col N="863" /> regulations made by Bord na gCon.  It is extraordinary that the Minister is refusing that request.</P>
    <P>It is also extraordinary that the Minister is refusing the amendment tabled by Deputy Gregory and myself which seeks to insert the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; because the whole purpose of introducing this Bill was to place a requirement on the greyhound industry to make it compulsory that greyhounds should wear muzzles during coursing.  For a member of the Labour Party to tell us that the Irish Coursing Club will now introduce their own rules that greyhounds must wear muzzles is a very weak argument indeed.  Such regulations would have no legal standing, no statutory authority, they would be just an internal arrangement of the Irish Coursing Club in relation to the running of its affairs which it could just as easily change next week. The House expressed very strong views on this matter and the least the House might expect is that the Bill the Minister is asking the House to accept should require this by way of statute.  He could have these powers and use them if he so <Col N="864" /> wished.  That is an insult and it is not reflecting the desire of the House as expressed during the earlier debate.</P>
    <P>One has to question the Minister's motives in regard to this matter.  Why is the Minister so reluctant to accept the amendment?  Surely he agrees that this is merely an amendment of an existing Act and would only come into operation after the House has passed it, when the Minister so decides.  He would have his regulations, which can be amended by him at a later stage, in place by then.  The arguments he put forward are very weak and are not convincing.  Obviously, the Minister listened to these arguments at the committee but rejected them and is continuing to reject them.</P>
    <P>This is a sad indication of the Minister's and the Government's attitude to the House and to legislation.  It certainly indicates a different approach by Labour Party Members than that adopted by them in Opposition, which, is perhaps an indication of something else.  This is a retrograde step and I am disappointed that the Minister is not accepting the arguments put forward.</P>

      <P>We now come to amendment No. 2 in the name of Deputy Molloy.  I observe that amendments Nos. 3 and 4 are alternatives to amendment No. 2 and that amendments Nos. 5 and 6 are related to amendments Nos. 3 and 4.  I am suggesting, therefore, that we discuss amendments Nos. 2 to 6, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>For the information of the House, if amendment No. 2 is negatived amendments Nos. 3 and 4 cannot be moved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 2, to delete lines 12 to 18 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) (a)  The Minister shall make regulations to provide for the appointment of nine ordinary members of Bord na gCon who shall be nominated by the following bodies &mdash; Irish Coursing Club to nominate two members; Greyhound Owners Association to nominate two members; Greyhound Race-Track Managements to nominate one member; Employees' Representatives to nominate one member; Bookmakers to nominate one member; Veterinary profession to nominate one member; Minister to nominate one member.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The effect of my amendment is to introduce a section into the Bill which will make it mandatory on the Minister to give representation on the board of Bord na gCon to certain bodies which are involved at different levels in the administration of the greyhound industry.  The amendment proposes:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister shall make regulations to provide for the appointment of nine ordinary members of Bord na gCon who shall be nominated by the following bodies &mdash; Irish Coursing Club to nominate two members; Greyhound Owners Association to nominate two members; Greyhound Race-Track Managements to nominate one member; Employees' Representatives to nominate one member; Bookmakers <Col N="867" /> to nominate one member; Veterinary profession to nominate one member; Minister to nominate one member.</P>
    <P>I found the Minister's comments on the provisions for the appointment of the board members of Bord na gCon quite extraordinary.  The Greyhound Industry Act lays down provision for the appointment of its members and requires that three of them be from the executive of the Irish Coursing Club.  He said that should be changed in order to remove &ldquo;unnecessary restrictions on the Minister when appointing a new board&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In recent years the principle has been accepted by all parties in this House that when it comes to appointing people to State boards an attempt should be made to have mandatory representation on certain vocational groups where that is considered appropriate.  That has happened in the case of a wide range of bodies that have been established by statute.  It is the proposal of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to do the same thing in relation to a new horse board he is proposing to establish.</P>
    <P>I made the argument in regard to this on Committee Stage and I have reduced the number to nine to see if that would provoke a response from the Minister.  I would be happy if the Minister would indicate that he will accept the amendment but if he is going to take the stand which he took with regard to the earlier amendments, his approach will be very disappointing.  His approach contrasts with the approach taken by the other Minister of State, Deputy Hyland, when we were dealing with the Animal Remedies Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not know why a different attitude is being taken by the Labour Minister as this is a principle that Labour spokespersons have sought to enshrine in legislation in recent years.  Now we find that it is the Labour Party who are anxious to remove any restrictions in regard to who could or could not be appointed to a State board, and they are sweeping everything out of the way in order to ensure that all <Col N="868" /> the appointments to Bord na gCon will be ministerial appointments.  That is a retrograde step and does not give us great hope that a more enlightened approach will be taken.  By putting down the amendment I am giving the Minister the option to reconsider his earlier decision. I have reduced the number that was objectionable to him from 11 to nine but the principle I am proposing is the same.</P>
    <P>I regret that on the earlier amendment the Minister mentioned that a Progressive Democrats' Minister of State who promoted the Environmental Protection Agency had done something similar to what he is doing in this Bill, in other words provided that regulations may be made by the Minister rather than shall be made by the Minister.  I went to the Library to get a copy of the Environmental Protection Agency Act but nobody was available there to make it available to me quickly.  I spoke to the former Minister who brought that Act through the House and she assured me that in several instances she had put in the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in order to provide a statutory requirement that certain things be done.  It is not appropriate that the Minister should seek to convey a different impression.  It is clear that in the Environmental Protection Agency Act the principle I am proposing here for Bord na gCon is enshrined in relation to persons to be appointed to the Environmental Protection Agency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The spirit of my amendment No. 4 is very much in line with Deputy Molloy's amendment No. 2. Deputy Molloy went to the trouble of reducing the number from 11, which he proposed on Committee Stage, to nine this evening.  I support the principle of what Deputy Molloy is saying and his motivation for tabling the amendment. The more the debate on this Bill has gone on, the more I have to ask why this Bill is being taken on its own and why we are not being told more about the Government's intentions in the next Bill it will bring forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has argued that he wants freedom and latitude to appoint suitable <Col N="869" /> persons to the board.  I suppose we could take that at face value but, as Deputy Molloy has pointed out, that is not the argument that members of the Labour Party have been making in this kind of connection up to now, nor is it the kind of action that is being taken in the horse industry which is in competition with the greyhound industry to some extent.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not satisfactorily explained why a different approach is required in relation to the horse industry than that being put forward here.  I suspect that the Minister will say that there are pragmatic reasons for it but one cannot produce good, consistent legislation on the basis of pragmatic points of view.  It may suit the kind of labyrinthine reasoning that the Minister seems to have got sucked into and that parliamentary draftsmen and attorneys general, and sometimes even the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry would put forward, but we have to understand the intention of what we are doing here.</P>
    <P>I suspect, from what the Minister said on Committee Stage and earlier this evening, that he intends to do a number of things about the Irish Coursing Club in the next Bill for the greyhound industry which is to come before the Dáil and about which he is not telling us this evening.  The Minister has not levelled with the Dáil although I suspect that he has a fairly clear idea of what he will do about the ICC in the next Bill.  It is something that the Minister does not want to say now because it is something to which the ICC will object.  It is for that reason that he wants the kind of latitude about which he is talking and why he has resisted our amendments which seek to maintain the right that is written into the 1958 Act for the Irish Coursing Club.</P>
    <P>I will not go over all the ground I covered on Committee Stage except to say that there does not seem to be anything in the current situation of the industry that would change anything in the reasoning the Oireachtas applied in 1958 when it went to the trouble of writing a constitution for the Irish Coursing Club and including it as a schedule to the 1958 Act.  Nothing the Minister has talked <Col N="870" /> about on Second Stage, on Committee Stage or tonight justifies any change in the position of the ICC.</P>
    <P>I wonder also if there is something more that the Minister is not telling us in relation to what he said about the last amendment.  What the Minister is seeking to do in this section is something which most of the Labour Party would find appalling.  The Minister is disposed to deregulate an industry and he is not telling us now because he wants to dump it on us in the next Bill that comes forward. Normally I would applaud this, but I question the Minister's reasons.  I suspect that when the Minister presents the next Bill he will argue that he wants to loosen up the whole thing.</P>
    <P>The Minister said earlier that some regulations should not be applied to sports.  I am delighted to hear it.  If the Minister is going to talk about deregulation, I would be delighted to hear it.  However, the Labour Party will have to do a few more gymnastics to accommodate that, because on the last Bill which we discussed tonight they were absolutely against any kind of deregulation or liberty for operators. Where is the consistency or the principle there?  The only principle the Labour Party seems to have these days is to do what is required to keep Fianna Fáil happy in order to stay in Government with them.  I suspect that what the Minister is proposing to do about the Irish Coursing Club will not keep many members of Fianna Fáil very happy because they will be rightly suspicious of what he is trying to do.  I have a fair notion that there are one or two members of the Labour Party who will not be too happy with what they see emerging in the next Bill for the Irish Coursing Club.  One of them who is sitting here, Deputy Brian Fitzgerald, went to great lengths in the special committee on this to applaud and praise members of the Irish Coursing Club even going to the extraordinary length of naming people whom he singled out for special defence.</P>

      <P>I suspect Deputy Davern will not like what will come about for the Irish Coursing Club in the next Bill the Minister proposes to introduce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to make another point in regard to amendment No. 4 which the Minister does not seem to want to take on board. I want him to state clearly whether he intends to do anything about my suggestion that 40 per cent of places on State boards should be allocated to women. That principle is outlined in the Programme for a Partnership Government.  I am disappointed that the &ldquo;democratic leftovers&rdquo; are not here to support me on this matter.  Neither were they present when we debated this matter at the special committee.  I tabled an amendment <Col N="872" /> which provides that 40 per cent of the new board of nine people should be women.  I made the point on Committee Stage and I will make it again here tonight that there should be no difficulty in living up to that gender balance in the Irish greyhound industry.  We would not need Deputy Wallace's compendium of the top favourite 100 Fianna Fáil women around the country in our talent bank to do so because the industry could produce such persons without any difficulty.  Even the Labour Party could accept many of them.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister accept my proposals and say whether the Government takes that commitment seriously?  I suspect he will give us all sorts of pragmatic reasons that cannot be done in this case.  In effect, he will be saying that the Government does not intend doing anything worthwhile about adhering to that commitment.</P>
    <P>The other amendments are consequential, but the test will be whether the Minister accepts either amendment No. 2 or amendment No. 4.  If he does not he will clearly state that a Labour Minister wants an opportunity to appoint to the board people who are amenable to his way of thinking and confirm that more pain and suffering will be visited on the Irish Coursing Club in the next Bill the Minister proposes to introduce.  If the Minister does not accept my amendments he will confirm my suspicions on both those matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Dukes's forecasts are accurate I look forward to the introduction of the next Bill and if they so displease Deputies Davern and Fitzgerald it will not be all bad from my point of view.</P>
      <P>The Minister went from one extreme to another in this legislation.  Bord na gCon was dominated by the coursing community and the Irish Coursing Club has three of the seven nominees on the board.  As I pointed out on Committee Stage, a study revealed that the seven members of Bord na gCon and also their top executives were deeply involved in coursing for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the dramatic <Col N="873" /> decline in the greyhound industry which highlights the incompetence of those in charge during the past number of years. For that reason it is necessary that we change the method of appointing members to the new board.  I am well aware that leaving it in the hands of a Minister can lead to abuse, not necessarily by the present Minister, but by future Ministers.  I share Deputies' concerns in that regard.  I also share the view of Deputy Molloy that an attempt should be made to embrace all aspects of the greyhound industry so that they are represented on Bord na gCon.  Because of what I have seen members of the Irish Coursing Club oversee since its foundation, I would not appoint any of its members to that board.  I accept the Minister intends appointing a number of members of the Irish Coursing Club to the new board, but I support Deputy Molloy's suggestion that only two of the nine should be members of that club.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I referred to the control stewards of the Irish Coursing Club supervising the release of hares.  I accept the Minister made a number of concessions in regard to my amendments, particularly in relation to trials and marking the hare when it is being released into the wild.  However, he did not concede on the key element of who should supervise the regulations.  If that is not catered for correctly and above suspicion and doubt, this Bill will be worthless.  So long as the special committee monitors all coursing meetings everything will be done according to the rules, but that may not always be the case.  My remarks on Committee Stage upset Deputy Fitzgerald to such an extent that he defended the control stewards by reading out their names, but Deputy Dukes correctly suggested he should stop.</P>
    <P>In carrying out research I came across an editorial in the <i>Greyhound News</i> of February 1988 in which it was stated:</P>
    <P>The message had come over loud and clear during the season that certain members of the ICC Executive and ICC Club Representatives are turning a blind eye to meetings that have been <Col N="874" /> run off when they should have been stopped.  True, it is a very difficult decision to make, especially as nearly all the labour in coursing meetings is on a voluntary basis and many a good relationship between neighbours has been severed by members of a committee not pulling together.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately this season, and more than ever, the pressure is on to ban coursing and it has now reached the stage that committees must pull together; if the hares are weak or if a club is in trouble it must not be let run the meeting.  Weather conditions can play havoc with hares and there are of course exceptions; but at least, if the Trial Stakes were taken away from the clubs that seem to offend all too frequently, it might encourage them to get their house in order.</P>
    <P>That comment was included for the good reason that a blind eye was being turned to distasteful aspects of coursing which have been highighted by myself and other Members of this House.  A warning was given at Clounanna three years later.  I have no doubt that once this issue moves out of the limelight and coursing is again under the control of these people who for so long turned a blind eye to abuses, they will do precisely the same again.</P>
    <P>The Minister is to introduce regulations under which hares will be released into the wild after coursing meetings.  In this regard he has tabled an amendment under which hares will be marked.  Who will supervise this procedure of marking and releasing hares into the wild?</P>

If the regulations are implemented &mdash; we are <Col N="875" /> not sure that they will &mdash; veterinary surgeons will be present at each coursing meeting and I presume they have a code of ethics.  I cannot see why provision cannot be made in the regulations for supervision by veterinary surgeons whereby they would oversee the procedure of marking the unfortunate hares before they are released into the wild.  I hope the Minister will make provision for this in the regulations.</P>

      <P>I support both amendments and appeal to the Minister to allow the ICC to be represented on the new board.  I am sure Deputies Davern and Fitzgerald will support me in making this appeal.  It is fair to say that the ICC is shattered and demoralised by the Minister's proposal.  I appeal to him to take into consideration the fact that it has been devoted to the greyhound industry.  As we are aware, the members of its executive committee have been democratically elected and represent the interests of owners, trainers and breeders.  It also possesses expertise and knowledge which would be invaluable in setting up any new board.  As I said, I hope the two Deputies to whom I have referred will support me in my appeal to the Minister at this late stage to consider both amendments on their merits and acknowledge the work done by the ICC during the years in the greyhound industry by allowing the members of the executive committee to be represented on the new board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the point made by Deputy Dukes that there should be some women on the new board.  Deputy Dukes suggested four.  I would agree with that figure, given that women play a major role in the industry, both coursing and track, particularly when it comes to feeding and preparing dogs.  I ask the Minister to seriously consider this proposal.  If the new board is to have credibility and receive widespread support the Minister will have to consider the possibility of allowing the members of the executive committee of the Irish Coursing Club to be represented also and of including <Col N="876" /> women on the new board.  I have made this case on a number of occasions and appeal to the Minister to reconsider this matter.</P>

      <P>In response to Deputy Dukes, who argued that I had not levelled with the Dáil, the reasons this legislation is before us are, first, that if changes are to be made on the board this will have to be done before 31 December and, second, we want to avail of the opportunity to remove the ban on Sunday racing.  The sections dealing with the muzzling of greyhounds and veterinary controls were included on foot of undertakings given in the Dáil earlier this year.</P>
      <P>I will not be accepting these amendments. I would like to remind Deputies that up to 1958, when the Act was introduced, the Irish Coursing Club controlled coursing and track racing.  It made sense at that time to reserve places for members of the ICC with expertise to ensure continuity. The Deputies should also bear in mind that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Greyhound Industry recommended that places should no longer be reserved for members of the ICC.  Therefore I do not know what the Deputy is getting at.</P>
      <P>I suggest to Deputy Molloy that when he visits the Library tomorrow he should look at section 6 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, under which the Minister has power to make regulations.  In that section the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is used rather than the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of people in County Kerry and throughout the country who were in receipt of long term unemployment benefit before joining social employment schemes will not qualify for the social welfare Christmas bonus.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the anomaly in the system.  It is inequitable that participants in similar schemes &mdash; for example, the community employment development programmes in depressed areas &mdash; qualify for the bonus.  Participants on those schemes in one part of Kerry qualify for the bonus but participants on those schemes in non-depressed areas do not qualify for the bonus. That position is unfair.</P>
      <P>The Christmas bonus should extend to all social employment scheme participants provided that, prior to participating in the scheme, they were in receipt of long term unemployment benefit. Participants in social employment schemes should retain secondary benefits including the Christmas bonus, fuel allowance, medical care and in the case of participants repaying loans, supplementary welfare benefit.</P>
      <P>People lose their secondary benefits when they participate in social employment schemes.  Those schemes are designed to give people an opportunity to work.  Because of the unfairness in the system, people are discouraged from participating in social employment schemes.  I would like the Minister to clarify a statement made by the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy O'Rourke, at a Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis, that all participants in social employment schemes would receive the Christmas bonus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Social employment schemes have provided work opportunities.  Those schemes were welcomed by many people and valuable work has been carried out through them throughout the country. <Col N="880" /> However, those schemes have a demotivating influence because participants do not qualify for the Christmas bonus. Many of the participants find themselves in unsuitable employment.  In many cases they do not possess the skills for the work they are required to do as many of them were employed in different jobs previously. For example, people employed previously in clerical jobs are now required to do manual jobs.  Many participants find it difficult to cope with the change in jobs and the fact that they do not qualify for the Christmas bonus is the demotivating factor.  I appeal to the Minister to remove what I consider an anomaly in the system and to address the inequitable treatment of participants in those schemes.  It may not be possible to address this matter at this stage but I ask the Minister to give a commitment to address it for next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, announced on 9 September 1993 that the social welfare Christmas bonus was being paid again this year.  The bonus is payable to persons in receipt of long term social welfare payments, including persons who are long term unemployed and in receipt of unemployment compensation payments, and also to persons who are in receipt of payments which are directly linked to the rates of unemployment payments. Participants on the social employment scheme, SES, are in receipt of payments which are not directly linked to the unemployment payments they were receiving while they were on the live register.</P>
      <P>The level of payment to participants on the scheme is pitched above that which such persons would be entitled to had they remained on social welfare.  Accordingly, participants on the SES are compensated for the loss of extra benefits such as the Christmas bonus which they might be entitled to had they remained on the live register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current basic rate paid to a participant on the social employment scheme is £77 per week, in respect of a <Col N="881" /> part-time week, which compares with the basic rate of unemployment assistance of £59.20.  In other words there is a differential throughout the year of £17.80 between the SES payment and the payment made while on the live register. This differential is intended to compensate participants for the loss of secondary social benefits such as the Christmas bonus.</P>
    <P>In addition to the basic rate of £77 an added dependant allowance of £33.70 a week is paid, together with £12.80 per week per child.  The availability of the child dependant allowance since 1990 has made the scheme attractive for long term unemployed people with dependants who currently represent about 54 per cent of those participating, compared with 30 per cent prior to the introduction of the child allowance scheme.</P>
    <P>I would like to be in a position to increase the basic payment &mdash; £77 &mdash; to persons participating in manpower programmes. However, I must act responsibly, having regard to the capacity of the Exchequer which fully funds this scheme, unlike when it was originally introduced by me in the mid-eighties and we were able to draw down European Social Fund money for this purpose.  I am using the funds made available to me for the social employment scheme to provide opportunities for as many long term unemployed as possible on the basis of normal weekly payments.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the Government announced this year that the intake into the social employment scheme and the Community Employment Development Programme would be increased so as to provide for 20,500 participants by the end of the year, and that target has been achieved.  Exchequer expenditure on the combined social employment scheme and the Community Employment Development Programme will amount to £103 million this year compared with £74 million in 1992.  I am sure all Deputies are aware from experience in their constituencies that the projects undertaken are of significant benefit to local communities.  It is generally accepted that participation in the scheme <Col N="882" /> is worthwhile and helps the long term unemployed to improve their prospects of obtaining employment when opportunities arise.</P>

      <P>Gabhaim buíochas leis an Aire as ucht teacht isteach anseo chomh deireanach san oíche, ach is ceist tábhachtach í seo.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year I raised the question in the Dáil of the provision of geriatric care in Connemara.  At that time I pointed out that for a large number of people from the Connemara area the nearest geriatric care is in Loughrea and that this causes great hardship for many families as it means a round trip of up to 180 miles to visit relatives.  The cost for families in receipt of social welfare of visiting close relatives in the old people's home in Loughrea is prohibitive.  It is of the utmost importance that extra beds be provided locally for these people.</P>
      <P>This is a particular problem in the Clifden area because that part of Connemara is furthest away from Loughrea.  Apart from St. Anne's home and Clifden hospital the nearest geriatric homes are in Spiddal, Galway city and Carraroe in south Connemara.  In a huge catchment area of up to 40 miles radius total geriatric care is provided by the health board. The introduction of the new scheme of allowances for people in private nursing homes, which I sincerely welcome, while it has been of great benefit and will be of increasing benefit in other areas in my constituency, has not had a huge impact on this area.</P>
      <P>When I raised this question earlier this year I was informed that it was intended to open ten extra beds in Clifden hospital. I understand that finance is available for this purpose but due to a dispute within the Western Health Board in relation to management there, provision of these beds has been delayed, and that is regrettable. The Western Health Board should be directed by the Minister to ensure that these extra beds are provided forthwith.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first instance, responsibility for providing long-stay beds in the Galway region is a matter for the Western Health Board.  Formerly the needs of dependent elderly persons were met by admitting them to long-stay hospitals.  This practice is now generally believed to be unsatisfactory. Greater emphasis is currently being placed on the development of community-based services so that elderly persons can continue to live in their homes, with assistance if necessary, for as long as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the working party on services for the elderly, <i>The Years Ahead</i>, provides a blueprint for the development of services for the elderly.  The recommendations of the report have been adopted by Government and are being progressively implemented.  Since 1990, the Government has provided substantial additional funds to the Western Health Board to implement this report.  During this time, the board has considerably improved services for the elderly throughout the region.  The home nursing, home care and home help services have benefited while liaison nurses have also been appointed.  A total of 17 additional long-stay beds were provided in Merlin Park Regional Hospital in 1992. The Western Health Board also proposes to adapt a unit in the hospital for the care of elderly mentally infirm patients.  In Carraroe the board has provided an extension which has enabled approximately <Col N="884" /> 15 extra elderly people to attend the centre each day.  The board is currently carrying out work on the provision of beds for respite care in Áras Mhic Dara.  The board is also examining the possibility of providing ten extra long-stay beds in Clifden District Hospital but as yet has not made a formal proposal to my Department.  Overall, there has been much improvement in the services being provided for the elderly in the Galway region which I hope will be maintained.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, came into operation on 1 September last.  I understand that this country is the only member state of the European Union to implement new legislation in favour of older people during this the European Year of Older People and Solidarity between Generations.</P>
    <P>The Nursing Homes Act has two principal objectives: first, to ensure that all nursing homes which care for the dependent elderly have a high standard of accommodation and care, and secondly, to financially assist dependent persons most in need in paying their nursing home fees.  The implementation of the Act is another important step in honouring the commitments in the Programme for a Partnership Government.</P>
    <P>Under the new legislation a dependent person requiring nursing care who cannot afford to pay for the full costs of care in a home can apply to a health board for a subvention towards the cost of care.  Each case is being assessed by the health board and it is my hope that the new subvention scheme will ensure that those most in need will benefit from the new scheme. The new Act is a major step forward in ensuring that dependent elderly persons will be well cared for, which is surely the aspiration of any truly caring society.  The Act, therefore, will provide the health board with yet another option in meeting the needs of the dependent elderly in their region.</P>

      <P>Before calling on Deputy McDowell, I wish to remind <Col N="885" /> Members of the convention that, if at all possible, persons outside the House should not be referred to by name or in a manner which would make them identifiable.  In regard to the report of the inquiry, I would also ask that comment which might be seen as an attempt to influence the Minister's decision on the findings of the report should be avoided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise with the Minister for Health the situation which still unfortunately pertains in regard to the administration and reputation of Beaumont Hospital.  As the House is aware, Beaumont Hospital is one of the largest hospitals in Dublin city. It has an immense throughput of patients and covers a very large catchment area. This new hospital, which was formed by the amalgamation of several older hospitals, ought to be a jewel in the crown of health administration in the Dublin area.  The hospital has congregated under its roof many people with various professional skills in medicine, be they nursing staff, doctors, specialists or other people in the health area who provide much needed services to the people of north Dublin city.  This hospital is also a centre of excellence in respect of several specialties.</P>
      <P>In that context it is of the greatest importance that any perception in the public mind that a cloud hangs over the hospital or that the hospital is labouring under disadvantages caused by adverse publicity should be dispelled as soon as possible.  It is important also that public confidence in the hospital, the services provided at every level and its administration should be restored as soon as possible to the requisite level.  The opportunity should be availed of in that process to ensure that the standards of the hospital are vindicated in the public eye.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I make those remarks in general terms because I do not want to refer to any individual controversy.  However, I have to say that when the Minister was on these benches there was no one &mdash; and I say that advisedly &mdash; as assiduous as he in calling for publicity about the problems which arose at that time in Beaumont <Col N="886" /> Hospital and the publication of certain reports commissioned from outside experts.  No one was as vociferous as he in calling the public's attention to the problems created for the hospital by the ongoing cloud over its reputation arising out of controversies which have been well ventilated in public and which I do not want to repeat here.  No one was as vociferous or as persistent in drawing the public's attention to the problems in that hospital.  He effectively and persistently harried the then Minister for Health in seeking answers to a number of questions he raised in this House.</P>
    <P>For some reason &mdash; I think this is a well known fact, and I can comment without prejudice to anyone's reputation &mdash; a number of medical personnel in Beaumont Hospital were the subject of inquiries by the General Medical Council's Fitness to Practise Committee.  Apparently those inquiries have been concluded but these matters fall to be rehearsed again before the courts. Apparently, the decisions reached by the committee have virtually no status except as a preliminary run over the course.</P>
    <P>There is a separate issue involved here, that is, the inquiry which the Minister's predecessor, as a corporation sole, caused to be instituted into several different complaints which were not the subject matter of the Fitness to Practise Committee's inquiries or any appeal to the courts.  Under the common contract, the then Minister appointed a committee of inquiry, which has had its report on the Minister's desk for some considerable time.  The Minister exercises a quasi-judicial function in deciding whether to act on the report of that committee.  The time has come for the Minister to act on this matter.  He cannot use the excuse that court proceedings could affect his judgment; it is a matter for him to act. The Minister has had the report for long enough and he must make up his mind on it.  I am not seeking to influence how he makes up his mind but if he does so expeditiously he will assist in lifting the cloud which has hovered for far too long over the hospital's reputation and the reputation of the senior staff working <Col N="887" /> there.  I ask the Minister to remedy that situation now.  He knows that if he was on these benches he would be the first to raise this issue and he would not have allowed the amount of time I have allowed to elapse before bringing it to the attention of the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Beaumont Hospital has only been operational since 1987.  This hospital as an entity replaced two old and out-dated but very venerable hospitals and, in a very short time, established itself as one of the country's major teaching hospitals with an international reputation. In terms of activity, the hospital since it opened has dealt with over 110,000 in-patients, 30,000 day cases have been treated and 60,000 operations have been performed.  In addition, there have been 500,000 out-patients and 330,000 patients have attended the hospital's accident and emergency department.  Not only is Beaumont Hospital one of the pivotal accident and emergency hospitals in the Dublin area but, as the Deputy will be aware, it has national and regional responsibilities, particularly in the renal and neurosurgical areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am, of course, aware from the period before I became Minister for Health that certain difficulties arose in the hospital's neurosurgical department.  I am unaware of any ongoing difficulties at the hospital and I would very much hope that the chapter of problems that arose in the past can be closed and that Beaumont Hospital can continue to get on with the business that it does best, that is, treating patients in need of care.  In particular, considerable efforts have been made to consolidate and strengthen the neurosurgical services at Beaumont Hospital. Two additional consultants in neurosurgery have been appointed to the hospital staff and considerable investment has been made in the provision of additional theatre space and equipment. In addition, earlier this year, I was able to make resources available to the neurosurgery waiting list within the hospital's <Col N="888" /> allocation of over £1.25 million from the national waiting list initiative.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may be aware that I recently had the opportunity of formally opening the new magnetic resonance imaging facility at Beaumont Hospital which will significantly enhance the hospital's state-of-the-art diagnostic services. I look forward to working with the hospital over the coming years and building on its undoubted strengths as one of our finest hospitals.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of making available the report of the committee of inquiry established by my predecessor and referred to by the Deputy, I have received advice on this matter.  This report was forwarded to my predecessor as Minister for Health, given the Minister for Health's functions under appendix V of the consultants' common contract relating to the appeal mechanisms. Because of my appelate role as Minister for Health in relation to the report of the committee of inquiry, I am advised that it would be inappropriate for me to make any comment on the matter other than to say that I will be making my decision in the near future.  I am also advised that the making available of the report is a matter for the committee of inquiry itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased and surprised to have the opportunity to raise this issue with the Minister tonight, perhaps it is due to the late hour.  This morning a constituent telephoned me in a state of deep concern with regard to her father who had been admitted to the Mater Hospital 48 hours before suffering from emphysema.  He was placed on a couch during the night and on a bench during the day while awaiting treatment and because he was in casualty and not a ward he was not receiving regular meals.  This man was highly distressed by being moved around.  We all know that emphysema affects one's breathing and can be serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would have satisfied myself by making particular inquiries in regard to <Col N="889" /> this case had it not been for the fact that on a Sunday in the past fortnight I was contacted by another constituent who had been approached by hospital staff to take her 90 year old mother, who was suffering from cancer, out of the hospital on the Sunday night and bring her back on the Monday morning at 8 o'clock simply because of lack of space.  This woman lived in a flat in Ballymun and had no transport.  The nursing staff, who were excellent and who were trying to do their best, explained to me that on that weekend they had 30 patients in casualty whom they could not accommodate in the hospital and which required them to open a day ward.  They had to clear the day ward on the Sunday night to get ready for Monday and were required to ask anyone who was barely fit to go home for the night.</P>
    <P>This seems to indicate substantial pressure on the facilities.  I realise there is the normal rise in admissions to hospitals at this time of the year and I gather the problem is equally severe in other hospitals, but perhaps not quite as severe as in the Mater.  All of those who complain about the problem have the highest regard for the nursing and medical staff, who are trying to do their best, but the accommodation is simply not adequate to meet the needs at this time of the year.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister happy with this situation and does he believe the hospitals in Dublin are adequately resourced to meet these demands?  Does he propose to take any action to ensure that people will not have to anticipate this type of problem in the accident and emergency departments of our hospitals?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the pressures under which the accident and emergency service in the Mater Hospital and the other major Dublin hospitals must operate, particularly at this time of year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like, first, to outline to the House the nature and scale of the service provided by the Dublin hospital accident and emergency departments.  There are six hospitals involved, three on the north side of the city and three on the south. <Col N="890" /> These are, on the north side, Beaumont, the Mater and James Connolly Memorial Hospital, Blanchardstown, and on the south side the Meath, St. James's and St. Vincent's Hospitals.  Altogether there are some 300,000 attendances at the accident and emergency departments of these hospitals every year.  Of these, some 65,000 attend the accident and emergency department of the Mater Hospital and in 1992 over 8,500 of those attending required admission to the hospital.</P>
    <P>It must be understood that because of the nature of the work of hospital accident and emergency departments it is not possible to predict what their workload will be at any particular time.  At all times, however, priority is accorded to those patients most in need of immediate medical attention.</P>
    <P>The situation in relation to the accident and emergency departments is exacerbated at times through, for instance, major accidents or epidemics such as 'flu. At this time of year, as Deputies will be aware, there is usually an increase in the number of people, many of them elderly, suffering from respiratory and other complaints and this results in increased pressure on the facilities, both in the accident and emergency departments and the medical wards of hospitals.  A difficulty has arisen from time to time, not primarily in relation to the availability of acute hospital beds, but in that there have been insufficient step-down facilities for patients in need of a lower level of care. Therefore, such patients have had to be kept in hospital, even though they are no longer in need of care at the level provided in an acute hospital setting.</P>
    <P>I understand that at present all of the Dublin accident and emergency hospitals are extremely busy.  In the case of the Mater Hospital, an influx of seriously ill patients, some of them elderly, coupled with a number of road traffic accident cases, has meant that it has not been possible to provide beds immediately for all patients in need of admission.  Every effort is being made to deal with this situation through the discharge of patients so as to release beds for further admissions. <Col N="891" /> The position regarding the accident and emergency departments is monitored by my Department on an ongoing basis. In this regard, shortly after coming into office at the beginning of this year, I approved a sum of £500,000 to provide an immediate response to a problem regarding a shortage of step-down accommodation of this type.</P>
    <P>I am glad to announce that following further discussions in recent weeks, I have allocated an additional £250,000 to the Eastern Health Board to enable the pressures on the accident and emergency departments to be eased further.  This is being achieved through the placing of more than 100 patients from the six accident and emergency hospitals in Dublin, <Col N="892" /> who are no longer in need of acute hospital care, in step-down accommodation more appropriate to their condition.</P>
    <P>To date, the Eastern Health Board has placed 86 of these patients in step-down accommodation and a further 23 patients will be placed in the coming days.  This action will, I am confident, greatly relieve the seasonal pressures on the hospitals.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the House of my continuing concern that the accident and emergency hospitals in Dublin are enabled to respond effectively to the demands placed upon them and that I will continue to monitor the situation with a view to taking further action if required.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 12.50 a.m. on 16 December 1993 until 10.30 a.m.</P>

      <P>Tá na gníomhaíochtaí uile atá ar siúl ag mo Roinnse bunaithe ar pholasaithe atá faoi bhreithniú agam ar bhonn leanúnach.</P>
      <P>Ó thaobh na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta de, tá scéimeanna éagsúla á reachtáil ag mo Roinnse ar mhaithe le leas cultúrtha, sóisialach agus eacnamaíoch na Gaeltachta agus ar mhaithe le caomhnú agus leathnú na Gaeilge mar ghnáthurlabhra.  Tacaíonn na tionscnaimh faoi scáth Údarás na Gaeltachta agus Bord na Gaeilge leis na cuspóirí sin chomh maith.</P>
      <P>Tá áthas orm go bhfuil éirithe liom infheistíocht sa réimse oidhreachta a mhéadú faoin bPlean Náisiúnta úr, d'ainneoin infheistíocht mhór sa réimse sin sa Phlean Náisiúnta 1989-1993.  Díreofar an infheistíocht seo ar na codanna sin dár n-oidhreacht a rachaidh chun tairbhe an tionscail thurasóireachta.  Beidh mé ag leagadh amach go luath d'Oifig na nOibreacha Poiblí clár oibreacha lena cur i gcrích i 1994: ina measc beidh tograí a thiocfaidh faoin gClár Ghníomhaíochtaí Turasóireachta.</P>
      <P>Is é mo pholasaí maidir le hinfheistíocht san Ealaíon agus sa Chultúr ná go bhfuil de cheart ag gach saoránach go mbeadh teacht acu ar shaol ealaíona agus cultúrtha na tíre agus, dá bhrí sin, tá forbairt áiseanna oiriúnacha dá leithéid mar thosaíocht agam.</P>

    <P>Tá athbhreithniú iomlán idir lámha agam ar reachtaíocht agus gréasáin craolacháin agus tá sé beartaithe agam Páipéar Uaine faoi chúrsaí chraolacháin a ullmhú sna míonna amach romhainn.

    <P>Ceann de na forbairtí is suntasaí sa réimse craolacháin, ar ndóigh, ná an cinneadh go mbunófaí Teilifís na Gaeilge.  Tá eolas beacht tugtha agam faoin tionscnamh sin san fhreagra ar cheisteanna eile níos luaithe.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, it is estimated that RTE reception is available to 35 per cent of the population of Northern Ireland.  The transmitter network for Teilifís na <Col N="652" /> Gaeilge, if configured in the same way as the RTE transmitter network, would achieve similar coverage.  The question of improving or extending RTE or Teilifís na Gaeilge coverage beyond the estimated 35 per cent figure is complex.  One consideration is that the broadcasting frequency spectrum can be used only in accordance with plans drawn up under international agreements to which Ireland is a party.  Difficult technical, radio frequency and policy problems have to be overcome to allow RTE reception in Northern Ireland to be improved or extended.</P>
    <P>At the last meeting of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, Ministers noted progress on the reception of RTE in Northern Ireland.  Within the framework of the conference, detailed discussions on extending RTE coverage in Northern Ireland are ongoing between officials of my Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications and representatives of British Government Departments in London with responsibility for broadcasting policy and radio frequency planning and management.  A report will be submitted to the next meeting of the Conference.</P>

    <P>Tá dóchas agam, le dea-thoil ó gach taobh &mdash; rud atá ann, creidim &mdash; go mbeifear in ann feabhas a chur ar chúrsaí maidir le glacadh RTÉ agus Theilifís na Gaeilge i dTuaisceart Éireann.</P>

      <P>The figures referred to by the Deputy were quoted in a Coopers and Lybrand report on the Indigenous Audiovisual Production Sector, which was commissioned by the Irish Film Centre, Dublin, and published in June 1992.</P>
      <P>Section 9 of the Coopers and Lybrand report addressed the question of employment generation and the contribution to Gross National Product of expenditure in the industry.  In the case of employment generation, the consultants calculated the equivalent number of full-time jobs for a year which the activity in the sector created, on the basis of 250 working days per annum per job.  These calculations addressed both the direct and indirect employment effects, as well as the induced effect arising from the introduction of foreign investment into the country.  They concluded that, in the case of feature film production, the equivalent of 50 full-time jobs for one year are created for every £1 million spent. They also concluded that the equivalent number of full-time jobs for various categories of television programmes for one year, based on expenditure of £1 million was as follows:</P>

      <P>I propose to take identical Questions Nos. 25, 26, 44, 47, 52 and 54 together.</P>
      <P>I wish to assure the Deputies from the outset that my intention is to promote a vibrant and autonomous State-sponsored sector which serves all the disciplines and fields of endeavour within my Ministerial remit.  I also intend to establish a dynamic dialogue with those State-sponsored agencies for which I am responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is for this reason that I have decided to appoint an officer of my Department as an observer to An Chomhairle Ealaíon with effect from 1 January, 1994 for an experimental period of 12 months.  The <Col N="656" /> appointment of an observer will facilitate the flow of all relevant information about my policies germane to the statutory responsibilities of An Chomhairle.</P>
    <P>The observer will be able to provide clarification about factors that I, as Minister, would be likely to take into account when considering proposals that are proper to be referred to me for approval or consent.  This will facilitate the council to come to its own decisions on the basis of the information available, while ensuring that the observer, who will also have no voting powers, is not personally or professionally compromised by the outcome. I must stress that it will not be part of the observer's remit to seek to influence the thinking or decision making of An Chomhairle or to negotiate with them.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be pleased to note that An Chomhairle have indicated to me that, on balance, they believe that the attendance of an observer at their meetings would be to our mutual advantage.</P>
    <P>For the Deputies' information I am also appointing an observer to the board of Bord Scannán na h-Eireann and this appointment has been welcomed by that board also.</P>
    <P>As for the future funding arrangements for the Abbey Theatre, I would refer the Deputies to my reply to Question No. 4 on 4 November last, Vol. 435, No. 5, columns 1556 and 1557 of the Official Report.</P>
    <P>I am awaiting the views of An Chomhairle Ealaíon and will be seeking the views of the Abbey Theatre on this proposal. It will be some time before I will be in a position to adopt a final position in the matter.  However, Deputies can be assured that any new funding arrangements or relationships which I might put in place over time will in no way undermine the independence of either An Chomhairle Ealaíon or of the Abbey Theatre.  As for the question of the independence of cultural policy in the State. I should say it is my responsibility to develop and articulate that policy in close consultation with the relevant bodies and institutions.</P>

      <P>The Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of the Architectural Heritage of Europe was signed by Ireland in Granada, Spain, on 3 October 1985.  To date, 20 countries out of a total of 33 have ratified or acceded to the convention.  I am concerned that international conventions of this kind should be ratified by this country as quickly as possible.  My Department will be actively pursuing this in consultation with the other Departments involved.</P>

      <P>I am taking Questions Nos 29, 31 and 53 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies are aware, I have on more than one occasion stated my commitment to the need for a fostering of cultural diversity.  I have striven since taking up office to emphasise this requirement in all cultural enterprises.  I have always supported the approach that guarantees for European producers and broadcasters should provide adequate space for European programming on our television screens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the development of the European Union's negotiating position in relation to the audiovisual sector in the GATT negotiations, I have put forward the view that the cultural dimension of the audio-visual sector, including film, in Europe has to be recognised and adequately protected. <Col N="659" /> Ireland's position was articulated during the Danish Presidency and developed during the Belgian Presidency of the EU and advanced at all stages of the discussions.</P>
    <P>The negotiations are at a delicate stage and must be concluded by midnight tonight.  Washington time.  I understand that the audiovisual sector will be included in the agreement, but that the European Union will retain complete freedom to pursue its policies in relation of the sector.  I must stress that, until the details of the text of the agreement, if concluded, have been studied, I cannot assess its impact on the constituent elements of the Irish audiovisual sector. However, I would be reasonably confident on the basis of the information available to me now that the sector will be adequately protected.</P>

      <P>The discovery programme was formally initiated on 11 May 1991 by the then Taoiseach, Mr. Charles J. Haughey.  Its purpose is to enhance our understanding of Ireland's past through a major programme of research and archaeological excavation. The Discovery Programme Panel, a committee of 11 persons appointed by the Taoiseach, was charged with the general direction of this work.</P>
      <P>Initially the panel set out to identify major issues and problems that would form a basis for a first programme of study.  Given the scope of the exercise, many possibilities immediately presented themselves, stretching chronologically from the Mesolithic to the Middle Ages, and thematically from such monument types as upland habitation sites to deserted medieval villages, from megalithic tombs to tower houses.  The panel decided that initially a core period should be focused on so that significant increases in knowledge could be demonstrated within a few years.  The core period chosen was the Late Bronze Age-Iron Age.  This is a most important, exciting and formative period, but one that is imperfectly understood.  It was felt that this period should be better researched, in particular the emergence of a complex Celtic society.  I understand that the discovery programme will in future address other topics.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have ensured in making appointments to boards-agencies under my Department's aegis that their composition is in accordance with the recommendations in the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women. Appointments made by me this year <Col N="663" /> included eight women to the 17 member Comhairle Ealaíon, four women to the seven member Bord Scannán na hÉireann and four women to the ten member Independent Radio and Television Commission.  In relation to the RTÉ Authority, the requirement for gender balance has been enshrined in legislation by the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1993.</P>
    <P>I have also requested bodies who nominate members for boards-agencies to practise gender balance and this has already begun.  All bodies under the aegis of my Department have been directed to operate an equal opportunities policy and to specify in job advertisements that they are an equal opportunities employer.</P>
    <P>With regard to the matter of a women's arts policy, I indicated in reply to similar parliamentary questions on 29 April 1993, that An Comhairle Ealaíon was to be asked to prepare a three-year coordinated plan and that I saw this mechanism as being a useful forum to explore and respond to the commission's recommendations over time.  The Deputy will be glad to know that I have since asked An Chomhairle to prepare this plan and expect it to be available to me early in 1994.</P>

      <P>The European <Col N="665" /> Union's budget for food aid to the developing world amounted to 579 million ECU in 1993.  In addition, there were further emergency food aid operations for Africa bringing the total spent on EU food aid deliveries to more than 600 million ECU (around IR£480 million).</P>
      <P>In volume, this represents some 1.7 million tonnes of food products, shipped mainly from Europe.  In deciding which products to donate to recipient countries, the Commission, as implementing agent, places particular emphasis on nutritional requirements and local dietary practices. Around 15 per cent of the food aid is purchased locally or in other developing countries.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed to providing relief for the emergency humanitarian needs of the victims on all sides of the conflict in the former Yugoslavia.  That commitment was renewed most recently at the meeting held in Geneva on 29 November 1993 between European Union Ministers and the parties to the conflict.</P>
      <P>Since the conflict began, the Government has allocated £1.2 million pounds in emergency humanitarian assistance to the international relief operation in the former Yugoslavia.  In addition, Ireland also plays its part in the European Union's programme of humanitarian assistance to the former Yugoslavia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government agreed to accept two hundred refugees from the former Yugoslavia in July 1992 and a further 200 refugees in June 1993.  We have never applied restrictions as regards age or ethnic background of those persons admitted here under this programme.  At present, our <Col N="666" /> efforts are concentrated on facilitating the family reunification of Bosnians who have already been admitted to Ireland. We are using all available channels to ensure that relatives, many of whom are trapped in besieged cities in central Bosnia, may travel to Ireland as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Ireland has also supported the medical evacuation programme which is operated by the UNHCR and the International Office of Migration for the former Yugoslavia. We have accepted ten serious orthopaedic cases for treatment in Ireland in Cappagh Hospital.  Again, no restrictions as regards age or the ethnic background of the injured persons were imposed.  The medical evacuees, eight adults and two minors, are in continuing need of medical treatment in Ireland. They will not be required to return to the former Yugoslavia when their treatment is completed.  The evacuees and their relatives have been offered the same legal status and entitlements as other persons admitted here as refugees from the former Yugoslavia.</P>
    <P>The joint UNHCR/IOM medical evacuation programme in the former Yugoslavia is continuing.  It is understood that there are a large number of offers of treatment available under that programme from other countries.</P>

      <P>The area around Cloghauninchy is low lying and liable to floods.  It is protected by an embankment constructed in the late 1920s.</P>
      <P>The responsibility for the repair of the embankment was transferred by the Minister for Finance to the Commissioners of Public Works in August, 1990, in accordance with the powers conferred by the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.  The outfall structure through the embankment had been damaged earlier and was replaced by the Commissioners with a 1.8m diameter pipe which had the effect of improving its discharge capacity. There are no proposals to undertake any additional works at this stage.</P>
      <P>The problem is not with the works already completed but is due to the inadequate discharging capacity of the main channel.  Studies carried out by the Commissioners following the extreme rainfall in the area in January, 1992 led them to conclude that flooding would have been extensive irrespective of the outfall conditions due to the inability of the channel upstream of the road bridge to carry such flood waters within its banks.  An extensive scheme of embankments and back drains, including the installation of sluices and pumping equipment, would be required to give the necessary relief.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 66, 67 and 68 together.</P>
      <P>The Garda Commissioner is responsible for the detailed allocation of manpower and resources to individual areas. The sergeant who retired recently at Broadford was replaced by a garda with effect from 28 October, 1993.  In these circumstances, the Garda authorities do not consider the filling of the sergeant's vacancy to be a priority.</P>
      <P>The 1992 manning levels at Milltown Malbay was one sergeant and three gardaí.  The present strength is one sergeant and two gardaí (since 30 November 1993).  The Garda authorities consider that the level of manpower is adequate to meet the policing needs of the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the position at Kilkee, I understand that Garda manning levels there remained unchanged over the past <Col N="671" /> three years at one sergeant and one garda until 11 June, 1993 when an additional garda was appointed.  A vacancy at the rank of sergeant which arose on 31 October, 1993 was filled on 30 November, 1993.  The Garda authorities are satisfied that the present increased manning level of one sergeant and two gardaí adequately meets the needs of the local community.</P>

The National Development Plan indicates the priority the Government places on the types of actions supported under Euroform, NOW and Horizon.</P>
      <P>On a number of occasions, I have raised the issue of the continuation of Euroform, NOW and Horizon with the Commissioner for Social Affairs, Mr. Pádraig Flynn.  Most recently, at the Congress on Community Initiatives, which was organised by my Department on behalf of the European Commission, I indicated that I am personally very attached to retaining all three Initiatives in their present format and strongly encouraged the Commission to reflect seriously on the justification for any revision which might be proposed.  I believe that while the focus or emphasis of the Initiatives may be adapted or enlarged, it is important to retain their existing profile and to be conscious of the recognition factor which Euroform, NOW and Horizon have so recently established throughout all Member States in the European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also urged the European Commission to expedite its consideration of the future for the Community Initiatives to ensure that discontent and confusion do not jeopardise the benefits which Euroform, NOW and Horizon have created.

      <P>It is not possible to give an estimate of the number of jobs lost during the period of the currency crisis.  It is, however, relevant to mention that employment numbers in the firms assisted under the Market Development Fund were virtually maintained in full during that period.</P>
      <P>The main measure introduced by the Government to protect employment during the currency crisis was the Market Development Fund operated under the aegis of An Bord Tráchtála.  Additional assistance was also provided to firms at risk by various State agencies, mainly under their existing programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total cost of the measures concerned, in so far as they relate to my <Col N="685" /> Department, the Department of Tourism and Trade and the former Department of Industry and Commerce, is estimated at £49 million.</P>

      <P>Financial support provided from the European Social Fund to the three Human Resource Initiatives &mdash; Euroform, NOW and Horizon &mdash; allows for the piloting of innovative approaches to training, education and employment creation.  Accordingly, projects are cofinanced only for a predetermined period of time.  The regulations which now govern financing under the European Union Human Resource Initiatives do not provide for the continuation of funding when the pilot phase of a particular project has been completed.</P>
      <P>A critical objective of the Initiatives is to ensure that the positive results achieved in implementing projects inform the content and delivery of education, training and employment programmes at national and local levels.  All projects supported through the Initiatives are still operational.  As the Minister responsible I intend, on their completion, to assess the outcomes and to ensure that innovatory developments inform policy in the education, training and employment areas.</P>

      <P>All Euroform projects in Ireland are closely monitored by a Technical Support Unit and by my Department.  Written progress reports in respect of each project are required twice yearly and detailed expenditure reports are required on a quarterly basis.  In addition, a minimum of two monitoring visits take place each year when representatives of the Technical Support Unit visit each project to review issues arising from the progress reports submitted. These control visits focus in particular on progress towards the achievement of predetermined targets and objectives, including the expenditure profile of each project visited.</P>
      <P>In the case referred to by the Deputy the required progress and financial reports have been submitted by the organisation concerned.  In 1993, two project visits have taken place.  In addition, there have been two meetings with the board of the organisation concerned as well as informal meetings with the Project Manager to explore issues arising in the operation of the project.</P>
      <P>By reference to the monitoring procedures outlined, I am not aware of any evidence which would support an allegation of misuse of funds or justify a specific investigation in that respect.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that many people who are paying fixed rate repayments on local authority mortgages at 12½ per cent now find that these are extremely uncompetitive in relation to the current prevailing rates of mortgages through banks and building societies; if he has any proposals to review the fixed rate aspect of these loans to see if they can be revised through a variable rate or if some concession can be given on redemption figures so that such mortgage holders can redeem their local authority loans and obtain new substitute mortgages from banks or building societies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The interest rate on local authority fixed rate house purchase loans is related to the cost of long term funds prevailing at the time the loans were advanced and is fixed for the life of the loan.  A fixed interest rate of up to 12½ per cent applied to loans issued before 1 December 1987.  It is not possible to reduce the interest rate on these loans as the cost involved would be substantial and would have to be borne by the Exchequer and local authorities. However, borrowers of these loans may redeem them without penalty and refinance in the private sector, if they consider it advantageous to do so.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 76 and 77 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The statutory authority for payment of disabled person's grants is to be found in section 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1979 and the Housing (Disabled Person's and Essential Repairs Grants) Regulations, 1993.  Within that framework, it is a matter for individual housing authorities to determine whether, or to what categories of persons, grants are paid.  No provision is <Col N="688" /> made in the regulations in relation to means testing and a housing authority is not, therefore, prevented from applying such a requirement.  It has not been the policy of housing authorities generally to means test these grants and I could not favour such a development.</P>
    <P>The details requested of recoupments by my Department to housing authorities in respect of disabled person's grants are being compiled and will be sent to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I am aware of reports that EU exports of frozen beef have damaged the market for locally produced beef in West Africa.  The EU Commission has continuously monitored the impact of subsidised beef exports to West Africa during the past six months and consequently reduced the relevant export refund by 25 per cent in three stages.  The use of refunds for exports of beef, and of other agricultural products, from the EU has been, and remains, a central element of the market support regime for Irish agriculture and is very important to farmers' incomes, employment in the processing sector and the national economy as a whole.  I regard the EU export refund system as an essential part of the Common Agricultural Policy but I also favour modification of its effects where necessary to alleviate situations of particular difficulty in developing countries.</P>

      <P>It is assumed the Deputy's question relates to the allocation of suckler cow quota from the special reserve set up by the EU to cater for farmers who had eligible suckler cows at 1 January 1993 and who (a) had milk quotas of less than 12,819 gallons but who were restricted to a maximum of ten suckler cows or (b) had milk quotas of less than 25,638 gallons.</P>
      <P>Only farmers with beef type suckler cows &mdash; i.e. cows belonging to beef breeds or the progeny of crosses with beef breeds &mdash; were eligible to apply for quota from the special reserve.  It is not known how many farmers were affected by the EU decision to confine the special reserve to beef type cows.  EU Regulations provide for the unused balance of the reserve to be transferred to the national reserve and it is open to such farmers to apply for quota from the national reserve.  This reserve is estimated to be about 60,000 premium rights.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances the question of appeals in respect of friesian cows does not arise.</P>

      <P>Under EU Regulations a special reserve of 63,400 rights was set up to cater for farmers who (a) were allocated milk quotas of less than 12,819 gallons at 1 April 1992 and who applied in 1992 for suckler cow premium <Col N="693" /> but were limited by the ten cow maximum rule and (b) farmers who were allocated milk quotas of less than 25,638 gallons on 1 April 1993 and who did not apply for suckler cow premium in 1992.</P>
      <P>Applications for quota from the reserve will be processed in the near future.  It is estimated that an unused balance of about 40,000 will be available and as required by EU Regulation, the balance will be transferred to the national reserve.</P>
      <P>I have recently announced the priority categories to whom quota from the national reserve will be distributed.  Small scale dairy producers referred to at (a) and (b) above are being given a very high priority in the allocation of this reserve.</P>

      <P>The herd in question was restricted in June 1993 following the disclosure of 11 reactor animals. The retest was carried out in September 1993 and was clear.  The second retest took place in November 1993 at which three inconclusive animals were disclosed.  For this reason and because of the level of active infection detected at the initial test it is considered in the best interests of the health of the herd to carry out a further test before considering derestriction.</P>

      <P>Is cuid lárnach de shaol agus de chultúr na hÉireann í an Ghaeilge agus is é an spriocaidhm náisiúnta i leith na teanga ná go mbeadh formhór ár muintire fíor-dhátheangach. Tá polasaí an Rialtais i leith cothú na Gaeilge, ár gcultúr agus ár n-oidhreachta leagtha síos sa Chlár le haghaidh Rialtais Chomhpháirtíochta 1993-1997.</P>
      <P>Maidir leis an dul chun cinn atá á dhéanamh i dtaca le cláir phleanáilte ghníomhaíochtaí Bhord na Gaeilge (a luaitear sa Chlár sin) chun méadú a dhéanamh ar an bhfáil ar sheirbhísí Stáit trí mheán na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht agus sa tír i gcoitinne, dírím aird an Teachta ar an bhfreagra a thug mé ar 25 Samhain 1993 ar Cheist Dála Uimhir 104 i dtaobh an ábhair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Táim tar éis a fhógairt go mbeidh Teilifís <Col N="698" /> na Gaeilge ann i 1995.  Níl aon amhras ach go gcabhróidh bunú na seirbhíse sin le staid na Gaeilge a neartú sa Ghaeltacht agus le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge sa tir i gcoitinne.</P>
    <P>Is ar mhaithe le leas cultúrtha, sóisialach agus eacnamaíoch na Gaelachta agus ar mhaithe le caomhnú agus leathadh na Gaeilge mar ghnáthurlabhra atá na scéimeanna Gaeltachta agus Gaeilge a bhíonn á riaradh ag mo Roinnse agus an cúnamh airgid a chuirtear ar fáil d'Údarás na Gaeltachta, do Bhord na Gaeilge agus d'eagrais dheonacha Gaeilge.  Suim £27.325 milliún a bheidh ar fáil ag mo Roinnse i 1994 le caitheamh ar mhaithe leis an nGaeltacht agus leis an nGaeilge.</P>
    <P>Is iad na heagrais go díreach faoi scáth mo Roinne a bhfuil ról acu i gcur chun cinn na Gaeilge ná Údarás na Gaeltachta, Bord na Gaeilge agus Bord na Leabhar Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an nGaeilge, is é feidhm Údarás na Gaeltachta ná caomhnú agus leathadh na teanga mar phríomh-mheán cumarsáide sa Ghaeltachta a spreagadh agus a chinntiú gurb í an Ghaeilge a úsáidfear a mhéid is féidir nuair a bheidh a fheidhmeanna á gcomhlíonadh aige agus thar a cheann.</P>
    <P>Is é feidhm Bhord na Gaeilge an Ghaeilge, agus go háirithe a húsáid mar theanga bheo agus mar ghnáthmheán cumarsáide, a chur chun cinn.  Obair ghríosaithe agus spreagtha is mó a bhíonn ar siúl ag an mBord chun tuilleadh Gaeilge a chur á labhairt ag an bpobal.</P>
    <P>Is é Bord na Leabhar Gaeilge a thugann deontais faoi scéim a chabhraíonn le foilsitheoirí chun leabhair Ghaeilge a fhoilsiú d'fhonn spéis sa léitheoireacht Ghaeilge a chothú.</P>
    <P>D'fhonn cabhrú le caomhnú agus leathadh na Gaeilge mar ghnáthurlabhra bíonn cúnmh le fáil ag eagrais dheonacha Ghaeilge ó mo Roinnse.</P>
    <P>Faoi mar atá ráite sa Chlár le haghaidh Rialtais Chomhpháirtíochta, ní mór do gach dream den phobal a gcion féin a dhéanamh chun aidhm an dátheangachais a bhaint amach.  Ní féidir leis an Rialtas amháin an cúram sin a chomhlíonadh ach is den riachtanas é go mbeadh lán-tacaíocht le fáil ón Rialtas <Col N="699" /> don obair agus deimhním arís go mbeidh an tacaíocht sin ar fáil.  Caithfear an bhá atá ag an bpobal leis an nGaeilge a shaothrú sa tslí go mbeidh gach duine sásta iarracht phearsanta leanúnach a dhéanamh chun úsáid na Gaeilge a leathadh. Ar ndóigh tá ról fíorthábhachtach ag an gcóras oideachais i gcur chun cinn na Gaeilge chomh maith.</P>
    <P>Ní fhéadfaí bheith sásta leis an dul chun cinn atá á dhéanamh maidir le leathadh na Gaeilge mar theanga labhartha cé go bhfuil obair fhónta á déanamh ag mo Roinn féin, ag Bord na Gaeilge, ag Údarás na Gaeltachta agus ag na heagrais dheonacha Ghaeilge.  Leanfar go dícheallach leis an obair sin d'fhonn an bunchloch atá ann cheana féin a neartú i gcaoi is go mbeidh fonn ar níos mó daoine an Ghaeilge a labhairt agus í a thabhairt don chéad ghlúin eile.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned that by the tone of the various questions put down by the Deputy for oral and written answer on the topic of Teilifís na Gaeilge to-day that she appears to be opposed to the project.  The Deputy is after all the Fine Gael spokesperson on Arts, Culture and <Col N="700" /> Gaeltacht affairs.  I hope I am mistaken in my impression and that she appreciates that many more considerations, other than purely economic ones must be taken into account in addressing cultural issues, particularly the preservation and promotion of the Irish language as a living language.</P>
    <P>I have no comment to offer on the observations of one member of a 31 member group contained in the report in question other than to point out that the representative recognised, in principle, the desirability of such a service.  The group in paragraph 4.25 of the report stated its belief that the establishment of such service would be of significant benefit to the independent production sector which represents a growing and important economic activity.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of research, various reports and studies into the feasibility of establishing an Irish language television station have been undertaken over the years.  The results of these deliberations were taken into consideration when the commitment to establish the service was included in our <i>Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-1997.</i></P>

    <P>The figures quoted are in respect of original allocations notified to the health boards earlier this year.  The allocation per head of population is calculated on the basis of the 1991 census of population.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that these figures do not include expenditure on voluntary hospitals, directly funded homes for the mentally handicapped and payments made by the General Medical Services (Payments) Board.  Because of this they cannot be compared to figures issued to this House earlier this year.  It should also be noted that the allocation per head of population is an unweighted average and fails to take account of a number of important demographic and geographic factors.  The difference in the cost of health care in each region is also influenced by other factors such as access to higher specialties, density of population and the present stage of development of the services.</P>

      <P>Enrolment at Barefield national school on 30 September 1992 had risen to 201 pupils.  On the basis of this enrolment, an additional teaching post was sought by the school.  However, this figure included 18 pupils enrolled in a seventh standard following a post-primary programme.</P>
      <P>It has been stated on behalf of the school that a seventh standard has traditionally been conducted there.  Seventh standards following a secondary school programme were common in the days before the universal provision of post-primary education.  With the provision of such education from 1967, it is now no longer appropriate that general post-primary education be provided through national schools.</P>
      <P>It has been represented that there is a shortage of post-primary places in the area.  My Department is having this matter investigated and, meantime, has informed the school that an additional post has been approved on a temporary basis.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the Programme for a Partnership Government made a specific commitment to the appointment of a substantial number of additional remedial teachers by September 1996.  As part of this commitment I approved the appointment of an <Col N="706" /> additional 86 remedial teachers in the current school year, bringing the total now in place to 1,033.</P>
      <P>No decision has been made regarding the number of remedial appointments in 1994.  However, I anticipate that current demographic trends will give me further opportunities to address the position of special needs pupils in 1994 and I am currently considering ways of using these trends to best advantage in areas such as remedial teaching.</P>
      <P>Remedial posts are allocated on the basis of priority of need, following the collection of data from schools by my Department's inspectorate.  I will be keeping the question of further need in this area under review.  The needs of all schools, including schools in County Clare, will be considered in the context of this development.</P>

      <P>Due to the demands on the capital resources available, priority has been given for some time to the provision of essential teaching spaces in post-primary schools.  As a result it is not possible in present circumstances to grant aid provision of physical education facilities at existing schools without such facilities. As indicated in the Green Paper, the policy of providing indoor sports accommodation in schools will resume as soon as pressure on available resources for urgent classroom accommodation has eased.</P>

    <P>Phase 1 of this programme was introduced in September 1992 and targeted schools with enrolments of 500 pupils or more which did not have caretaking and-or <Col N="708" /> clerical services already.  Phase 2, implemented in September 1993, using the same criteria, catered for schools with 400 + pupils, as well as making special provision for schools in designated disadvantaged areas and special schools.</P>
    <P>At this stage it is not possible to indicate when the school might expect to receive assistance under any subsequent phase of the programme.  I should add that the arrangements arising from the programme are complemented by provisions for clerical and caretaking services under the social employment scheme.</P>
