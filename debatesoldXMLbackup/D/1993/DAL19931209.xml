      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a notice of motion under Standing Order 30 from Deputy Doyle.  I call on the Deputy to state the matter of which she has given notice to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to request the Adjournment of the Dáil to debate the specific and urgent matter of the rejection of the National Development Plan 1994-99 by the European Commission due to the failure to comply with Framework Regulation 2081 of 1993 on Integrated Environmental Assessment Plans.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 7, 3 and 4.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: (1) business shall be interrupted not later than 4.45 p.m. today; (2) <Col N="3" /> No. 7 shall be decided without debate and if a division is demanded thereon it shall be taken forthwith; (3) the Second Stage of No. 3 shall be taken today and the following arrangements shall apply in relation the debate: (i) the proceedings thereon if not previously concluded shall be brought to a conclusion at 4.45 p.m. today; (ii) the speech of each Member called on shall not exceed 20 minutes; and (iii) the Minister for Justice shall be called upon not later than 4.30 p.m. to make a speech in reply; and (4) the Dáil shall sit tomorrow at 10.30 a.m. and shall adjourn not later than 4.00 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the proposal that No. 1, business shall be interrupted not later than 4.45 p.m. today, satisfactory and agreed?  Agreed.  Is the proposal for dealing with No. 7 satisfactory and agreed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there a mistake in the Estimates circulated for consideration which will be dealt with next week?  Perhaps the Minister will make an announcement in this regard this morning. There is an additional Supplementary Estimate of £18,000 for the Office of the Minister for Justice and £377,000 for the Garda Síochána, neither of which represent salaries.  An article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> today stated that an additional £40 million will be spent on a crime package.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us whether these Estimates are accurate or whether there is some sort of disinformation campaign.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>On No. 7, is there not something incongruous in taking a vote today on an Estimate that has yet to be discussed in special committee, the day after the announcement by the OECD that we have the largest class sizes in Europe?  Surely it is putting the cart before the horse to decide the Estimate and to debate it next week in committee? It is obvious there is a major crisis in relation to the numbers in classrooms.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the case that we will simply consider the Estimates in committee and, having accepted them today, they cannot be voted on in special committee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should be well aware that he can vote on the Estimates next week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to be disorderly in questioning your ruling, a Cheann Comhairle, but I am very disappointed you did not see fit to accept Deputy Avril Doyle's motion under Standing Order 30, in view of the dire consequences of the non-acceptance of the national plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should ask the Department of the Environment officials who are dealing with the plan whether that is so.  The Minister was told on 14 October that this would happen, and it has happened.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach make time available in the House, now that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry is here, to discuss Ireland's position with regard to GATT?  Now that the Minister has returned, one assumes he concluded negotiations.  I would like to know the Government's position on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Government thinks it can do.  One minute it says that everything we read in the papers is not true but when it suits, it makes announcements through the papers.  We do not know how the Government is running the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise two questions. In view of the fact that in the business ordered for next week there is no reference to a debate on the renewal of section 31 of the Broadcasting Act and having regard to the undertaking given to the House by the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht in this regard, I presume the Taoiseach can assure the House it is not proposed to renew section 31.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is clearly a major Bill which forms a vital part of the comprehensive programme of criminal law reform which I have under way at present.  There is widespread public support for the measures in the Bill and that it proposes some of the most powerful weapons against major criminals ever to come before this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Briefly the Bill has three main objects: first, it will enable the courts to order the seizure and confiscation of the proceeds of drug trafficking and other serious offences; second, it will create a specific offence of money laundering and require financial institutions to assist in the prevention and detection of money laundering; and thirdly, it will enable this country to co-operate with other states in the criminal field and to become a party to a number of international conventions which deal with drug trafficking, money <Col N="17" /> laundering and mutual assistance in criminal matters.</P>
    <P>All the available evidence strongly suggests that large scale crime is becoming more sophisticated in its scope with increasing international dimensions.  It has also come to be recognised that where large amounts of criminal proceeds are involved it is not sufficient that the perpetrators of crime should be dealt with merely by way of imprisonment and fines and that other measures are called for. In particular, I am referring to measures such as confiscation of criminal assets which is required to target those who reap substantial rewards from crime at the expense of others and society as a whole.  Nowhere is there a greater need for these additional measures than in the area of drug trafficking.  We all know of the tremendous profits that can be made from drugs and that this deadly trade is being carried on by evil parasites who prey on others, especially young people, for the sole purpose of financial gain.</P>
    <P>It is hard to imagine a greater threat to the quality of life both in this and many other countries that that posed by the activities of those whose business is the supply of drugs.  The reality of what happens is all to simple.  The drugs godfathers set about creating a market for their products among young &mdash; often very young &mdash; people.  Very soon those whom they have successfully targeted are addicts.  Addicts then tend to live for nothing but their next fix.  The obsession with feeding their addiction is such that over time virtually all social values go. Typically, members of the addict's immediate family will be the first to be deceived and defrauded.  Shortly after that the addict is likely to start committing crime in the community beginning with petty theft and in many cases moving on to much more serious crimes. At some point along the way the heroin drug abuser is likely to acquire the HIV virus and perhaps spread it further into the community.  Many addicts will probably end up serving increasingly longer sentences in prison as part of, in many cases, their greatly shortened life-spans. <Col N="18" /> The addicts themselves are just the immediate victims.  There is also the agony suffered by their families and friends.  Then there is the misery suffered by the community generally because of the level and serious nature of crimes committed by many of those who become addicted.  Of course, none of this is of concern to drug traffickers when they reap substantial profits from their handiwork.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides us with the opportunity to strike at the very heart of drug trafficking and other serious crime.  By enabling criminals to be deprived of their ill gotten gains we will help remove, to a significant extent, the incentive which draws people into this type of crime and, in addition, ensure that money which might otherwise have been used for criminal purposes is no longer available for such purposes.</P>
    <P>Broadly speaking, under the terms of the Bill where a person is convicted of a non drug trafficking offence on indictment the court will be able to make a confiscation order against the offender up to the amount of the benefit the court is satisfied was obtained as a result of the offence.  However, where a drug trafficking conviction is involved the amount of the confiscation order will not be limited to the benefit the trafficker has derived from a particular offence but will extend to all the profits that person has made from drug trafficking.</P>
    <P>Money laundering is another important feature of serious crime which is addressed in the Bill.  Laundering is not new as criminals have always sought to cover up the illegal origins of what is frequenlty called &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; money. However, the growing trend towards the removal of restrictions on the movement of persons and capital between countries has made it much more difficult for law enforcement authorities to keep up with criminals who have become increasingly mobile and ingenious in their attempts to conceal and disguise their criminal proceeds.</P>
    <P>I am aware there is a gap in our law due to the absence of a money laundering offence.  The Bill fills this gap by making <Col N="19" /> laundering a specific offence with very heavy penalties.  In addition, the Bill contains provisions which are designed to prevent and detect money laundering in line with the EC Directive 91/308/EEC on prevention of the use of the financial systems for the purpose of money laundering. For example, obligations are being imposed on banks and other financial institutions to carry out identity checks on customers and to report suspicious transactions to the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>The third significant feature of the Bill is that it will provide a legislative basis for this country to enter into arrangements with other countries whereby we will be able to obtain and provide assistance in criminal matters.  This will significantly ease the task of foreign investigation and prosecution agencies in cases where crucial evidence or witnesses may be in this country.  Equally, we will benefit by being able to make requests for similar assistance from countries party to the relevant international conventions.</P>
    <P>Mutual assistance arrangements between states are the subject of a number of international conventions and a measure of the comprehensiveness of the approach which we are taking is that the Bill will enable this country to become party to the most important of those conventions, namely the Council of Europe Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters (1959); the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (1988) and the Council of Europe Convention on Laundering, Search, Seizure and Confiscation of the Proceeds of Crime (1990).  It might be helpful if I were to outline briefly the nature of these conventions.</P>
    <P>The 1959 mutual assistance convention applies to a wide range of measures such as the taking of evidence for foreign courts, the service of summonses and carrying out searches for evidence required in connection with foreign investigations or prosecutions.  The United Nations Convention, which is generally referred to as the &ldquo;Vienna Convention&rdquo;, <Col N="20" /> requires states to co-operate in the fight against drug trafficking in particular in relation to the confiscation of the proceeds of trafficking.  The general thrust of the 1990 Council of Europe convention on money laundering and related matters is similar to the Vienna Convention but its scope is much broader in that it is not limited to the proceeds of drug trafficking.</P>
    <P>Turning now to specific provisions of the Bill, Deputies will appreciate that in view of its size and technical nature it would not be practicable for me to go through all of the Bill in detail at this stage.  Obviously, this is something we will do on Committee Stage.  I propose, therefore, to concentrate on the main provisions.</P>
    <P>Part I of the Bill deals with the short title, commencement and interpretation providing extensive definitions in relation to terms used later in the Bill.  Part II, which runs from sections 4 to 14, is concerned with the confiscation of criminal proceeds and is at the heart of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 4 confers power on a court to make confiscation order, on the application of the Director of Public Prosecutions, against a person who has been convicted on indictment of a drug trafficking offence.  For this purpose a drug trafficking offence is very widely defined and the definition is contained in section 3 in Part I of the Bill.  Where a court determines that the offender has benefited from trafficking it will make a confiscation order for the amount of the benefit he or she has received from all drug trafficking and not merely from the specific offence in respect of which he or she has been convicted.  The section also provides that in determining whether a person has benefited from drug trafficking or the amount of such benefit the court will apply the civil standard of proof.  In this regard I would like to emphasise that there is no question of reducing the burden of proof that the prosecution must discharge to obtain a conviction in relation to a particular offence.  That burden will remain on the prosecution, in the usual way, to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the <Col N="21" /> defendant is guilty of the offence with which he or she is charged.  However, to insist that the same burden be discharged in relation to confiscation proceedings would place an intolerable task on the Director of Public Prosecutions.  It would inevitably mean that many convicted traffickers would be able to retain a large portion of their illegal gains.</P>
    <P>Section 5 makes provision for the assessment of a defendant's proceeds of drug trafficking in connection with the making of a confiscation order under section 4.  The main feature of the section is that the court will be required to assume that all property in the hands of the defendant at the time of conviction and all income or other assets received by him or her in the previous six years were part of the proceeds of drug trafficking. It will be a matter for the defendant to show that particular assets or property were not, in fact, derived from trafficking and I believe it is appropriate that this type of burden should be placed on the defendant given the nature of drug trafficking and that the type of information involved will be within his or her knowledge.  The court will also be in a position not to apply the assumptions if it is satisfied that there would be a serious risk of injustice if they were to be applied in a particular case.  I should emphasise that where a court is satisfied that proceeds of drug trafficking arose prior to six years before the conviction these too can be confiscated: the difference would be that the same evidential assumptions would not apply.</P>
    <P>The situation where the defendant's assets are less than the amount the court assesses to be his or her proceeds of drug trafficking is covered in section 6.  If that proves to be the case the confiscation order will be made for the amount of the defendant's actual assets.</P>
    <P>The making of confiscation orders, where a person is convicted on indictment of non drug trafficking offences, is provided for in section 7.  The procedure will be similar to that in drug trafficking cases but the maximum amount of the confiscation order will be restricted to the value of the defendant's benefit from the <Col N="22" /> specific offence involved and the type of assumptions which are provided for in section 5 will not apply.</P>
    <P>Sections 8 and 9 are concerned with the provision of information by the Director of Prosecutions and the defendant in confiscation proceedings.  Section 10 includes a provision, <i>inter alia</i>, that before making a confiscation order a court can take account of a civil action that may be instituted against the defendant in respect of his or her crime and any other order that involves payment to another person, for example, a compensation order made under the Criminal Justice Act, 1993.</P>
    <P>The effect of section 11, which has to be read with section 12, is to allow confiscation orders to be made against persons who have died or absconded. These will apply where a person has been convicted of an offence on indictment but subsequently dies or absconds and also where a person against whom proceedings have been instituted absconds.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill is concerned with the enforcement of confiscation orders. Perhaps the most important point to note in this regard is that under section 15 such orders will be enforceable by the Director of Public Prosecutions in the same way as a civil debt to the State for the amount involved.  In this way the Director will be able to rely on the whole range of civil remedies available in respect of civil debts to realise and collect money due under a confiscation order.  In addition, specific provision is made to enable the court to appoint a receiver in respect of the defendant's property.  The section also makes provision for the enforcement of a confiscation order by the committal to prison of a defendant who does not comply with such an order.  The period of imprisonment to be served will be related to the amount to be paid or which is outstanding under the order and will be determined in accordance with a table at the end of the section.  Where a defendant serves a term of imprisonment under section 15 this will not affect the power of the Director of Public Prosecutions to take other action to enforce the confiscation order.  In other words, imprisonment <Col N="23" /> will not be in substitution for compliance with a confiscation order.</P>
    <P>Part III also provides, in sections 19 and 20, for the making of restraint orders by the High Court.  The purpose of these sections is to ensure that confiscation orders will not be frustrated by the transfer by criminals of their assets to other parties.  The effect of a restraint order will be to prevent any person dealing with the property covered by the order without the permission of the High Court.  The operation of sections 19 and 20 is not restricted to the situation where a confiscation order has actually been made and, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, they allow the Director of Public Prosecutions to obtain a restraint order against a person who has not yet been charged with a criminal offence in respect of which a confiscation order might be made.  To avoid alerting criminals that their property may be restrained, provision has been made to enable a restraint order to be sought without notice to the defendant.  It will be open to a defendant in restraint proceedings, or another person whose property has been affected, to seek the discharge or variation of a restraint order.</P>
    <P>I now propose to move on to Part IV of the Bill which is concerned with money laundering.  Section 27 creates a new offence of money laundering.  It is very wide in scope and will apply whether a person has laundered their own criminal proceeds or proceeds from crimes committed by others.  The maximum penalties for the offence will be imprisonment for up to 14 years and/or an unlimited fine.  This reflects the seriousness of the offence.  In addition, it should be noted that an offence will be committed where laundering is carried out in respect of criminal proceeds which are derived from crimes committed before section 27 comes into operation or from offences abroad.</P>
    <P>Section 28 obliges banks and other financial bodies whose services are likely to be used to conceal criminal proceeds to adopt measures to prevent and assist in the detection of money laundering.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="24" /> In particular, the section requires that customers be identified and that records relating to identifications and to transactions be retained in case they may be needed for money laundering investigations. These requirements are provided for in the EC Directive on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill is concerned with drug offences at sea.  The purpose of this Part is to give effect to certain provisions of the UN Drugs Convention.  Sections 29 and 30 extend the scope of our criminal law to deal with drug trafficking on Irish and other ships.  Sections 31 and 32 make provision for prosecution and enforcement matters arising out of sections 29 and 30.</P>
    <P>Part VI of the Bill makes provision for international co-operation with other countries in criminal matters.  I have already referred to various international conventions that operate in this field.  It is our intention to ratify those conventions as quickly as possible after the Bill has been enacted.  The overall effect will be to enable this country to play a full part at international level in the fight against drug trafficking and other serious crime.</P>
    <P>I do not consider it necessary at this stage to go into any great detail on Part VI of the Bill but, to illustrate the very broad nature of the provisions, I believe it would be appropriate to list the forms of assistance which are covered.  They are: the enforcement of confiscation and forfeiture orders; the service of summonses and other judicial documents; the taking of evidence for criminal proceedings; the transfer of prisoners to give evidence or assist criminal investigations; and searches for material required for foreign investigations.</P>
    <P>Part VII is, in effect, the miscellaneous part of the Bill.  There are a number of its provisions to which I would like to refer briefly.</P>
    <P>Section 44 supplements the earlier money laundering provisions by requiring the disclosure by banks and other financial bodies of suspicious transactions <Col N="25" /> to the Garda Síochána.  In addition, section 45 makes it an offence for a person to prejudice an investigation that may be under way following a disclosure made under section 44.  Section 48 allows a court to make a forfeiture order in respect of property which was used or intended to be used in the commission of an offence.</P>
    <P>Section 50 empowers a court, under specified conditions, to order a person to disclose to the Garda Síochána material which is required for the purpose of investigating serious crime or in connection with confiscation proceedings. Additional provision is made in section 51 for the issue of search warrants to allow the Garda to obtain access to information where the disclosure procedure under section 50 has proved unsuccessful or where it would not be practicable or appropriate.</P>
    <P>Sections 52, 53 and 54 provide for the payment of compensation in connection with the operation of the confiscation and related provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I have set out an outline of the main provisions of the Bill and I am confident that the Bill will be found acceptable in principle by all sides of the House.  I can assure Deputies that I will consider fully the points which they make today and during later stages of the debate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="26" /> Given the provisions which I have outlined I believe that the importance of this Bill in terms of tackling the activities of major criminals and drug traffickers in particular will be self-evident.  I am determined &mdash; and I am sure I will have the support of every Member of this House &mdash; that this country should adopt the strongest possible measures to see that we do not allow a situation where criminals can live off their ill-gotten gains. Equally, we must not allow this country to become a soft target for international crime.  I believe the Bill sends out a very clear message that we are prepared to take whatever measures are necessary to make sure that does not happen.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not be opposing the Second Reading of this Bill. However, I wish to point out that I received the Bill last Monday week.  It had been supplied to the Press the previous Thursday evening, embargoed for 1 a.m. the following morning.  That is a discourtesy to me and to Members of this House.  If, as a Legislature, we are to seriously respond to its detailed contents we should have had this Bill well in advance of Second Stage.  That is not acceptable and is contrary to what the Taoiseach promised in this House, which was that we would have at least a fortnight's notice.  In the case of a Bill of this kind, containing a number of very detailed sections, we would need more than a fortnight's notice and should have received this Bill much earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill will fail unless we have the courage and determination to pursue drug barons to their sources, that is those countries internationally which continue to export illegal drugs with impunity.  Some countries <Col N="31" /> are exporting more illegal drugs, in terms of gross national product, than they do for the whole of their legitimate products added together.  For example, in 1991 almost 4,000 tonnes of opium were produced in ten named countries which I provided in the table I have submitted for the record.  There are clear indications that Colombia, the largest producer of illicit opium is now entering the heroin business.  Heroin sources are Turkey, the golden crescent in South West Asia, where Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran adjoin, and the golden triangle in South East Asia, Thailand, Laos and Burma.</P>
    <P>With this knowledge of the content and sources of these drugs one would be forgiven for suspecting that the feeble response of the European Union is a sinister one.  Who, or what, has a grip on the European Union that it has not yet established a drugs enforcement agency along the lines of the American DEA?  Is it the Mafia or Dutch business interests? It is very clear where the drugs are going. I have documented for the record of this House where these drugs are produced, from where they emanate in large numbers and where the GNP of those countries is greater from illegal drugs than all their other products put together.  Why is the European Union not taking a diplomatic offensive against those producing countries?  It is far too late when these drugs are on the ground, endeavouring to deal with the problem at that level only.  Of course, it must be dealt with at that level but also at a macro level.  With the exception of John Cushnahan who has raised the need for a European coastguard to tackle this problem &mdash; why have our MEPs been so silent for the last four years?</P>
    <P>There is a huge drugs problem in this country with drugs being sold openly on our streets, brought into the European Union, warehoused through Rotterdam, distributed throughout the European Union, coming in boat loads directly to Britain and changing routes, without there being any macro plan to tackle the problem.</P>
    <P>I suggest to this House that there is at <Col N="32" /> least good ground for suspecting sinister reasons for the European Union not taking this enormous problem seriously, or placing it at the top of their agenda.  As one of my colleagues said to me recently, drugs distribution in Dublin has become one of the fastest growing indigenous industries.  I will not steal his thunder; I will allow him to make that point himself.</P>
    <P>Money laundering from these illegal sources is corrupting all sorts of people. The money laundered is then competing with the legitimate business community in a further distortion of society.  We must tackle this problem on a multifaceted basis.  An Irish DEA, perhaps even an Irish/British DEA, with a European DEA, is required to tackle the problem internationally, by giving incentives, or taking economic sanctions against those countries which continue to export these drugs.  The Minister gives the impression that she is in favour of a DEA but she has never given a commitment to this House that she will set up a DEA.  Is the Minister going to set it up or not?</P>
    <P>The courts should be empowered to appoint auditors to find out the resources of criminals so that these can be confiscated. That is not provided for in the Bill.  If there is to be confiscation the resources confiscated can be used to pay those auditors or inspectors, call them whatever you wish.  There is nothing in this Bill to allow the courts to appoint people to go and find out where these criminals keep their assets.  It is all very well saying to somebody who has been selling boat loads of heroin or whatever that we will take away your little bank account in such and such a building society.  What about the millions of pounds these people have seeded away outside the country, perhaps in Northern Ireland?  We need auditors so that an audit trail can be set up to find out precisely where these people keep their assets.  It is pointless giving courts the power to confiscate assets unless they also have the power to find out the full extent of those assets.  That is not provided for in the Bill and it is a substantial weakness in the Bill.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about dealing with <Col N="33" /> the alarming crime problem, much of which is related to our serious drugs problem, with drugs being sold openly on the streets, why is there no co-ordinated plan to fight back?  I have in mind a Cabinet sub-committee chaired by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and including the Ministers for Health and Justice.  There is no point in putting in a few more resources to deal with the problem in some areas &mdash; that is needed &mdash; but unless we are prepared to tackle the source of the 4,000 tonnes of drugs internationally, which is known and documented, we are not taking the problem seriously and we are not approaching the matter in a businesslike way.</P>
    <P>An EC sponsored Christian Democrat meeting in Santiago de Chile, in March 1992 considered drug trafficking, including an overview of illegal drug production and distribution worldwide.  Its findings, as set out by Phillippe Cosyn in a document published in May 1993, were frightening, given that the drugs barons are so well organised and the international response is so feeble.  Much of the information used in this speech comes from that conference's conclusions, including the table I have submitted.</P>
    <P>Vast criminal empires have emerged in recent years with the rise of an unprecedented drug epidemic.  These criminal empires have amassed so much money and power that they have not only become states within states, but fullfledged multinationals of crime that spread their corrupting influences all over the world.  Terrorist organisations and guerilla groups have also, for their own funding purposes or for a drugs for weapons deal, become involved in many parts of the world.</P>
    <P>The head of the United States Senate sub-committee investigating drugs trafficking, Senator John Kerry, said five years ago: &ldquo;Narcodollars are buying entire countries and altering geopolitics&rdquo;. He was speaking of the Colombian cartels which have come to dominate the cocaine trade.  These cartels are involved with the production, transportation and sale of illicit drugs &mdash; the peasant growing the coca leaf, the <Col N="34" /> chemist who refines it, the pilot who flies it to the consumer country.  Then there are the financial managers, lawyers who handle legal complications, so-called &ldquo;bagmen&rdquo; who offer bribes and launder money, and gunmen to eliminate those who get in the way.  Colombia ranks only third in the worldwide cultivation of coca leaves, the largest being Peru with an estimated yield of close to 700 tons of cocaine in 1991, and Bolivia, with 460 tons in the same year.  However, Colombia is the largest producer of cocaine since most of the coca cultivated in Bolivia and Peru is converted to paste form and is flown to Colombia for further refinement into the powdery end product.</P>
    <P>It is the business end that is not being tackled by the international community of which we are formal members.  The single biggest economic and political bloc in the world is the European Union.  We have a seat at the governing table of that Union, where the Minister for Justice sits down with other Ministers for Justice. What are they doing to tackle this problem? The answer is &ldquo;practically nothing&rdquo;. Am I being unreasonable in putting forward suggestions, doubts or suspicions of sinister involvement within the European Union when we see the response?  It will be too late when Colombia gets involved with cocaine or heroin.  God help us, we cannot handle what we have.  With their established network we are in for big trouble if that happens.</P>
    <P>The power of the cartels has not been benevolent to Colombia.  Hundreds of thousands of Colombian youths have become addicted to &ldquo;bazuko&rdquo;, a cheap form of cocaine.  Violence and corruption have devastated Colombian society, with those politicians, policemen and judges who refuse to be bribed being slaughtered in large numbers.  The cartels have terrorised the state apparatus and use paramilitary organisations and paid assassins, known as sicarios, who will kill for less than 100 dollars.</P>
    <P>There are alarming indications that the Colombian cartels are planning to expand their activities into heroin cultivation. Many countries in that region <Col N="35" /> are used as transit points for illicit drugs destined for the US and Europe.  Venezuela is emerging as an important transit country, while Uruguay, with its bank secrecy system, is thought to be a money laundering haven as well as a transit country.  Once in Europe the drugs can be warehoused and distributed easily.</P>
    <P>Let us talk about the various trails. Marijuana is the most commonly used illegal drug.  Cannabis grows in many parts of the world and its cultivation has risen steeply since the 1980s.  Mexico supplies about 70 per cent of marijuana consumed in the US, which has its own so-called &ldquo;Emerald Triangle&rdquo; production area in northern California, and about half of the world supply.</P>
    <P>South-East Asia is another cannabis growing area, with Thailand and Laos and, to a lesser extent, the Philippines and Cambodia major producing countries. In North Africa, Morocco is a producer of both marijuana and hashish, which is shipped to Italy, Spain and Gibraltar.  These are established facts. Traditional sources of heroin are: Turkey, the &ldquo;Golden Crescent&rdquo;, an area where Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan adjoin; in south west Asia, the &ldquo;Golden Triangle&rdquo;, where Thailand, Laos and Burma intersect, and in south east Asia and Mexico.</P>
    <P>Added to the producing countries is a web of numerous transshipment countries which are numerous.  It can be seen from all of this that simply tackling the drugs problem on the ground after the drugs have arrived is insufficient.  We need a multi-faceted approach, with all of this government and inter-government led.</P>
    <P>The budget for the Department of Justice this year is over £500 million.  This is not all spent on enforcement of drug laws, but a substantial amount is, since much of the mugging, robbery, burglary and petty theft which takes place is related to financing an expensive drugs habit.  In addition, the Department of Health and other agencies incur substantial expenditure.</P>
    <P>Drug abuse and trafficking brings <Col N="36" /> buyers in contact with criminals since illicit drugs are sold underground.  As well as theft, some drug users turn to prostitution as a source of drugs money and this, together with shared needles, increases the incidence of AIDS.</P>
    <P>It also promotes a culture which believes that fast money can be made and this is more attractive than honest labour in the user's or pusher's mind.  Ever younger persons are targeted by drug traffickers, both as buyers and accomplices. This has been especially true since the appearance of &ldquo;crack&rdquo; on the streets of the United States and Europe.  This highly addictive drug, which causes a strong craving for more sells in the United States for as little as $3 a vial. Drug traffickers make use of juveniles because they are rarely imprisoned for long periods and are quickly available again.  This is just another indication of the corruptiong influence of the drug business.</P>
    <P>An often ignored side effect of the drugs problem is the damage it does to the environment in the consumer and producer countries.  In producer countries, for instance, the tropical rain forest is under threat as vegetable and animal life if destroyed by chemicals used in processing drugs.  The drug epidemic also imposes enormous burdens on the economy of a country.  In the workplace, drug abuse leads to a diminished work ethos.  Innocent individuals suffer from thefts and burglaries by drug addicts who need money to support their habit and it can draw legitimate business into the drugs culture with &ldquo;underground money&rdquo; being moving into the &ldquo;above ground&rdquo; economy giving drug barons influence and immensely corrupting powers.  Add to this, the health and law enforcement costs and it can be seen that the legitimate economy can be greatly distorted by the drugs world.</P>
    <P>There are those who argue that illegal drugs should be made legal because after all alcohol is legal.  Proponents advance the following arguments in favour of legalisation of drugs: (1) the libertarian argument which questions why society should have the right to limit the freedom <Col N="37" /> of adults; (2) personal freedom: a war against drugs may cause a threat to the individual freedoms by the implementation of repressive measures, such as stringent search and seizure powers, wire tapping and so on; (3) hypocrisy of drug laws; why allow some drugs such as alcohol and not others?  (4) it does not work: despite tough laws it has been impossible to reduce drug trafficking and abuse; (5) prohibition means criminalisation; drug users, including youths, must turn to the criminal underground to buy what they want; (6) prohibition also causes a blackmarket which fosters crime at home and abroad; (7) decriminalising drugs would be good for public health, for example, it could slow down the spread of AIDS; (8) decriminalising drugs would eliminate the need for expensive law enforcement.  These are not my arguments but the arguments put forward by people who favour the legalising of drugs.</P>
    <P>The arguments against it include: (1) the moral argument: one does not solve a problem by ignoring it.  In other words, something that is wrong does not become &ldquo;good&rdquo; because one has chosen to change the label for the sake of convenience. What proponents argue is, in fact, a policy of capitulation; (2) man does not live an isolated life.  Living in a society requires living according to a set of rules and restrictions for the good of all.  Driving under the influence of alcohol is both dangerous to the individual as well as to the public, hence it is forbidden; (3) the historical argument: until the 19th century, most of the now illicit drugs were freely available.  They were prohibited and/or restricted because there was a need to do so; (4) the legalisation of drugs would, without any doubt, lead to increased consumption, as even proponents of legalisation admit; (5) it is by no means certain that allowing the free sale of drugs would put an end to organised crime which survived the abolition of prohibition in the United States; (6) legalising drugs could have some beneficial effects on certain aspects of the health situation, such as the spread of AIDS, but increased drug use would put <Col N="38" /> new stresses on the health care system; (7) legalising drugs could lead to reduced expenditure on law enforcement but could not eliminate it; increased drug use would have to be accompanied by increased testing of personnel involved in dangerous work, for example, people driving a car, and so on; (8) other social costs would remain; (9) legalising some drugs, such as marijuana and not others such as crack, would not solve the problem and could actually wither away the existing &ldquo;fire break&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Unless the Minister is prepared to look at the problem in the way that I have been advocating in his House instead of continuing with this nonsense of a fire brigade service and PR exercise she is engaged in, the drugs problem will continue. I believe we need a Cabinet subcommittee, a European drugs enforcement agency as well as an Irish drugs enforcement agency and a coastguard service to tackle the drugs problem before the drugs are on the streets.  This Bill has given a great deal of publicity to the problem but I can guarantee that unless the steps I have advocated are taken the flow of drugs will continue and the corrupting influence of the money launderers, drug pushers and other criminals will continue.  There is no evidence whatsoever that either in the national or European context that a plan of action is in place.  We are getting a public relations exercise and when the photo opportunities fade, the problem will still be there unless the Minister starts to approach the problem along the lines I have been advocating.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the drugs problem, as Deputy Mitchell has said, requires various measures but this Bill is confronting very efficiently one aspect of the scourge of drug trafficking.  On behalf of the Progressive Democrats, I warmly welcome the publication of this Bill and I wish to express my party's support for this radical measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very radical legislation, in fact it could be said to be draconian.  This draconian Bill is necessary.  The Law Reform Commission carried out a review <Col N="39" /> of the law in this area in 1987 and examined the possibility of confiscating the proceeds of crime.  It recognised that constitutionally sound legislation that brought forward such a measure would be draconian.  I do not think there is anybody in this House or a citizen in the country who would criticise this Bill for that fact because it needs to be draconian to be effective.  For as long as there has been crime and criminal activity there has been concern to ensure that criminals do not flagrantly benefit from criminal activity.  This legislation seeks to confront the injustice of the fact that crime pays and that &ldquo;criminals are laughing all the way to the bank&rdquo;.  For that reason I welcome this legislation.  I congratulate the Minister and the parliamentary draftsman for their excellent work in comprehensively covering all the angles. With the introduction of this Bill, we wil be now in compliance with our international obligations.</P>
    <P>Much intellectual investment has been made in the preparatory work in framing this Bill.  The Law Reform Commission was asked to examine the matter because of the need to comply with international obligations in relation to drug trafficking and money laundering.  As in all legislation that goes through the House, it has to be scrutinised in detail now and on Committee Stage to ensure that it is as effective as it is intended to be and that it is constitutionally sound.</P>
    <P>Members have outlined the problems in Dublin, and I am sure Deputy Gregory's contribution will give deep insights because of his deep knowledge of the problems in the inner city, which he represents.  There is good cause to be concerned about the increasing proliferation of hard drugs among young people.  What has happened in Dublin over the past 20 years has been horrific and has actually caused the loss of generations of inner city children and young adults.  Nobody will baulk at this draconian provision.  It is very welcome legislation.</P>
    <P>We have all had cause to examine the consequences of drug addiction in Dublin <Col N="40" /> because of its direct link with muggings and crime, both petty and violent.  This has prompted a desire among the general public for strong, effective legislation to tackle those &ldquo;aristocrats of crime&rdquo;, commonly known as drug barons who benefit from the misery that heroin addiction causes, particularly in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Recently I visited the women's prison in Mountjoy where of the 26 inmates 17 were IV users, heroin addicts.  Anybody who has cause to deal with socially disadvantaged areas across the city and county, and in other major urban centres, has seen the terrible social and human cost of drug addiction of our young citizens.  This legislation is one measure which seeks to confront the people who are not addicted but who make money from the proliferation of drugs.  The fact that these people are not victims but are highly organised intelligent people who have foregone a life of compliant citizenship is what makes the crime more heinous.  It is because crime pays they have become involved in international drug trafficking.  As they are so callous and calculating and are not victims of drug abuse, people feel that they are the most infamous and detested of criminals.</P>
    <P>The international perspective of the Bill has been covered in some detail by Deputy Mitchell.  The problem with regard to tracing the proceeds of the crime has undoubtedly engaged the concern of the parliamentary draftsman.  It is not clear to what extent the authorities can successfully trace the proceeds of crime so it was essential to build certain welcome presumptions into the law.</P>
    <P>Section 7 deals with the making of confiscation orders for offences other than drug trafficking but the section could be more clearly drafted.  It should list a schedule of the offences covered by this Bill.  Section 7 (4) is obscure and the language should be precise.  For example, it could be stated that where offences carry penalties over a certain number of years, the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, sets out such a distinction and a schedule.</P>
    <P>Section 7 could be improved by allowing the court to order that the defendant should pay the costs of the prosecution <Col N="41" /> where a wealthy defendant is found guilty and it is obvious that he has resources. Even if a confiscation order is not made it would be appropriate that where convicted the defendant should be made responsible for the high costs of the State in bringing the prosecution.  I may table an amendment on that at a later stage.</P>
    <P>Due to the increased sophistication of these aristocrats of crime, the need for international co-operation is paramount. This legislation enables us to take part in international conventions and comply with international regulations.  The law must be in a constant state of evolution in order to adapt to the changing sophistication of the criminal genius involved in international money laundering and drug trafficking.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides a welcome draconian power for the State to seize the proceeds of crime by allowing the Director of Public Prosecutions powers to secure the freezing of assets before a criminal trial takes place or an accused is charged.  If one thinks of civil litigation this is related to Mareva Orders and Anton Pillar Orders which have become quite common particularly in England.  The Law Reform Commission considered the law on forfeiture and seizure and considered the various search powers which were available under specific statutory provisions.  The law provides for the seizure and appropriate disposal of stolen goods under the larceny Acts but, apart from the larceny Acts, there are other statutory provisions on the forfeiture on articles and goods.  Under section 202 of the Customs Consolidation Act, 1976, custom officers are empowered to seize all goods liable to forfeiture under the Act and vehicles used in importing and dealing with them without any court order.  We have comprehensive search and seizure provisions in other aspects of the law.</P>
    <P>Section 30 of the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977, provides for the forfeiture of anything which is seen to relate to an offence under the Act, but case law has shown that difficulties arose as to whether moneys were intrinsically connected with the actual drugs supply operation. <Col N="42" /> Clearly case law has shown that wider powers are required if the prosecution authorities are to ensure that the penalties imposed for certain offences, in particular drug trafficking offences, are genuinely effective in ensuring that the commission of the offence is not profitable.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission also looked at the various search powers which now exist under the various statutory provisions which usually require an application for a warrant to a District Court Judge or a Peace Commissioner. Under section 23 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, power is given to a member of the Garda Síochána to search any person or vehicle without warrant where possession of drugs is suspected.  A similar provision exists, by virtue of section 8 of the Criminal Law Act, 1976, where a Garda suspects that an offence has been or is being committed.</P>
    <P>There are previous provisions for discovery under our civil law and our tax legislation provides powers of inspection relating to the collection of income tax, corporation tax, capital gains tax and so on.  The effectiveness of any forfeiture provisions in any legislation is largely diminished by the likelihood that once the defendant gets wind of the fact that he is being watched or is under suspicion, the assets will quickly disappear.  The key point is that until the legislation comes through there is no legislative provision of the Director of Public Prosecutions to immobilise property prior to and pending trials.  Under this Bill we are ensuring that the defendant does not anticipate prosecution in advance of the trial and deprive the proceedings of their efficacy by removing assets from the jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>The report of the Law Reform Commission indicated that it was no longer justifiable to leave the question of the freezing of the proceeds of crime to the uncertainties of the law on injunctions, Mareva, or otherwise.  It stated that if such pre-trial restraint was to be constitutional it should be based on the statute such as this which lays out clearly the circumstances and the powers involved, what must be programmed by <Col N="43" /> the prosecution and what redress there might be by way of safeguards for the person affected in the light of other constitutional rights, including the right to a fair trial, and that one is deemed innocent until proved guilty.  Those issues must be teased out and balanced in the interest of the public and the Minister and the draftsperson tackled those constitutional difficulties in this legislation.</P>
    <P>In the United Kingdom the Drug Traffic Offences Act, 1986, introduced measures to provide for the tracing, seizure and confiscation of the proceeds of drug trafficking.  In Australia and many other places throughout the world similar legislation was introduced to tackle drug trafficking and money laundering.  The United States has introduced an extensive and complex system of civil and criminal forfeiture statutes to deal with such crimes.  Other provisions of the US code have recognised situations where property could be seized without any warrant, including seizure instant to arrest.</P>
    <P>There are also extensive measures, both at State and Federal level, designed to curb money laundering by putting specific requirements on financial institutions to report certain large domestic currency transactions to the authorities. I welcome the fact that the question of money laundering is being tackled seriously in this legislation, which provides for 14 years' imprisonment and/or confiscation for such an offence.  That provision will be warmly welcomed by most people because it relates to white collar crime which to date has not been adequately responded to in this jurisdiction. The obligations placed on financial institutions in section 28 of the Bill will be warmly welcomed and will change the culture of many banks and building societies here.  In the past some banks tended to boast that mums the word in regard to certain transactions.  Such a culture must be changed and I welcome the provisions in section 28 in that regard.</P>
    <P>An aspect of the Law Reform Commission's review in this area which is not covered in the legislation relates to the <Col N="44" /> compensation of victims of crime.  In the context of the seizure of the assets of criminals this legislation provides an opportunity for the State to compensate such victims.  I spoke recently in this House about that matter and my party advocated its concern in that regard.  At present the only social response to the victims of crime, particularly in regard to him and suffering, is a voluntary body called the Irish Association for Victim Support.  We called for the restoration of pain and suffering in the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal, which was removed because of the costs involved, and no party appreciates public finance cost factors as much as ours.</P>
    <P>As confiscation procedures will apply to serious offences, the assets of wealthy criminals who have destroyed people's lives by their criminal activities could be seized with a view to compensating the victims of those crimes.  That matter could be addressed on Committee Stage. I acknowledge that the Minister is supportive of the Irish Association for Victim Support.  That association is well credited and established and to some extent is supported by the State.  Nevertheless, it needs, to expand, and in the absence of a formal State response to the pain and suffering of the victims of crime, the State should provide adequate funding for that organisation.  The association provides a good service by counselling and accompanying victims to trials who appear as prosecution witnesses.  If the State is not prepared to provide such a service it should support the voluntary organisation which has taken on the task of doing so.</P>
    <P>This is excellent legislation and confronts the logic that crime pays.  I congratulate the Minister on introducing it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome this long awaited Bill, which was promised on many occasions during the past ten years. <Col N="45" /> It certainly has been called for by Opposition spokespersons for some time now.</P>
      <P>I am not a legal expert or an expert on complicated legislation such as this. Therefore, I do not know how effective the Bill will be or how easy it will be for drug dealers to lodge their profits in bank accounts in the names of family members, friends, respectable associates or front people, making it extremely difficult to link the money with its original source, drug dealing.  Neither do I know how effective the Bill will be in confiscating assets known to be accumulated from drug dealing before the accused is convicted.  Provision is made for freezing assets, but ultimately I assume it will be necessary to convict the drug dealer before the assets can finally be confiscated. If that is not the case, I would like the matter clarified.</P>
      <P>While this legislation is necessary, from a deterrent point of view it is not the answer to the hard drugs problem.  I do not wish to take from the necessity for the Bill, but solely from a deterrent point of view the answer to the drugs problem is already contained in the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1984, where sentences of up to 14 years, and in some cases life sentences, are provided for.  Despite the huge drugs problem about which we are all aware, when did we last hear of a 14 year sentence being imposed on a drug dealer?  A life sentence has never been imposed on a drug dealer here.  I can recall when the last 14 year sentence was imposed on such a person, but it is some years ago. That is certainly not because we do not have a major hard drugs problem.  I compliment the Minister on the way she described the problem, the misery and agony it causes for the addicts and their families, in particular, and the huge spiralling crime problem linked to drug dealing.  Major drug dealers are operating here; but we do not appear to be catching or convicting them, much less being in a position to confiscate their assets, which is provided for in this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why have such heavy sentences not been imposed on drug dealers here?  Is it because of a lack of prosecutions or <Col N="46" /> because of the failure of the Judiciary to convict them?  The Minister stated that we all know the tremendous profits that can be made from drugs and the deadly trade being carried on by evil parasites who prey on others.  We are all aware of that, but are the members of the Judiciary who deal with such criminals aware of it? It is regrettable that in some instances during recent years it appears the Judiciary did not appreciate the devastation caused by those dealing in hard drugs.  When convicted drug dealers, who do not use drugs but profit from their supply, come before the courts they do not receive the full rigour of the heavy sentencing provided for by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>In my own area on the north side of Dublin every heroin dealer is known to the Garda, but it is difficult to convict them.  In recent weeks an individual &mdash; this case was highlighted in a Sunday newspaper &mdash; was convicted for supplying and possessing heroin up to a value of £100,000, but this was the exception. In that case the individual concerned did not use drugs, had never worked a day in his life; yet, he had a high lifestyle.  In the photograph carried in the Sunday newspaper he is shown enjoying himself in Italy during the World Cup while his victims were dying from AIDS or from following the use of impure heroin in the area he lives in.  He would know many of his victims.</P>
    <P>I represent an area where hard drugs are still openly on sale on street corners, in public view; where young teenagers are given heroin to smoke &mdash; I think it is called &ldquo;chasing the dragon&rdquo;&mdash; where increasing numbers of young teenagers start smoking heroin and undoubtedly move onto injecting it, thereby contracting AIDS; where children come home to their parents with bloodied syringes which they find on stairways and parks; where the local drug treatment centre has a waiting list of almost 200 addicts and where people face the horrific threat of AIDS on a daily basis.  Recently in my constituency the owner of a small business, whom I have known for many <Col N="47" /> years, was confronted by a crazed individual waving a blood-filled syringe.  He was cut with the syringe and it was found later when the blood was tested that it was HIV positive.  That is the nightmare facing many people in the inner city of Dublin and will face others in many other parts of Dublin and other cities throughout the country.</P>
    <P>This is the direct result of the activities of a relatively small number of individuals who do not use drugs themselves but who bring in heroin because they know there are huge profits to be made rapidly from the supply of heroin.  Our first priority should be to concentrate Garda resources on bringing these people to justice and handing down extremely heavy sentences.  If drug dealers are convicted and a lenient sentence is handed down the message to others will be that it is worth the risk.  However, when a drug dealer is convicted and a heavy sentence is handed down, this has an impact on others who deal in heroin in areas such as the north inner city of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I will conclude shortly as I wish to share my time evenly with Deputy Gilmore.  By and large, heroin dealers in my area draw social welfare payments; do not work; buy houses; are believed to buy shops, businesses and pubs; have new cars, regularly go on expensive holidays just like the individual who was convicted a week or two ago, have banker's cards and appear to be able to accumulate large profits with relative ease.  It is inevitable that others will follow their example when they see them getting away with it and with a high lifestyle as a result.  While I welcome this Bill, it is absolutely essential that we concentrate our efforts and resources on bringing these known individuals to justice and putting them behind bars for a lengthy period.  If we fail to do this, confiscating their assets will be of secondary importance.  That is not the priority, it must be to put those people behind bars.</P>
    <P>It is no coincidence that there is heroin addiction in poor areas such as my own. High unemployment, poor housing conditions and children dropping out of <Col N="48" /> second level education feed the heroin problem.  The areas where there are many dreadful social problems and where people, out of a sense of hopelessness, take drugs such as heroin have been represented for many years by some of the most powerful politicians in this State but they have neglected to deal with these problems and as a result we now have a major heroin problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Gregory for sharing his time with me.  This Bill has been presented at a time when we are experiencing a drugs crisis.  Recently, there was a phenomenal haul of cannabis off the coast of Kinsale with an estimated value of around £12 million.  This shows the profits that are to be made from drugs.  The figures published in the Garda Commissioner's report highlight the extent of the increase in drug related crime.  The number of drug related offences increased from 3,088 in 1991 to almost 3,500 in 1992 while the number of drugs seizures increased from 3,500 in 1991 to over 4,200 in 1992.  On top of this, the drug problem in Dublin is now worse than it was in the mid-eighties when it was at crisis levels.  As Deputy Gregory mentioned, young people are being introduced to drugs.  I have come across cases where nine year old and ten year old children were introduced to drugs &mdash; an insidious form of hooking young people to feed the profits of drug barons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a shameful gap in our law with the result that those who have benefited from drug dealing, even when convictions were secured in the courts, have been able to retain their ill-gotten gains. It must be particularly galling for members of the Garda Síochána to see those whom they know are making their living from this trade sitting in their big houses, enjoying a lavish lifestyle and laughing all the way to the bank.  Profits from the trade have often been used to develop legitimate businesses to provide a cover for drug dealing.  The Law Reform Commission confirmed what everyone suspected when it said: &ldquo;We have no doubt that a large percentage of <Col N="49" /> the proceeds of crime in Ireland is already being sufficiently laundered&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that there are people who have made huge amounts of money in this way and there have been battles in Dublin and Cork to gain control.  There is also evidence that drug traders are located here and using this country as a staging post for the drug trade in other countries.  For example, the huge cannabis haul off Kinsale was hardly intended to supply what is, after all, a limited, although growing, market for cannabis in Ireland.  It was clearly intended for a much wider, international distribution.  That is where the international dimension of some of the provisions in this Bill are very important.</P>
    <P>There has been similar legislation to this in operation in Britain since 1986 and it has resulted in the forfeiture of substantial money and assets belonging to drug dealers.  Between 1986 and 1990 £27 million in cash and assets was seized with £12.5 million alone brought in 1990. It is probably fair to say at least proportionate sums could be found in this country.  What I would like to know is what will happen to the money seized from these drug barons?  We have the experience in this country that money raised in this way disappears into the great big maw of the Exchequer and is never seen again.</P>
    <P>I would like to put a proposition to the Minister which I would like her to address on Committee Stage.  My proposal is that the moneys seized from these drug barons should be established as a fund which would be used to address the serious drug problem which we have. Deputy Gregory spoke about the 200 waiting for drug treatment.  I could tell the same story.  The area I represent, Dún Laoghaire, has had a serious drug problem since the 1980s and we have no drug treatment centre.  Young people who are on drugs, perhaps introduced to drugs at a very early age, go into the city and mix in an environment where, far from being treated for drugs, they are encountering them in a much more severe way.  The money raised from the seizure of assets should be established as <Col N="50" /> a fund to combat the drugs problem and to provide treatment.  There would be some justice in the money made from drugs finding its way back to perhaps treating the problem itself.</P>
    <P>It is somewhat ironic that we are debating this legislation at the very time the Government has extended the tax amnesty for tax cheats.  The Minister and the Law Reform Commission have drawn attention to the fact that many of these drug barons have used the money they have wrongfully raised from drug dealing to set themselves up in legitimate businesses. It is not unreasonable to suspect that at least some of the drug barons who illicitly raised money through drug dealing and then channelled it into legitimate business, or laundered it in some way, will be among those claiming this amnesty for the non-payment of taxes. What worries me about that is the provision for confidentiality in relation to the tax amnesty whereby people who declare for the tax amnesty will have no further probe made into their financial affairs. My worry is that a drug dealer, who has made big money in drug dealing and has set up some kind of legitimate business, claims the tax amnesty arising from that legitimate business will have a line drawn under his activities and there can be no further probe made into this affair.</P>
    <P>While we are passing legislation providing that when the drug dealer is convicted there will be a seizure of his assets, because of the guarantees of confidentiality in terms of the tax amnesty it may not be possible to get the evidence necessary to convict a drug baron.  I would like the Minister to address that point because I do not think it is stretching credibility too far to believe that the type of person who has no compunction about dealing in drugs and inflicting the kind of misery that drug dealing has inflicted on individuals and on communities, would be the same kind of person who would have no compunction about withholding the payment of tax to the Revenue Commissioners.  I am worried that the confidentiality associated with the tax amnesty may prevent the assembling of the kind of <Col N="51" /> evidence that would be needed to get a conviction or, having got a conviction, being able to trace the extent of the assets the individual may have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is a vital response to disturbing trends, both nationally and globally.  It is the latest in a battery of legislation from a Minister who is clearly determined to tackle the challenges crime poses for our society, and they are many.  We have already seen the Minister demonstrate her commitment in other areas of legislation which we have been discussing in the last couple of months.</P>
      <P>Let there be no doubt about the threat drugs pose for this country.  Apart from the obvious threats posed by addiction there are negative knock on effects that can prove detrimental to society as a whole.  We have only to look at the drug-ravaged cities of other countries to see the terrible fate that could befall us.  We cannot stand idly by and allow this to happen.  This Government has no intention of doing that and this legislation is a clear manifestation of the Government's determination to protect this country from the international drugs trade.  I commend the Minister for bringing it forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Cork coastline, with its abundant natural resources, should be a magnet for prosperity and, in many instances it is, particularly in the area of tourism. However, there is very real concern that this stretch of coastline could become a major drug route for Europe.  As a Deputy for a Cork constituency I am obviously greatly concerned at this possibility. I should like to pay a tribute to the Garda Síochána and the customs officers on their tremendous success in netting drug hauls over the last couple of months, worth millions of pounds.  I know I speak for all Members of the House in paying tribute to those very dedicated people for their work and their vigilance.  The results are there for everybody to see.  Their success is an indication of their utter dedication to their task.  The legislation <Col N="52" /> will provide them with a valuable back-up in their vital work.</P>
    <P>This Bill could not have been better timed because there are ominous signs that Ireland is a prime target for international drug barons.  I have already referred to the drug seizures on the Cork coast.  However, this week saw the appearance of a new dimension to the drug problem when a substantial amount of drugs was intercepted at Dublin Airport. Among this haul was quantities of crack cocaine.  This is the first time that this most deadly of drugs has been seized here.</P>
    <P>Let us tell this House about crack cocaine.  It is cheap to produce.  It is instantly addictive and utterly deadly. The growth of even a small crackaddicted population in this country would make the heroin problems of the 1980s look mild by comparison.  I do not exaggerate when I say that this drug's destructive capacity is unimaginable. We have only to look at the American experience to see what could happen.</P>
    <P>Crack is cocaine-based, comes in the form of tiny rocks and is usually sold in phials.  It can be smoked or melted down and injected.  All this may sound as if it comes from another world but we must be forearmed.  Entire communities in American cities have been wiped out as a result of this drug.  There is evidence to support that in parts of New York and Miami.  The drug has swept through communities like wild fire.  Addiction has fuelled a violent crime wave, neighbourhoods have become uninhabitable no-go areas because the drug barons' profits are so astronomical that the drug trade has no shortage of criminals ready to take up the vile business of drug dealing.</P>
    <P>I do not mean to be apocalyptic or to frighten people for the sake of frightening them, but it is important to know why we must be ever vigilant in the face of the drug trade.  Too much is at stake to ever drop our guard.  Drug barons are not strangers, or from other planets.  In many instances they live in local communities, push drugs or have young people and others acting on their behalf as drug pushers. <Col N="53" /> Many of them have families with young children or teenagers.  The fact that they are not concerned about the damage drugs cause in their communities highlights the level to which they have sunk.</P>
    <P>The financial rewards that many be gained from dealing in drugs are so great that the barons have become greedy and are prepared to go to any lengths for those gains.  Profit is the root motivation of the drug trade.  By confiscating the assets of such criminals the Minister is striking the drug barons where it will hurt them the most.  While a jail sentence is a major deterrent in itself and must continue to be imposed, because some people need to be taken out of circulation for as long as possible, the confiscation of assets will prevent drug barons from resuming or subsequently benefiting from their crimes.  Confiscation is an invaluable weapon in the war against drugs and I look forward to its swift and ruthless application.</P>
    <P>In the past drug barons here used the profits of their crimes to keep themselves and their families in the lap of luxury. They led a comfortable life far removed from the abject misery of their victims. It was a nauseous display of opulence gained through brutality and the lowest form of criminal activity.  The Minister for Justice has insured this will not happen again.  For that she is to be commended.</P>
    <P>The Bill tackles the problem of money laundering.  That is the process by which the international drug trade processes its ill-gotten gains.  It is only right that financial institutions are compelled to prevent and assist in the detection of money laundering.  They have a serious responsibility in this area and must play their part to the full.  If they do not do so, measures must be put in place to ensure they comply with the law as others must.  The House should be aware that money laundering is an extraordinary complicated matter.  It is international financial corruption of the highest order. Money laundering and drug trafficking are inextricably linked.  In two counties in Florida, Dade and Broward, banking <Col N="54" /> and drug trafficking co-exist.  It is estimated that at least one-third of all money in circulation is drug money.  That is a frightening statistic and brings home to everybody the gains to be made from involvement in the drugs trade.</P>
    <P>Sometimes a narrow view is held of the drug dealer as a criminal who sells his or her wares from the street corner That view could not be further from the truth. Drug dealing is a sophisticated international business.  It would be more accurate to compare it to a successful multinational business adept in complex financial wheeling and dealing.  The real drug dealer is not a shabby, dishevelled figure.  He or she wears expensive clothes and carries a mobile phone.  We need tough sophisticated measures to deal with such people.  This Bill is an important step in that direction.</P>
    <P>The drugs business casts its net across national boundaries.  It does not respect borders.  National legal measures alone are not sufficient; effective international action is required also.  However, this Bill gives practical expression to the reality that drug trafficking is an international business.  A measure of the comprehensive nature of this Bill is that, when enacted, it will give effect to the EC directive on money laundering.  As outlined by the Minister earlier, Ireland will be able also to ratify three international conventions in the area of drug trafficking. If we are to tackle the drug trafficking it is essential that we act in concert with other nations.  The battle must take place at all levels across boundaries, whether on the streets or in plush offices. When it comes to tackling the drug barons we must take the gloves off.  There can be no place for the faint-hearted.</P>
    <P>Under the legislation, the Minister has shown her determination, and that of our country, to tackle the enemy at home and abroad.  We owe it to future generations not to be found wanting and never to relax our vigilance in tackling drug trafficking.  The Bill is but one step forward in the fight against crime.  Much more needs to be done and the Minister will ensure that more will be done.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, there are still elements <Col N="55" /> of the system which appear to favour the criminal.  I will refer to one example which pertains to Cork.  At present offenders awaiting trial have the option to be tried in Dublin as opposed to Cork. There is no reason for that to be the case. In many cases the accused, witnesses, gardaí and members of the legal profession must be ferried to Dublin at the taxpayer's expense.  That is unacceptable. The law in one district must be as fair as that in another.  The case should be heard in the district where the offence is committed.  The offender should stand trial in that district and be answerable to the community whom he or she has offended.  I ask the Minister to consider this matter, if not in this legislation, then when introducing legislation in future. There has been widespread concern about this matter in Cork.  Allowing people to avail of that unnecessary provision slows up the judicial process and only serves to make a mockery of the law. Members of the Judiciary have referred already to this unsatisfactory position.  It is but one example of the anomalies that must be rooted out of the system to make it more effective.</P>
    <P>The Bill is welcome and timely given the real threat the international drugs trade poses for Ireland.  Obviously, the Minister is keenly aware of this threat and her concern is clearly reflected in this legislation.  All Members are concerned about our society's future.  Through the media, from listening to the radio, watching television and reading newspapers, everyone is aware of the trauma and the heartbreak suffered by the families of young people who have become involved in drugs, who in many cases have become the victims of the drug barons by distributing drugs.  We cannot allow this to continue.  We owe it to society, our young people and parents to ensure that every effort is made by this House to, for example, introduce legislation to increase the powers of the Garda to deal with this serious threat to society.  We need only look abroad to Colombia and other countries to see the length to which people are prepared to go to reap the <Col N="56" /> gains from being involved in drugs.  I am glad the Minister has taken this matter on board in a determined way and I am sure the House will support her and the Government in their efforts to deal with the problem.  When this legislation is passed people will know that they will not be alowed continue, as they have done for far too long, living off the backs of the less well off in our community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to contribute to this debate considering that to date only city based Deputies have spoken on this matter. The provisions of the Bill are so wide ranging that there is nothing to prevent me as a rural Deputy from welcoming it and congratulating the Minister on bringing into the House innovative, radical and wide ranging legislation.  This is a unique Bill in that it provides for international co-operation measures in the fight against crime and allows Ireland to ratify three important conventions.</P>
      <P>In the week that Pablo Escobar, the drug king of Medellín, Colombia, was killed, it is appropriate that as a nation we do everything possible to ensure that this country does not become a base or a delivery route for drugs and other sophisticated criminal activity as crime becomes internationalised.  As a nation we are playing our part, as a member of an international community, to assist responsible Governments throughout the free world to strengthen the arsenal of legislative instruments.  Enforcement procedures and penalties are being made available to combat what is an ever-increasing global threat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a small country we depend on international co-operation from other Governments and agencies in preventing the selling of drugs here and the use of this country as a distribution area to feed lucrative European markets.  Criminals involved in drug trafficking and other sophisticated criminal activities have massive resources available to them and easily evade detection.  Invariably they handle their operations with hands-off technique, rendering difficult, and in most cases impossible, their detection <Col N="57" /> and subsequent conviction.  While recognising the efforts of our enforcement agencies and their increasing success rate, particularly in view of recent seizures, I am not naïve in suggesting that we have been successful to a lesser degree than is ultimately desired.  Many criminals live offshore of this jurisdiction. When this Bill is passed, the necessary regulations put in place and international conventions ratified, it will be possible to curtail the activities of these criminals. Hopefully, their activities will be reduced to as low a level as possible &mdash; I agree that no level of activity of this nature is acceptable.</P>
    <P>The lead story in this week's issue of <i>Newsweek,</i> an international magazine, relates to international criminal activity and its threat to the world.  Many people may believe that in the main we live in an ordered, secure environment, free from the stresses and influences of undesirable social activity which is evident in other countries; but the signs of such activity are increasingly evident here.  City-based Deputies have outlined their experiences and I fully support their efforts and those of the Minister to combat crime.  Some people may believe that criminals of the kind we are talking about merely have a toehold in this country and that the problem is much greater in other European countries.  As the problem increases for our European neighbours, it is only a matter of time before it increases here.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Newsweek</i> identified a number of social, political and technological trends which have accelerated the internationalisation of crime.  These include the development of computers and communications technology.  Electronic fund transfer systems provide for the movement of billions of pounds around the globe in seconds.  Boats and ships may have up to date data interceptors to blot out radar and avoid monitoring.  We have seen the collapse of Communism and its replacement in the main by very weak Governments.  There also has been a decline in the significance of national borders.</P>
    <P>The article states that as much as $10 <Col N="58" /> billion of drug money is thought to be laundered through Canada and $32 billion through Britain, our nearest neighbour. That gives some idea of the amount of money involved in the drug trade, the profits to be made and the use of our financial institutions by criminals.  Considering that such a large amount of money is laundered through British financial institutions, we have to accept that we have a problem here.  About $180 million in US postal money orders cleared Panamanian bank accounts last year.  It is important to note that the US and many other countries, including Panama, have laws requiring banks to identify transactions of more than $10,000 if they look suspicious.  If these figures are accurate the picture that is painted is frightening &mdash; huge amounts of money are available for illegitimate investment.</P>
    <P>It seems unnecessary to state that banks and other designated bodies should take reasonable measures to establish the identity of any person to whom it intends to provide a service, but under the Bill there will be a statutory obligation on banks and other financial institutions to report any suspicious activity to the Garda.  On a first reading of the Bill the provisions in relation to money laundering appear to be rather weak, but in view of the ratification of the three international Conventions I am satisfied that this legislation will ensure that international criminals will think twice about using our financial institutions to launder their ill-gotten gains.</P>
    <P>Over a period of time proceeds of crime will be obtained by the State by confiscation and forfeiture orders relating to drug and other criminal offences. I fully support Deputy Gilmore's comments in this regard.  Time will tell whether those confiscated assets of criminal activity will amount to a substantial sum of money.  Assets so confiscated will have to be disposed of by the State and I assume the proceeds will go to the coffers of the Department of Finance.  The confiscated proceeds, particularly of drug trafficking, should be directed to drug <Col N="59" /> education and rehabilitation, as is the case in the United States.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand Deputy Gilmore's difficulty in relation to the tax amnesty running parallel with this legislation.  I do not believe that the tax amnesty will assist people in concealing the way in which they obtained large amounts of money because this Bill provides that banks are obliged to maintain records for a period of six years.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to Pablo Escobar. While he was the godfather of the Colombian Mafia and reputed to be the largest operator in the world drug trade, we now learn that the crude methods used by him to retain his dominant position are being used by his two brothers, Gilberto and Miguel Orguela from Cali, Colombia. These two men have been described as buttoned-up entrepreneurs with better organisational skills than had their brother, a smaller appetite for murder and ties to other mafias overseas. That cartel in Cali recently tried to lease a satellite so that its conversations could not be listened into.  The sophistication of modern day criminals involved in drug trafficking and white collar crime is a challenge which must be faced up to.  The resources at the disposal of the State to deal with this crime must be the most modern and up to date available.</P>
    <P>I welcome this radical, wide ranging and comprehensive legislation.  It is important that it is put on our Statute Book as quickly as possible so that our law enforcement agencies and courts can implement its provisions.  The detailed provisions of the Bill break new ground in terms of the concepts involved.  I hope that the Bill is found to be sound and constitutional in any challenge to it by criminals who are subject to the rigours of the law.  Having regard to the type of crime with which the Bill deals, in due course the best legal brains will be employed to mount heavy challenges to the provisions of the Bill.  I have no doubt that the Minister and her officials have put a tremendous amount of thought and work into the preparation of the Bill.  I congratulate the Minister on the very <Col N="60" /> large legislative programme she has brought before the House during the past 12 months and I wish her the best of luck in her endeavours in this regard.</P>
    <P>There are many other matters which concern us as public representatives, one of which relates to the weakness in our criminal law which allows insurance intermediaries and brokers, who have the opportunity to advertise their services, to attract large amounts of money from innocent investors.  We have seen two recent cases where well known individuals with whom funds were invested were prosecuted; but the investors were left with no redress, despite the fact that clear evidence was available to show that there was fraud, mismanagement, deceit and deception.  It is amazing that people who invest substantial sums of money with insurance intermediaries or brokers and are misled in this way can be left with no redress when the company goes into liquidation.</P>
    <P>This weakness in the law needs to be addressed.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the recent case in the High Court where the investors were left with no redress.  I know that in the banking system there is protection for a minimum sum on deposit.  I am concerned that people purporting to be professional advisers and investors who mislead investors can escape without any criminal sanction whatsoever.  I am sure this matter has been brought to the attention of the Minister and that both she and her officials are working on it.  I should like to see the introduction of some legislation which would put an end to this type of criminal activity and ensure that professional people who mislead investors are subject to the full rigours of the law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I wholeheartedly welcome this Bill.  I might have had reservations about other Bills brought before the House by the Minister but I have few, if any, reservations about this Bill, which is designed to update the law in regard to drug trafficking and the seizure and confiscation of the proceeds of drug trafficking, to extend the legislation in regard to money laundering and <Col N="61" /> to implement the international instruments in this area &mdash; the 1990 Council of Europe Convention on money laundering and on the search, seizure and confiscation of the proceeds of crime, the 1988 Vienna Drugs Convention and the 1959 Council of Europe Convention on mutual assistance in criminal matters.  We should be a bit more expeditious in translating into Irish law the provisions of EU conventions.  Perhaps this is a lesson we can learn for the future.</P>
      <P>The Bill also implements the Government's specific commitment in the Programme for Government to deal with ill-gotten gains.  I am glad the Minister has dealt with this matter during the Government's first year in office.  The Bill also implements the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission's report on the confiscation of the proceeds of crime.</P>
      <P>It is very important that we update legislation of this nature.  When drug offenders come before the court a conviction may be secured and they may spend some time in prison.  However, they are let back out on the streets again without any rehabilitation or follow up to ensure that they cannot benefit from their ill-gotten gains.  Therefore, it is extremely important that we adopt a more serious approach to this issue.  It should be remembered that crimes involving drugs are very serious &mdash; it is an international industry.  The drugs baron, Pablo Escobar, who died recently, was regarded as one of the wealthiest men in the world.  It is important therefore that this problem is dealt with in an international context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also have local problems in regard to drugs.  For the past three weeks there have been reports of cannabis being trawled up from the depths of the Irish Sea.  Apparently drug traffickers were setting up a drugs resource centre from which they could take drugs at their leisure to sell on this island or distribute to other countries.  This is how some drug traffickers operate.  They have a very well organised, strong network and they store some of their drugs in Ireland before they distribute them here and in other countries.  It should be remembered that <Col N="62" /> drugs are not produced in Ireland in any significant quantity.  This means that drugs must be brought into the country and that the proceeds from their sale go out of the country.  This problem has to be addressed in an international context. In some cases the proceeds from drug trafficking may be lodged in our financial institutions and may be used to purchase property both here and elsewhere. Therefore, it is important that we deal with the laundering aspect of the proceeds from drug trafficking.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill should be accompanied by administrative regulations which mirror the concept of co-operation advanced in the legislation.  I do not believe that we are dealing in a comprehensive manner with the problems of drug abuse, drug trafficking and drug dealing.  Our State agencies operate as independent little empires.  The Garda, the local authorities, health boards and the Department of Education all operate on different levels.  There is no comprehensive plan to deal with a problem that has been the scourge of communities in this city and elsewhere over the past decade.</P>
    <P>I wish to give an example of where I see the problem originating and how we could deal with it in a more comprehensive fashion.  Dublin Corporation allocates houses or flats to people on its housing lists and, by and large, does not monitor these allocations.  It does not determine whether the people to whom it is allocating housing have a criminal record in relation to drugs and they may house such people in the midst of a community. Even one person like that is like the bad apple in the barrel, it can very quickly rot the others.  The person housed in a flat complex or an estate will bring their friends with them, they will attract other drug addicts to the area and engage in activities that will endanger the future of young people who may become addicted to drugs.  When a flat complex or housing estate gets the name of having a drug pusher as a resident other tenants will not want to be housed there.  The corporation will then allocate another tenant to that estate or complex who may <Col N="63" /> well be involved in similar activities, and who may be a troublesome individual in terms of anti-social or criminal activities. Consequently, areas can very quickly become known as drug problem areas, where drugs are readily available and distributed and, as a result of which, whole communities can be devastated. That is what has given rise to the Concerned Parents Against Drugs.  Complaints have been made about that organisation, nevertheless we must recognise the sociological background to its formation.</P>
    <P>The local authority's approach to the problem is far from adequate but the approach of the Garda is equally unitary and independent.  The Garda will wait for a particular locality to develop a reputation as having a drugs problem because it is easier for them to get convictions if they can monitor a situation on an ongoing basis.  That means they will tolerate an undesirable situation developing, it is only when a community has lost all its means to fight back, when it is vulnerable and subject or large scale drug abuse, that the Garda take action because that is the easiest way to get convictions.  Until the Garda are prepared to intervene at an early stage, when they know drugs are being peddled, many communities will be lost to the drug trade.  Young people will become addicted, young lives will be lost, harder drugs &mdash; such as heroin &mdash; will be peddled and, of course, there is always the danger of infectious diseases such as HIV and so on.  They are the two main areas where I see the proliferation of drugs and which relate to the policy being adopted by the local authorities and the Garda.  The Eastern Health Board has also been very slow to come to grips with the problem on the streets in terms of prevention and treatment.  It has dealt with it in the context of the hospitals by providing facilities but it has not gone out into the communities where the problem exists to ensure that its services are available locally.  That is now being done but only since the new Minister for Health took office.  That was another inadequacy in <Col N="64" /> the system while the problem was developing over the past decade or more.</P>
    <P>We must reach a situation where the services of the State are available and where youngsters are aware, through education, of the dangers of drugs.  It is extremely important for the Department of Education to have an input in disadvantaged areas.  There must be provision for estates to be managed by residents; there must be a role for estate managements so that the local tenants have a say in the running and administration of their estate.  That is another way to ensure that the elements intent on selfishly making financial gains and destroying young lives are kept out of estates.</P>
    <P>We must not look simply at the provisions of this Bill in a legal capacity, all of which I wholeheartedly welcome, we must extend out administrative provisions to ensure we deal adequately with the situation on the ground.  That must be our second line of attack.  The question of assessing the benefits to a convicted drug dealer and then confiscating the assets through a court order is the ideal way to ensure that these individuals do not simply serve a prison sentence, short or long.  At present, with the problem of overcrowded prisons, sentences are very often short, these criminals can then come out of prison and enjoy their ill-gotten gains, which have been deposited in an account here or abroad or invested in property.  It is extremely important that we are in a position to deal with the property, the income, the assets and any expenditure that may have come from these illegal activities.</P>
    <P>My only concern in relation to this section is that by allowing the courts the right to make assumptions in relation to property, income and expenditure we might leave ourselves open in some way to a constitutional challenge because of the defined rights to property in the Constitution. Section 9 is of assistance in that regard because it makes it obligatory for the defendant in any action of this nature to provide information relating to any confiscation hearing.  I hope that a caveat <Col N="65" /> will assist in this matter, nevertheless I would like to hear the Minister's reply as to whether constitutional concerns must be addressed.  This is equally important in relation to money laundering.  It is one thing to invest in property or have assets in some other form in this country, it is another to be able to invest those assets in a financial institution abroad without let or hindrance.  It is a disgrace that anybody can open an account in a financial institution without having to identify themselves.  That seems to be a basic requirement to carry out a transaction in any other area.  There are Swiss accounts and offshore island accounts in respect of which all that is required is a number. There is no form of identity required which the Revenue Commissioners could follow up; that is not an obligation when opening such accounts.  It should be pointed out that that will be an obligation under the terms of the European Conventions we are now ratifying, particularly the 1990 Council of European Convention on money laundering and on the search, seizure and confiscation of the proceeds of crime.  Indeed, I wish that Convention had been ratified by us before the present Government had considered a tax amnesty.  It is my belief that it is equally criminal to evade taxes that should be rightfully paid just as it is to otherwise launder the proceeds of crime of this nature, whether by way of drug trafficking or other non-white collar crime.</P>
    <P>Once we put in place specific provisions which are also put in place by our European counterparts &mdash; designated states with which we will be co-operating mutually &mdash; for the first time it will be possible to properly chase hot money. This is money that either originated in this country or through business conducted here, when goods may have been sold abroad, but, by failing to disclare tax liability and so on, the relevant money may not have come through the system. This will be the first time we actually have had a handle on hot money so that never again will there be reason to declare anything like a tax amnesty, with a 15 per cent incentive, to retrieve money we <Col N="66" /> could not otherwise retrieve.  To my mind that is a crime against the people of this country because it deprives them of necessary assets for the provision of health, educational and other services.</P>

      <P>I have covered the major issues I had intended to cover.  One of our main concerns with this Bill is that its provisions should be extended to ships at sea.  That is important since we are an island community and drugs must come in here by sea or air.  Certainly, we have already identified large quantities coming in by sea.</P>
      <P>The other issue is that of the international conventions we are ratifying. However, there is a problem in that they refer only to European countries.  By and large the origin of most drugs imported here is non-European.  Therefore it is quite possible for assets and income to be laundered through countries with which we will have no contact and which will not be covered by these conventions of mutual assistance.  That is a problem we will have to face.  Whenever there are useful international instruments drawn up and ratified we should ensure they are incorporated into our domestic legislative provisions at an early stage so that we can take full advantage of them particularly in the case of serious crimes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>In commenting on Deputy Costello's remarks in relation to hot money, I am not sure whether the legislation about which we have spoken and passed in this House over the past three months will be of any great advantage as a deterrent to the perpetrators of crime.  I think there might be a danger that it might prove to be an incentive to people to secrete funds in various <Col N="67" /> locations worldwide in the knowledge that they can siphon them back into the State at some later stage by way of a tax amnesty.  Indeed, I would consider that the tax amnesty is an encouragement to people to do so.  I am not suggesting that the people who have availed of the tax amnesty have secreted hot money, but it must have reached some degree of temperature at some stage in order to force people who had access to such funds to relocate them in bank accounts outside this State.  I would be worried therefore that the provisions of that tax amnesty might run counter to and be damaging to the Bill before us.</P>
      <P>In regard to organised crime and how to tackle it, I congratulate the Minister on having introduced this Bill, but at the same time I question its capability to tackle the problem.  When you look at what has been occurring in recent years you discover that there have been two types of crime committed.  First, there is the petty criminal who begins in the knowledge that he or she, more especially he, can get away with it.  They will have come to that conclusion on the basis that there would not appear to be sufficient resources to tackle the problem head on and deal with it.  Probably it is recognised worldwide that this country is a softer target than most for such people. However, I should acknowledge and point out the success on the part of the Customs and Excise, the Garda and the Naval Service in dealing with these problems. But the very fact that these people keep returning time out of number, with drugs having been discovered off Cobh, on the sea bed, with drug hauls at airports, seaports and so on, is an indication of the enormous interest very powerful people outside have in this island.  These people have access to what I might describe as unlimited financial resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While acknowledging the successes of our security forces in dealing with this matter generally, some huge problem must obtain since such people keep returning time and again.  One such problem is occasioned by the huge profit margin.  Therefore, the sequestration of <Col N="68" /> such funds constitutes a positive deterrent step which will certainly make them sit up and take notice.  But when we get down to its logistics, how do we determine that such funds are hot, have been laundered and so on?  How will we trace them if we give a tax amnesty to some people in another four or five years' time? On the one hand we appear to be saying to these people: &ldquo;You should not do this; it is a very serious crime.  If you commit it we will seize your funds&rdquo;.  But, on the other hand, we also appear to say to them: &ldquo;If you commit such crimes and we do not know how you committed them, we will not seize your funds.  But, if you repatriate those funds, we will let you off with a 15 per cent tax rate&rdquo;.  That is not exactly a penalty for such people. Therefore, I am worried about the deterrent element.</P>
    <P>Let us examine the many ways and means that illegally obtained funds are being used.  There is no doubt that, in some cases, they are being used to purchase commercial property, to build up a virtual empire.  I do not want to be specific, but I am quite sure that the Minister sitting opposite and Members must have heard of rumours throughout this city and country in relation to empires allegedly built on ill-gotten gains.  I am not talking here about somebody who has fiddled the tax system but rather of somebody about whom it was alleged that they obtained their large resources by totally illegal means, in some cases through force, and that those funds were used subsequently to fund criminal organisations.</P>
    <P>The one thing I would worry about at present is that such organisations are becoming even better at their job in that they can now afford to pay the kind of consultants necessary for the continuance of their business.  What I should like to know from the Minister is this, will the Department of Justice and the forces of law and order have the wherewithal to chase these people and to pursue them, because such people will use whatever resources are at their disposal to evade pursuit by the forces of law and order?  I perceive a difficulty there.  While the Bill may be well meaning, in practice its <Col N="69" /> logistics may prove that we will find in a couple of years' time that the resources are insufficient to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>Let us take a step further and ask ourselves the next question.  Let us suppose we are successful in seizing the funds of these merchants and we pursue them through the courts &mdash; and suppose they do not get on well, which would be unusual &mdash; and they are given a jail sentence, are we really serious about dealing with them then?  During the past number of years have we shown that we are capable of dealing with them?  Is it not true that there are not sufficient custodial places here at any time to deal with the problem of crime whether petty or serious?  The people in the business of crime on the streets day and night are aware of that and make a laugh of us.</P>
    <P>Another issue which I have raised repeatedly in this House, and which has been raised by other speakers, is the question of bail.  It has been mentioned in the UK whenever discussions on this issue take place.  There is absolutely no sense in introducing legislation which ultimately becomes an Act of the Oireachtas and expect the Garda to enforce it if the people against whom the laws are being enforced circumvent the system simply because there are not sufficient custodial places for them.  What are we at?  Is it not time we copped on to ourselves?  Are we not merely going through the motions?</P>
    <P>It requires the commitment of financial resources in that area to ensure that the people who are involved in this type of crime recognise from the start that there is a good chance they will be caught, that they will serve a hefty sentence, that there is no chance they will be released on bail and have the opportunity to go back and pursue the same activities as before, whether in drug related crime or any other type of crime.  The more organised criminals are the greater chance they have of continuing along the lines I have have described.</P>
    <P>If these people held a conference I am sure a topic for discussion would be the futility of the Houses of the Oireachtas proceeding with legislation which <Col N="70" /> attempted to deal with them when they recognise full well that they are almost above and beyond the reaches of the law. We have a serious problem which we must deal with.  I believe in the constitutional and human rights of individuals and that nobody's rights should be eroded.  We must accept that citizens have their rights.</P>

Once we get to the stage where on the one hand we believe something should be done but on the other hand believe no perceptive action should be taken which would impinge on the rights of the individuals who happen to be the perpetrators of lawlessness and crime generally we will never do anything against them.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the feasibility of enforcing the Bill.  I will support legislation that I believe is capable of dealing with a particular problem. At the outset I pointed out that I am not 100 per cent certain that this legislation is capable of so doing.  I referred earlier to the bail laws.  Is anybody in this House satisfied with our bail laws?  Can anybody honestly say to themselves that it is all right for a multiplicity of crimes to be committed by an individual and each time the individual goes back to court he is released on bail?  Long ago people should have asked if the Garda are expected to pursue such an individual.  We can blame the judges and the Garda.  Where is the sense in going before judges if, under the law, we say: &ldquo;Given this particular situation and having regard to the Constitution, your case history and so forth, it is proper that you shall be released to carry on until such time as you are proved guilty&rdquo;?  Surely there has to be a better <Col N="71" /> way.  I question whether this legislation on its own will be sufficient to deal with the problem of organised crime.</P>
      <P>The question of custodial places will have to be dealt with.  I have heard various spokespersons in this House say this costs money.  That is correct.  The problem cannot be solved without spending money.  Either we want to spend resources to deal with the problem or we do not, but we should not go through the nonsense of pretending to deal with it if we are not prepared to commit the necessary resources.  I will not go down the road of dealing with the various types of custodial places which are necessary. Am I running short on time?</P>

I hope we will not say in four or five years time that it would have been good legislation if sufficient custodial places had been available or if other actions had been taken in relation to bail laws and so on, which would also have been of major importance in dealing with this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Durkan for sharing his time with me.  I welcome this Bill but everything depends on how the Bill will be put into operation.  My colleague referred to the issue of custodial places.  It is ridiculous that real criminals can be put in jail for only a few days while somebody who has not paid a fine or owes money is committed to prison for the specified number of days. A new method must be found to allow <Col N="72" /> prison places to be available for real criminals.  If we do not take the drug barons seriously, and those bringing in drugs which will damage our children and future generations, we will be in grave trouble.</P>
      <P>There is also the question of the massive sums of money which accrue from this project and what is done with it.  I was glad to hear Deputy Costello say he was worried that this legislation did not come into operation prior to the tax amnesty.  The tax amnesty provided a way round the system for drug barons as they did not have to declare where the money came from.  They were able to avail of the 15 per cent tax rate.  I hope they will not be assured by this Government that if they watch where they put their money for the next five years they will get another amnesty.  There is the whole question of drugs being used to pressure humans and encouraging addiction among the youth, but there is also the issue of angel dust and other drugs which are abused by some members of the farming community.  This is equally as serious and in need of censure.  I accept the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry is making every effort in this regard.</P>
      <P>It all comes back to the necessity to enforce the legislation and to have the will to do so.  Unless we provide the wherewithal to pursue crime, it is pointless introducing legislation.  The Garda Síochána is prepared to work as hard as it can but the Force is being frustrated in its efforts.  Recently, a car parked in front of my door was taken and written off. While the gardaí do as much as they can, their efforts are frustrated by the fact that even when they apprehend the criminal, he will only spend a very short time in prison.  The turn around in prison is so fast that there is no pressure on criminals to stop committing crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has outlined the need to make provision for the seizure and confiscation of property but I wonder if it is possible to find out who owned such property.  Criminals seem to be able to find ways and means around ownership and thus are able to get off scot free. <Col N="73" /> Unless we can guarantee that people will stay in prison for the duration of their sentence there is no real purpose in catching these criminals.</P>
    <P>The Minister commented on co-operation with international bodies.  It is possible that but for that we would not have been so successful in locating the recent drugs hauls off our coast.  We need to show that we are committed to putting these people in jail and that they will be kept there until the problem has been cleared up.  We must let it be known that criminal activity, whether big or small, is taken seriously.  An old man who went to see his brother in hospital found, on his return, that travellers had called to his house and he had been robbed of £300, the only money he had.  We do not have the wherewithal to deal with this problem either.  There is a breakdown of law and order.  Recently my colleague, Deputy Enda Kenny, referred to similar happenings in County Mayo.  We need to provide the resources, the personnel and prison spaces to combat this problem.  It is not sufficient for the Minister to come into this House and utter bland statements &mdash; I do not question her commitment, but she must get the finance to provide more prison spaces.  The Minister should find another method to deal with those who are in prison for failing to pay fines or for unpaid debts.  They could easily be dealt with by deducting money from their income or social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>We want to ensure that this Bill works. My colleagues have dealt with many of the provisions of the Bill.  We hope improvements will be made during the course of its passage through the Houses and that the finance will be provided to ensure that when it is enacted its provisions will be implemented.  There is no use in passing legislation unless its provisions are implemented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and I am glad it is receiving so much support in the House.  Anyone who has had the opportunity to study its provisions will know that it is complex and would have required a great deal of time and effort <Col N="74" /> by the Minister and her Department to prepare it.</P>
      <P>It is accepted that the issues it attempts to deal with are complex and have been discussed here and internationally for a number of years.  I congratulate the Minister for Justice and her staff on bringing forward this Bill.  It will make a major contribution in our fight against drug trafficking and related crimes.  In the fight against drug abuse, a range of issues concerning drug trafficking need to be tackled.  This Bill should not be taken in isolation.  The issue of drug abuse needs to be tackled on two fronts: first, we need to try to reduce or eliminate the supply of drugs; second, in tandem with that effort, we need to try to reduce and eliminate the demand for drugs.  In this way we would be much more effective in our fight against drug abuse.</P>
      <P>On the first issue, the reduction in the supply of drugs, the Bill sets out in a very serious way to tackle it.  The seizure and confiscation of the proceeds of drug trafficking is very important and this has been called for by many people for some time.  Obviously, money laundering is closely associated with drug trafficking in addition to other crimes.  Illegal drug trafficking has been promoted through the laundering of money both nationally and internationally.  The legislation sets out the mechanism whereby this county will be able to co-operate internationally on drug trafficking, which is very important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be necessary for the Minister to examine the whole question of the seizure of assets carefully and closely because while it might appear to be reasonably simple and straight forward, any critical examination of the appropriate sections will certainly give rise to concern that the Bill might run into constitutional difficulties at some stage.  The reason I make this point is that one is talking about seizure of assets and ill-gotten gains from drug trafficking, that might involve a property or the family home.  Drug distribution can often take place from the family home, which becomes clearly identified by the local <Col N="75" /> community as a location used for that purpose.</P>
    <P>There may also be victims of drug trafficking in the home.  For example, the husband or male partner may be involved in drug trafficking despite the efforts of a wife or partner, indeed children are also involved.  If we take this legislation to its extreme, would it mean the family home would be confiscated as part of the seizure of assets?  If it had been bought through what might appear to have been moneys gained from drug trafficking or to have been considerably improved using such money, what would become of it? Would we have more victims apart from those involved in using drugs?  That issue will have to be expertly considered to ensure that a major part of this legislation does not fall at the first fence.</P>
    <P>In New York the Drugs Enforcement Agency have utilised the seizure of assets effectively, my information is that in one year alone £200 million worth of assets were seized.  Those involved at the coal face in the fight against drug trafficking and abuse in that State say clearly that the confiscation of assets is one of the best weapons they have in the fight against drug trafficking and abuse.</P>
    <P>What is the position with regard to rented property, particularly if the person who owns the property knows it has been used for drug trafficking for some time?  If a person allows property to be misused in this way will he suffer any penalty?  In dance halls in the UK and more lately in Dublin there have been what are termed &ldquo;rave&rdquo; and &ldquo;crack&rdquo; parties and convictions have been obtained against persons using drugs in those places.  What is the position with regard to that property?  Does the owner have any responsibility for allowing such practices to take place on the property, particularly in cases where a series of convictions associated with identifiable activities have been obtained over a number of months or years?  The owner of such property must be called to account and suffer some penalty in so far as the seizure of assets is concerned.</P>
    <P>At one stage warehouses were used for <Col N="76" /> such parties.  Certainly this happened in the UK and there have been a number of attempts to organise such parties, clearly identified with the use of drugs, in warehouse facilities in Dublin.  What will happen to the owner of such a facility if convictions are obtained?  Will such a property owner, who might not be directly involved in drug trafficking but who would know the intention for which the premises was to be used, suffer any penalty under the seizure of assets laws?</P>
    <P>I will be interested in hearing the Minister on these issues on Committee and Report Stages, when I hope to be able to tease them out a little further.</P>
    <P>Members representing coastal counties referred to the protection of our coastline which makes us an easy target for drug barons who have turned their attention to this country over the years.  It is generally accepted that Ireland has become something of a soft touch with regard to getting drugs into Europe.  People working in combating drug trafficking will readily confirm that.  These issues need to be teased out further to see how effective the legislation will be.</P>
    <P>The Minister will need close co-operation from other Government Departments in this work, particularly the Departments of Finance and Foreign Affairs.  Those involved in the fight against drug trafficking here recognise they have a serious problem with regard to the importation of drugs because of our long coastline.  They are being brought through our ferry ports and airports by what are referred to as &ldquo;stuffers&rdquo; and &ldquo;swallowers&rdquo; people who bring considerable amounts of drugs into the country concealed within their bodies.  In some cases drugs imported in this way have come into contact with the body internally and killed the carrier.  I raise that point because there is a weakness in the legislation with regard to detaining people at the point of entry to this country. Customs and Excise officers are unable to detain persons reasonably suspected of importing drugs in the orifices of their bodies long enough for those drugs to be expelled.  This poses a serious difficulty for the customs and excise <Col N="77" /> people.  It also relates to the detention conditions of such people who suggest they have a right to privacy and, therefore, when the drugs are expelled from the body they disappear.  That is a weakness in preventing the importation of drugs.  The Minister for Justice will require the support of the Department of Finance and, to some extent, the Department of Foreign Affairs in this area.</P>
    <P>We will need to strengthen Garda numbers involved in detecting drug trafficking and bringing those involved to justice.  Drug trafficking is becoming increasingly complex.  It is so financially rewarding that those involved are in a position to pay substantial amounts of money to avoid detection.  The Garda need special training to detect drugs which, in the old days, were easily detectable by anyone with a knowledge of drugs.  Nowadays drugs can be concealed in other products and at one stage they were concealed in pieces of paper.  It is difficult for gardaí to detect the multiplicity of ways in which drugs can be imported so they require special training. The Minister must deal with that.</P>
    <P>A reduction in the demand for illegal drugs is the second of a two-pronged approach to fighting drug abuse and drug trafficking and this is where other Government Departments will need to support the Minister in her endeavours in this legislation.  I refer particularly to the Departments of Health, Education, Finance, the Environment and Foreign Affairs.  Those Departments can make a major contribution to reduce the demand as opposed to the supply of drugs.  If that co-operation is not forthcoming the good intent of this legislation will be weakened.</P>
    <P>In that context, the Government's strategy in 1991 to prevent drug misuse was very welcome because it attempted to co-ordinate the efforts of those Departments in this area.  Therefore, a mechanism exists for the co-ordination to which I referred.  That strategy was well researched and involved the co-operation of senior export officials from those Departments.  They put in place a Government strategy to prevent drug <Col N="78" /> misuse and their recommendations included the introduction of legislation such as this.  They also recommended the introduction of other legislation which, I am sure, the Minister will deal with as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The strategy deals mainly with the questions of education, health and the environment.  The question of education is almost self-explanatory in that the Department of Education has a role to play in educating all young people to the dangers inherent in dabbling in soft drugs which almost inevitably leads to involvement in hard drugs.  That Department should ensure that young people are alerted to the dangers involved in the misuse of drugs.  The role to be played by families is also important.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health has a role to play through health education.  It must ensure it makes easily understood literature available.  I suggest that every home should receive an appropriate drugs misuse package to alert parents to the dangers of drug abuse to enable them to detect the signs when their children start to dabble in drugs, and inform them of how they should tackle the problem and of the local health services which are available.  Such a package should concentrate mainly on educating parents in detecting signs which are indicative of young people becoming involved in drug abuse.  The Department of Health has a major role to play also in helping those addicted to drugs.</P>
    <P>There is a distinct difference between a drug trafficker and an addict.  The drug addict is like an alcoholic and needs help. He or she needs to be accepted in the community and have access to local resources.  That would involve co-operation between practitioners, community social welfare workers and voluntary agencies in setting up community drug teams.</P>
    <P>We must endeavour to reduce the supply of drugs through the mechanisms I outlined and this legislation will be beneficial in that regard.  Demand can be reduced through co-operation between the Departments to which I referred.  In such a two-pronged fashion we can begin <Col N="79" /> to make an attack on the misuse of drugs here which is having unfortunate and desperate consequences for many individuals, families and communities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bree</NameTxt>
      <P>If ever there was a need to introduce legislation to take on the drug barons and their partners in crime, it is now.  Despite the the fact that much of the country does not have to face the scourge of drug pushing and addiction, in reality, it is a growing problem.  While cities such as Dublin, Cork and Limerick have increasing problems associated with drug trafficking and addiction, there is a fear in smaller cities, towns and the provinces that the scourge will eventually spread and inflict the all too common results we have witnessed in Dublin and other major urban areas abroad.</P>
      <P>Despite the best efforts of the Garda Síochána and local communities the drug barons succeeded in building up a large network whereby they can distribute their evil merchandise.  They have done so in the knowledge that even if they are apprehended and convicted the authorities will find it almost impossible to confiscate the proceedings of their criminal activities.  Therefore, the cash and profits accrued as a result of such crimes can be maintained and used by the drug barons to further develop their evil trade. That has been the position to date and I welcome the proposals to allow the authorities seize and confiscate the proceeds of drug trafficking and other serious offences.  Everybody knows that drug traffickers, pushers and dealers generate substantial amounts of money and, while they invest a proportion of such money in the drug trade, some of it is invested in other criminal activities and a large amount of it is invested in what might be described as legitimate business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is now widely recognised that the <Col N="80" /> traditional methods of dealing with criminal offences that generate substantial amounts of money, including drug trafficking, are not sufficient.  At present, our courts have only limited powers to order the seizure and confiscation of criminal proceeds and the proposal in this legislation to extend that power to all cases where a person is convicted of an offence on indictment is very welcome.  Too many families and communities have suffered at the hands of drug traffickers and pushers and if evidence is required we have only to look at the city of Dublin to learn at first hand of the destruction and havoc caused by the drug barons.  Young people in their prime are being destroyed as a result of drug addiction.  Families are being ruined.  Increasingly, addicts are turning to crime to obtain funds to pay for their supplies and some areas of our capital city have been reduced to &ldquo;no go&rdquo; areas as a result of the criminal activities of drug pushers.</P>
    <P>While this legislation may not provide all the answers, I have no doubt it will be warmly welcomed by the law enforcing agencies.  When this Bill is placed on the Statute Book it will provide the Garda and the courts with real powers to take on the drug traffickers and others involved in serious crime.  It will help to ensure that persons who derive advantage or benefit from offences committed in this State can be held liable in future.  I welcome, in particular, the inclusion of the provision whereby the law will provide for the liability of individual company directors for offences committed by the company.</P>
    <P>For far too long the godfathers of the drug trade have used so-called legitimate trading companies to launder the proceeds of their drug trafficking.  For far too long also the godfathers have been able to invest a portion of their profits in legitimate businesses.  The legislation before us today when enacted will greatly hamper the activities of drug traffickers. An Opposition Deputy expressed concern at the large quantities of drugs seized at various coves, ports and airports in recent years.  We are all concerned in that regard, but we should be pleased also because it is an indication of the <Col N="81" /> professional capacity of the Garda Síochána, the Customs and Excise and the Naval Service to successfully block the illegal importation of drugs.</P>
    <P>If we can take on the godfathers, apprehend and convict them and, more importantly, if as a result of this legislation we can seize and confiscate the proceeds of their evil activities, we will have gone a long way towards reducing their influence in our society.  If ever there was a need for such legislation, it is now and I congratulate the Minister on her initiative.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMulvihill" hpid="Mr. Mulvihill Mr. Mulvihill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulvihill</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Bree for sharing his time with me.  I welcome the Bill.  In recent years there has been a frightening upsurge in the number of drug traffickers and drug suppliers operating within and through this country.  The evidence is the high number of attempted drug importations in recent times and the drug finds off Courtmacsherry and Loop Head and, more recently, in the seas off the coast of Cork.</P>
      <P>I wish to preface my remarks by paying tribute to the Naval Service, the Garda Síochána and the customs authorities for the role they have played in the battle against drugs.  This is a difficult and dangerous task but their dedication and commitment is absolute.</P>
      <P>With the removal of internal customs barriers within the European Union it is now more important than ever to update our laws pertaining to drug traffickers. Because our coastline is accessible there is a continuous risk that this country will be used as a base for drug importations into mainland Europe.  It is well known that international drug importers are increasingly using Ireland as a base and, in some cases, are resident here.  We must do all in our power to continue the fight against these people.  They are evil parasites who prey upon young people and have brought nothing but misery to so many families.  It would not be an exaggeration to state that they are living in luxury off young people who in many cases have been consigned to a life of misery.  This legislation is therefore most welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="82" /> As every one is aware, vast sums of money are made from drug trafficking, as can be seen from the estimated value of a recent drug find.  It was immoral that persons convicted of serious drug offences in the past could serve their sentences comforted by the fact that vast sums of money were held in bank accounts.  Sections 2 and 3 which deal with money laundering are essential. Those who committ drug offences are well known for their attempts to conceal their ill-gotten gains through various purchases and investments.  In many cases a number of middle men are involved in this operation.  In this respect section 27 which deals with those who launder money in the knowledge that these are the proceeds of crime is particularly important.  To my mind those who assist drug traffickers in this way are just as guilty.</P>
    <P>As the coastline in my constituency of Cork East is accessible there is a risk of drug importations.  There is no need for competition between the Garda and custom officials to gain a headline in the newspapers.  I ask the Minister of State to convey this message to the Minister as this is causing problems for both sides in the fight against drugs.  There is a need for co-operation and better back-up facilities.  In one case in Cork drug traffickers got away because the authorities did not have surveillance equipment.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay tribute to the Naval Service for their dedication in combating this terrible trade.  While members of the Naval Service are the policemen on the seas they do not have the authority to board vessels unless they are accompanied by a member of the Garda Síochána or a customs official.  The Minister should consider this aspect of the matter.</P>
    <P>The Naval Service plays a major role in tracking and intercepting vessels involved in the importation of drugs. Perhaps the best example of this is the role played by the Naval Service in the seizure of the <i>Brime</i> off Loop Head when there was £20 million worth of cannabis on board.  In particular I pay tribute to <Col N="83" /> Commander Mark Mellet and his crew for the role they played in that seizure. They did a fantastic job and, by their actions, saved the lives of many people both in Ireland and on mainland Europe. I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Bree and Mulvihill for sharing their time with me.  I warmly welcome this Bill which deals with the confiscation of the ill-gotten gains in the most vile way from drug trafficking and other criminal activities. For the first time in the history of the State it will be an offence to launder money.  Provision is also made at last in this formidable legislation for the ratification of a range of measures relating to international co-operation.  It is clear that drug trafficking is a huge international business in death and destruction.  An international response is therefore necessary.</P>
      <P>As a number of Deputies said, there is a need to provide the necessary accountancy and technical assistance that the Garda will need.  If we fail to do this they will face an impossible task in pursuing criminals.  In addition, a great burden will be placed on the Judiciary to make certain that the provisions of this Bill are implemented and that challenges are not made on spurious grounds under sections 2, 3 and 4.</P>
      <P>This morning the Minister indicated the reasons for this legislation.  The graphs contained in the report of the Garda Commissioner show clearly that the number of indictable crimes and seizures, as well as the number of arrests for drug offences, have been rising steadily since 1987.  Last year there were more than 4,000 seizures.  However, this may only be the tip of the iceberg since many crimes go undetected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and some of my colleagues referred to the destructive effects of drugs.  For example, on the north side of the city entire generations have been deeply and profoundly affected.  Like other Deputies, I have met families every member of which has HIV or full blown AIDS as a result of injecting heroin and <Col N="84" /> other drugs.  As the Minister said this morning, it is impossible to promote social values when this vile culture is allowed to take root and spread.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies mentioned that there may be constitutional difficulties in relation to property rights but how can one set this against the number of deaths and the destruction caused as a direct result of the increase in this criminal activity?  It seems to occur in waves and cycles.  It is noticeable that there is a new cycle of drug addition, particularly in the most deprived districts where there is high unemployment and other social problems.  Our constituents can tell us that children as young as eight to ten years of age are being offered different drugs.  The British Parliament is alarmed at this increase in criminal activity which seems to have spread to Dublin in recent years.</P>
    <P>There is still dissatisfaction with the way the various law enforcement agencies have dealt with drug problems in certain areas. It is astonishing that some parts of Dublin city are notorious as areas where drugs are available.  An intensified security presence has been established to deal with the problem but, perhaps after a couple of months, when that is removed, the problem will re-emerge in its worst form.  Even in other countries small districts in Dublin city are known as places where drugs are freely available and the social fabric in them is under severe attack.  I do not understand how this can arise.  The Minister, the Garda Commissioner and Assistant Commissioners, have a special responsibility for halting this development whereby it is possible to get drugs in certain areas between particular hours of the day, say, between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m. in the evening. It seems impossible to bring the people responsible to heel.</P>
    <P>Part of the problem which this Bill seeks to address, is the nature of the drug trade.  Pushers lower down the line will take responsibility for distributing most of the drugs while the godfathers stay in the background, building up large fortunes, and are not on the scene in the <Col N="85" /> districts concerned.  The Bill is specifically directed against those who have been notorious for the way they can live with total immunity and no hand being lifted against them.  I welcome particularly the sections from section 4 onwards which will enable the Director of Public Prosecutions to apply for confiscation orders.  I particularly welcome the fact that the civil standard of proof will apply and that it should therefore be possible to introduce stern measures against the chief godfathers.  I welcome also the provision in section 5 that all wealth gained for a period of up to six years before the time of conviction shall be brought within its remit and, in some cases, wealth illegally gained before that time.</P>
    <P>I am a little worried about section 8 (6) which states that we might allow certain immunities to people who are candid about their ill-gotten gains, I do not think there should be immunity on any count in relation to any criminal gains.  I welcome also the enforcements provision under which from the time this Bill is passed the godfathers of the drug industry can be hounded under the receivership process, to the end of their lives if necessary, to make certain that they do not gain from their activities.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies mentioned restraint orders and transfer of assets.  This is topical in the context of the new ethics Bill and the possibility of assets being transferred between public servants and Members of this House.  In this connection a Deputy raised the question of family homes.  I hope, in the operation of restraint orders, we will not see a notorious criminal living in a £200,000 house on the south side of the city while his minions are wreaking havoc in parts of my constituency and destroying and blighting the lives of the young people.</P>
    <P>I welcome in section 4 the introduction of the specific offence of handling illegal moneys, and the attempt to at last bring the financial institutions within the remit of legislation so that we can ascertain how moneys have been gained.  Provided the Garda, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the other agencies involved are given the necessary <Col N="86" /> resources this Bill will, I hope, be very successful.</P>
    <P>Finally, I welcome the fact that we will be working closely with other countries under international legislation.  We have seen countries &mdash; the best known one is Colombia, but there are others, countries in North Africa, South Asia, etc. &mdash; taken over by this cancer and used to destroy the social fabric of other nations.  It is only by international action that we can bring the full rigours of the law to bear on the criminals concerned.  I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is very welcome. It will provide an opportunity for a select committee of the Dáil to deal in considerable detail with the implications of what the Minister outlined this morning. The Bill deals with three major areas.  It will enable the courts to order the seizure and confiscation of the proceeds of drug trafficking, deal with the offence of money-laundering and enable the Government and courts to co-operate with courts in other jurisdictions in relation to crime and use the international conventions to deal with drug trafficking, money-laundering and associated matters.</P>
      <P>A number of contributions were about the general effects of the Bill.  It is important to understand that the drug problem is brought about because there are users of drugs.  However, if drugs were not for sale and were not being bought, they would not be used.  I recall working in New York in 1974.  The building next door to me was used as a methadone centre where methadone was distributed freely on the city bill to heroin addicts to wean them off heroin.  That was my first encounter with the consequences for young people in the prime of their lives of getting involved directly or indirectly in the abuse of drugs.  I witnessed every day a queue of young people, burnt out, decrepit, depressed, craving the daily fix.  In many cases addicts simply acquired methadone, sold it for more heroin and became even more dependent on the drug.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill should target <Col N="87" /> those who bring drugs to the street and, in a different way, those who buy them and also treat those who fall prey to the lure of drugs.</P>
    <P>There must be the will to tackle drug traffickers.  The Government must make the resources available and let it be known that there will be no backing off from enforcing the law rigorously in respect of confiscation of assets and dealing with drug barons and traffickers. There should be no mercy shown to these people.</P>
    <P>The budget available to the Drug Enforcement Association in the United States in 1992 was $811.7 million.  That gives us some idea of the huge challenge facing the American Government.  An FBI report states that a breakdown of its budget from 1981 to 1993 showed $2,216.8 million in interdictions, $1,398.5 million in investigations, $682.3 million in prosecutions &mdash; the list is endless.  The budget allocated to the Drug Enforcement Association during the years 1981 and 1993 was £11,953.1 million yet the drug epidemic on the streets of New York and other primary cities in the States is still of phenomenal proportions.</P>
    <P>There is now a growing movement in the United States to legalise drugs in many areas and take them out of the hands of the warlords, the drug barons and the drug traffickers.  That is a school of thought that has a growing appeal in the United States.  A great deal of money has been invested by the American Government in tackling this problem and heavy penalties exist for those convicted of drug offences.  In other words, notice of penalties has been given as it were to those involved in drug trafficking and drug abuse.</P>
    <P>Penalties for drug trafficking introduced on 18 November, 1988 became effective in November 1991 and the taking of anabolic steroids was also made an offence.  For example, a person found in possession of one kilogram or more of heroine or a mixture of some such drug, is subject to a penalty of not less than ten years and not more than life for a first offence and not less than 20 years and <Col N="88" /> not more than life for a second offence. Possession of 10 grams or more of LSD or some such drug mixture or 400 grams or more of Fentanyl or some such drug mixture is subject to a fine of not more than $4 million for an individual or £10 million for more than one individual.</P>
    <P>Those are heavy penalties and very large fines.  Yet all the intelligence services and the facilities made available to the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Association in the United States have failed to beat the drug barons.  Some Deputies stated that many of the drug outfits have budgets that exceed those of many countries and have legitimised their operation by using laundered money for establishing legitimate fronts to their operations.</P>
    <P>On a recent visit to Northern Ireland members of my party discussed political and law and order matters.  Sources there revealed that it is understood that a number of public houses in this city are operating as a front for the Provisional IRA.  If that information is correct it a very serious matter.  The people who frequent those public houses may not be aware of this position and if they were so aware, they might not frequent the premises.</P>
    <P>That is a matter that requires close scrutiny and investigation by the Garda and the Department of Justice.  If a number of what are deemed to be legitimate outlets in our capital city are in fact fronts for the Provisional IRA, that lends an urgency to the introduction of this legislation to deal with that position and the laundering of money.  If those public houses are fronts for moneys gained from illegal drug trafficking, arms or whatever there should be a clamp down on them. The Minister referred to co-operation with other States in criminal matters and I hope she and the Department of Justice will avail of the latest technology in tackling crime.</P>
    <P>The FBI report of 16 March, 1993 states:</P>
    <P>The FBI has produced a tested prototype of a computer system that will revolutionize the drug intelligence <Col N="89" /> analysis capabilities of the FBI.  The DIS is state-of-the-art technology that &ldquo;windows&rdquo; several different computer data bases at the same instant.  The system is user-friendly and combines advanced technologies to assist the FBI in virtually all phases of case, program, and administrative management of the Drug Program and related intelligence. The DIS is designed with strong emphasis on the dismantling of drug organizations through tracing, tracking, seizing, and forfeiting drug-derived assets.  As fully envisoned, the DIS will provide the FBI and other agencies in the drug law enforcement community with the first fully automated, programmatic, investigative drug intelligence data base in the United States.  DIS technology will be available to support a future national Drug Intelligence Center.</P>
    <P>As stated by many Deputies, our coastline is open to infiltration by small ships and trawlers.  The forces of law and order have been commended for their seizures off the Cork coast and for the amounts recovered from the seabed through trawling.  The majority of Deputies and, I am sure, 98 per cent of our population, are probably unaware of the extent of money laundering that takes place here or how serious its implications are for our society, particularly for those who have become victims of what that money was used for.</P>
    <P>A major investigation in the United States, known as &ldquo;Polar Cap&rdquo;, involving the FBI, the US Customs Service, the Internal Revenue Service and the Drug Enforcement Association, dealt with largescale money laundering operations associated with the South American cocaine trafficking organisations.  I will give an example of those operations.  The report indicates that drug proceeds were collected in Los Angeles, Houston and New York city for laundering through the jewellery business.  During a six month period 26 electronic surveillances were conducted and those coupled with source information revealed that two Los Angeles jewellery firms has been receiving armoured car shipments of boxes of <Col N="90" /> US currency on a regular basis from New York and Houston as well as from Los Angeles drug organisations.  That example highlights the practical operation of the drug laundering business.</P>
    <P>The effect of the operation was that those shipments were to appear as shipments of jewellery when, in fact, they were cash.  The Los Angeles money laundering businesses deposited close to $1 billion cash in accounts in Los Angeles area banks.  Those drug moneys were then transferred to other bank accounts in Los Angeles and New York for further transferral to accounts in Panama and Uruguay for dealing in drug areas.  On 22 February 1989 the inter-agency investigation came to an end with the arrest of 33 subjects, the execution of 39 search warrants and the seizure of $50 million in assets.  That is an example of a large money laundering operation.</P>
    <P>Given that this country did not have legislation in place to deal with money laundering under the appropriate EC Directive, it is timely that this legislation should be introduced.  It can be complex and difficult for the Department of Justice, the Revenue Commissioners and the forces of law and order to deal with the confiscation of assets and prove that assets should be confiscated.  One must make an example of those who are caught and are found to be in direct confrontation with this legislation before the impact of their offence spreads to others who may be enticed to break the law.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice and the Government should be fully aware that there is great support in the community for legislation such as this.  There is a crying need for resources to be made available to the Government so that the legislation can be implemented and the crime problem dealt with.  Under this legislation no mercy or leniency will be shown to people who take part in money laundering, drug trafficking or drug smuggling by air, personal courier or boat.  We have all witnessed the effects of drug abuse on young people.  As pointed out, many of them involved in drug abuse on the streets of Dublin have become HIV positive sufferers and a number <Col N="91" /> have died from the AIDS virus.  I am sure those people would advise others not to go down the same road.</P>
    <P>In tackling the prorblem of drug trafficking and money laundering we should ensure that our forces of law and order co-operate fully with other countries. All the necessary resources including personnel, finance and transport, should be made available to deal with it. The Revenue Commissioners should be given power to examine bank accounts where it is suspected there has been money laundering.  It should be clearly understood by those who take part in these criminal activities that the full rigours of the law will be implemented.</P>
    <P>I hope that when this Bill goes to the special committee, Deputies from all sides will fully tease out the problems and put forward proposals to make the Bill more effective.  There should be a perception that this country is not a haven for those involved in drug trafficking and a place of horror for the victims of this vile abuse and curse on humanity.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies who addressed the House during the debate and note the general welcome for the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members, through their role in their constituencies, are in many ways uniquely placed to assess the effect of the activities of criminals on our communities and to identify changes in the law which need to be made in an attempt to tackle these problems.  The Bill is one of a number of major reforms underway.  Earlier this year we passed the Criminal Justice Act which dealt with unduly lenient sentences, compensation for victims of crime and the placing of an obligation on the courts to take into account effects of specific crimes on victims.  The Criminal Law (Suicide) Act and the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act remove certain offences from criminal law.  Recently we concluded in this House a very lengthy discussion on the Public Order Bill, Second Stage of which was concluded in <Col N="92" /> the Seanad last evening.  The Criminal Procedure Bill dealing with miscarriage of justice is at present before the Seanad.</P>
    <P>The measure before the House is one of a number which the Minister for Justice has directed to be given priority.  Despite the broad scope of the measures and the complex issues which may arise it has been possible to bring before the House this legislation which has received a general welcome.  Practical problems have been raised by many Deputies which can be dealt with on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that further developments are planned in areas such as the defence of insanity, offences against the person, fraud and updating and indexation of fines.  I should also mention specifically that the Law Reform Commission report on sentencing is due to be published shortly and will give us an opportunity to deal with some of the issues referred to which are not specifically dealt with in the Bill.  Confiscation is not part of the sentence as it arises after a person is sentenced.  Therefore, it is not included in the legislation.</P>
    <P>Questions were raised during the debate about the resources made available to the various components of the criminal justice system.  That matter is being dealt with by the Minister who will shortly be in a position in the context of the 1994 Estimates to make a significant and comprehensive statement in that regard.  No doubt there will be opportunities to fully discuss what is involved.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 48 and 56 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very anxious for the early restoration of satellite TV on the Cablelink network at reasonable cost to viewers. Deputies will be aware that Cablelink's proposals for the restoration of these channels involved the use of inserted advertising.  After full consideration of the proposal, which included consultation <Col N="94" /> with a very wide range of media interests, I inclined to the view that there are options available which need not involve inserted advertising.  Ordinary advertisement included in original broadcast programmes on cable and MMDS are not, of course, affected by my decision.  If the satellite channels cannot be restored for all viewers at reasonable cost, then I would like to see a situation evolving where the maximum choice in terms of free and subscription programmes is made available to viewers. Accordingly, I have informed Cablelink that I would like these options to be explored with the satellite TV companies and I have asked that this be done urgently and jointly with all other cable relay and MMDS companies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Is the Minister aware that Cablelink was in a position to restore full service to its subscribers and pay for it by a modest £5 increase in subscriber charge, the remainder being made up by insert advertising? The option the company now faces is to increase the charge per household by £30 if it is to restore the full range of services enjoyed by consumers heretofore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the original proposal submitted by Cablelink.  As I said, I consulted a wide range of interests, including media interests, and I inclined to view that inserted advertising is not the only option available.  I have stated that that satellite channels will only become available again at a reasonable cost.  I do not subscribe to the view that the amount mentioned by the Deputy is accurate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Will the Minister agree that the advertising proposed on an insert basis will simply replace the advertising now carried and, from the Irish consumers' point of view, replace relevant advertising with irrelevant advertising?  Will the Minister state on what he founded his decision not to allow one type of advertising to be substituted by another?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been put to me very forcefully that inserted advertising on satellite TV channels would be detrimental to Irish media interests.  While it is an open question as to whether such advertising would have an adverse effect, I have to take account of that risk.  Irrespective of the arguments for and against inserted advertising, I believe the satellite TV question can be best settled through the principle of consumer choice, if it cannot be achieved through a reasonable price increase.  This is why I have asked the multi-channel industry as a whole to negotiate again with the satellite TV companies with a view to arriving at a formula which will not need inserted advertising to support the restoration of these channels.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I agree that the best way forward is to base decisions on consumer choice.  Is the Minister aware that a recent survey carried out on behalf of Cablelink by MRBI, a reputable scientific agency, established that 77 per cent of consumers want Sky News, 69 per cent want Sky One, 58 per cent want Euro Sport, 57 per cent want text and community information, 47 per cent want MTV.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i>&mdash;&mdash; 38 per cent want the children's channel and 25 per cent want the French language channel?  If we are talking about consumer choice, is the Minister aware that the days of satisfying consumer demand by confining them to the six traditional choices &mdash; the two RTE channels and the four traditional British Channels; is long gone and people now want a range of choices?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that people want a wider range of choice.  I am simply seeking to reach a position where this is provided at a reasonable cost.  I am adhering to the principle of consumer choice.  The reason this issue arose in the first place is that these channels were <Col N="96" /> previously provided free of charge to gain access to the grid.  The companies concerned now wish to put a charge on this service.  What is at issue here is the price and how this can be accommodated in terms of a general price increase to accommodate the wider consumer choice.  In the event of further choice being available, consumers should have the option of paying for it if they wish rather than imposing a general price increase across the board on every channel.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2, 3, 5, 12, 57 and 109 together.</P>
      <P>In the past number of years, the Aer Lingus Board forwarded proposals or submissions to my Department on financing issues relating to the company. Both I and my predecessors have carefully examined all such proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In our Programme for a Partnership <Col N="98" /> Government, we gave a specific commitment that we would ensure the commercial future of our national airline as part of our overall air transport policy.  I assure the House that we have taken specific action to fulfil that commitment.</P>
    <P>On the question of fares flexibility, the Deputy will be aware that, in reply to a question from Deputy Yates, on 13 February 1991, my predecessor outlined the general position in relation to Aer Lingus fare increases since 1987.  This showed that fare increases sought by Aer Lingus have generally been approved. Since 1991, all Aer Lingus applications for increases have been approved by my Department.</P>
    <P>Both I and my predecessors have consistently encouraged Aer Lingus to develop links with foreign airlines with a view to improving access to international markets as well as achieving additional earnings in areas such as maintenance, overhaul and training.  These objectives can be achieved in a number of ways such as, for example, cross shareholdings, joint venture agreements, marketing alliances and service contracts.  No proposals have been brought before me or my predecessors for a strategic alliance between Aer Lingus and any other airline. I would be favourably disposed towards any proposal which was clearly in the best commercial interest of Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>On 9 March 1993 I appointed an Executive Chairman to Aer Lingus with a mandate to develop a framework to restore the airline to commercial viability.  On 13 June 1993 the board of Aer Lingus submitted to me their proposals, entitled &ldquo;Strategy for the Future&rdquo;, to restore the Aer Lingus group to financial viability.</P>
    <P>The Government endorsed the broad strategy on 6 July last, and decided to invest £175 million equity in Aer Lingus over the three years 1993 to 1995 by way of one £75 million and two £50 million instalments subject to the following conditions: a full and comprehensive agreement having been reached between management and unions in Aer Lingus on annual reductions in internal costs <Col N="99" /> essential for the return of the company to commercial viability; production of satisfactory evidence that the necessary measures proposed are being implemented in full; a formal indication by the European Commission that it will raise no objection to the proposed State equity injections.</P>
    <P>An essential part of Aer Lingus's strategy was a modification in the Shannon stop policy to allow the airline fly direct between New York and Dublin.  When taking its decision on Aer Lingus's strategy, the Government authorised discussions with the United States authorities to amend the Ireland-US Air Transport Agreement.</P>
    <P>Formal negotiations with the US authorities were held on 27 to 29 September last.  Following some progress, these talks were adjourned as the US authorities were, in line with their international aviation policies, seeking an open skies arrangement with Ireland.  I subsequently visited Washington to meet the Secretary for Transportation, Mr. F. Pena, and to impress upon him the urgent necessity to achieve an amendment to the Ireland-US Air Transport Agreement which would provide for Shannon's interests.  Talks were resumed on 27 October last and agreement was reached with the US authorities on the following day.</P>
    <P>There was no inaction on my part on this issue.  As is evident from what I already said, I took immediate action as soon as Aer Lingus submitted a firm proposal for a modification to the Shannon stop policy and the Government had taken its decision.</P>
    <P>As regards Aer Lingus's broad strategy, I have consistently made it clear that the Government's bottom line is that the £50 million in annual savings must be achieved.  The proposed financial restructuring of Aer Lingus, while involving inevitable job losses, will offer the prospect of secure employment for those remaining with the company.  Without commercial viability, there would be no future for the airline or its employees.</P>
    <P>The Government's proposed investment in Aer Lingus is an essential part of <Col N="100" /> a once-off financial restructuring package designed to restore the airline's commercial viability within a short period. There is no question of the investment of IR£175 million being used to subsidise loss-making routes.</P>
    <P>Following the financial restructuring, the Government will require Aer Lingus to operate the airline profitably and in accordance with established principles in relation to both domestic and European Union rules.  In particular, I will ensure that the Aer Lingus Express operation will only be put in place when the company can demonstrate in full detail, on costs and revenues that such a low cost operation can operate profitably on a stand alone basis.</P>
    <P>In October 1993, a letter issued from my office to a third party, attaching a document which outlined some of the main points of the case made to the European Commission in support of the Government's proposed investment in Aer Lingus.  The document was not an internal memorandum but a note specifically prepared for transmission to the third party concerned.  The information contained in the document, and more detailed information, had been available in my Department for some time.</P>
    <P>A photocopy of the document, including a copy of the covering letter, signed by my Private Secretary, came into the possession of Ryanair.  I am certain that this photocopy did not emanate from my Department.  This is confirmed by the fact that the copy of the letter in Ryanair's document is a copy of the original signed letter which issued by post from my office.  The file copy of the letter in my Department is on plain paper with the officer's name stamped in block capitals in place of the signature.  This indicates that the letter and document were copied after they issued from my office.</P>
    <P>I should add that the information in the document, which was issued for the information of the third party only, contains nothing of a commercially or otherwise sensitive nature.  If that had been the case, it would not have been issued in the first instance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="101" /> Substantial progress has been made in discussions with the European Commission and I am confident the Government will be able to make its investment as planned.  I do not, however, intend to discuss details at this stage.</P>
    <P>I will be bringing a Bill before the Dáil next week to provide for the equity investment in Aer Lingus and related matters.  Deputies will have a further opportunity to discuss Aer Lingus at that time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I do not think the Minister added much to the sum of our knowledge in his very lengthy reply.  No doubt he is aware that one of the main causes which almost reduced Aer Lingus to bankruptcy was the fact that over several years it operated a below cost selling policy on the London-Heathrow route.  Would the Minister give this House an absolute guarantee that Aer Lingus will not revert to that practice when its balance sheet is improved by the injection of the Government's £175 million, thereby putting the company at risk once more as well as doing serious injury to any putative competition, in particular to Ryanair which is also an Irish company employing 500 people?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Aer Lingus in future will operate on a fully commercial basis.  It is a national airline operating on many routes.  Over the period of the plan, and beyond it, it will ensure that those routes are viable and are profit making.  It will compete competitively with all other airlines, Irish or non-Irish, on all their routes.  That is its commercial mandate as a body under our aegis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that at the moment Aer Lingus is pursuing a policy of deliberately under-pricing and losing money on routes where it is in competition with Ryanair and that on routes where it is not in competition with Ryanair, such as on the Glasgow and the Bristol routes, the cost of travel is substantially higher per mile and in every other respect than on routes where it is in competition with <Col N="102" /> Ryanair?  Would the Minister agree also that it is not good enough simply to say that Aer Lingus will act competitively? Taxpayers' money is being invested in a semi-State company which, if it is used in a predatory price competition war with Ryanair, will destroy 500 jobs.  The Minister said that the Aer Lingus Express is a stand alone operation viable in its own right, but would he indicate to this House precisely what steps he will take to ensure that it is publicly seen to be a stand alone operation and that there are no hidden subsidies as there were between TEAM and Aer Lingus in the past?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made it clear in the House on a number of occasions that under the restructuring proposals these will be stand-alone operations which will have full cost transparency, which is required in any event under EC competition rules.  I can assure the Deputy that Aer Lingus will not in any way act in a predatory manner simply because it is not in its own interests, apart from the interests of others.</P>

I intend to continue to a successful completion and Aer Lingus and its employees, who have negotiated the necessary cost reductions, will be allowed to engage in the tough business of aviation and I am confident they will do well.  As Minister with responsibility for transport I will seek to ensure that they be given the commercial freedom that is required to do that. Obviously, I am equally aware of the tax-payers' investment and it will be done in such a way as to ensure the future viability of the company.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that the trade unions and the management of Aer Lingus have concluded an agreement on cost cutting, including a very substantial reduction in the number of jobs in Aer Lingus, can the Minister assure the <Col N="103" /> House and, indeed, the employees and unions in Aer Lingus, that the Government's and the company's side of the bargain will not be watered down in any way and that the Government's commitment to the various aspects of the recovery plan, including the establishment of Aer Lingus Express, will be adhered to?  Could I ask the Minister also if he has received any indication from the EC Commission that it intends to impose restrictions on its approval for the package and if it has so indicated what has the Minister done to ensure that such restrictions will not apply?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is committed to the full implementation of the strategy plan which has been agreed as a result of discussions with the Congress of Trade Unions and all necessary aspects of the plan being put in place.  I want to assure Deputy Gilmore and all other Members that Aer Lingus Express, when established, will operate on a fully commercial basis in line with all other aspects of the operation.  I wish to say also to the Deputy that the application to the EC Commission for approval of the equity injection is continuing, it is ongoing and I and my officials are working hard to bring that dossier to a conclusion so that an equity injection can be made at the end of this month.  I would remind the Deputy that in relation to a State aid application, this dossier is being processed more quickly than any other ever submitted to the Commission.</P>
      <P>We are grateful to the Commission for facilitating us in that regard.  Clearly, the Commission are seeking to ensure that the equity injection is made in conformity with Article 92 (3) (c) of the Treaty of Rome.  We are putting our case clearly to them and I believe that will ensure that Aer Lingus, over the period of the plan, will be allowed do what it envisages.  That is my position.  We can achieve that in conformity with European Union competition rules and without in any way affecting the integrity of the plan.</P>

        <i>(Limerick-East):</i> Can the Minister inform the House whether the full Aer Lingus restructuring package is now on the table and whether the measures agreed between the Aer Lingus unions and the company, together with the Minister's proposals on equity in the Bill he published today, completes the restructuring process?  In particular, can he give us a guarantee that all Aer Lingus subsidiaries will continue to trade in 1994 and that there will be neither closures nor sell-offs of subsidiaries in a further restructuring of the balance sheet?  In particular, will he give some degree of hope to the employees at SRS in Shannon who believe that that subsidiary will be either closed down or sold off very shortly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is misrepresenting the strategy if he speaks about its being only an equity injection and a cost reduction plan.  The Deputy will be aware that part of the strategy to reduce the debt overhand of the company, which is in excess of £540 million, is a judicious assets disposal programme, as agreed at the meeting with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in May of last year.  It would be wrong to suggest that that is not also part of the strategy because clearly it is.  We are required to ensure that the core operations of the company achieve economic viability as quickly as possible and that the strategic interests of this country in terms of aviation matters are upheld. Clearly, a judicious assets disposal programme &mdash; as I indicated from day one &mdash; is also part of the strategy.  In relation to specific issues the Deputy raised, I am afraid they should be the subject of a <Col N="105" /> separate question.  I am not in a position to interpret what are day-to-day management affairs of the company.</P>

Can the Minister also indicate, in relation to the price policies being adopted by Aer Lingus, whether he accepts the thrust of what I said earlier, that there is a remarkable difference in the price per passenger mile charged on routes where there is no competition with Ryanair to that on routes on which there is such competition?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>In answer to the Deputy's first question, it will be a stand-alone company.  On his second question, I do not accept the thrust of his statement. From once the structuring package has been put in place, the company will operate on a fully commercial basis so as to achieve economic viability.

      <P>When the Minister states that Aer Lingus must demonstrate that Aer Lingus Express must operate on a stand-alone basis, does he mean that the Cahill plan, as presented to him, did not demonstrate it could operate on a stand-alone basis; that the question of the establishment of Aer Lingus Express is now in some doubt and that it may not go ahead, or may be delayed?</P>

      <P>I would not accept the contention or the implication in the Deputy's question.  If he refers to the &ldquo;Strategy for the Future&rdquo; plan, he will see that the company states it is its intention to follow business in all niches of the market; it refers to the requirement, for that purpose, in terms of low cost operations, to set up a new company called Aer Lingus Express which would have the requisite cost base to ensure that that <Col N="106" /> was a successful operation.  Discussions on how that would be done are a matter for the staff and management and are at an early stage at present.  That will be a matter for further discussion between the staff and management of the company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 9, 15, 16, 19, 20, 22, 24 to 28, 30 to 37, 39, 41 to 47, 50 to 53, 59 to 62, 64 to 67, 69, 70, 74 and 75 together.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware that early this year, we sent a detailed and wide-ranging submission to the UK Minister for the Environment and the UK Inspectorate of Pollution.  This submission conveyed in the strongest possible terms the Government's total opposition to the continued operation of all nuclear activities carried out at Sellafield and to any expansion of these activities.  In particular the submission expressed the Government's grave concerns about commissioning the proposed new THORP plant on the site and the proposed new levels of authorised discharges from Sellafield into the atmosphere and the Irish Sea and called for a public inquiry to be held before any decision is taken to proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 28 June, last, the UK Secretary of State for the Environment announced <Col N="118" /> that, after consideration by him and the UK Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, of the report of the Inspectorate of Pollution, it has been concluded that no points of substance had been raised that should cause them to reconsider the terms of the draft authorisations. However, because a high volume of submissions, including ours, had raised questions as to the justification for the operation of THORP it was decided to delay the commissioning of the plant until a further round of consultations to deal with the wider issues has been held.</P>
    <P>Following consideration of material published by the UK authorities, we made a second and more comprehensive submission on behalf of the Government to the UK authorities.  In addition to detailing our previously stated opposition to the THORP plant, this last submission concludes that, as THORP will serve no overall useful purpose, there is no justification for the increased risk of radiation exposure that the public will receive from the plant.  We have also concluded, in a separate detailed examination of British Nuclear Fuel's economics of reprocessing at THORP, that there are no demonstrable overall economic or security benefits arising from THORP's operation which would justify it or balance out possible and likely risks to public health and environmental damage. Copies of the full submission have been made available to Members of the Oireachtas in the Library of this House.</P>
    <P>In this submission we renewed our call on the UK authorities to hold a full, open and independent public inquiry to deal with the basic justification for operating the THORP plant in the circumstances now prevailing as well as the technical aspects of the revised discharge authorisations. The UK Secretary of State for the Environment and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, who have statutory responsibility for considering whether to hold a hearing or inquiry, will not take a final decision on this question until they have considered all submissions.</P>
    <P>I am aware of some media reports that <Col N="119" /> Germany is proposing to change its law about the management of spent nuclear fuel.  Of course, I would welcome such a development.  We raised this aspect in our second submission and challenged the claims of BNFL in its submission on the economics of reprocessing at THORP.  We pointed out in our submission that, while the contractual position of BNFL for the first ten years of THORP operation appears strong, such a change in German law would probably have a serious effect on the economic case for THORP in the longer term put forward by BNFL.</P>
    <P>I am aware also that a letter, signed by two former United States CIA chiefs and a number of other prominent Americans, including leading scientists, was sent to the UK Prime Minister which warned that THORP could encourage the spread of nuclear weapons.  We had already raised these concerns in our submission to the UK authorities and referred specifically to the concerns expressed by the US authorities and the International Atomic Energy Agency on this particular matter.  I should add that it is not intended that any fissionable material, including plutonium extracted from spent fuel at THORP, would be used for nuclear weapons and all such material will be safeguarded under the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency.  There remains a risk that such material could, nevertheless, at some time be diverted to military or terrorist uses.  For that reason we stated in our submission that there were already substantial quantities of unwanted plutonium in store and THORP would make this situation worse by adding to the stockpile and increasing the risk of nuclear proliferation.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of an environmental impact assessment on THORP the UK view is that, as approval for the construction of the plant was given in 1978, it does not come within the timeframe of the EC Directive dealing with the environmental effects of certain public and private projects which only came into effect in 1988.  In our submission <Col N="120" /> we stated that, &ldquo;given the scale and potential impact of the plant and the lapse of time and knowledge of radiation hazards acquired since planning approval for the project was given in 1978, the Irish Government considers that it would be appropriate to have an environmental impact assessment carried out now on the basis of the EC Directive as part of a full public inquiry&rdquo;.  On this aspect I am aware that, in addition to Ireland, the UK Government has received correspondence on this point from Denmark, Sweden, Norway and the Netherlands.  I am aware that the UK Government has received a letter from the EC Commission seeking information in relation to the THORP plant at Sellafield. This correspondence, however, is treated in confidence and not made available to other member states.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that, in addition to the two submissions on THORP, the Government has, on many occasions, requested the UK Government to close Sellafield and emphasised Ireland's total opposition to the plant.  Our concerns in relation to the plant have also been expressed at every available opportunity in the European Community and other international fora.  We will continue to pursue this line of total opposition.  The question of raising this matter at the European Council of Foreign Ministers is a matter for the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>While the Government has always been and continues to be committed to legal action against Sellafield if a sufficient case for it can be shown to exist, it will not initiate such action without a firm legal case based on sufficient evidence. The Attorney General has advised that any such legal action would have to be based on scientific evidence as to the injurious effects of operations at the Sellafield plant on Ireland.  In 1992 the EC Commission examined the implications of THORP and issued an official opinion that the implementation of the plant for the disposal of radioactive waste from THORP is not liable, either in normal operation or in the case of an accident, to result in radioactive <Col N="121" /> contamination, significant from the point of view of health, of the water, soil or airspace of another member state.  Furthermore there is no evidence to date to suggest that activities at the entire complex, including the proposed operation of the THORP plant, are or will be in breach of EC law and international conventions which would sustain a successful legal action.  The Government is open to information and evidence from any source to support a sustainable case regarding closure of Sellafield.  We are at present consulting with the Attorney General to decide what action, if any, may be possible if THORP is allowed to proceed without first holding a hearing or inquiry.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister cannot report any action on foot of two very significant changes for THORP.  Is the Minister aware that the two former United States CIA chiefs <Col N="122" /> indicated that Britain could be in breach of its commitments under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as a result of proceeding with THORP?  Will he agree that that may be a very significant change in the ability of the Irish Government to frame a legal case?  Would he further agree with the decision of the Germans to enact a provision which effectively requires that nuclear waste be kept at home represents a very significant shift in opinion in the states making up EURATOM which, again would give scope for Irish Government initiatives?  Why was the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Ray Burke, able to tell us that he would and could take a case on the grounds that it was wrong to export nuclear waste, it was wrong that polluters would not pay and it was wrong that the British Government was not obeying the precautionary principle?  How was he able to assure us he would take legal action but now the Minister of State has backed off?</P>

      <P>I am fully aware of the communication from the Americans to Prime Minister Major regarding the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the weapon situation.  Our position has been known internationally for decades. We have played a major role at the United Nations and elsewhere in ensuring a reduction in those weapons throughout the world.  We are consulting with our colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Attorney General on this matter.  Until we have an absolute scientific and legal sustainable basis we cannot go ahead.  To proceed without a proper case would weaken our situation.  We must be certain that we have a case.  We are very pleased that the Germans, fellow members of the European Community, have taken a decision regarding the use of spent nuclear fuels and have changed their emphasis from having it reprocessed.  That decision is of major assistance and it strengthens our case within the European Commission. We will avail of every opportunity to keep the pressure on Britain and maximise every effort to ensure we are fully informed regarding all situations. We will respond to every given situation, as rapidly as possible, based on the facts and on any legal support we can get.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>My feelings is that BNFL is totally committed, and if not it should be in another sense.  There are 46 questions on this subject today which should indicate the gravity of the situation.  Is the Minister of State aware from previous cases, such as the Cattenon case when Luxembourg took France to the European Court, that there is a strong precedent for taking legal action?  Whether we agree 100 per cent with its conclusion the fact that we take the action will be significant internationally.  Is the Minister <Col N="124" /> of State aware that the decision on this case will probably be made before the House of Commons goes into recess on 17 December?  Has he made a DG 11 complaint to the European Commission on this matter?  I commend what has been done we should do more.  Has Commissioner Flynn made a complaint to Commissioner Ioannis Paleokrassas? Does he consider that Commissioner Flynn has a particular role to play in this process on a European level given that he was a former Minister for the Environment and would have an interest in this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been very fortunate over the years since we joined the European Community that every Irish Commissioner who has been appointed to serve the Community has performed with distinction.  I am quite confident that Commissioner Flynn will give his full support to this issue as it will have an impact in the wider European context as well as our domestic situation.</P>
      <P>The Government and the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Cowen, in particular, raised this matter at every level.  It has been raised by successive Ministers for Energy in various fora.  We are in constant communication with the European Commission, we have raised the matter at the European Council, at the International Energy Agency and other energy fora throughout the world and in the United Nations.  We are totally committed and we have the full support of this Parliament which passed a motion unanimously on 1 July 1993 regarding this matter.  The Irish people are at one on this matter.</P>
      <P>As information unfolds, we respond to it and we are on top of the matter.  If there are organisations, individuals or agencies outside this House who can contribute by way of assisting us in putting forward a sustainable legal argument then, of course, we will be delighted to proceed. The Attorney General is considering the legal implications of that situation.</P>

    <P>In response to Deputy Sargent's question of course, we have taken up DG 11 with the European Commission.  I <Col N="126" /> alluded to that fact.

      <P>I apologise, a Ceann Comhairle.  In response to Deputy Callely's question, we have in place a national emergency plan for nuclear accidents, which is a plan of action designed to provide a response to nuclear accidents involving the release or potential release of radioactive substances into the environment which would give rise to exposing the public to radiation.  The plan outlined the measures which are in place to assess and mitigate the effects of a nuclear accident which might pose a radiological hazard in Ireland.  The Minister for Tranport, Energy and Communications, has overall responsibility for the plan and ensuring the co-ordination of the response of the relevant national authorities. The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland has special responsibility for monitoring radioactivity and for the provision of advice on the potential consequences of any accident and on the measures to be taken.  For example, it is responsible for a network of monitoring equipment placed all around the country. The plan was tested in October 1992 and the feedback from the participants has been invaluable in strengthening the plan so as to ensure a rapid and effective national response to a nuclear emergency. An international emergency exercise under the aegis of the nuclear energy <Col N="127" /> agency of the OECD took place in May of this year.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister recall that in the period when he was in Opposition, from 1983-86, there were stand-up rows every day in which he clearly called for the law to be taken against the UK authorities to stop the development of this plan?  When in Government, however, he is not doing this.  His party has been in Government from 1987 until 1993 and surely that is long enough to compile a legal case on this matter without having to appeal to bodies outside this House to give assistance to take a case against the UK authorities.</P>

      <Quest>whether the future energy requirements of the country are likely to be met within the context of the National Development Plan 1994-1999 in view of the current situation in respect of peat generated electricity in the midlands and projected capital investment in this area during the lifespan of the plan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the National Development Plan 1994-1999, it is proposed to provide EC Structural Funds to certain key projects in the energy sector as part of a policy of meeting Ireland's future energy needs.</P>
      <P>The investments planned for the energy sector will cater for increased demand from the economy in general, secure improved efficiency in energy supply and consumption and result in a more cost-competitive supply infrastructure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recently received a proposal from <Col N="133" /> Bord na Móna for the provision of a new 120MW peat-fired electricity generation station to be located in the east midlands region.  The Government is committed to the continued use of peat for electricity generation, provided that the cost is not excessive.  In 1992, peat constituted around 13 per cent of Ireland's power generation requirements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely an energy requirement should be determined before a commitment is incorporated in a plan?  In view of that will the Minister say whether there has been an evaluation of energy requirements, with particular regard to peat generated energy and on what basis it is proposed to build a peat generating station in the midlands as there is one already there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a need for new peat generating capacity in order to take up improved technology and efficiency which will make the generation of peat fired electricity a cost competitive fuel compared to fuels like coal and oil.  In relation to energy policy and the national plan, detailed operational energy programmes must now be submitted to the Commission for their approval so that we can find out what money will go to what projects.  Those discussions are continuing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the provision of peat fired electricity generation will be included in the operational programme. When all those issues are resolved we can examine this project, but not in isolation. It is timely that there should be a full <Col N="134" /> review of the peat industry and its contribution to our energy policy.  That is taking place at present and we must examine the general position before arriving at decisions.  Failure to find further gas off our shores will mean that resource will be depleted by the end of the century, our only native resource then will be peat, if other resources are not found.  From the point of view of security of supply, in devising an energy policy we should maximise the use of our native resources because it is economic to do so.  That proposal will be included as part of our energy policy for the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give us a projected lifespan for such a plan given that the proposed east midlands plant will replace an older plant?  Is it possible to say what the lifespan of the new plant will be?  Also, what will its lifespan be in the context of the supply of peat given the finite nature of that resource?  As the Minister said, other fuel sources are not available, will he accept that our overall energy consumption will have to be reduced unless he embarks on a programme of renewable energy instead of the finite resource of peat?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The lifespan of the envisaged plant is 30 years providing one million tonnes of peat per annum.  I will address the question of the increased demand for electricity in reply to later questions, but the provision of a new plant to meet the increased demand is only one aspect of the matter.  Of course, the demand must be met and I am at present seeking to provide for, at a minimum, a 75 megawatt capacity in renewable energy sources by 1997.  Plans for that project are underway at present.</P>

      <P>The answer to the Deputy's first two questions is yes.  In regard to his third question, the plant will be considered on its merits, but the design life of existing plans will be an important factor because, obviously, it cannot go on forever and neither can the resources to supply those plants.  If the new technology provides improved and increased efficiency it would be more cost competitive to provide that type of operation in the long-term while at the same time providing for a phased position in regard to existing plants.  The workforce in the plant will be approximately 70 people.</P>

      <P>In the course of my keynote address to the recent Light Rail '93 Conference in Birmingham, I indicated that the National Development Plan includes proposals for an EC assisted investment programme of £220 million which will enable the public transport elements of the Dublin Transportation Initiative recommended strategy to be substantially implemented by 1999.  This funding will include up to £200 million in expenditure in respect of the development of a light rail transit network in Dublin.</P>
      <P>The basic light rail system recommended by the Dublin Transportation Initiative is for lines to Tallaght, Cabinteely and Ballymun and would cost approxmately £300 million to implement. Possibilities for further extensions to the basic network will also be reported on in the final report of the DTI which will be completed soon.  The basic system cannot be constructed within the allocation of EC and other resources totalling £200 million set out in the plan.  Moreover, a longer time frame than that of the plan will be needed to complete the basic DTI network.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anticipating the agreement of the European Commission to these proposals my Department is engaged in detailed work to advise on the optimum combination of light rail links, based on the recommendations of the DTI, which should be constructed over the plan period.  All the bodies involved in the planning and provision of transportation in the Dublin area are co-operating with my Department in this work.  I expect that decisions on these issues will be taken by the Government over the coming months.  The Government's decision on the choice of light rail links will be influenced by major factors such as financial viability, congestion alleviation, levels of peak and off peak <Col N="137" /> demand, social need and ease of construction. Our objective is to be in a position to commence construction of the light rail system by early 1995.</P>

      <P>In regard to the Minister's statement that work will commence in 1995 and end in 1999, will he accept that the traffic in this city will come to a halt long before 1999 and that urgent measures need to be taken now?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the success of a strategy for dealing with traffic congestion in this city will require an integrated and committed approach by all concerned.  We need to provide structures to ensure the implementation phase of the DTI strategy is successful and that critical paths are met, not only in relation to a light rail system but to all areas of traffic management, quality bus corridors and so on.  All those matters must be addressed simultaneously if we are to deal with the matter in a co-ordinated manner.  It will be a major civil engineering feat and taking up the allocations within the planned period will require a degree of professionalism and commitment to the project.  I am satisfied that the level of consultation and the approach of the DTI in coming forward with this integrated strategy will allow us to make decisions and deal with the problem which will deteriorate unless remedial action is taken.  That is at the heart of the strategy recommended by the DTI to deal with that problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that the so-called dormitory towns of Leixlip, Maynooth and, indeed, Clondalkin are not part of the problem and that any measures to implement an LRT system ought to go further than those envisaged by the Dublin Transportation Initiative and include not only Clondalkin but other major dormitory towns such as Leixlip and Maynooth?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I should make the point that the mainline rail network also has a contribution to make on this issue.  While I do not want to anticipate the recommendations <Col N="138" /> that will be made in the final report of the DTI &mdash; we can have a discussion on this report &mdash; I am putting down a marker that, given the resources available to us under the National Development Plan, in addition to own resources, the strategy cannot be implemented within the period of the plan.  In any major city where there was a new traffic management system and an integrated transportation strategy it was implemented over a period longer than five years or, indeed, four years given that the first year is devoted to planning. I am stating, however, that a light rail network will be provided within the period of the plan while other aspects of the strategy such as a co-ordinated and integrated traffic management system will be pushed along to ensure that it is successful.  Deputies will be more <i>au fait</i> with the position in their constituencies but it is our objective to ensure that the strategy will cover all areas of Dublin. However, we do not have unlimited resources.  It is important, therefore, that we use well whatever resources are available, including those from the European Union, to ensure we get the best possible result.</P>

      <P>To take the Deputy's final question first, that will be a matter for the <Col N="139" /> Whips at the appropriate time.  Indeed, such a discussion might prove fruitful. Again, the Deputy raised a local issue. While the recommendations made will cover many areas I am saying that there will be a need to prioritise and to decide on the essential elements of a successful transportation initiative for the city.  We will be able to discuss this in more detail when the final report is presented by the strategy committee.  I should make the point that we have reiterated our commitment in the National Development Plan to public transport.  If people are to use public transport rather than their own vehicles and thereby relieve traffic congestion there is a need for an attractive alternative.  I am not in favour of restricting access on the basis that it would be far better to provide a transport system that the public would use willingly and leave their cars at home.  Clearly in providing a light rail network through the city centre road space will be restricted. Traffic management controls will be required to ensure that this proves successful. All these issues will have to be considered during the implementation phase.  I am considering what structures should be put in place to ensure that this happens in the most effective way possible.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State is outstanding in his own field.  The second interim report of the Comptroller and Auditor General concluded no such thing; in fairness to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General the Minister of State, or whoever wrote that note for him, should correct the record. Is the Minister of State aware that £966 million worth of zinc and £144 million worth of lead was exported by the company giving a total return to the State of $16 million or £11.4 million in respect of past and future royalties at the time we disposed of our remaining 25 per cent stake in the Tara ore body, the subject of the investigation referred to by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General?

I have the documentation here in which this matter involving Tara Mines is covered in great detail.  The committee, of which the Deputy is a member, was given the information but the Deputy is now seeking the same information.  It is acknowledged that there was a major weakness in the agreements initiated and concluded in the 1970s but following the appointment of an arbitrator, we were able to rectify this and, to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners and everybody involved, the State received $50 million in respect of past and future royalties.

As to whether the State has learned lessons from this, of course we have; and in any future deal there will be absolute transparency and bona fide decisions taken that will be binding on all parties so that the State gets a fair return for mineral resources in this country.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 71 together.</P>
      <P>As the House is aware, the ESB has applied for an increase in electricity process primarily to finance its proposed capital expenditure programme.  ESB's most recent proposals was for an initial increase of 3.5 per cent followed by regular annual increases related to inflation.</P>
      <P>It has been decided to examine the ESB's cost base and capital expenditure programme in detail before taking a decision on the price increase application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that if there is overcapacity in the ESB at the moment and if one of the benefits arising from a successful conclusion of the talks on Northern Ireland was a sufficient degree of peace to enable the interconnector to be reopened, the overcapacity would be even greater and therefore there is no need for further substantial capital work?  In these circumstances would he not advise the ESB to postpone any request for a further increase in the price of electricity, which, at the industrial level at least, is prohibitively high for many users?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Until the examination of the cost base and the capital expenditure programme has been looked at in detail, no decision will be taken on a price increase.  A stand alone electricity grid like ours requires some overcapacity to meet peak demands and there are a number of ways of doing that.  If the interconnector between ourselves and Northern Ireland were to reopen it would <Col N="143" /> help the situation, but it would certainly not address future need because there is an ever increasing demand for electricity in our economy, reflecting a level of output growth we all welcome.  The question is what is the best and most effective way of providing for that.  When the examination has been completed and the assessment made we will be in a better position to see what capital expenditure programme is appropriate.  The question of the opening of the interconnector is under continuing review.  As the Deputy knows, security issues come into place in determining that decision.  Should the interconnector come into operation again it would improve cash flow in the ESB by £1.5 million providing extra reserves for the ESB.  Were it to be there long term it certainly would be of benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to provide for the implementation of an EC directive which is titled &ldquo;Directive on an employer's obligation to inform employees of the conditions applicable to the contract or employment relationship&rdquo;. In summary, the Bill gives effect to the provisions of the directive in two main ways: First, it obliges employers to provide their employees with a written statement of particulars of their terms of employment and to notify them of any changes in those particulars.  Second, it provides for a system of redress for any employee who considers that he or she has been denied entitlement to information under the terms of the Bill.</P>
      <P>In introducing the Bill, I might refer briefly to the background and to the rationale for the introduction of the directive.  Over the past number of years there has been an increasing growth in non-standard forms of work which inevitably affects the employment relationships between employees and employers. These new forms of atypical work are evidenced the growth in the level of part-time work and by the growing number of persons employed in varying alternative forms of work to the traditional fulltime job.</P>
      <P>The increasing development in member states of such forms of atypical work allows employers the flexibility they need to respond to increased competition and to the demands of customers, while at the same time it provides opportunities for employment and facilitates workers who, for family or other reasons, prefer atypical working arrangements. However, the growth of new forms of work highlighted a need for the introduction of measures designed to safeguard the rights of employees and to create greater transparency in employment relationships between employers and employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="192" /> The Community Charter of Fundamental Social Rights for Workers, which was adopted at the European Council in Strasbourg in 1989, identified a number of measures necessary to promote improved working conditions for workers in the context of the establishment of the internal market.  One of the measures identified in the Social Charter was that the conditions of employment of employees should be stipulated in laws, in a collective agreement or in a contract of employment. Arising from this provision the European Commission proposed the directive here concerned which requires member states to put in place the necessary legislative provisions to ensure that employees are provided with information on the essential elements of their contract or employment relationship.</P>
    <P>In bringing forward this Bill to implement a directive which arises from the Social Charter, it is timely to refer to Ireland's position in relation to the social dimension enshrined in European Community policy.  Ireland has supported the idea of a progressive social policy in the Community and, as a signatory of the Community Social Charter, is committed to the development of a social policy in tandem with the economic objectives of the community.  We have adopted a constructive and positive approach in relation to the development of social policy, taking account, of course, of the need to avoid the imposition of costs and obligations which might adversely affect competitiveness and employment.</P>
    <P>I am aware, of course, that there is a perception &mdash; and I emphasise it is a perception and not a reality &mdash; that the development of European Community law in relation to worker protection leads to &ldquo;over-regulation&rdquo; of the labour market.  However, the initiatives in this area must be viewed in their overall context, just as the initiatives in domestic labour law must be viewed in the context of the overall packages which were agreed in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> At European Community level, the European <Col N="193" /> Council considered that in the context of the establishment of the internal market the same importance should be attached to the social aspects as to the economic and that both of those should therefore be developed in a balanced manner.</P>
    <P>As a member state committed to the dual objectives of economic growth and a progressive social policy, the implementation of this directive represents a further statement of progress in the development of our social policy. Therefore I am pleased to have this opportunity to put before the House this Bill, which puts in place the measures necessary for implementation of the directive.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the details of the Bill, one point that I would like to underline is that the Bill is primarily about the provision of information in a straightforward manner.  There is much talk of consumer rights, and that is welcome. There is talk also of the need for transparency and openness in the use of language and access to information and that is reflected in the Bill.  The main feature of the Bill is the requirement on employers to provide their employees wih a written statement of the particulars of their terms of employment.</P>
    <P>The effect of that will ensure a high level of transparency in the employment relationship.  The employee will have a clear and unambiguous statement of the terms of employment and both the employee and the employer will have a good understanding of their respective obligations to each other.  I believe that this level of clarity will be of significant benefit to both the employer and the employee, will help to avoid subsequent disputes as to the employee's and employer's entitlements and obligations and will facilitate continuing good relations with consequent smooth operation of the enterprise.  I have no doubts that in general employers recognise that the sharing of information about terms of employment, which will help to eliminate any misconception and misunderstandings about the employment relationship, represents a positive approach to proper management.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="194" /> Of course, the need for communication between both sides in relation to terms of employment and the benefits of fostering a healthy level of transparency has long been recognised here.  To be precise, for the past 20 years most employees have been entitled to a range of information, mainly under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973.  In fact, to a large extent the provisions of the directive are in tandem with the provisions of that Act.  The range of information required by the directive, and consequently by the Bill, is more extensive, however, in order to reflect the needs arising from developments in employment arrangements over the years.  It replaces and builds on existing legislative proposals and provisions.</P>
    <P>While I will deal with the provisions of the Bill, in greater detail, I would like to mention briefly some of the main differences between the 1973 Act and the provisions which have been included in this Bill in order to implement the terms of the directive.</P>
    <P>The scope of the Bill is somewhat wider than the existing legislation as it applies to all employees other than those who work less than eight hours a week or have less than four weeks continuous service. The 1973 Act, as amended by the Worker Protection (Regular Part-Time Employees) Act, 1991, excludes those who work less than eight hours a week or have less than 13 weeks continuous service and also excludes certain limited types of employments.  The range of employment particulars required to be included in the statement required under this Bill is more extensive in some respects than is currently required under the existing legislation.  The Bill introduces, for the first time, a complaints procedure which gives employees access to the Rights Commissioner and, an appeal to the Employment Appeals Tribunal if they believe that they have failed to secure their full entitlement.</P>
    <P>The system of redress which I have incorporated in the Bill reflects the requirement of the directive that member states put in place the necessary measures to enable employees who consider themselves <Col N="195" /> wronged by the failure of their employers to comply with their obligations to pursue their complaints by judicial process.  I am satisfied that the most appropriate procedure for the purpose of dealing with complaints from employees under this legislation is through access to the Rights Commissioner, with a right of appeal to the Employment Appeals Tribunal and enforcement of determinations, if necessary, in the District Court.  This procedure will allow an inexpensive and readily accessible system of redress to employees, is consistent with similar provisions contained in other relevant labour legislation and satisfies the requirements of the directive.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973, in so far as they relate to an employer's obligation to provide information on terms of employment, are provided solely for prosecutions of employers who failed to meet those obligations.  That means of redress has attracted criticism over the years as being unsatisfactory from the employees' point of view.  Moreover, it is not, in any event, sufficient to meet the specific requirements in the directive.  The provision concerned is being repealed by the provisions of this Bill and replaced by the system of redress which I have described.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn now to the provisions of the Bill and elaborate on its main features.  Section 1 is an interpretation section and includes definitions of the terms &ldquo;contract of employment&rdquo;, &ldquo;employer&rdquo; and &ldquo;employee&rdquo;.  The definition of employee is designed to comply with article 1.1 of the directive. The definition of &ldquo;contract of employment&rdquo; has been designed to encompass not only the traditional contract of service but also contracts under which workers are engaged by employment agencies.  The decision to bring employment agency workers within the scope of this legislation follows from a commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to examine the position of these workers.  This commitment <Col N="196" /> arose from a court decision that agency workers do not have a contract of service and are not, therefore, covered by most labour legislation.  Deputies may recall that agency workers were also brought within the scope of the recently enacted Unfair Dismissals (Amendment) Act, 1993 in a different way to the manner in which they were brought within the scope of the Payment of Wages Act, 1991.  I am sure that will arise in discussions later. There is an obvious reason for that.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides for exclusions from the provisions of the Bill.  It provides that the legislation shall not apply to an employee who is normally expected to work for less than eight hours in a week or who has been in continuous service for less than four weeks consistent with the terms of the directive.  It is intended to achieve the correct balance between the need to ensure an adequate level of protection for employees and the necessity for employers to be able to maintain a certain level of flexibility and administrative freedom in respect of the very casual or occasional employment which falls below these thresholds.</P>
    <P>Section 2 also contains an enabling provision to allow other classes of employment to be excluded by order from any provision of the Bill.  I must stress, however, that the power to exclude classes of employment from the Bill is restricted by the terms of the directive.</P>
    <P>Section 3 is a key provision.  It specifies the particulars of the terms of employment which an employer must give in writing to an employee and provides that the information must be given not later than two months after the date of commencement of employment.</P>
    <P>Many of the particulars specified in section 3 of the Bill are already specified in section 9 of the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973, which section is being repealed by this Bill.  The 1973 Act required that details be given to the employee on such matters as the date of commencement of employment, remuneration, hours of work, holidays, sick pay and pensions and notice periods.</P>
    <P>This Bill extends the list of particulars to include such further details as the <Col N="197" /> name and address of the employer, the place of work, the job title or the nature of the work, the expected duration of temporary contracts of employment and a reference to any collective agreements which directly affect the terms and conditions of employment.  Section 3 also requires that the written statement be signed by or on behalf of the employer and that it must be retained for one year after the employee's employment has ceased.  The requirement to provide a written statement only applies to employees recruited from the date of commencement of the legislation. Section 6, which I will come to shortly, deals with the rights of existing employees.</P>
    <P>Section 4 deals with employment outside the State.  It provides that in the case of employees assigned to work abroad for a period of not less than one month &mdash; firms frequently take on contracts in other countries and employees are out of the country for a period &mdash; an employer must provide, prior to the employee's departure from the State, the complete written statement described in section 3. In addition the employer must provide certain supplementary information which includes the period of employment outside the State and the benefits in cash or kind resulting from the employment outside the State.  I am sure that Deputies will appreciate how important it is for an employee to have possession of all essential information about the employment abroad before he or she leaves the country.</P>
    <P>Section 5 deals with changes in the particulars of the terms of employment and provides that any such changes must be notified to the employee within one month of the change coming into operation. However, where the change is related to the employee being assigned to work outside the State, the change must be notified before the departure of the employee from the State.  This is consistent with the provisions of the previous section which seek to ensure that employees are made fully aware of their particulars of employment before they leave the State.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="198" /> Section 6 makes provision in relation to existing employees.  It provides that where an existing employee requires his or her employer to furnish a written statement of particulars of terms of employment, the employer must supply the written statement within two months of the date of request.  The position of existing employees was given careful consideration when the directive has being adopted.  It was recognised that it would not be reasonable or administratively feasible to require employers automatically to furnish a written statement of employment terms to each existing employee on the date of implementation of the directive in national legislation.  It was decided as a compromise that employers would only be required to provide particulars of the terms of employment to existing employees if so requested.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the fact that the terms of the directive require member states to put in place adequate measures to allow employees to pursue complaints if they consider that their employers have not accorded them their entitlements under this legislation.  Sections 7, 8 and 9 of the Bill make provision for an adjudicative process and I have dealt with them in a global way at the commencement of my speech.</P>
    <P>Section 10 deals with evidence in relation to prosecution of a person for failure to attend before the Employment Appeals Tribunal or refusal to give evidence, or failure or refusal to produce documents.  It mirrors a provision in the recently enacted unfair dismissals amending legislation.  It is intended to resolve problems which have arisen in the past in prosecution cases in providing evidence of failure or refusal to give evidence or produce documents to the tribunal.  Section 11 is a standard requirement, as is section 12.  Section 13 repeals sections 9 and 10 of the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973. Section 14 is a standard provision dealing with the short title and date of commencement of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Before concluding I would like to reiterate that this Bill represents further <Col N="199" /> evidence of Ireland's commitment to full implementation of measures adopted by the Community in the context of the social dimension enshrined in European Union policy.  Moreover, I am satisfied that the legislative requirement to provide written information on the terms of employment will be seen as a positive step in establishing greater transparency in the employment relationships between employers and employees.  I believe that the good employer has nothing to fear from this legislation.  I am confident that the provisions contained in the Bill will be seen as an asset to the continued development of harmonious relationships in the workplace.</P>
    <P>There has been much comment on the need for deregulation.  The suggestion has been made that if workers' rights and social policy were diminished, somehow that would be the panacea for unemployment; but I do not hold that point of view.  Legislation that is enacted must be clear and the terms relating to it must be transparent for the employer and employee.  I take note of the way the UK operates at Council of Ministers meetings in Brussels and through its public press. There has been great brouhaha in the UK recently about the enactment throughout the land of deregulation.  This modest directive which has been translated into legislation applies equally to all member states and was implemented by the UK in the trade union reform and employment rights legislation of 1993.  The UK likes to pose as the arch-deregulators and to point out that it has no social or trade union legislation.  It has much more legislation in that area than has many other countries.  This legislation is in line with the policies that have been followed and I have great pleasure in recommending it to the House.</P>

      <P>I broadly welcome this legislation.  As the Minister said, it implements the recommendations of an EC directive dated 1991.  I am sure the Minister will be aware that the labour movement welcome the legislation, but there is some anger that it was not introduced <Col N="200" /> sooner, that the deadline date of June 1993 was bypassed.  There is considerable concern that a Bill such as this which is technical, straightforward and uncontentious&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;was not implemented sooner.  A threat was made of a complaint to the Commission had the Government not moved on this matter. There is concern among the unions that this will create a bad precedent.  It also raises the question of the Government's support for the Social Chapter.  The Social Chapter in the Maastricht Treaty was so weak and watered down that it is important the commitments made in this regard are speedily and effectively honoured. There is concern in union circles that it was only as a result of action at Commission level that the Irish Government moved to implement what is straightforward and valuable legislation.</P>
      <P>This Bill will further strengthen workers' rights.  It will act as a useful mechanism to focus employers' minds on matters concerning employees &mdash; lack of focus may lead to dispute in the definition of the terms of employment.  It will standardise a practice that exists to some degree at present and which will be to the benefit of the employer and employee.  It will lead to greater professionalism and a more effective understanding of the expectations of employer and employee.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said, for many groups of workers, particularly those in full-time traditional employment, the 1973 Act provided many of the protections afforded in this Bill; but the Bill goes further and includes many atypical, new types of work such as part-time and agency work, and in that regard it is extremely welcome.  It is also welcome that many of the definitions are consistent with those in other legislation in this area. The definition of an agency worker is consistent with the definition in the Act dealing with part-time workers and the Unfair Dismissals Act.  This is extremely important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill will impose new demands on <Col N="201" /> employers in terms of the information they are required to give about the nature of the work for which an employee is employed, etc.  While I welcome this development, I am concerned that it could give rise to potential difficulties. For example, disputes could arise about what a job entails and what one is expected to do.  I will further tease out this point with the Minister on Committee Stage.  The relationship between the description of a job and what it actually entails is of critical importance in terms of avoiding disputes.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions dealing with new groups of workers, the extension of the right of workers to basic information and the remedy being afforded to employees whose employers fail to provide them on time with the necessary information required.  This remedy process is strightforward and uncomplicated and is in line with the process for handling disputes under the Unfair Dismissals Act and most legislation relating to workers.</P>
    <P>It is strange that there should have been such a delay by the Government in bringing this legislation before the House.  During the difficult times of the seventies and eighties, when the Labour Party was in Government with Fine Gael, the record in regard to the introduction of worker legislation was very good.  I think the 1973-77 Coalition Government had one of the most outstanding records ever in this area.  Much of this legislation transformed the position of women workers.  In addition to the failure to negotiate a new Programme for National Recovery or a new Programme for Economic and Social Progress, I find it strange that the problems with which the Bill deals can still exist; one would expect the Labour Party in Government to deliver a great deal more in this respect.</P>
    <P>There is a debate in my party &mdash; and, I suppose, throughout the country &mdash; on the value of collective bargaining.  I have no doubt that this system has served the country well.  However, having failed to negotiate a further programme, industrial relations personnel, whether they are on the union side or management side, will have to spend the bulk of their <Col N="202" /> energies over the next 12 months in negotiating pay agreements.  If a new programme had been negotiated it would have been possible to plan for a number of years and for time to be devoted to developing new skills and improving the work environment.  I very much regret the possibility of returning to the localised bargaining position and the often less than constructive environment it led to.  I suppose it is still possible for a programme to be negotiated, but it seems the two central characters involved &mdash; the Minister for Enterprise and Employment and the Minister for Finance &mdash; have danced with the unions in the same way as attempts were made to form a coalition with the Fine Gael Party.  As was evident from the final outcome, there was not much sincerity in the attempts&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We all have views on this matter, and I have very clear views on it.  Having looked at the record of the Minister for Finance and the former leader of his party to deliver agreements at extraordinary costs, it seems incredible that the small gap which exists could not have been bridged.  However, I will watch events with interest.  I may be proven wrong, but that is my view on the matter.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred in detail to the major sections in the Bill.  It is important that this legislation ties in properly with the other legislation in this area.  I did not have time to check today and perhaps the Minister might clarify whether the definition of an employer in the Bill is the same as the definition of an employer in the Unfair Dismissals Act.</P>

      <P>The obligation being placed on employers to provide information on the nature and title of the job raises many interesting issues.  The position of Deputies' secretarial assistants provides a very useful example of <Col N="203" /> this.  Our secretarial assistants are a very interesting and special breed.  I understand that legislation dealing with their position will be introduced next week.  I share the view that our secretarial assistants are special and that they do exceptional work.  I do not know if the legislation is broad enough to cover these secretaries, secretarial assistants, personal assistants, or whatever one wishes to call them.  This Bill gives rise to a new issue, that is that by defining the title and nature of a job, an employer is implying that the employee has certain characteristics. The Bill will require employers to give the title of the job and information on what it entails.  While this may be fair enough in regard to new jobs, employers will still be required to give this information in regard to jobs which have existed for some time.  This could give rise to potential disputes.  Will employees who are not happy with the way in which their work is defined have any redress under the Bill?  Perhaps we will have an opportunity to debate this point in detail on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provisions in the Bill which will extend the rights and entitlements of employees over and above those in the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973.  The only regret I have is that it has taken six months longer than required to implement the provisions of the directive.  I look forward to the enactment of the Bill as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>My first reaction to this Bill was to view it with grave reservation and a strong degree of suspicion as I tend to view any set of regulations emanating from Europe.  Before I read the Bill and memorandum I wondered about the effect of these measures and whether they will result in the creation of more bureaucracy and impose additional duties on employers.  The one clear message I receive time and again from employers is that they are already overburdened with bureaucracy, particularly people in the small businesses sector and the self-employed who complain constantly <Col N="204" /> that the filling of forms is not their vocation, that they have a job to do and want to be allowed to do it without being inhibited by the demands of bureaucracy. I felt that if this was one such measure, it was to be welcomed like the plague.</P>
      <P>Recently a group of people in Cork spoke to me about a difficulty they had experienced with the Companies Office. They had sent a sheaf of forms, which had taken a long time to complete, to that office only to have them returned, the scanning apparatus did not accept them as they were completed in blue instead of black ink.  I mention it because that group of people felt it was a case of bureaucracy gone mad and I agree with them.  There is a crisis in Ireland and Europe with regard to unemployment and we should be scaling down the level of bureaucracy rather than creating more.</P>
      <P>However, when I examined this Bill more closely I conceded it did not fall into the category of the provisions I just mentioned.  What is proposed in the Bill is a worthy measures offering protection to the employer as well as to the employee.  The right to information is one of the most basic rights and this Bill, as I said, gives equal protection to the employer as well as the employee.  It is important in any contract of employment, that all the conditions are set out simply and unambiguously at the outset. If that was done in all cases many of the misunerstandings and disputes that arise later, some of which cause enormous problems and may lead to stoppages, could be avoided.</P>
      <P>This is a basic but essential measure and I welcome it.  However, on behalf of my party, I will be examining this directive and all future directives from EU sources.  The yardstick I will apply to any such legislation will be whether it inhibits or enhances job creation.  If it inhibits it should be viewed with a jaundiced eye and we should make up our own minds on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied this is worthy legislation. Much of what it proposes is already in place in this country and operates to the benefit of both workers and employers. <Col N="205" /> For that reason, the extension of the conditions will bring other categories of workers within the scope of the 1973 Act and that is to be welcomed.  For that reason I support the Bill.</P>

      <P>This is the second time in two weeks we have had to respond off the top of our heads to a Bill we were not expecting to debate until some time later. I am not blaming the Minister for that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and perhaps as Whip I have to take more of the blame than her but it is extraordinary it was the same Minister on both occasions and that we find ourselves in this position.</P>
      <P>This is a minimalist Bill and is broadly welcome.  I concur with much of what has been said about it.  In terms of the structure of the modern day workforce it is a fact of life that what are referred to in the Minister's speech as atypical workers are becoming more numerous. The days of 9 to 5 jobs, predictability and permanence are, unfortunately, behind us and the growth in the number of atypical workers is a phenomenon of the modern economy.  It is not entirely unfortunate inasmuch as I acknowledged that in addition to meeting the requirements of employers and assisting towards objectives of competitiveness and so on, it can also meet the requirements and suit the needs of workers.  Many workers have adapted to this, perhaps not willingly initially, and have grown to accept it because it suits their personal or domestic circumstances.  There are a great many women, for example, in these categories and it is finding its own level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope it will apply to more men in future for the same reasons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely, the House here this evening is a good example of that, where I find myself in such a minority. I accept that there should be more men, especially off the dole queue, in those categories in the future.</P>
      <P>Having said that, employers invariably jockey for position and some of the provisions in this Bill, while apparently obvious, do not operate in the workplace. If, for example, one considers the Minister's speech where she refers to the requirements, in addition to the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, that will be imposed by this Act, the uninitiated might say that they are obvious and not necessary.  I can say from experience that, for example, the name and address of the employer can be a relevant consideration because it can be difficult on occasion to identify an employer.</P>
      <P>We are not only talking about the area which has the highest concentration of the most vulnerable workers but also areas that are largely non-trade union and this kind of consideration is significant. Take, for example, the question of the place of work, which is the second point to which the Minister refers.  This can, similarly, be a very important consideration. In my experience from a previous incarnation security persons, for example, were often sent to one location as distinct from another.  These workers never had anything in writing stating the location of their place of work and that is not an insignificant consideration if one is earning very low pay and is transferred from one end of the city to another without compensation and as part of a ruse by an employer to dismiss a worker.</P>
      <P>It is important that clarity be introduced in this area.  Like Deputy Quill, I came to the conclusion that it is likely to minimise industrial dispute rather than have the opposite effect.  I have no doubt that this clarity and lack of room for misunderstanding will assist in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note the provision of redress to the Rights Commissioner.  The Rights Commissioner is an institution that has worked with remarkable success in industrial relations in this country.  To my <Col N="207" /> knowledge it is not a facility that is replicated anywhere else, certainly not in Britain.  Its informal nature and conciliatory, mediatory-style role has contributed enormously to the maintenance of good industrial relations.  Therefore it is entirely appropriate that that be the first step of redress.</P>
    <P>However, I might refer the Minister to section 7 of the Bill, which deals with the ceiling on compensation and which presumably we will have plenty of time to tease out in the course of Committee Stage.  Where the Rights Commissioner considers it appropriate that compensation should be awarded, it is limited to four week's pay.  I do not entirely understand why that ceiling is there.  It seems to me that circumstances can be so atypical, so widely varying, that putting a ceiling on the compensation that might be awarded could in some cases render it not worth the while of the employee to pursue it.  Certainly, I shall be interested to hear the Minister's response to that.</P>
    <P>A Cheann Comhairle, by agreement, we have decided to conclude the Second Stage of this Bill this evening.  There are a great many more things I wanted to say about it.  Hopefully, I will have the opportunity to do so in the course of Committee Stage.  However, I want to permit the Minister to close.  I hope that in the new year we will not be presented with Bills at short notice, as in this case. For the second week in a row we have had a new Bill we had not expected until the following week.  We have to make eloquent contributions in response without really having had an opportunity to study the Bill other than listen to the Minister.  Of course, given her background, she has been very helpful in explaining the provisions of the Bill for us.  However, I would not like that to become the precedent for legislation in 1994.</P>

      <P>I do not think we shall ever doubt Deputy Rabbitte's eloquence or indeed that of any of the <Col N="208" /> other Members who contributed to this debate.</P>
      <P>Let me make it clear that I had absolutely nothing to do with the early introduction of the Bill to the House.  Rather it arose because of the demise of the earlier Bill, or perhaps because the Minister who introduced that Bill made matters so clear that there was very little to be said or done about it.</P>

      <P>While we should all have liked longer for the Second Stage debate, all of the provisions of the Bill will be teased out, I hope in a lively fashion, by the Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy when I will answer the points raised in detail.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputy Flaherty, who gave the Bill a general welcome, while slightly castigating us for the delay in bringing it forward.  However, I might say to her that we are still in the year 1993, the year in which we were to have introduced it. Indeed, I might point out to the House that my Department has introduced five Bills in the course of this year, which we consider to be quite heroic of us.</P>
      <P>Deputy Quill quite rightly wondered whether the provisions of this Bill would lead to increased bureaucracy.  I think they will lead to quite the opposite, that of their very nature they will render matters very clear, thereby helping to alleviate any tension which might arise between employers and employees and in that way ease the relevant procedures. Nonetheless, I take her point about red tape.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte also gave the Bill a broad welcome and I look forward to his questions &mdash; two or three of which he specified &mdash; being answered in the course of Committee Stage.  With the permission <Col N="209" /> of the House, I shall reply to them at that point.</P>

      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for having selected this matter this evening.  I had been seeking a way to raise the matter again since the Minister for Justice, in the course of Question Time on 25 November last, replied to my first priority question, saying that she was not sure whether the <Col N="210" /> information available to her was up to date.  Certainly, judging from the reply she read out in the House, her information was not in keeping with that available to me.</P>
      <P>I have been informed that an English company has conducted sales of furniture from hotels and other venues nationwide. Their method of operation is to display a container load of high class furniture, advertised as liquidation stock, take deposits from customers and then disappear. I am informed that the Garda have received many complaints about the activities of this company.  In cases of this nature the Garda experience difficulty in proving fraud because the relevant law is antiquated and on many occasions the Garda have to tailor charges to fit that antiquated law.  For example, if legislation obtained here along the lines of the British Thefts Acts of 1968 and 1978 their task would be rendered much easier.  I have a list of 58 recommendations made by the Special Committee set up to report on fraud which reported almost two years ago but whose recommendations have not been implemented.</P>

    <P>I was informed by the Garda that in relation to this particular company they have received approximately 40 complaints from places as far apart as Dublin, Wicklow, Drogheda, Athlone, Sligo, Roscommon, Salthill and Ennis, and there may be others.  There seems to be some conflict between the information available to me and that available to the Minister in relation to this matter, but I am quite happy that the information available to me is reliable.  First of all, I received the information from sources outside the Garda, based on a number of complaints from people around the country.  A number of local interests in both Ennis and Sligo have been in touch with me directly about the matter, as have some other public representatives. When I approached the Garda in preparation for this debate and asked whether this information was correct I was informed that up to 40 investigations are taking place in those areas.  The Minister, in reply to a parliamentary question, told <Col N="211" /> me she had no information about this and, if I had information, would I kindly supply it to her.  Since then I have been endeavouring to establish which of us is wrong.</P>
    <P>Second, in relation to this case, but also in relation to cases in general, it is my understanding that if the Garda suspected that, say, X, Y or Z building society, or whatever other financial institution one might care to imagine by way of example, was trading fraudulently, taking deposits fraudulently, there is nothing the Garda can do about it, even though they may suspect there is impropriety, and must await receipt of a complaint or complaints before they can investigate.  Of course, this means that by the time they receive a complaint and investigate, the bird will have flown the nest.</P>
    <P>My second query is: why have the recommendations of the Special Advisory Committee set up by the Government to examine fraud not been implemented? We should remember that the reason that advisory committee was established in the first place was that I and others had been seeking the establishment of a serious fraud office here.</P>
    <P>I went to London and met the director of the fraud office there.  The reply from the former Minister was: &ldquo;maybe we do not need a serious fraud office here, we will set up a committee&rdquo;.  That committee made 58 recommendations including the setting up of a national bureau of fraud investigation.  If that bureau had been in place this alleged fraud and many proven or attempted frauds, could be investigated in a timely fashion.  Normal business people would not object to the Garda through the fraud squad or the National Bureau of Fraud Investigation &mdash; if it was set up &mdash; going in to establish companies' bona fides if they had suspicions.</P>
    <P>In relation to the specific question, will the Minister state whether my information is correct?  When will she implement the findings of the committee dealing with fraud?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two aspects to Deputy Mitchell's motion and I think it best to deal separately with them.</P>
      <P>First, there is the question of the information I provided to this House on 25 November in reply to a Priority Question by the Deputy and, second, there is the allegation of serious fraud involving perhaps a number of victims and what is now being done about that matter.</P>
      <P>As regards the information which I gave to the House on 25 November, what I said was that the Garda were not aware of any alleged criminal activity by the company in question.  I went on to say, however, that the reply I had given was based on information provided to me by the Garda authorities and that this information appeared to differ from information, attributed to Garda sources, contained in an article in that day's evening papers which I had read shortly before entering the House.  I informed the House that I had ordered an immediate inquiry with the Garda Commissioner's Office to ascertain the correct factual position, and I asked the Garda Commissioner for a full and detailed account of the up-to-date position later that day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to be able to inform the House that the Garda Commissioner has now provided me with an updated report on this matter.  What emerges from this is that the information I received from the Garda authorities, which I in turn gave to the House, was accurate, but only on the basis of a very strict, legalistic use of the term &ldquo;complaint&rdquo;.  I am now advised that the gardaí cannot treat a communication from a member of the public as a complaint in the technical sense i.e. something capable of triggering a criminal investigation, unless the communication relates to an occurrence which could, at the time the communication was made, amount to a criminal offence.  I am advised that, for technical reasons, the failure by the company in this instance to deliver the furniture promised could not, in itself, amount to an offence unless that failure arose after the time lapse for delivery <Col N="213" /> provided for in the contract had expired. Whether, even at that stage, the failure to deliver amounted to an offence is a matter which would fall to be assessed by the Director of Public Prosecutions following completion of a Garda investigation.</P>
    <P>I am not aware when the Garda authorities informed me there had not been a complaint and that they were not aware of any alleged criminal activity that the term &ldquo;complaint&rdquo; was being used in the strict sense I have mentioned and I trust that the House will accept that there was no intention on my part to mislead.  I have been assured by the Garda authorities that care will be taken to ensure that a misunderstanding of this kind does not arise again.</P>
    <P>As to the facts of the case, I have already given details in reply to a Question put down on Tuesday by Deputy Nora Owen.  However, given the understandable concern generated by this matter I believe the details are worth repeating.  A UK registered company applied to the Department of Enterprise and Employment and was granted specific permits under the Occasional Trading Act, 1979, to hold sales of furniture at various locations around the country, including those referred to by the Deputy, between 23 September 1993 and 10 October 1993, inclusive.  It appears that the company operated generally on the basis that a 50 per cent deposit on goods was taken from purchasers on foot of a contractual undertaking that the purchased goods would be delivered within eight weeks from the date of order.</P>
    <P>I am informed by my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, that an alleged breach of the Occasional Trading Act, 1979, by an Irish registered company, which appears to be connected with the company already mentioned and which conducted some of the sales, for trading without a permit on various dates in October has been sent to the Chief State Solicitor's Office for his advice as to whether proceedings can be instituted against this company for breach of the Act.</P>
    <P>Because the Garda had been contacted <Col N="214" /> by members of the public who were concerned that commitments to deliver furniture would not be honoured, they had been making inquiries from an early stage into the companies and the sales of furniture by them.  These Garda inquiries did not amount to formal criminal investigation because, as I say, no criminal offence had arisen at that time as far as the gardaí were aware.  The inquiries were considered to be justified, however, as a precautionary measure and to assist any formal investigation that might become necessary later.</P>
    <P>The present position is that the Garda are currently conducting an investigation and, as part of the investigation, are making arrangements to interview members of the public who agreed to buy furniture from the companies.  They advise me that this is a very complicated investigation spread over many counties and is being co-ordinated by the Fraud Squad.  For that reason, and because of the nature of the contracts entered into by the customers it is not clear yet to the Garda if criminal offences have been committed.</P>
    <P>The underlying concern here, of course, is how to protect the public from unscrupulous traders who may not fulfil contracts entered into by them, even though they are operating under an offical permit, as in the present case.  I am advised that the consumers' rights provided for under the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980, and other consumer legislation such as the Consumer Information Act, 1978, apply not only with regard to sales by &ldquo;established&rdquo; traders, but also in the case of temporary sales.  Consumers should be aware, however, that in the case of temporary sales they may have difficulty in enforcing their rights in practice as there may be difficulty in making contact with the seller.</P>
    <P>I am also advised that the Director of Consumer Affairs provides information for consumers on their rights daily through his telephone complaints line, leaflets, newspapers and other media.  In addition the director is involved in the development of improved consumer education <Col N="215" /> in national, secondary and vocational schools.  I am confident this programme will, in the longer term, bear rich fruit in enhancing consumer awareness generally.  In the meantime, I assure the House that the investigation commenced by the Garda in the present case will be vigorously pursued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  I am concerned about the position in Scoil Uí Mhuirí.  The Minister of State will be aware that an application for an extension to the school has been under consideration in his Department for some considerable time.  Recently the parents have taken the children from the school and earlier today protested outside the gates.</P>
      <P>The position regarding accommodation is that in the 1992-93 school year there were 358 pupils on the roll and in the present school year I understand the number on the roll is 372.  Modified plans for the extension have been agreed between the Department and County Louth vocational education committee. There are approximately 16 prefabricated school classrooms on the school campus.  In this regard there has been a considerable amount of agitation during the past number of years.</P>
      <P>The school has a fine record of academic achievement and the parents are very supportive of the teachers.  The significant increase in numbers attending the school indicates their appreciation of the education they are receiving.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to note in the Estimates which have just been circulated to Members a significant increase in the provision for both primary and post primary school buildings and upgradings.  That augurs well.  I hope the Minister of State will be in a position to announce good tidings on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful <Col N="216" /> for this opportunity to respond to the matter raised by the Deputy regarding the withdrawal of pupils at Scoil Uí Mhuirí, Dunleer, in support of the application to have a new extension built at the school.  I am indeed aware of the situation and very much regret any action which prevents children from attending school.  I am also aware of the accommodation problems at Scoil Uí Mhuirí in Dunleer and am glad to say that the architectural planning of this extension which will alleviate these problems, is now complete.</P>
      <P>I would like to avail of this opportunity to give some details on the background to this project.  Scoil Uí Mhuirí is a co-educational vocational school with an enrolment of approximately 360 pupils. It is the sole provider of post-primary education in the catchment area.</P>
      <P>A proposal to provide an additional 845m² of accommodation at the school was approved in 1984 and architectural planning of this extension commenced. However, due to financial constraints, the project had not proceeded to construction when in 1990 it was decided to carry out a detailed review of all projects in planning in view of the declining demographic trends which had become evident. Following this indepth evaluation of the project a modified, phased development of the school was approved by the then Minister.  It was agreed that phase 1 of the project, which was to provide 539m², should proceed and architectural planning was immediately initiated.  The planning process is now complete and the project is ready to proceed to tender.</P>
      <P>In the meantime the Department has been monitoring the immediate accommodation needs at Scoil Uí Mhuirí and in recognition of the difficulties being experienced authorised the County Louth Vocational Education Committee to provide one prefab at the school in 1992 and a further two in 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again I would like to say that while I fully appreciate the difficulties being experienced at Scoil Uí Mhuirí and the anxieties being expressed by staff, parents <Col N="217" /> and pupils and County Louth Vocational Education Committee, I am not in a position at this time to give a precise date for the commencement of this project.  I can assure the Deputy, however, that every effort will be made to include this project in the Department's 1994 building programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Sir, for giving me permission to raise this most urgent matter.  There is an appalling accommodation shortage in the Christian Brothers High School in Clonmel.  It is alarming that the school cannot accept first year pupils in September 1994 unless the Department takes action.  Is there any other town in Ireland that cannot provide a secondary education for the boys in its catchment area?  This is the serious situation facing the principal, staff and the parents of prospective pupils in Clonmel.</P>
      <P>This is not the first time that such facts have been presented to the Department of Education.  In June 1992 I rose in this House to put those points to the then Minister for Education, but the facts that those of us who represent the people of Clonmel put to the Minister were not taken as reality.  We are now approaching a crisis and September 1994 is the deadline. Unless classroom accommodation is provided by the Department of Education, pupils cannot enrol in the Christian Brothers High School in Clonmel to begin their first year of secondary education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, the Minister for Education has set out guidelines for enrolment in secondary schools in which she rightly states that she disagrees with entrance tests.  However, what is the option before the principal in this school? How can he offer places to pupils when he has not got the classrooms?  The Christian Brothers High School has refused entry to 301 students over the past five years. That means that 60 students each year have been refused a place in the school. Research has shown that there will be in excess of 100 students wishing to enter <Col N="218" /> this school each year for the next ten years.</P>
    <P>A decision is needed before Christmas because accommodation must be provided for September 1994.  To date, the Department has offered a grant of only £60,000 for four pre-fab classrooms.  The principal, staff, the board of management and the parents have refused pre-fab accommodation and I stand by their refusal.  They want permanent accommodation because they know there will be sufficient students to fill the additional accommodation that will be provided.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to share the anger, the worry and concern of those of us who represent Clonmel and to appreciate the impossible situation in which the principal finds himself and to share also the enormous anger of the parents.  Where will students in Clonmel go to school in 1994?  All we are looking for is over £100,000 to build four permanent classrooms to get us out of what I would call the most impossible situation that a school has had to confront.  It is unreal that as we approach the next century students in a town like Clonmel will not be able to go to school in the Christian Brothers High School in September 1994. The Christmas season is approaching and I ask the Minister to give us good news because the people of Clonmel need this news.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Ahearn for raising this matter, Deputy Ferris for contributing and, indeed, all the Deputies in South Tipperary, including yourself, a Cheann Comhairle.  I know, Sir, that you cannot say anything here but I have noted your interest in this matter also.</P>
      <P>Last September I visited that school to see if I could be of assistance.  As Deputies know, there are four post-primary schools in Clonmel post-primary centre, two of which cater for boys &mdash; the high school and the vocational school. The Department's main responsibility in the matter of school accommodation is to ensure that in any given centre or catchment area there are sufficient post-primary places overall to meet immediate and long term needs.  Therefore, any application from a particular school for additional accommodation must be considered in this context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the Christian Brothers High School, the school authorities submitted proposals to the Department <Col N="220" /> which included a proposal for the provision of some additional accommodation. Having examined this matter, it was decided by the Department that there was sufficient accommodation in the centre to meet projected long term requirements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. A. Alyward Mr. A. Alyward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Alyward</NameTxt>
      <P>However, it was recognised that in view of the current enrolment in the school and the likely short term enrolment figures, there was a need for additional short term provision of accommodation to meet the immediate needs of the school.  This requirement arises because it appears that a majority of parents prefer their sons to attend the Christian Brothers High School.  The result is that the Christian Brothers High School is unable to cope with current demands on its accommodation level whereas there is surplus accommodation elsewhere.</P>
      <P>In order to meet the school's immediate needs therefore an offer of grant aid for the provision of an extra three classrooms and a mechanical drawing room, together with toilets and circulation area, was made to the school. This offer was unacceptable to the school, however, and the matter has since been under further discussion.  The Department recently met the school authorities and agreed to review the pupil projections for the school.  This review of enrolments has been carried out and a further meeting will be arranged shortly with the school authorities to examine how best to meet the school's needs, both short term and long term.  The question of replacement of the roof and windows which are causing problems will also be discussed at the meeting.</P>
      <P>I am very conscious of the need to have the problem resolved as quickly as possible.  I would therefore like to assure the Deputies that every effort will be made to reach an agreement with the school authorities without delay.</P>

      <P>I thank you, Sir, for permitting <Col N="221" /> me to raise this matter on the Adjournment this evening, having allowed me to raise another matter on the Adjournment on Tuesday evening. This is the most difficult incident I have had to raise during my 13 years in this House.  I regret that I have to draw public attention in the Dáil to this very sensitive issue.  I do so, having discussed the matter fully with the parents and having got their consent.  The parents have been angered and frustrated by the situation during the past seven weeks.  They are angry at what happened to their children and even more angry at the lack of response from Government agencies, the Department of Health, Education, the Southern Health Board, Bus Éireann, the special school involved and the voluntary group. Parents approached me about five weeks ago making serious allegations about incidents of a sexual and physical nature involving the driver of a private bus funded by Bus Éireann in Cork to transport children to a special school. Although the Southern Health Board was informed of the incidents on the bus the parents were told it would take about eight weeks before the children could be examined, interviewed and assessed.  I advised the parents to see a solicitor and within two hours of their solicitor contacting the Garda one of the children was examined by a GP.  Prior to meeting me the parents informed the principal of the special school of what had occurred and they had already held fruitless meetings and discussions with Bus Éireann on the matter of bus escorts.  The incidents involved children and young people whose ages range between ten and 20. The children suffer from autism, Down's Syndrome and physical impairment and some of them cannot speak.  The Garda have been extremely sensitive and cooperative in dealing with the matter but that is where sensitivity and co-operation ended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having met the parents I immediately contacted the Department of Education office in Cork who advised me to contact the Department in Dublin.  I also contacted the Southern Health Board and requested a meeting between representatives of the Southern Health Board, Bus Éireann, the Department of <Col N="222" /> Education and the voluntary organisation involved in the running of the school, to discuss the provision of escorts on the buses.  The meetings were fruitless as all the agencies involved refused to accept responsibility for the provision of escorts on buses.  I telephoned the Department of Education exactly two weeks to the day and gave the Minister's Secretary the details of the incident.  I was advised it was a matter for the Junior Minister since school transport was under his jurisdiction.  I was promised a telephone call from the Office of the Junior Minister the following day but I was not contacted by either the Minister or the Junior Minister's office for 12 days.  There was no contact until I was obliged last Tuesday to contact both offices to protest strongly at their failure to respond to my representations.  I was told yesterday by the office of the Junior Minister that they would not provide an escort on the bus.</P>
    <P>In the discussions in Cork between the parents and the other parties involved an attempt was made to exclude me and it was only at the insistence of the parents that I was able to attend the meeting last Monday night.  At that meeting a Bus Éireann representative failed to turn up although there was a representative of the health board and a representative of the voluntary group.  The meeting ended in deadlock with the result that people are not using bus transport and most of them are not attending school.</P>
    <P>This week the Southern Health Board published a comprehensive review of child care services but it does not show the appalling lack of services in this sensitive area.  I hope that by raising this matter here today the parents will get a more sensitive and caring response from the Departments of Health and Education and their request for the provision of an escort on the bus will be granted in line with the recommendations of the Brennan report which recommended that such escorts should be provided.</P>
    <P>The parents in this case will release further evidence of the disgraceful way in which they have been treated over the last number of weeks.  The problem has been passed from one organisation to another and the parents have been given the run around at this traumatic time.  I <Col N="223" /> hope the Minister will respond positively to the needs of the children and the parents in relation to school transport.  I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this appalling incident.</P>

      <P>I assure the Deputy that I would be most concerned to avoid any situation where handicapped children being transported to special schools would be put at risk.</P>
      <P>Deputy Allen brought this matter to my attention on Tuesday night after the Adjournment Debate and submitted it for the Adjournment Debate today, so he did not give me much time to respond.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>Under present arrangements, handicapped children attending special schools are generally transported on special services which have been put in place for this purpose. Where it is not possible to accommodate an individual child on such a service, due to distance from route or other factors, my Department arranges for the payment of a grant towards the cost of private transport arrangements.</P>
      <P>The need for escorts on special services will vary depending on the circumstances of the children involved.  There is no prohibition on the use of escorts where they can be accommodated on a service and some escorts travel on special services as part of their role as child care assistants attached to special schools.</P>
      <P>In the case of children attending the special schools for visual impairment, escorts have been provided by the National Council for the Blind for a number of years.  These escorts accompany children travelling to and from home for holiday periods and their transport costs are funded by my Department.</P>
      <P>Under present arrangements a parent or other adult may also be allowed to travel with a child where a place is available on the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the current year approximately £38 <Col N="224" /> million will be spent on the provision of school transport services.  Of this amount, approximately 20 per cent will be spent on services for pupils with disabilities. This is a considerable commitment, given that such pupils constitute only about 2 per cent of the school-going population.</P>
    <P>The issue of school transport services for children with disabilities, including the question of escorts on such services, was one of the matters addressed by the Special Education Review Committee. This committee has just recently presented its report to the Minister for Education and the Deputy may be aware that among the committee's recommendations in relation to school transport, is the proposal that the Department of Education should grant-aid the provision of escorts on school buses, where the need for them has been shown to exist.  The question of the need for escorts was also highlighted in presentations made to the special seminar organised recently by the Minister for Education to discuss the Special Education Committee's Report.</P>
    <P>The recommendations of the special committee are currently being considered in my Department and while some of the measures proposed may take some time to implement, it will be necessary to give priority to actions to respond as quickly as possible to areas of particular and urgent need.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that I fully recognise the seriousness of the situation to which he refers.  In this particular connection, I understand that arrangements are currently being made whereby a parent of one of the children will act as an escort on the bus.</P>

      <P>A total of ten MMDS franchises, covering the entire country, were awarded in late 1989 &mdash; early 1990 to provide multi-channel TV to non-cable areas.  Each franchisee was required to pay £20,000 for the grant of the licence. An annual renewal fee of 5 per cent of gross revenue, excluding installations charges and value added tax, is charged.</P>
      <P>MMDS systems are now in operation over most areas.  Some areas remain to be served, and while I would have preferred that more progress might have been made, I understand that franchises are experiencing difficulties with illegal &ldquo;deflector&rdquo; systems in some areas.  I am very happy with the quality of service available under MMDS.  Any dissatisfaction I have heard raised about MMDS seems to emanate from those who prefer, or have an interest in illegal deflector systems.</P>

      <P>I have not been informed of any incident at THORP on 25 October 1993.  However, I have been informed of two incidents at THORP since testing began on 2 September 1993.  The first leak, which occurred on 7 September, involved the release of nitrogen dioxide gas.  There was no release of radioactive material. Although this incident was not formally reportable, my Department received some details of the incident on the following day.  My Department wrote to the UK Department of the Environment on that day also seeking a full explanation of the incident and the results of any official investigation into the incident when available.  My Department received further information about the incident on 28 October 1993 but the report of the investigations being carried out by the Health and Safety Executive is not yet to hand.</P>
      <P>The second incident, which occurred on 18 October 1993, involved a minor seepage of about one litre of low level uranyl nitrate liquid from a pump into a fully enclosed area.  The liquid was being used for testing purposes and was quickly cleared up.  No release of radioactivity to the environment occurred.  Although this incident was not formally reportable by British Nuclear Fuels to the UK Department of the Environment my Department sought and received full details of the incident following press reports of the incident.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am indeed aware of the <i>Observer</i> newspaper's article about the British National Radiological Protection Board's report dealing with radiation doses.  In fact, the article in question relates to a mixture of two reports recently issued by the NRPB. Since the article's publication I have obtained from the UK authorities copies of the two reports and I have asked the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland to examine them in detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first report dealt with the potential radiation doses to members of the public due to Sellafield discharges at the limits originally proposed by British Nuclear Fuels.  While this report focused on the doses received by people living near Sellafield, it also presented estimates of the collective does over the next 10,000 years to the UK and European population for marine and atmospheric discharges. <Col N="148" /> The second report dealt with the collective doses from discharges at the limits proposed in the draft discharge authorisation under consideration at present by the UK authorities.  These doses are reported on the effects for all time as well as for a truncated period of 12 years.  The second report differs from the first in that, in its consideration of the Sellafield discharges at the limits proposed in the discharge authorisations, distinctions are drawn between THORP and other discharges from the site.</P>
    <P>The calculations in the report are based on the assumption that discharges were continuously at the authorised levels.  In practice discharges could be expected to be much lower.  An important point made in our submission on THORP was that the proposed authorised levels were far higher than is necessary to operate the plant.  Nevertheless from the RPII's examination of the reports, it is clear that the operation of THORP will give rise to an increased collective dose to population. However, the UK's NRPB questions the scientific justification of applying risk factors to collective dose figures in order to obtain an index of radiological detriment.  The UK's NRPB states that it is questionable to apply risk factors derived for other purposes to possible radiation exposures delivered to populations over thousands of years into the future.  It also states that estimating radiological detriment to populations who may exist in the future has little scientific justification.  However, there is some validity in estimates of detriment for collective doses estimated over a specified period being used for comparison purposes.  The report, however, does not provide any estimates of deaths or detriment as reported in the newspaper.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that there is a great deal of technical detail, statistical data and figures involving collective doses to the UK population, European and the world recorded in man-sieverts which is not possible to reproduce here today.  However, copies of the reports are available from the RPII's library in Clonskeagh.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="149" /> The Irish Government's views on THORP and its radioactive discharges are well-known to the UK Government. Ireland is entitled to object to the operation of THORP because of the increased radiation dose which people here will receive due to the routine discharges of radioactive waste to the Irish Sea and to the atmosphere from the plant.  The RPII points out, however, that this increase in dose during the normal operation of the plant will amount only to 0.2 per cent of the average radiation dose already being received by a person in Ireland from all sources of radiation.</P>

      <P>Significant aid has been provided by the EC to Ireland under (1) REGEN and (2) TELEMATIQUE.  Ireland has not received any aid under (3) RECHAR as the coal industry in Ireland is not of sufficient magnitude to qualify for assistance under this initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The REGEN initiative, announced by the European Commission in December 1990, made aid available to a small number of specified gas and electricity projects which had been identified as being of interest to the Community.  The Ireland-UK natural gas interconnector pipeline was one of the projects identified. Total eligible expenditure under this project is 338.27 MECU.  Grant aid of 35 per cent of the approved cost of the project, some 118.35 MECU, has been allocated by the Commission.  To date 102.45 MECU has been received.  The project is nearing completion.  The pipeline is currently gassed up between the UK high pressure grid in Scotland and the reception station at Loughshinny in County Dublin.  Some work remains to be done at the reception station and at the turbo compressor station in Scotland. The pipeline, when completed, will provide additional supply security and load management capability during the remaining life of the Kinsale Head Field. Gas will be imported through the pipeline to supplement output from Kinsale Head during its declining years, building up to full replacement when the field is depleted.  It will have capacity to cater for increased demand in the future.  Of course, in the event of further significant <Col N="154" /> discoveries being made in our offshore, the pipeline could be used to export any gas surplus to our requirements.</P>
    <P>The objective of the Telematique two year Programme which was formally announced by the EC in February, 1992 is to promote the use of new and existing advanced telecommunications services with a view to improving the efficiency and competitiveness of the business sector.  Some 8.8 million ECU of the 11 million ECU available to Ireland under the Programme has been drawn down to date.  The remaining 2.2 million ECU will be drawn down at the close of the programme when a final report is furnished to the European Commission.  It is too early yet to give definitive statements of the results under the programme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 68 and 107 together.</P>
      <P>The proposed Flagford-Drumsallagh 220kV powerline project is at an initial stage.  Expenditure approved to date for this project has been solely related to preparatory work on the project including studies and surveys connected with the ESB's applications for planning permission.</P>
      <P>Total cost for this project are estimated to be approximately £26 million.  The bulk of capital expenditure under this project is not scheduled to arise until 1995-98.  I have not approved capital expenditure by the ESB for construction work on this proposed project.  Depending on the outcome of the planning process, the earliest I envisage receiving such a request would be in 1994 in the context of the ESB's 1995 Capital Expenditure Programme.</P>

      <P>As Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, I do not have a statutory function in relation to the safety and technical standards for electrical contracting work.  The Electro-Technical Council of Ireland specifies standards for electrical installation work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned, however, that the public should be able to rely on an acceptable <Col N="156" /> standard of workmanship, and welcome efforts by the industry to ensure that adequate technical standards are applied.  The Register of Electrical Contractors of Ireland was established as an independent, non-statutory, self-regulatory body, without direct State involvement, to be operated by the industry itself, to oversee satisfactory implementation of established standards for electrical installation work.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may be aware that there are legal proceedings pending between the Association of South Western Electrical Contractors and the ESB.  This case was taken following the ESB's decision, in support of RECI's objectives, that from 1 September 1992 it would only accept work on new connections for supply which were carried out, or inspected by RECI members.  It is expected that this matter will be fully heard early in the new year, and it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the future of RECI pending the outcome of the case.</P>

      <P>As part of the liberalisation process of recent years, the role of Governments in controlling and regulating air fares has been progressively reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under European Union rules and the Ireland-US Air Transport Agreement, which apply to most air services to and from Ireland, airlines serving Ireland are free to determine air fares in accordance with their own commercial judgment, subject to certain safeguards.  The safeguards in relation to air fares within the European Union are set out in Article 6 of Council Regulation (EEC) No. <Col N="157" /> 2409/92 and enable member states or the EC Commission to take action in relation to air fares in circumstances where a fare is excessively high to the disadvantage of users or where market forces have led to a sustained downward development of air fares resulting in widespread losses among all air carriers.</P>
    <P>I have no statutory function in relation to the determining of fares for services provided by ferry operators.  This is a matter solely for the commercial judgment of individual operators.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is presumably referring to newspaper reports about proposals in the White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness and Employment which the President of the European Commission has presented to Heads of State and Government for discussion at the European Council on 10/11 December.</P>
      <P>The White Paper is not proposing 100 billion ECU additional public expenditure on Transeuropean networks and indeed says that any contributions from member states will respect the Maastricht guidelines related to public debt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is involved is investment in Transeuropean networks over the next five years by the public and private sectors, most of which is already at the planning stage.  The White Paper raises the issue of whether existing financing mechanisms in the Community &mdash; including Structural Funds, the Cohesion Fund, the EIB and the European Investment Fund &mdash; will be adequate to deal with these <Col N="158" /> projects, or whether new mechanisms are needed.</P>
    <P>To the extent that there will be Exchequer expenditure on Transeuropean networks over the next five years, provision for it has been made in the National Development Plan 1994-99.</P>

      <P>Special confidentiality arrangements apply to the 15 per cent incentive amnesty which is administered by the Office of the Chief Special Collector.  Consistent with the guarantees of confidentiality the legislation provides that I may obtain only certain information and this only in the form of aggregates of the total amount of the declared amounts, the total amount of settlement amounts, the total amount of value-added tax remitted to the Chief Special Collector and the total numbers of individuals who remitted amounts to the Chief Special Collector. The legislation does not permit the provision of this information on a separate county or administrative area basis.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I recently announced an extension, from 30 November, 1993 to 21 December, 1993, of the cut-off date for the making of declarations to the Chief Special Collector. In the case of both the 15 per cent incentive amnesty and the separate general amnesty in respect of interest and penalties actual payments do not have to be made until 14 January, 1994.  I will be seeking the information on declarations provided for by the legislation after the new cut-off date of 21 December, 1993 and the other information mentioned at the appropriate juncture.</P>

      <P>I have no function in relation to the acceptance of applications under either the 15 per cent incentive amnesty or the general amnesty provided for respectively by sections 2 and 3 of the Waiver of Certain Tax, Interest and Penalties Act, 1993. Both the incentive amnesty and the general amnesty operate on self assessment principles, thus placing the onus on the person concerned to ensure he or she meets all the applicable conditions.  Both amnesties relate to pre-April, 1991 tax liabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The incentive amnesty is administered in confidence by a special office, the Office of the Chief Special Collector, which is completely separate from the <Col N="160" /> Office of the Revenue Commissioners. Individuals seeking to avail of this amnesty now have up to 21 December, 1993 to make the necessary declaration to the Chief Special Collector and up to 14 January, 1994 to make the appropriate payment of tax.  The general amnesty is administered by the Revenue Commissioners. Persons seeking to avail of this amnesty have until 14 January, 1994 to pay their tax liabilities to the Commissioners.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have published two information leaflets on the amnesties which contain, amongst other matters, details of a number of telephone help lines.  Persons seeking information on their entitlement to avail of either or both the incentive amnesty and the general amnesty may use the telephone help lines in question to make inquiries on a confidential basis.</P>

      <P>The Revenue and Social Insurance (RSI) number is the unique personal reference number issued by my Department to a person for tax, social welfare and related purposes.  Most people, including self-employed people, who are registered for income tax purposes or who are claiming a social welfare payment, already have an RSI number.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extension of PRSI cover to self-employed people was introduced by me in 1988.  Since that time the RSI number is being used as the main reference number for social welfare purposes.  Any person who does not have an RSI number and who requires one for tax related purposes can apply to their local tax office who will make the necessary arrangements with my Department for the issue of an RSI number.  People who require an RSI number in connection with a social <Col N="161" /> welfare claim should contact my Department directly.</P>
    <P>The allocation of RSI numbers to people is an ongoing feature of the work of my Department and the working arrangements with the Revenue Commissioners are satisfactory.  The use of the RSI number for tax, social welfare and related purposes has proved very beneficial in the past in terms of improved service delivery and ease of access to services for people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the setting up of the group referred to and that my Department declined an invitation to nominate a representative to the group.</P>
      <P>I understand that the group being set up by ICON will include public representatives and will act as a lobby group to initiate activities that it considers necessary to deal with the drugs problem in the area.  I trust that the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for my Department to nominate an official to participate in a group which describes itself as a lobby group.</P>
      <P>This does not reflect any lack of commitment on my part to dealing with the drugs problem in the north inner city nor does it imply any particular attitude towards the group in question.  Officials of my Department have met representatives of the group and will do so again if the need arises.  But it is a different matter to expect that civil servants should be nominated to a lobby group &mdash; no matter how worth while the objectives or how sincere the motives of that group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Garda authorities after consulting with me, recently set up a special task force to deal with the drugs problem in that area. I also published legislation on 24 November that will provide for the confiscation of the proceeds of serious crime, including profits from drugs trafficking. The legislation is particularly aimed at the drugs barons and their illegal trading in drugs.  As such, it should have a positive <Col N="167" /> effect in areas which are badly affected by the drugs problem, such as the north inner city.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that, as the Employment Appeals Tribunal is an independent body, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on its findings.  In normal circumstances, cases decided by the Employment Appeals Tribunal under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973, would come to the attention of my Department only if there was a complaint about non-implementation of a Tribunal determination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am advised that, in the case referred to by the Deputy, the Tribunal, having examined the issue of whether or not the <Col N="168" /> claimants were precluded from claiming minimum notice because of the requirements of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, disallowed the claim and noted that each of the claimants had been formally put on notice that the terms of the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973 did not apply.</P>
    <P>The policy of my Department in relation to providing responses to inquiries from persons seeking information about entitlements under labour legislation, including the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973, is to inform those persons of the provisions of the relevant legislation, including, where appropriate, the provisions relating to the employments excluded from the legislation.</P>
    <P>In cases of doubt about qualification for entitlement under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act 1973, persons are informed of the right of appeal to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  It would, however, be a matter for the party concerned or their representatives to decide whether or not to refer the matter to the Tribunal for determination.</P>

      <Quest>the reason for the decision that the resurfacing works on roads in Enniscorthy town, County Wexford, to be included as part of the main drainage scheme which is currently underway, are not now to be undertaken; the way in which the decision was made; if £1 million which was to be spent for this purpose is now not committed to the area; and if he will have this matter reconsidered so that the roads and footpaths in question will be brought up to the highest possible standard.</Quest>

      <P>As is the normal practice with water and sewerage schemes, the contract for Stage 2 of the Enniscorthy Main Drainage Scheme, which is now underway, includes provision for the full restoration of affected roadways. Enniscorthy Urban District Council, however, sought approval to more extensive road reconstruction work, including the provision of new footpaths, storm drainage and the under grounding of electricity and telephone services at a cost of over £460,000.  In view of the nature and extent of these works, the Council was informed in May 1992, that the cost was not acceptable as a charge against grants.  Consideration will, however, be given to any revised proposals which the Council may submit in respect of the affected roads.</P>

      <P>The Government has consistently conveyed to the UK authorities at every opportunity its serious concerns about safety <Col N="178" /> aspects of Britain's nuclear industry.  In particular, there has been persistent opposition to the continued operation and expansion of nuclear reprocessing activities at Sellafield.  Two detailed submissions were forwarded to London by the Government during 1993 calling for a halt to reprocessing and the closure of the Sellafield plant, including THORP, and the safe management and storage of stocks of nuclear waste materials at the plant.</P>
      <P>There have also been continuous representations over the years about radioactive discharges into the Irish Sea. Arising from pressure from many quarters including the Irish Government, British Nuclear Fuels have reduced their emissions significantly since the early eighties and this has resulted in a slow decline in contamination levels monitored by the National Radiological Protection Institute.  The Government's aim of course is to have such discharges minimised as much as possible and ultimately eliminated.  In this connection, at the OSLO/PARIS Convention meeting on the Prevention of Marine Pollution in June this year, an Irish recommendation was adopted agreeing to adopt further measures, including the application of best available techniques, for the reduction or elimination of marine radioactive discharges.  In relation to planned discharges at THORP, the recommendation also called for more information on its justification, an environmental impact assessment and the use of best available techniques before an authorisation was given.</P>
      <P>In November 1993, the Government supported a total ban on radioactive waste dumping at sea.  This has implications for the UK nuclear industry as they have an upcoming problem with the disposal of decommissioned nuclear plant and nuclear powered submarines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At various times also, concern has been relayed to the UK authorities about the risks associated with the operation of old Magnox reactors in the UK which have major shortcomings compared with modern reactors.  The recent closure of Trawsfynndd Magnox nuclear plant in <Col N="179" /> Wales therefore was welcome news in that respect.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to highlight its concerns about safety aspects of the UK nuclear industry at every opportunity at home and abroad.</P>

      <P>In August, a plan prepared by management for the future viable operation of the hotel was presented to staff and union.  This was the subject of a series of meetings in September and October between management and the staff-union committee, two of which were conducted under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission.  In early November, the package which had been worked out in these meetings was rejected by a majority of staff in a secret ballot and the hotel then closed.</P>
      <P>Since the closure, contact between the management and union has been maintained. The company has recently invited the union to indicate what changes might be considered in the plan to secure staff agreement.</P>
      <P>Following the acquisition of the Great Southern Hotels by Aer Rianta in November, 1990, a major refurbishment programme costing £14 million has been undertaken.  There are no plans for the expansion of the hotels currently before me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the Study Group on the Development of the Psychiatric Services, <i>Planning for the Future</i>, which was published in December 1984 recommended a shift in delivery of services for the mentally ill from an institutional to a community based service.  This policy has been adopted by successive Governments and the process of providing a comprehensive community based service in place of the traditional model based on the psychiatric hospital has been ongoing for a number of years.  The <i>Green Paper on Mental Health</i>, which was published in June, 1992 endorsed the policies as outlined in <i>Planning for the Future</i> and outlined what still needs to be done to complete the transition to a comprehensive, community oriented, sector <Col N="183" /> based service which is integrated with other health services.</P>
      <P>In line with this policy, the number of patients resident in public psychiatric hospitals has continued to fall from 11,613 patients in December 1984 to 7,050 at the end of March 1991.  The fall in the number of patients in psychiatric hospitals has been brought about by the transfer of admissions to acute psychiatric units in general hospitals, by the transfer of many patients from hospital to independent community living or to community residences and by the deaths of older residents.  While the hospitalisation rate of psychiatric patients has been falling, it is still twice as high as that of France, Denmark, England and Wales.</P>
      <P>The number of community residences and training hostels for discharged long-stay patients has increased from just over 121 in 1984 to 324 in 1991.  The number of places in these residences and hostels has also increased from just over 900 to 2,288 in the same period.  Day hospitals and day centres for the mentally ill have also been established to cater for patients living in the community and to prevent admissions to hospitals which might otherwise take place.  In 1984 there were thirty two day hospitals and centres providing 800 places compared to 114 providing approximately 2,500 places at the end of 1991.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that while I recognise the need for sufficient long-stay places for psychiatric patients, I am satisfied that there are sufficient long-stay beds available in psychiatric hospitals to cater for those long-stay patients who have been assessed as unsuitable for transfer to community based accommodation.</P>

      <P>I take it that the person in question is suffering from a specific learning disability, in view of the Deputy's reference to a special class being organised by the Association for Children with Learning Disabilities.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the educational needs of children with specific learning disability, sometimes referred to as dyslexia, are generally capable of being met within the ordinary school system, with the assistance, where appropriate, of a remedial teacher.</P>
      <P>Fully qualified primary school teachers are trained to deal with a variety of reading problems, including those which are accompanied by perceptional difficulties. In addition the special training programme for remedial teachers includes a module on specific learning disability.</P>
      <P>Where more serious cases of difficulty arise, provision is made in one of the special schools dedicated to this area. Two of these schools are located in Dublin and one in Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While fully recognising the important support provided by parents and voluntary groups, such as the group mentioned by the Deputy, in this area, my intention for the present is to concentrate available resources on the development <Col N="189" /> of school-based strategies to address the needs of the children in question.</P>
    <P>Funds are not available to my Department towards the expenses of parents or voluntary groups who may be providing assistance additional to that provided by the school system.</P>
    <P>However, if the Deputy wishes to provide further details of the case he mentions, I will arrange to have the question of a suitable eduational placement for the child examined by my Department.</P>
