      <P>Is the proposal agreed that Nos. 1, 4 and 5 shall be decided without debate?  Agreed.  Are the proposals for dealing with the Committee Stage of No. 7 agreed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Criminal Justice Bill, 1993, was taken at the specific request of the Minister for Justice because of its very sensitive nature and urgency.  The Minister in introducing the Bill said she would be prepared to accept amendments on Committee Stage.  Will the Minister be present to steer the Bill through the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Justice will take the Bill to finality and is fully competent to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise two issues in regard to the same matter.  First, the order is on the basis that when Committee Stage is completed the only amendments which will be taken in effect are those table by the Minister.  During the last Dáil session it was agreed that if the Minister indicated that amendments from the Opposition were acceptable, they would then be accepted.  Will the Taoiseach agree that that procedure will apply in this instance?</P>
      <P>Secondly, in the context of the issue which my colleague, Deputy Kenny, raised, I am concerned that last evening at the close of the debate the Minister of State at the Department of Justice seemed to indicate that the Government lacked the capacity to accept any Opposition amendments today.  I am concerned that that may be the case because he may not have the authority, in the absence of the Minister for Justice, to accept amendments.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will clarify the question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The arrangements requested by Deputy Shatter are already included in the Order of Business and the same procedure will apply.  The amendments <Col N="1631" /> will be considered on their merit by the Minister.  That is already included in the Order of Business.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are taking a commonsense practical approach to the arrangements for sittings next week.  We will take a week off the period of the Easter recess and take it at this time instead so there will be no loss of Dáil sitting time.  On the question of committees sitting next week, this can be arranged and I believe two of the committees are ready to be set up and will be in a position to sit next week.</P>

      <P>Item No. 7 seeks to adjourn the House tomorrow until Tuesday, 23 March, which effectively means that we do not sit next week.  Even the proposal from Deputy Bruton that some committees would meet next week is apparently not acceptable to the Government.  I regard this as an utterly disgraceful proposal.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I am making a point in relation to a proposal before the House and I seek your indulgence to speak on the matter. It is an utter disgrace to propose that the House will not sit next week.  The House is very well aware of the growing wave of cynicism about how we do our business.</P>

      <P>In page 3, before section 1, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;1.&mdash;In any case where a sentence has been imposed by the Court consisting of imprisonment or a fine or Community Service Order any decision made by the Minister pursuant to the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1951, to commute or remit such sentence or any decision to release any person from custody pursuant to the law for the time being relating to temporary release orders made under the Criminal Justice Act, 1960, shall be notified to the public by a notice published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> stating the following matters:</P>
      <P>(a)  the name of the person in respect of whom the decision is made;</P>
      <P>(b)  the sentence imposed on such person;</P>
      <P>(c)  the offence or offences in respect of which such sentence was imposed; and</P>
      <P>(d)  the extent by which the sentence was commuted or remitted, or in relation to a temporary release order the duration of any term of imprisonment actually served by the person prior to the commencement of such order.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed the Minister is not here for this debate.  I normally would not raise a matter of this kind because it is important that Ministers represent Ireland abroad on St. Patrick's Day, but I have to raise it on this occasion because of the manner in which the Government sought to take this Bill.  On Tuesday afternoon Deputy Mary Coughlan told us in the House that the Bill was very urgent and the Government wanted to take it that afternoon.  The Minister for Justice seemed keen to take the Bill on <Col N="1642" /> Tuesday.  We were told the reason was that the Minister had just met the incest victim from Kilkenny and her mother and was therefore anxious to have the Bill passed.</P>
    <P>The Opposition kindly agreed in very unusual circumstances to take the Bill yesterday, which required spokespeople such as myself having to do considerable work in a very short period.  The Minister opened the debate here yesterday, Deputy Shatter spoke next and in the middle of my speech the Minister left for Australia &mdash; she is now in Singapore.  I am disgusted the Minister did not see fit to stay for at least the Second Stage debate and for this morning's Committee Stage.  I say this because she told us she was going to listen carefully to the debate &mdash; unless she had special earplugs on the plane I do not know how she could have listened to the debate yesterday &mdash; and that she was going to take on board suggestions.  She asked for recommendations in relation to the maximum penalty for incest.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I normally would not raise a matter of this kind and I am not doing so in any sense for cheap publicity but because I genuinely believe it was wrong of the Minister, in the circumstances in which she sought to bring forward this Bill, to stick to her original arrangements.  Although the Minister changed her arrangements from an Aer Lingus flight to use the Government jet, otherwise she stuck to her timescale and I am very disappointed she has chosen to do so when we are discussing this very important legislation.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment in my name &mdash; this applies principally to fines &mdash; is that when a fine is considered by the person on whom it is imposed to be unreasonable the person is normally told by members of the Garda Síochána and others that one way of seeking to have the penalty reduced is to go to their local politician who can lobby the Minister for Justice who has the power to reduce or totally abolish fines, community service orders or whatever.  All of us have made representations, which we are obliged to do, on behalf of constituents, although I <Col N="1643" /> have never done so except where I believed there was a legitimate case for making such representation.</P>
    <P>This is a power the Minister should not have.  The Minister has been critical of lenient sentences, as have all politicians. It seems ironic that in the context of passing judgment on particular sentences this power should be reserved in political hands.  It is not appropriate that the Minister should have that power, but rather than abolish it altogether, which would not be in order in the context of this Bill, I propose to take some pressure from the Minister and at the same time allow the public to be able to assess the impact of this power, the way it is being used and what exactly particular Ministers do in relation to the power they have.  The courts can impose a fine or an appeal can be made and a new sentence imposed but if the Minister keeps the power to reduce or abolish a sentence, a fine, or community service order, that is a little strange.  I suggest that where the power is used, the name and address of the person in respect of whom the decision is made should be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> along with the sentence imposed, the offence or offences for which the penalty is imposed and the extent to which the sentence was commuted or remitted or, in relation to a temporary release order, the duration of the term of imprisonment served prior to the commencement of such an order.</P>
    <P>This is a reasonable amendment which will allow the public to have the kind of information that would make us better informed about the impact of sentencing policy and what happens in reality.  In the context of framing legislation and updating the law, it will allow politicians to be fully informed.  If the Programme for Government is to be implemented, the criminal law will be subject to major reform which is long overdue.  A Deputy yesterday raised a question as to how much information we have about sentences and he wondered if anybody ever did adequate research on the nature of sentences over any period.  My amendment would make a contribution towards <Col N="1644" /> research in that area and that would be extremely useful.  For all those reasons I hope the Minister of State will be in a position to accept this reasonable amendment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore on 2 March asked a question in the Dáil in relation to those who had received a temporary release during the Christmas period and he was informed that an extensive list of people received temporary release.  I am not opposed to the principle because, as far as possible, people should be free to be with their families and loved ones on Christmas Day.  However, it seems that people serving long sentences of from four to seven years for robbery whose release date would be 1995 after a normal remission which is about one-third of the sentence, obtained a temporary release.  I do not know on what basis that occurred. Obviously families lobbied and the governor of the institution has a huge say in it, but very often there is also a political decision.  There is much disquiet in the community about it.  Yesterday in a parliamentary reply we were told that last year the number of people out on bail who committed further crimes was almost 3,000.  The public are entitled to as much information as possible.</P>
    <P>To be fair to the courts, it is wrong to criticise lenient decisions if Ministers are constantly reducing the penalties imposed by the courts.  Many judges, the Garda Síochána and other practitioners of the law feel very aggrieved that politicians can get away with using this power, because it is used quietly behind closed doors so that nobody ever really knows about it or on what basis decisions are made.  I will not delay the House because we have a short Committee Stage and we want to get through as many of these amendments as possible.  I would ask the Minister to accept the amendment which is reasonable in the circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Harney that this Bill together with all the provisions we are dealing with in relation to the Bill are of importance.  Indeed, it is legislation that could have been passed <Col N="1645" /> three years ago if the Government had accepted a Fine Gael Private Members' Bill.</P>
      <P>Originally, we were to take Second Stage of this Bill on Friday and it was represented to us that the Minister had a deep concern about this issue.  I wish to see this Bill passed through the House speedily.  I welcome that, because of the undue delay by the Government in even acknowledging the need for this legislation. It is appalling in the area of priorities that the Minister is not here today to take this Bill.  It is appalling that she should leave the country to go to Australia when we are taking all Stages of the Bill today and when she could have equally gone on the designated trip tomorrow.</P>
      <P>Since the Fine Gael Private Members' Bill was published by me a week ago to increase the maximum sentence for incest from seven to 20 years, the Minister has being doing a seven day a week public relations exercise to portray her concern in the media.  Without acknowledging the importance of the Fine Gael Bill, she made a presentation as if it was a Government initiative and we now see at the later section that the Fine Gael proposal to increase the maximum sentence to 20 years has been accepted by the Government. If the Minister was concerned about this Bill, about getting it right and amending it properly and ensuring that it would work, she would be here in the House today.  Being a Minister and a legislator is not just about public relations exercises, it is about being in this House doing the real work that must be done in ensuring that legislation put through the House is correct.</P>
      <P>I will be interested in the responses of the Minister of State to amendments today to see whether he has the authority to take on board any of the amendments tabled by the Opposition or whether he will have to kick to touch on all of them on the basis of promising that they will be re-examined when the Bill goes to the Seanad, presumably because before the Bill goes to the Seanad the Minister will be back in this country.  It is simply not good enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1646" /> In relation to Deputy Harney's proposal, there is some merit in it.  Deputy Harney has made the case for it and like her, I will not unduly delay the House because there are a lot of amendments we need to discuss.  However, there is one aspect of relevance to her amendment which she has not addressed which highlights to some extent the hypocrisy of the Government in dealing with criminal justice.  It is agreed across the House now that there is need for appeals against unduly lenient sentences.  That is based on the assumption that when people commit serious crime there will be a sentence commensurate with the crime, imposed by the courts, and that when on occasions judges act inconsistently there should be the possibility of appealing to the higher courts.  There is an assumption that when sentences are imposed they will be served fully.  The problem is that when sentences are currently handed down, very often the sentences are not fully served because we do not have sufficient capacity in our prisons to keep people in prison for the duration of the sentence.  We have had for a number of years what the Garda have described as a revolving door system, whereby the courts sentence people and they go in the front door of Mountjoy Prison and some months later they are allowed out the back door to make room for someone else.  Whereas this legislation is badly needed, we are only doing a part of the job and it is a little disingenous for the Government to support legislation on appeal against unduly lenient sentences when they have failed to provide the facilities to ensure that proper sentences are fully serviced.  That is a real problem.</P>
    <P>If, under Deputy Harney's amendment, the information was published it would to some extent highlight the numbers of people who are being released from the prisons without fully serving sentences.  I accept that a system that allows for time off for good behaviour has some merit.  I do not suggest that we set that aside entirely, but the concept of early release has been used not simply to allow people out for reasons of good behaviour but to make space for new <Col N="1647" /> people sentenced by the courts.  That is not good enough.</P>
    <P>In the context of the information that Deputy Harney has suggested should be published it would be important that not only do we note the sentence handed down by the courts, but the length of time the person served prior to release. That should be a matter of public knowledge. The general public and the Judiciary are entitled to know that if someone is sentenced to a term of imprisonment, be it for six months, six years or nine years, how much of that term is served by the individual.  It should be a matter of public record how we operate our criminal justice system and the extent to which court sentences are complied.</P>
    <P>I agree with the view that the power of the Minister to commute fines handed down by the courts should be abolished. If we accept the independence of the courts and the Judiciary it is extraordinary that after a judge has imposed a fine on a person that the Minister for Justice can, by the stroke of a pen, reduce that fine.  Like Deputy Harney, I can recall during the 13 years I have been a Member of this House writing on three or four occasions asking a Minister for Justice to exercise this power.  I have always felt uneasy about it and I wrote the letters merely because I had been requested by the constituents concerned. They were entitled to have their request considered by the Minister as that power exists.  It was not for me to block representations being made on their behalf. It is wrong and a Minister should not be in a position to make such decisions.</P>
    <P>There is an assumption by the general public that if a particular party is in Government a fine imposed on a supporter of that party will be commuted. That may not be the case and it may be an injustice to any Minister to suggest it is how they operate.  Nevertheless, there is a smell of that type of procedure going on behind closed doors.  It is a procedure that does not show respect for the courts or safeguards the independence of the <Col N="1648" /> Judiciary.  It is open to abuse and should be abolished.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I too want to comment on the absence of the Minister for Justice from the debate this morning.  The Opposition parties co-operated with the Government in bringing forward the debate on this legislation because we accepted, at face value, the Government's <i>bona fides</i> to have this legislation, which we all consider to be important, debated and enacted as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Usually, I would not agree with an arrangement for the taking of Second Stage of a Bill on Wednesday, followed by Committee Stage on Thursday morning with a break before Committee Stage and it and Report Stage guillotined in the space of about one hour.  In normal circumstances if such an arrangement for the taking of a Bill was presented to this House I certainly argue that insufficient time was being given for consideration of the 20 amendments before us.  I would argue that the gap between the various Stages was not sufficient to allow the Minister, and his officials, consider the points made by Members.  For example, the Minister will have one hour and a quarter &mdash; the period of Question Time &mdash; to consider points put forward on Second Stage.  That is insufficient time, but I accepted that procedure because the Government was anxious to have the legislation dealt with as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I had been informed that the Minister was anxious to have this legislation dealt with because she had a commitment abroad, I would have been open to accommodating that wish, but that is not what we were presented with.  On Tuesday evening we were presented with a shoddy, pre-rehearsed set up by the Taoiseach who said the Government was willing, if the House wished, to take the Bill. This was followed by a Member of one of the Government parties innocently asking whether the Bill could be taken. This was a shoddy, rehearsed set-up arrangement in a cynical attempt to portray the Opposition parties as not accepting  <Col N="1649" /> the taking of this important legislation which the public was crying out for.  The Opposition parties agreed to have the Bill dealt with quickly and expeditiously. The Minister then showed discourtesy to those of us who were prepared to change our schedule in order to be present for the Committee Stage debate, and prepared our amendments in the hope that the Minister for Justice would take them on board.  I have no objection to the Minister going to Australia on official Government business or to accommodate her by taking legislation for which she is responsible but I object to being sold the kind of cynical political pup which we were sold on Tuesday evening.</P>
    <P>The amendment before us deals with a question raised by Deputy Harney yesterday. I agree with the principle that the review of sentences, and the exercising of discretion, should be taken out of the hands of politicians.  There is probably a need for an independent body to review sentences.  It is inappropriate that decisions by courts can subsequently become the subject of political lobbying. We are continually asked to make representations on behalf of people who have been convicted of offences &mdash; in many cases minor offences &mdash; to Ministers for Justice to commute the sentences, allow the fine to go unpaid and so on.</P>
    <P>I wish to express a note of caution in relation to Deputy Harney's amendment. The bulk of those representations refer to minor cases.  Most of the letters I write to the Minister for Justice are petitions in relation to a fine for non-payment of a television licence or some other minor offence.  Very often I write to the Minister for Justice because the people concerned did not get a fair hearing in court. During the week I heard of a person who turned up in court on a relatively minor driving offence and was led to believe by the gardaí that there would be no problem, that they would not press the matter.  The person in question, who was not represented in court, got very short shrift from the judge, had her licence suspended for a period of six months and <Col N="1650" /> was fined.  That court decision will be the subject of a letter from me to the Minister for Justice in the course of time because she cannot pay.  Politicians make representations to the Minister for Justice on behalf of people who have been convicted of minor offences and been treated, in some cases, very peremptorily by judges in a hurry to the golf course or to lunch.  I have some reservations about blowing out of proportion the kind of minor offences which are very often the subject of these types of representations.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney referred to a parliamentary question put down by me on 3 March.  I put down that question to find out how decisions on matters such as temporary release are actually made.  I found myself in the situation, in which I am sure many Members of the House often find themselves, of making representations to the Department on Christmas eve on behalf of a constituent who was due for release on, I think, 16 January, who was serving the end of his sentence in an open prison and who had expected, as had his family, to be released temporarily for the Christmas period.  I know that other Members of the House also made representations on his behalf.  To make a long story short, the Department decided that the person concerned could not be released temporarily for Christmas.  I was puzzled why somebody who was to be released on 16 January could not be released for a day or two over the Christmas period so that he could be with his family.  That is what prompted me to put down the question, which sought to establish the offenders who had been released temporarily for Christmas, the length of time which remained to be served by them and the offences they had committed.  I wanted to see if I could establish from that list whether there was any rationale or pattern to the way in which the Department makes these decisions.  I could not establish any pattern to these decisions and I still do not understand the basis on which these decisions are made.</P>
    <P>I have to question the lack of accountability for the making of such decisions. There are two sides to the story.  On the <Col N="1651" /> one hand, there is the public concern about the revolving door problem, where offenders are let out of prison either to make room in the prison or for some other inexplicable reason, while on the other hand there is the problem of offenders who have some grievance in relation to the policy of the Department. I agree that there is a greater need for accountability and transparency in this area so that there is not, on the one hand, a public perception that offenders are being released willy-nilly by the Department and Minister for Justice and, on the other hand, that offenders do not feel they have been passed over for release, treated unfairly, etc.  The way to deal with this issue might be to take it out of the political area altogether and put it in the hands of an independent sentencing review board who could make the decisions.</P>

      <P>Before I refer specifically to the amendment, I wish to correct a point I made during Second Stage debate yesterday.  It was brought to my attention that in reply to a question from Deputy Quill I suggested that counsel for the prosecution makes representation in relation to sentences.  Of course, that is not correct and I did not intend to say it.  I apologise to Deputy Quill.  I misunderstood her question; I thought she was referring to counsel for the defence.  I see from the list of amendments that we will be able to discuss this matter further in the context of a later amendment from Deputy Quill.</P>
      <P>I also omitted yesterday to congratulate the spokespersons for the various parties on their appointments.

      <P>With regard to the amendment before us, I take on board the point made by Deputy Gilmore &mdash; I made the same point yesterday &mdash; that there should be more time between Committee and Report Stages of Bills as a number of technical points will inevitably arise on Committee Stage.  In considering whether to make these changes on Report Stage sometimes we have to consult outside parties, sometimes the parliamentary draftsman has to look at the proposed change in detail and sometimes we have to consult with the Attorney General's office to check the constitutionality of the suggested change.  I have to say that an hour and 15 minutes &mdash; the interregnum between Committee Stage and Report Stage of this Bill &mdash; is not sufficient to do all this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make it clear to the House that I have all the authority the Minister has to accept any amendments put forward by the Opposition which I consider to be worthwhile and desirable.  I am <Col N="1653" /> sorry that Deputy Shatter chose to distort what I said yesterday.  This is not the first time he has done this, and no doubt it will not be the last time.  I am very sorry to have to say it, but it is perfectly in character for distortion to come from that quarter.  The point I made yesterday was initially made by Deputy Harney and repeated by Deputy Gilmore today, that is, in view of the short interregnum between Committee and Report Stages of this Bill I might have to defer consideration of whether or not to accept amendments, so that I can get outside advice, until the Bill is debated in the Seanad in two or three weeks' time.  That may have to be the interregnum in this instance rather than the interregnum of one hour and 15 minutes between Committee and Report Stages.  That is the point I was making yesterday.  I did not mean to suggest that I did not have the authority to consider or take on board worthwhile changes proposed by the Opposition.</P>
    <P>As I read the amendment, Deputy Harney wishes to have published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> all reductions in fines, all changes in community service orders and all matters dealing with reductions of terms of imprisonment or temporary release.  I do not think it would be practicable to extend this provision to cover fines, especially fines for minor offences. Nowadays practically everyone approaches their TDs for assistance and I can assure the House that if that power was taken away from us my task both as a public representative and as Minister of State at the Department of Justice would be made much easier.  Purely from a selfish point of view, it would be of benefit to me if this happened, but I would not be inclined to support such a move.</P>
    <P>It would be impracticable for every single decision in regard to every small fine imposed &mdash; even for a parking offence or, as Deputy Gilmore said, failure to get a television licence or drinking in a pub after hours &mdash; for every single commutation decided by the Minister for Justice to be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i> Maybe that is not what Deputy Harney <Col N="1654" /> intended; she may have intended to confine this provision to instances where a prison sentence had been changed in some way or temporary release granted.</P>
    <P>The tradition has been that the privacy of people who have been sentenced to prison is generally protected.  I would be reluctant to depart from that tradition as such protection is justified by the need to save the offender's relatives and so on from further damaging publicity.  If such protection was removed a prisoner's rehabilitation could be affected.  Temporary release is regarded internationally as a potent factor in rehabilitation.  We cannot have it both ways; the offender must be allowed to take his place in society when he is released.  We hope that he will not offend again, unfortunately our hopes are dashed in this regard in many cases because there is a very high level of recidivism.  A person who is released early has to have satisfied the prison authorities etc. that he is fit to be released.  That does not always work in practice because life is not perfect.  The intention of the Minister is that such a person should be rehabilitated and allowed to take his place in society.  If everything goes well, he does not have to serve any further term of imprisonment for that offence.</P>
    <P>Decisions on temporary release for long term offenders are taken after careful consideration by the prison authorities and the Probation and Welfare Service and, where necessary, the medical officers and anybody else the prison section of the Department may wish to consult.  It is not an arbitrary procedure.</P>
    <P>Several speakers have said that the power to commute fines should be abolished. Deputy Gilmore made a very good case for the opposite argument.  In my capacity as a Deputy I have been approached many times by persons seeking to have their fines reduced.  Sometimes a reduction has been made.  The important point is that a petition to the Minister for Justice for a reduction in a fine results in delayed collection of either the full or any reduced amount.  The delay gives people who are in receipt of social welfare payments sufficient time to <Col N="1655" /> get the money together.  If the power to commute fines and the possibility of delay in collection did not exist, many of my constituents would end up in prison for non-payment of a fine.  This is the reality when 300,000 people are unemployed.  I had the case of a person who lost his job subsequent to the imposition of a fine and had to live on social welfare.  In such a case I am delighted to delay collection and possibly to secure a reduction.  We must take these considerations into account.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore referred to the inadequate time allowed between Committee and Report Stages.  I accept that point. We may have to consider amendments between the passing of the Bill in this House and the debate in the Seanad.  I am not disposed to accept the amendment, although I understand the reasoning behind it.  Deputy Harney made her case very well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his compliments.  He did not seek to defend the absence of the Minister for Justice, who said yesterday that she would listen carefully to the contributions by Deputies.  Her absence makes a farce of the whole thing.  I detect from the Minister of State's response on this amendment that he does not intend to accept any amendments.  Consequently the whole debate is a farce.  We will probably have to deal later with amendments from the Seanad, where the real debate is apparently to take place.</P>
      <P>I do not suggest that there should not be a power to reduce fines or sentences. My point is that this power should not be vested in politicians.  We know how unsatisfactory it was when politicians made decisions in relation to planning matters.  The establishment of An Bord Pleanála has taken these matters away from the area of political favouritism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unless our criminal justice system is a deterrent against crime, it does not serve its function.  In the absence of a deterrent, why would any of us want to obey the law?  Why would we bother to pay fines such as parking fines?  Fines are intended <Col N="1656" /> as a deterrent.  Anybody who has had a car seized and has had to pay £100 to have it released will be careful in future to park it legally.  The power to reduce fines should not be vested in the Minister for Justice.  The decision is made behind closed doors and nobody knows the basis on which it is made.  We have no way of knowing whether the friends or political associates of the Minister of the day have an input.  Deputies could put down parliamentary questions seeking this information but the Minister of State seems to think it would not be practicable.  I should prefer an independent board who would produce an annual report indicating the basis on which they had made decisions.  The amendment is not unreasonable.</P>
    <P>People have come to me who have been fined for not having car insurance. I do not consider this a minor matter.  We can give the courts power to take account of the means of the individual when imposing a fine.  A fine of £50 may amount to very little for some people but for others £50 can be a week's disposable income.  I am not in favour of mandatory fines for specific offences because the court must have discretion to take account of disposable income.</P>
    <P>I accept that there can be compelling cases for a reduction in the penalty imposed by a court.  I have dealt with cases where if the fine were to be paid a family would have to do without essential foodstuffs for several weeks.  A wife once said to me that her husband would have to rob the money to pay a fine or else go to jail, at a cost to the State of £600 or £700 a week.  In such a case, is it not preferable to reduce the fine and make it payable over a longer period?  We have to be practical about these matters and we must devise a system of justice which is fair and equitable.</P>
    <P>Having been a Minister of State, I can imagine how these decisions are made. A wad of paper would come before the Minister on a Friday afternoon and I doubt if the Minister would have the time to read the back-up information or to carry out an analysis of each case.  The influence of the person making representations <Col N="1657" /> or simply the instinct of the Minister may be the determining factor. I am not happy about that.  If the information were to be made available through <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> we would be doing a great service to the Minister and to politics.  We would also help to restore faith in the system.  This point was made to me last weekend in a social context by a district justice.  The existing system is deeply resented and judges rarely know what decision is made.  That is unsatisfactory. If they were to see that the Minister generally reduces the fine in a particular type of case, it might encourage the judges to take other factors into account.</P>
    <P>The giving of information is not a bad thing.  We have heard much about openness and freedom of information.  If those things mean anything, access to this kind of information is a basic right.</P>
    <P>If one has to apply in a public way to build an extension to one's house and advertise it in the newspapers it is not unreasonable that a fine imposed for a criminal offence which is reduced by the Minister should be published also.  I am talking only about fines which are reduced by the Minister.  I am not suggesting that <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> should publish every fine which is imposed by a court.  I do not believe I am being unreasonable. It would help to restore faith in the politicians and convince people that we do have a system of justice that is fair and above board; that politicians do not criticise lenient sentences because of the blaze of publicity in relation to a particular case and then make decisions behind closed doors which are equally unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>While I will put the amendment I will not be calling a formal vote because I do not want to delay the House, as we have a very short time.  It is particularly difficult, particularly for those of us who do not have legal expertise, to come to terms with legislation of this kind, talk to as many people as possible who have a broad and balanced view and put in amendments in such a short time.  The time is far too short and we only agreed to it being taken in such a short time in very extraordinary <Col N="1658" /> circumstances.  It would not have been unreasonable to expect the Minister to postpone her travel until tomorrow, or even this evening, because St. Patrick's Day is not until Wednesday.  I am disappointed that she did not do so.</P>

      <P>Deputy Harney said that she feels that no Opposition amendments will be accepted today.  I think she is being unduly pessimistic.  She also said that she did not want this power vested in politicians but in an independent board. She quoted the example of An Bord Pleanála, which took over the function of planning appeals from the Minister for the Environment.  An Bord Pleanála might not be the best example to quote. Some of the experiences we have had with An Bord Pleanála have been distinctly unhappy.  If somebody comes to me petitioning in relation to a fine I still have to do as I did as an ordinary backbencher, that is, petition the Minister.  In theory it is the Minister for Justice who makes the decision.  In practice, however, the volume of these is so great that the Minister could not possibly look at them all and the decision is made by the petitions section of the Department of Justice. I do not think anybody should question the independence of the civil servants who man the petitions section of the Department of Justice.  Maybe it would be better to give the responsibility to an independent board, but that would be only for the sake of appearance.  The reality is that independent people of integrity, public servants, decide these things.  I see no practical reason for giving the responsibility to an independent board other than for the sake of appearances. For the sake of appearances we do far too many things in this House that have absolutely no practical value in real life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Harney make the point that somebody requiring to build an extention onto their house has to publicly look for planning permission.  The reason for that is that their neighbours or somebody else may wish to object.  In the case of a fine, however, the fine has already been imposed.  There is no point in objecting to <Col N="1659" /> something <i>ex post facto</i>.  Deputy Harney also made the point that not all fines are commuted.  I accept that, but practically everybody who is fined now goes along to his Dáil Deputy and quite a high volume of fines are commuted.  We would have to publish a special edition of <i>Iris Ofigiúil</i> every month if we were to include all the information the Deputy requires.</P>

      <P>We now come to amendment No. 2 in the name of Deputy Shatter.  This amendment is consequential on amendment No. 7 and amendment No. 9 is related.  We will therefore discuss amendments Nos. 2, 7 and 9 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following definition;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;the Act of 1981&rsquo; means the Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Act, 1981;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The related amendment, which is amendment No. 7, seeks to insert a new section 6 into the Act which reads as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;On conviction of any person of an offence to which section 5 applies, in addition to dealing with him in any other way, the court may prohibit such person at any future date from attending at or near to or entering any place <Col N="1660" /> in which the person in respect of whom such offence was committed resides or is in employment and from using or threatening to use violence against, molesting or putting in fear the person in respect of whom such offence was committed or any member of such persons family.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) reads:</P>
    <P>An order made pursuant to subsection (1) of this section shall be treated as if it were a barring order made under the Act of 1981 and sections 5, 6, 7 and 8 of the Act of 1981 shall apply to such order.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Yesterday on Second Stage I made the point that we should have a more victim orientated system of criminal law.  I made the point that, particularly in sexual offences such as rape, sexual assault or incest, there is always a fear in the minds of the victims that, if they give evidence in court proceedings which results in the imprisonment of the person who has committed the offence against them, at some time in the future the person will, when released, come back to haunt them and seek revenge.  There are many people who have been the victims of sexual abuse and sexual offences who have not reported them to the Garda, or who, having reported them, have backed out of giving evidence in court for fear of the consequences if they do so.</P>
    <P>It is probably true to say that in reality very few people have found that some years later the convicted person has come back to create problems for them.  I do not think we have had too many instances of that, but from the discussions I have had with people who have been offended against in this way I know there is a very real and continuing fear in their minds that this could happen.  Very often when a sentence of imprisonment is handed down for a sexual assault such as rape or child sexual abuse, not only is the offender imprisoned but the victim is, effectively, imprisoned in her own house following the release of the person who has committed the offence because she <Col N="1661" /> fears what will happen if she comes in contact with the offender.  If the offender does not visit her in her home, she is fearful that she may simply bump into him in the street and that that may result in some form of attack on her.</P>
    <P>The amendments I propose are designed to extend to the courts an additional power when convicting persons of sexual or violent crimes under the terms of the Act.  The Minister, in the Act, seeks to extend to the courts the power to award compensation orders following a conviction.  This amendment is designed also to extend to the courts the power to, in effect, grant an order which will bar or prohibit an offender from attending at or near, or seeking to enter the home in which their victim resides and from in any way molesting or putting the victim in fear.  It does so by providing in the context of that power for a discretion that the courts would be able to exercise in appropriate cases and which the courts could enforce if, following the conviction and imprisonment of a person on their release, they failed to abide by the order.  It seeks to provide enforcement mechanisms that apply under the Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Act, 1981, to such orders.  In particular it seeks to apply sections 5, 6, 7 and 8 of that Act.  Section 5 of that Act requires the courts when making a barring order to furnish a copy of that order to the Garda in the local station in the area in which the person who is being protected by the order resides.  Section 6 of that Act renders the breaking of a barring order an offence that can result in summary conviction, a term of imprisonment of up to six months and a fine of up to £200.  If, following release from prison, the perpetrator of a sexual offence sought to interfere in any way with his victim that person would, by simply going to the home of the victim, be liable to prosecution and to a prison term of up to six months.  Moreover, section 7 of that Act extends to the Garda a power of arrest that they would not necessarily have otherwise.  Section 8 of the Act makes it an offence for someone <Col N="1662" /> charged with such an offence to commit a further offence when on bail; that of itself becomes an offence that could result in the imposition of a consecutive sentence.</P>
    <P>Yesterday I made the point that the Bill is welcome in so far as it will allow for appeals against unduly lenient sentences, in so far as there may be incorporated into it either the amendment I have tabled or the amendment tabled by the Minister to increase the maximum term of sentence for incest to 20 years and in so far as it provides for compensation payments.  However, it is my view that the Bill must also provide additional protection to victims of sexual offences. Were the court, after handing down a conviction, to put in place an order of the kind to which I have referred, considerably more peace of mind would be afforded those who are concerned that a person who has been sentenced for committing an offence will come back to haunt them after release from prison.</P>
    <P>The provision would be a relatively simple and straightforward legal measure that could properly be inserted in the legislation.  Just as the House is now conferring power on the courts to grant compensation orders, there should be no difficulty of any nature in the courts being given a discretionary power to prohibit someone convicted of a violent assault or a sexual offence from seeking to interfere with, approach or attend at the house or the business premises of his or her victim following release from prison.  The fear experienced by victims was expressed very vividly in the recent Kilkenny case by the victim of incest who appeared on our national television news.</P>
    <P>I hasten to add that my proposal is not merely a rapidly thought-up provision resulting from one very tragic case; it is a proposal that should have been enacted into law some time ago and is based on my own experiences in dealing with people who have suffered in this regard and who have very real fears that the law will not provide them with full protection following the release from prison of the perpetrator of a sexual offence if that person comes to seek them out.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1663" /> My proposal would provide protection, it would provide for a new criminal offence in this area and it would give the Garda additional powers of arrest, and it would do so on the basis of a legal scheme that has been proved to work well under the Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Act, 1981.  Just as the Minister sees fit under this Bill to adapt the attachment of earnings provisions contained in the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, for the payment of compensation orders, there is no reason that we could not also attach the enforcement provisions in relation to barring orders under the Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Act, 1981, to the making of these kind of orders.</P>
    <P>I seriously urge the Minister to accept this amendment.  I urge the Minister not to kick the amendment backwards and say that it has come before the House too quickly and will have to be considered, possibly in the Seanad.  As Deputy Harney very correctly said, we in the House seem to be in a bind today by virtue of the fact that Committee Stage and Report Stage are both being taken today.  If the Bill goes to the Seanad with the Minister having taken none of the Opposition amendments on board today and if the Minister subsequently seeks to take the amendments on board in the Seanad the Bill will come back to this House.</P>
    <P>In retrospect, if the Minister for Justice had been more up front with the House with regard to her intentions, it would have been a better approach for the House to take Committee Stage today and to take Report Stage on the day the Dáil resumes after the St. Patrick's week vacation &mdash; a vacation that is being imposed on some of us, who do not approve of the Dáil taking the intended break.  It would have been much more practical for the House to take Report Stage of the Bill on the Tuesday that the House resumes after the week of vacation, because in that way the Minister would have had more time for consideration. As Report Stage is to be taken <Col N="1664" /> today, I ask the Minister to take on board my proposal, bearing in mind that having given the proposal further consideration the Minister or the Minister of State may want to make further amendments to it in the Seanad.  The provision has been very carefully drafted and I believe it is workable and correctly presented.  I also believe that if the Minister has further time to reflect on the provision, having taken it on board, when it goes to the Seanad it will be recognised that there is no need for amendment and, if that is the case, there will be no need to bring the matter back before this House.</P>
    <P>If this additional scheme of protection were put in place the House would send out a message that Deputies are concerned with providing a victim-orientated protective system within the area of criminal justice and that we in the House acknowledge the very real fears often held by those who have been the victims of what most of us would regard as the most appalling, inhuman and vicious kind of offences.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms. McManus Ms. McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms. McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at the way in which the Minister has approached this legislation.  I certainly took at face value the Minister's declared interest in hearing what Deputies had to say and I was astonished yesterday that she disappeared, followed later by the Minister of State, and that the Minister remaining in the Chamber was the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare with special responsibility for poverty.  That was a very unfortunate signal to send out to the public in that the implication could be made that sexual abuse and incest are in some way related to poverty, which is simply not the case. There is always a danger that people think of those who are poor as being somehow more likely to be criminal or deviant.  An institute in Dublin that deals with sexual offenders notes that the average educational standards of sexual abusers is rather higher than those of the average criminal.  The arrangement made yesterday was unfortunate.  I am surprised that the Minister did not consider <Col N="1665" /> that it was important for her to be in the Chamber.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 9 highlights the point that the law is not good unless people feel that they can avail of it.  I learnt yesterday that as the law stands at the moment the Director of Public Prosecutions is able to go to the Supreme Court to appeal sentences, yet that power has not been used.  It is very important that when legislation is changed we make sure that those who need to avail of legislation feel that they can come forward and do so.  Amendment No. 9 enables the victims of abuse and violence to feel safe in approaching the courts.  It is my argument that unless that shelter of the State is provided the victims of violence and sexual abuse will not be empowered to come forward, yet that is probably the single, most effective way to start the process of combating these terrible crimes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment seeks an extension of the barring order protection procedure to victims of this kind of abuse and, in cases in which a person has been charged, for the interim period in which the case is being heard.  At present the barring order procedure is quite limited in that it recognises only the marital relationship. I acknowledge that the Minister for Equality and Law Reform has stated that he will change that provision &mdash; such a change will not come before its time. Many people nowadays live in relationships other than a marital relationship and it is to be hoped that we all recognise, at long last, that violence and sexual abuse occur in other relationships also, whether they be father-daughter relationships, brother-sister relationships or other relationships not covered by the barring orders and protection orders we have at present.  When amending the legislation, it is vital that that protection for the individual victim be stitched into the legislation.  If that is not done, an enormous day-to-day burden will be put on the victim, and we cannot do that any longer.  Even in relation to the barring orders that exist and those that work there are still numerous instances when those orders are broken and the supports <Col N="1666" /> of the State are not sufficiently quick to deal with the problem.  We need to provide security for the victim as well as punishment for the perpetrator.  If the two do not operate in tandem we will not achieve the desired result.</P>
    <P>The message must go out that this crime is evil and wrong.  Very often offenders in sex cases, particularly in cases of incest, do not believe that the crime they committed was evil and wrong, and we must spell that out clearly. We will not make progress unless the security of the victim is assured.  Without this type of amendment we will not be able to provide that shelter, we will simply cast victims adrift and let them take their chance in the courts, in the street or in the home.  The victims must have the protection of the State.</P>
    <P>Many victims of domestic violence go to refuges even where protection and barring orders setting out their right to stay in the family home are in force. Victims who stay in the family home with a violent partner often find their position so difficult and stressful that they could not institute court proceedings.  We must provide emergency accommodation in refuges.  Is the Minister of State satisfied that we are providing such accommodation countrywide?  I urge him to consider victims of sexual abuse and the ordeal they have been through.  Hand in hand with any punishment imposed on the perpetrator of such a crime must be the provision of shelters for the victim who is a cruical witness in any court proceedings and without whose help the State will not be able to prosecute the offender.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Reference was made to the victim in the recent Kilkenny case. Two issues dominated the statements by the victim since that case.  One was her desire to get on with her life and the second was her fear of what will happen her on her father's release from prison. That fear reflects the concerns of many people in relation to co-operating in the prosecution of a case.  This does not relate only to sexual violence and sexual offences generally.  The predominant <Col N="1667" /> worry of most people when reporting an offence to the gardaí, and subsequently co-operating in the prosecution of the case is the fear of retribution by the person against whom they have brought the case.  I have often heard people say, in response to being asked if they would co-operate with the gardaí in the prosecution of a case that they do not want to have a stone thrown through the window and they are afraid of being attacked.  Indeed, that has turned out to be the case many times when people were released from prison.  In my area there were one or two tragic cases of people on being released from prison subsequently attacking, in a vicious way, those who gave evidence against them in court.  That is a real fear of people generally, particularly in cases of sexual abuse.</P>
      <P>However, there is an additional dimension to those cases, that in the majority of such cases the offender is either a member of the victim's immediate family, a relative, a neighbour or a person known to the victim.  It is not enough to deal with the problem simply by prosecuting and gaining a conviction against that person followed by a term of imprisonment. The duration of the sentences can range from a few months to a considerable number of years.  That is not sufficient because the victim is always worried about the release of the person who committed the offence from prison, possibly without having been rehabilitated. The perpetrator may be back living in the victim's immediate locality.  As Deputy McManus said, where the offender is a member of the family, the onus is on the victim to seek a barring order.  Where the offender is not a member of the family the victim may be obliged to change house</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This obligation should not be placed on the victim to accommodate the movements and living arrangements of the offender when released from prison. Much consideration should be given to this matter and the courts should be given authority to deal with it.  Where a sexual assault is committed by a member of the victim's family, consideration must be <Col N="1668" /> given as to where the person will live when released from prison.  If the offender is allowed return to the family home that does not take account of the victim.  If the offender lives on the same street as the victim, will the victim have to endure the possibility of meeting the offender in the street, in the local shop or wherever, quite apart from any threat of physicial violence?  There may not be any question of the offender committing any further offences against the victim, but at the very least the situation is unpleasant for the victim.  Provision must be made to deal with this matter and the courts should be given some latitude.</P>
    <P>In the wake of recent cases, many people suggested harsh punishments for those found guilty of sexual offences. One of my constituents suggested recently that transportation should be reintroduced as a form of punishment.  I would not advocate going that far, but the logic that gives rise to that suggestion is similar to the logic behind these amendments, that provision must be made for the removal of the offender from the circle in which the victim mixes.  We must concentrate on the right of the victim to get on with her life.  It is very difficult for a victim to do this if, after a few years &mdash; four or five years in some cases; in the Kilkenny case it will be five years with remission &mdash; the victim must occupy the same living space as the offender.</P>

      <P>I support the principle in these amendments.  If the Minister accepts the amendments of Deputies Shatter, Gilmore and McManus I would be pleased to support them.  I would not like to choose between the two, but in relation to Deputy Gilmore's amendment, I wonder whether problems might arise in that people are innocent until proven guilty.  The suggestion in the amendment of Deputies Gilmore and McManus is that once a person is charged the court could impose an order restraining the accused from going near the premises or the home.  I would like to think that might be the case.  I can imagine what will happen in a house following a daughter or a wife reporting a <Col N="1669" /> serious case of incest or rape and the husband, the father or the brother being charged.  I can imagine the dreadful atmosphere in the home between the time the person was charged and the subsequent hearing of the case, which can be a considerable time.  If it was not a case of infringing on people's legal or constitutional rights the court should have the power in certain circumstances to make an order.  Fear might prevent people from pressing charges and I should like to hear the Minister's views in that regard.</P>
      <P>The principle of what we are talking about here &mdash; letting somebody get on with her life &mdash; should mean that the court could make an order.  I am not certain that it should be made at the time of conviction because people change.  I have heard of one or two extraordinary cases where people in detention for very serious crimes have changed.  I have been told by people who know the person, those in the institution in which the person is detained, social workers and others, that that is the case.  If the person has genuinely changed and if there is a chance that the family could get together when the offender is released I would hate to think that an order made at the beginning of a ten year sentence would still be in force nine years later.</P>
      <P>I will support an amendment in the name of Deputy McManus to the effect that a person in custody should have professional help.  It is obvious that such people do need professional help because they are suffering an illness.  We need to put considerable resources at the disposal of people who have been convicted of serious crimes of that nature.  I should like to hear the Minister's view in this respect.  Perhaps there could be a rehearing in the court shortly before the person is due to be released.  New evidence could be heard from various people as to the person's state of mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State should provide financial resources for the victims of these crimes. I do not know the girl in Kilkenny but she lives in a small place &mdash; indeed Ireland is a small country &mdash; and it is difficult to see how she will ever be able to escape from <Col N="1670" /> her ordeal.  Obviously, her neighbours know her and probably people living quite a distance from her would also recognise her.  In exceptional cases of that kind there should be some way whereby the State could provide resources to enable the victim to move to a different part of the country.  Perhaps she could buy a house in an estate being built, where everyone is moving in together, instead of buying a house in a settled area where people might guess her identity.  It is the only way someone of this kind could make a new life for herself and her child.  I am well aware of our financial difficulties and I would not favour providing financial resources in all cases, but the case in Kilkenny was horrific.  I am one of the few people who did not hear her on television or radio but I read an account the following day.  I never heard anything like it.  It was like reading a novel.  It did not seem real that something so awful could happen over a prolonged period.  It was hard to believe that someone could go through such agony, turmoil, violence and abuse.  It really shocked me and any decent person who heard her felt the same.  As I have said, in cases of this kind the State should provide resources to enable her to build a new life, perhaps they could provide a sum of about £45,000 to enable her to recover from her ordeal.</P>
    <P>I also felt very saddened when I heard her say that she dreads the day her father is released because he is very vindictive. She is now probably living in even greater fear because she knows what he was like before all this surfaced and he was sentenced. She must be wondering what his state of mind will be when he is released. Perhaps he will have changed &mdash; we all hope so &mdash; but that cannot be guaranteed. It is not directly relevant to this Bill, but I know that the vast majority of people would like to think that resources would be put at the disposal of this girl to ensure that she can start a new life.  It would be money well spent.</P>
    <P>I will not delay the House by repeating what Deputies McManus, Gilmore and Shatter said, but I support the thinking behind the amendments.  If the Minister <Col N="1671" /> is prepared to accept any amendment I will be happy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened carefully to Deputy Harney's contribution.  She recognises the complexities in this situation. It is not a simple matter; it is certainly not as simple as Deputy Shatter would have us believe.  We must remember that this problem has arisen in the context of the Kilkenny case and, like many other people, I listened to the unfortunate victim being interviewed. She emphasised that she feared for her life when this man is released.  I am a politician who faces reality and we must recognise that if somebody wants to perpetrate violence on a person when he comes out of prison, all the legislation, protection and barring orders will not stop him from doing so.</P>
      <P>What is the case at present?  If that man on his release from prison decides to go after the victim or her mother and commits an act of violence against them, the chances are that he will probably spend the remaining years of his life in prison. He knows that and the situation will not change because the court makes an order protecting them and preventing him from approaching them in the first place.  If we change the law in that regard and if he intends &mdash; as they fear &mdash; to perpetrate violence against the victim and her mother, he can be arrested, not only for what he did but for breaching the barring order.  However, if we do not change the law he can be arrested anyway because he will be in breach of the criminal law if he carries out the act of violence which they fear.  That is the unfortunate reality.</P>
      <P>There are many laws in place as a deterrent to crime, but crime still happens. The changes suggested in Deputy Shatter's amendment certainly will not prevent the man from perpetrating violence. He said in his contribution that a change along the lines suggested by him would give her peace of mind, which she does not have at present.  I would like to believe that, but I cannot.  If I believed it I would accept the amendment without hesitation.</P>

      <Col N="1672" /> Deputy McManus said there was something significant about the way in which the Minister of State a the Department of Social Welfare, Deputy Burton, came into the House yesterday evening.  I should like to outline what happened. The Minister for Justice left the House about noon yesterday and I then took over.  However, I had been with the Minister before she left and I was here all day, apart from slipping out once or twice for a cup of tea, and I do not think Deputy McManus would begrudge me that.  The Minister of State, Deputy Burton, wanted to make a contribution to the debate as she is entitled; but to deduce from that that we are trying to send out a signal that poorer people commit sexual offences shows tremendous imagination. Of course, Deputy McManus is a journalist.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I read the Deputy's articles every Sunday with great interest.  As I said last evening when concluding on the Second Stage, I have a great deal of sympathy with the object of these amendments, as do all other Members of the House, who are still conscious of the fear expressed by the Kilkenny incest victim about the release of her father at the end of his sentence.  In fact, courts in the past, when suspending or adjourning a sentence or releasing offenders on probation, have sometimes made it a condition that the offender ceases to have any contact with the victim of the offence and in particular to keep away from the victim's house.  Failure to comply with the condition could involve restoration of the sentence or breach of the probation order.  These are cases which are not in the very serious category, although the courts concerned in imposing the condition must have considered there was a likelihood of the offender molesting or annoying the victim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a long custodial sentence is imposed, the situation is of course different. The tradition has always been that someone who has paid the penalty for <Col N="1673" /> his crime should be every bit as free on leaving prison as he was before being sentenced.  I fear it would be difficult to have a provision of the kind proposed by the Deputy that would stand up to constitutional scrutiny.  For one thing, there would be an inherent assumption that a person, having had ample time in prison to reflect on the crime he had committed, would still constitute a threat to the victim and be likely to intimidate him or her.  Certainly, as Deputy Harney said, that could not be true in every case.</P>
    <P>To summarise the matter, Deputy Shatter's amendment &mdash; well intentioned though it may be &mdash; is giving the sentencing judge the right to assume there will be absolutely no change at all in the offender when he or she comes out after a long period of imprisonment.  The provision suggested by Deputy Shatter would involve the sentencing judge making a judgment on what an offender would be like at the end of his sentence six or seven years further on when all the judge could do is make a guess.  In some cases an offender, though completely reformed, could be debarred from entering particular localities for a long period after release.  That would be difficult to justify.  So far I have stressed the situation of the offender rather than that of the victim, who of course deserves all possible sympathy.  However, we cannot overlook the need for fairness to persons on release from prison who are no longer any danger to anyone.</P>
    <P>I do not want to deal with the matter in a negative way, and I made that clear yesterday.  I believe something should be done to improve the present situation of the victim where the released prisoner makes a nuisance of himself or, worse, intimidates him or her.  For nuisance and annoyance the civil remedy of injunction is unwieldly and expensive.  I certainly think it should be made a specific offence to indulge in such behaviour with a power of arrest without warrant and an appropriate penality being provided so that the victim could have speedy redress.</P>
    <P>I will also consider having a type of protection order and barring order on the lines provided in the 1981 Act mentioned <Col N="1674" /> by the Deputy, but I must emphasise that these changes will require very careful examination and I could not undertake to include them in the present Bill either here or in the Seanad &mdash; I am not saying that I will not but I cannot undertake to do so today.  As it happens, however, there is a number of criminal justice measures included in the Government programme, some of which are at an advanced stage of preparation, and I will ask to have a provision of this nature considered for inclusion in whichever Bill is nearest to publication.</P>
    <P>With regard to the amendment in the names of Deputies Gilmore and McManus, much of what I said in response to Deputy Shatter's amendment is relevant, although the first subsection of the proposed new section is related more to circumstances existing at the time the restriction order was made and is confined to a specified period.  On the other hand it does not have the notion of imposing a type of barring order, as envisaged by Deputy Shatter.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, this amendment has wide implications and goes beyond the scope of this Bill.  I can give the same undertaking as I have already given to Deputy Shatter, that I will have the point considered for inclusion in the next criminal justice measure to be sponsored by the Minister for Justice in pursuance of the commitments in the Programme for Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard the Minister's response as totally unsatisfactory.  What is proposed is to confer on the courts a discretionary power and not a power that would be exercised in every case.  It seems to me that the Minister has argued against the case he is trying to make.  Indeed, the arguments the Minister has come up with on this issue are a mirror image of the arguments the same Minister and his colleagues made in 1990 when they argued that we could not produce a Bill to allow for appeals against unduly lenient sentences. In fact, Sir, if I were to delay the House, which I do not intend to do.  I could quote chapter and verse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first thing a Minister always lobs <Col N="1675" /> up when an Oppostion party Deputy comes up with a constructive suggestion is the constitutional implication.  It is farcical the number of occasions Ministers lob this out as an objection.  I am quite clear and from the legal advice I have received, there is absolutely no constitutional difficulty of any nature in the circumstances where someone had been the victim of violent or sexual crime about the courts making an order barring the person convicted of that crime from attending at their home.  Let us put it in a very simple context: if there was a constitutional difficulty it would render unconstitutional the Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Act, 1981, which the Supreme Court has considered in a number of cases.  If a wife discovers that her husband is engaged in incest with their daughter she can bring barring proceedings under the 1981 Act and seek a barring order while her daughter is a minor so that her husband is barred from the home permanently and is barred from molesting or interferring with his wife and children at any time in the future.</P>
    <P>The problem is that if someone over 21 years who has been the victim of incest while a minor gives evidence in court against her father, she cannot get a barring order &mdash; because it is only the spouse who can get a barring order under the 1981 Act &mdash; to keep the father away from her after he has served his term of imprisonment.  They will have to do what the Minister suggests and bring separate civil injunction proceedings.  It is absolute spurious nonsense to suggest that there is any constitutional difficulty with this, as it was also spurious nonsense to suggest in 1990, when Fine Gael proposed a Private Members' Bill to provide for appeals against unduly lenient sentences, that there was a constitutional difficulty with that.  We have the same Constitution in 1993 as we had in 1990 and the Minister sees no constitutional problem with what he is now doing.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave the lie to his argument in part of what he said.  He acknowledged that there are circumstances in <Col N="1676" /> which people are convicted of violent crimes or sexual crimes where either all or part of the sentence is suspended by courts.  Where the court grants a suspended sentence the judge will say the sentence is suspended on condition that you do not attend at or near the place of residence of the victim of your crime or you do not interfere with the victim of your crime.  The perpetrator of the crime has the cloud hanging over him that if he does so attend he will be arrested and serve the rest of his sentence.  That acts as a deterrent to perpetrators making a nuisance of themselves.  The anomaly we have is that if someone is given a suspended sentence the courts can impose conditions to keep him away from his victim, but if someone is sentenced to a term of imprisonment and serves it the courts cannot at present impose conditions to prevent him from interferring or putting his victim in fear.  The Minister wisely says that if they do come along and assault their victim they are committing a criminal offence and can be arrested.  If someone is intent on assaulting his victim, the Minister says, no barring order will provide protection.  If that were the case we should repeal the 1981 Act. Hundreds if not thousands of wives throughout the country have used that Act to provide protection for themselves and their children against violent husbands. Indeed, some husbands have used it to protect themselves against violent wives.  It is a mechanism that actually works.  The fear of imprisonment for breaching a barring order seems to exercise the minds of people who are violent.  If the Garda see someone who is barred from the home walking up the driveway they have the power of arrest, which they would not otherwise have, and this means that the Garda respond more quickly and provide protection.  They do not have to wait for the assault to take place, which appears to be what the Minister is suggesting should happen in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>I regarded this particular amendment as a litmus test of the extent to which the Minister of State or his senior colleague, the Minister, would be receptive to constructive <Col N="1677" /> proposals to amend the legislation. The Minister of State in effect went on to say that he does not agree with this idea, that he will consider it but cannot do so in time for the Seanad debate but would do so when some other future Bill is being drafted in the Department of Justice.  We heard the same waffle in 1990 on a Bill dealing with unduly lenient sentences which was introduced by Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>We would not be debating this Bill today if it were not for the tragic circumstances of the Lavinia Kerwick case and we would not be rushing it through the House if it were not for the recent Kilkenny case.  Are we to ignore the need for this type of protection, which will provide immediate peace of mind for victims, until somebody is seriously assaulted following the release of an offender from prison?  In two or three years' time will a Minister have to introduce another emergency Bill to address the power being given in this legislation? We are trying to deal with this issue in a comprehensive way and it was unreasonable of the Minister to reject our proposal in the manner he did.  His constitutional reasons are nonsensical and his exposition of what courts do when they suspend sentences proves that this type of provision is necessary.  It invovles a judgment not alone on what an offender might do following his release but on what is necessary to provide peace of mind for the victim while the offender is in prison.</P>
    <P>Human beings do not operate on the basis of living in a vacuum.  The victim of a rape does not blissfully forget about the incident and about the offender for the five or six years he is detained in prison and suddenly start to worry the day before he is released.  This is an additional pressure and stress which hangs over the victim, not alone during the trial but following the conviction and throughout the period of the offender's imprisonment. We should take account of that.  There is no constitutional problem in doing so. The courts could exercise this as a discretionary power and I believe they <Col N="1678" /> would do so only in the most serious cases.</P>
    <P>This matter should not be put on the long finger until there is another emergency which would result in the Minister of State or his senior colleague rushing into this House with another emergency Bill.  The Minister would probably tell us with her hand on her heart that she suddenly recognises the existence of a problem &mdash; a problem about which Members of this House told her on a previous occasion &mdash; and will ride the media wave as if she were some type of hero because she suddenly discovers this great reality, similar to Archimedes discovering principles in years past.  She would probably then ride off into the sunset when it comes to doing the real legislative work in the House.  I will be pressing this amendment to a vote.  I am disappointed at the Minister of State's response.  It is less than incisive to the need in this area.  Many women will be disappointed with it; indeed, the same applies to many men who want to see this House respond in a comprehensive way to the problem.</P>
    <P>I stated yesterday that we are dealing with this in a piecemeal fashion.  There is another reason for including the provision in the legislation.  I do not have confidence that the Government will put in place proper psychiatric treatment services for those convicted of serious sexual offences and who threaten their victim about what they will do if the victim reports them to the Garda.  I am not satisfied that the Government will put in place the necessary provisions and services within our prison system to ensure that people released following a sentence for a sexual offence will not haunt their victims.</P>
    <P>The Government has a very bad record in this regard.  It set up the Arbour Hill project and abandoned the operation approximately one and a half years ago. The people who had developed expertise in this area were dispersed through the service and we were told by the former Minister, Pádraig Flynn, as we are still being told, that the matter is being examined by a committee.  I do not know <Col N="1679" /> what that committee will say in its report or what resources it might be given to implement its recommendations.  I do not have confidence in it because history has shown that the past Government and its Ministers, some of whom are Ministers in this Government, did not act until a public tragedy was reported in the press, much of the reaction being for public relations purposes.</P>

      <P>I wonder if there is a direct line to Singapore, because the Minister should be asked for her views on this issue.  I am somewhat taken aback at the Minister of State's response, but I thank him for complimenting me on my imagination.  I am surprised he should put it down to my writing ability, small though it is.  I believe imagination is the most important quality in a public representative and the lack of imagination displayed by the Minister of State is disturbing. He stated that he cannot envisage a way of protecting a victim.  That is essentially what he said today.</P>

      <P>That is the message I got from the Minister's response.

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should use his imagination and try to imagine what it is like to be a woman who is not necessarily being physically assaulted but is suffering psychological harassment and intimidation from a partner who is rapidly driving her insane.  If he could put himself in such a woman's shoes he might be able to imagine a law that would prove to her that she does not have to put up with such treatment, that it is illegal and that the Garda should deal with it.  That is <Col N="1680" /> apart from the question of serious assault which has been dealt with already.</P>
      <P>The Minister also displays a lack of faith in the Judiciary if he believes that by giving the courts discretion to examine the matter and not automatically grant a woman the right to be protected in this way, that that power will be abused.  I would be happy if the court had the right to protect the victim in this way and I am sure I speak for many victims in that regard.</P>
      <P>If a woman has a barring or a protection order against her husband it is clear to the Garda that the problem is real and that there will be no ambiguity in regard to domestic violence.  The Garda are often put in the invidious position of being called to a house where a domestic row is taking place, but there is no follow up in the courts.  Very often the couple get back together again.  This is a difficult problem for the Garda to deal with.  However, if a barring order exists or the courts say that protection must be given to the victim, the Garda have a much clearer position in regard to the case.  We do not have to test the bona fides of a convicted criminal on the broken bones of women.  We have seen enough of that.  We must use our imagination in regard to a victim who expects to be assaulted following the offender's release from prison or, if the Minister of State is pursuing the logic of his argument, having to experience assault before the perpetrator is brought to order.</P>

      <P>Deputy Shatter said that his legal advice was that there was no constitutional difficulty in regard to the proposal. I am not in a position to take Deputy Shatter's legal advice.  The Government is legally advised by the Attorney General and I will be consulting him about the constitutionality or otherwise of this provision.  It is farcical for Deputy Shatter to come in here and make spurious arguments about barring orders. The Deputy knows well that the objection I am making is to future as opposed to present barring orders.  I have reservations about a system whereby the courts are given power to prejudge the position in five, six, seven or maybe ten years' time, and it is reasonable to have such reservations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All cases mentioned by Deputy Shatter relate to circumstances where the current behaviour of the offender is in question. I have reservations about the courts, in current circumstances, prejudging the behaviour of a person in several years' time.  I have said in reply to Deputy McManus that I will consider a protection order or barring order for the type of case referred to in the proposed amendment, namely, a case analogous to the Kilkenny case.  The law can be changed to provide for such a case but this is not the appropriate way to do so.  I cannot undertake to make the changes in this legislation but I will consider all the arguments and points of view put forward.  I was very struck by the plight and fear of the victim in this case, and I say that genuinely.  I still believe that my suggestion to extend <Col N="1682" /> barring order or protection order legislation to the type of case in question is a more desirable approach.</P>

      <P>No, it is not.  I am talking about making an application for a barring order or protection order when the individual is nearing the end of his sentence, based on his likely behaviour at that time. Deputy Shatter's proposal suggests that a decision be made on the basis of current circumstances.  I know the Deputy is not saying it should be obligatory on the courts to make such a decision; it is discretionary. Nevertheless we would be giving discretion to the courts to make a decision judged on what a person's future behaviour might be, particularly after a long term in prison, and I have reservations in that regard.  Deputy McManus may say I am not showing much confidence in the Judiciary.  That is not the case but the Judiciary are only human.  Judges are not omnipotent; they do make mistakes.</P>

      <P>Here we come to amendment No. 3 in the name of Deputy Shatter.  I observe that amendments No. 3, 18 and 19 form a composite proposal and amendments No. 17 and 20 form an alternative composite proposal. I suggest therefore that we discuss amendments Nos. 3 and 17 to 20, inclusive, together.  Is that satisfactory?  Agreed.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1685" /> In page 4, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;2.&mdash;Section 1 of the Punishment of Incest Act, 1908 (as amended by section 12 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1935), is hereby amended in subsection (1) by the deletion of `to be kept in penal servitude for any term not less than three years, and not exceeding seven years, or to be imprisoned for any time not exceeding two years with or without hard labour' and the substitution of `to a term of imprisonment not exceeding twenty years'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>My amendment seeks to insert a new section into the Criminal Justice Bill, 1993 to expressly address the issue of the maximum sentence currently being imposed by the courts for the offence of incest.  The section I propose being inserted is as follows:</P>
    <P>2.&mdash;Secton 1 of the Punishment of Incest Act, 1908 (as amended by section 12 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1935), is hereby amended in subsection (1) by the deletion of &ldquo;to be kept in penal servitude for any term not less than three years, and not exceeding seven years, or to be imprisoned for any time not exceeding two years with or without hard labour&rdquo; and the substitution of &ldquo;to a term of imprisonment not exceeding twenty years&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The other two amendments to which the Chair referred are simply consequential amendments.  This amendment is designed to increase the maximum sentence the courts can impose for the offence of incest under the Punishment of Incest Act, 1908, from a sentence of seven years to a maximum of 20 years.</P>
    <P>This proposal is the same as that contained in the Private Members' Bill I published on behalf of the Fine Gael Party on 3 March. It was a response to the obvious legal anomaly that arose in the recent Kilkenny court case.  Although other charges were brought in that case, <Col N="1686" /> because the victim was a daughter of the person convicted the trial judge felt constrained in law to regard the case as one of incest in the context of sentencing. There has been a great deal of academic debate during the past seven or eight days as to whether the trial judge was right or wrong.  Indeed, a number of Ministers has engaged in that type of debate.  I was concerned, rather than leave the matter to be debated by legal academics or to be resolved at a future date in some other court hearing involving some other unfortunate victim, that the law be changed so that the courts would have a discretion to impose longer sentences. The amendment is designed to do that.</P>
    <P>Following the publication of the Fine Gael Bill, the Minister for Justice indicated her willingness to consider further changes in the law when she addressed the House yesterday before flying to Australia. She indicated she had an open mind on what the maximum sentence should be and thought something between 15 and 20 years would be appropriate. The Minister promised to listen to what other Members had to say.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Government amendment seeks to achieve the same result as the Fine Gael Private Members' Bill and the amendment I have proposed.  The reason I though it right that this provision be included in section 2 rather than at the back end of the Bill is that the later provisions deal with the issue of appeals against unduly lenient sentences.  In the context of an amendment to a specific Act in relation to a specific maximum sentence that can be imposed, it should be made clear at the outset what the maximum penalty is. Obviously, there will be many cases before the courts in which the maximum sentence may not be handed down for particular reasons, but, equally there will be cases in which judges would consider imposing the maximum penalty.  Judging by the horrors portrayed in it, it would seem it was one in which a judge would have been expected to give very serious consideration to imposing the maximum sentence if the law had been changed prior to that case commencing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1687" /> I hope the Minister will have the decency to acknowledge that the proposal brought forward by Fine Gael eight days ago was a constructive and well drafted one to address this issue.  In the 24 hours following the publicity given to the tragic Kilkenny case, members of the Government were more concerned to implicitly attack the judge indicating there were other sentences that could have been imposed.  Much of that comment lost sight of the fact that the judge, be he right or wrong, said he felt constrained to regard that case as one to which the maximum seven years penalty applied.  There was some information which indicated that the Punishment of Incest Act, 1908, applied only to people over the age of 15 years: that is not true, it applies to all cases of incest.  People can be charged and convicted of having sexual relations with children under the age of 15.</P>
    <P>The Punishment of Incest Act deals with the offence of incest.  It is right that the penalties should be increased.  It is right that this House should set down a marker that all sexual offences are appalling but incest is one of the most appalling because it is a person in parental authority who abuses that authority to abuse his own child.  That abuse can destroy that child mentally for life.  Many adults who were victims of incest in their childhood, have not recovered from that experience.  They experience great difficulty in forming relationships with other people by virtue of what happened.  This House should set down a marker as to how seriously we regard such an offence. The Minister should take on board my amendment.  If he insists on proceeding with his amendment it appears that both will have the same effect.  I am pleased we have reached the stage where we are addressing this issue and where we can agree on a change.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I support these amendments which propose to increase the maximum sentence for incest.  Will one of the proposers of the amendment explain the reason for the deletion of the minimum <Col N="1688" /> sentence as proposed in the original draft?  I support the principle because there is a question of the punishment fitting the crime.  Like many people I was surprised at the leniency of the sentence in the Kilkenny case.  I know the Minister made the point that there were other options open to the judge in that a longer sentence could have been imposed. Nevertheless, the maximum of seven years for incest is out of proportion with the crime and reflects a dated attitude to incest.  It seems to imply that a sexual offence committed within the family by somebody who is in a position of power over the victim and who is in a position of trust is in some way less of a crime. The crime of incest is appalling and we need to send a clear message to the courts that we wish to have longer sentences for it.  The way to do that is by adopting the amendments before us which provide for the maximum sentence of 20 years.</P>
      <P>A question was raised as to whether the decision in the Kilkenny case was open to appeal.  In an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 1 July 1990, Paul Carney, senior counsel, as he then was, made a point in relation to the Rape Bill which was before the Dáil.  He said the Bill, as he put it, by a side wind would enable a prosecution to appeal sentences or to lodge an appeal to the Supreme Court. He made the point that section 9 of that Bill provided that offences would be tried by the Central Criminal Court rather than by the Circuit Court, and that as the Central Criminal Court was the High Court exercising its criminal jurisdiction Article 34 of the Constitution provided for an appeal to the Supreme Court, and there were no exemptions made from that.  This raises the question as to whether even under the existing legislative framework the possibility of an appeal might have been possible in the Kilkenny case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the issue before us now relates to the finer points of whether an appeal was allowable, how it could be achieved, etc.  The problem we have been bluntly faced with is that the penalty for incest up to now has clearly been inadequate. It is a hangover from a time in <Col N="1689" /> the past where, presumably because members of families were considered to be the property of the parents or husband, as the case may be, a crime committed within the family was regarded as less of a crime than if it was committed outside of that context.  The anomaly needs to be redressed.  The crime of incest is an appalling one which I find very difficult to comprehend and the level of sentence has to reflect the seriousness of it.  I support the proposal that the maximum sentence should be increased to 20 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Shatter's amendment and the similar amendment in the name of the Minister. Yesterday the Minister indicated that she wanted to hear our views on this issue and that she would bring forward her own amendments.  I accept that that has happened, although she did not hear our views.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy Gilmore, I query why, in both amendments, there is a proposal to abolish the minimum sentence.  As I said yesterday, I am not a great advocate of mandatory sentencing, I do not favour it in principle.  To a certain extent minimum sentencing is in the same league.  Deputy Shatter did not say why he believes the minimum sentence should be abolished. I am not necessarily saying that the minimum sentence should be retained, but I should like to hear the Minister's arguments as to why he thinks it is not necessary to have a minimum sentence. Imposing a maximum sentence is all very fine but it will rarely if ever be used.  This is not to say that the law should not provide for a maximum sentence; of course it should do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore referred to the current powers of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Yesterday the Minister said that the Director of Public Prosecutions has the power to appeal to the Supreme Court but that he has never exercised that power.  I ask the Minister to clarify that matter.  If the Director of Public Prosecutions has not exercised an existing power one wonders if he will exercise an additional power given to him <Col N="1690" /> under this Bill.  I am worried that we are building up an expectation in the community that in cases where there is a perceived lenient sentence there will be a mechanism to put that right because there will be an appeal procedure.  This may not necessarily be the case &mdash; even though the procedure may be there it will not be very helpful if it is not used.  In view of the fact that an existing power of that kind exists already but has not been used, we need to be careful that we do not build up an expectation which leaves all of us with egg on our faces if we give a power to someone which he may never use.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 17 proposes to increase from seven to 20 years the maximum penalty for incest involving a female of 17 years and upwards.  In cases where the girl is under 15 years the maximum sentence is life imprisonment. Yesterday the Minister said she would take into account the views of the House on the appropriate increase in the seven years maximum sentence.  She said that she believed the maximum sentence should be increased to 20 years.  There was general agreement on that point, and it accords with the limits proposed both in Deputy Shatter's recent Private Members' Bill and in his amendment No. 3 here.  There is also a provision in the 1908 Act which makes it an offence for a female of 16 years or over to consent to incest and which allows for the same maximum penalty of seven years.  I do not propose disturbing that limit as it seems that different considerations apply in such cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputies raised a number of queries.  Deputy Gilmore asked why the minimum sentence of three years, as provided in section 1 of the 1908 Act, was not being retained.  I understand that at the time of the enactment of that Act there was a distinction between imprisonment and penal servitude.  That distinction has since fallen into disuse.  At that time the Parliament, in providing for sentences of penal servitude, had to lay down a maximum of three years imprisonment so that it would come under the <Col N="1691" /> heading of what was understood at the time to be penal servitude.</P>
    <P>With regard to appeals, as Deputy Harney correctly said, Article 34 of the Constitution gives both sides the right to appeal decisions of the High Court to the Supreme Court in all cases.  There is a doubt as to the right of the prosecution to exercise the right of appeal against a lenient sentence under Article 34 as the sentence will sometimes have been handed down by the Central Criminal Court, which is the High Court exercising its criminal jurisdiction.  I imagine that it was not intended that there be a right for the prosecution to appeal a sentence handed down by the High Court exercising its criminal jurisdiction because the criminal jurisdiction of the Circuit Criminal Court is also very extensive. As I understand it, Article 34 would not apply in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney wanted to know if any appeals had been taken.  The Director of Public Prosecutions' office has just been contacted by phone and although my officials did not speak to him, his deputy said that he is not aware of any case where an appeal has been take by the prosecution against a lenient sentence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I thank Deputies Harney and Gilmore for supporting my amendment.  In effect, what the Minister has said is correct &mdash; the distinction between penal servitude and imprisonment has long fallen into disuse and has ceased to be relevant.  This means that the provision in the 1908 Act dealing with minimum sentencing has long since fallen into disuse and is not relevant.  It was my perception that once we increased the penalty to this level it would allow the courts to exercise a discretion and would make it quite clear that this House intends that a very serious penalty be imposed in cases of this nature.  I think the concept of minimum sentences has largely been discredited nowadays and is not seen to fulfil any real function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased we are in agreement about this issue.  Am I to take it that the Minister is agreeable to accepting my <Col N="1692" /> amendment?  It does not seem that he has any objection to it.  I do not want to hold up the House as I am very anxious that we proceed to discuss some of the other amendments which we may not otherwise get to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept Deputy Shatter's amendment.  I will move my amendment at a later stage.  There is a technical defect in Deputy Shatter's amendment in that it does not propose to delete the words &ldquo;at the discretion of the court&rdquo;.  Those words are not necessary any more as we are no longer talking about a choice between two years and seven years as was the case hitherto; we are simply imposing a new maximum sentence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to delay the House but it seems that we are once again dealing with Alice in Wonderland stuff. We need to move away from the position where Ministers feel they have a ministerial prerogative in the area of legislation and that in some way their ministerial virginity will be threatened if they take on board a proposal put forward by an Opposition Deputy.  The Minister is making the same proposal as I have made.  He may wish to be childish about the matter but I will not call a vote on the issue as to do so would merely prevent us from discussing other issues. However, in the context of the so-called technical objection, if the court can impose a maximum sentence of up to 20 years imprisonment &mdash; clearly it will do so at its discretion &mdash; it has the discretion to impose a sentence of three, five, ten or 20 years.  There is no reason the Minister cannot take on board my amendment beyond the usual knee-jerk political reaction by people who are appointed to Government and who seem to be constitutionally unable to take on board what is proposed by Opposition Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had hoped the Minister might have the generosity to accept the amendment since his amendment is drafted on the same basis and derives from a Bill which Fine Gael published.  The purpose of the exercise is not to score points as to whose <Col N="1693" /> amendment is taken on board but rather to make meaningful changes in the law.</P>

      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 4, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.&mdash;Notwithstanding any rule of law or practice to the contrary, it shall be lawful for the prosecutor or Counsel for the prosecutor to address any court which is about to impose sentence, on the nature and severity of such sentence.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to give the Director of Public Prosecutions, or counsel on his behalf, power to make a plea to the court regarding what the director believes to be an appropriate sentence for a particular crime.  It is normal for defence counsel to refer to appropriate penalties for their clients when convicted.  Prosecuting counsel do not have this power.  The Director of Public Prosecutions will be aware of the main facts of the case and he or his counsel should be in a position after the jury has brought in a verdict to recommend an appropriate sentence.  This might avoid the necessity for an appeal.  It is a reasonable amendment.  In cases such as the one to which reference has been made, the director would have power to inform the trial judge as to what he would consider an appropriate sentence.  The trial judge would not have to accept that recommendation, but the plea would indicate to the judge that the director <Col N="1694" /> took the case very seriously and that if his wishes were ignored the director might appeal an unduly lenient sentence.</P>
    <P>The Minister might refer to the matter of plea bargaining.  I understand that in many cases the prosecution enter a plea bargaining process with the accused to secure a plea of guilty and thereby minimise the effect on the victim.  Plea bargaining is not formally recognised in our system, but the trial judge will be aware that this has taken place and will take it into account when imposing sentence. That happens in quite a number of cases. Of course it is preferable that a person guilty of an offence should plead guilty when charged because it minimises the effect on the victim.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter spoke yesterday about making our judicial system victim-orientated, particularly in the area of sexual offences.  Most women I know would prefer to hide the agony than to go through a rape trial.  I have spoken to counsel who have been involved in rape trials and representatives of the Rape Crisis Centre and they tell me it is the most horrific experience, despite improvements in the law.  It is an extremely humiliating and appalling ordeal which many consider worse than the rape itself.  We need to encourage persons charged with these offences to plead guilty when this is the case.  That must have a bearing on the sentence subsequently imposed.  I would be interested to hear the Minister's comments because I understand from legal practitioners that ours is one of the few countries not to recognise formally the process of plea bargaining.  It is done behind closed doors and, because of the independence of the Judiciary, it is felt that this is the way it should be done.  It has a major impact and may well have been a factor in the trial judge's decision in the most recent case, although I do not know this as a fact.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I adverted yesterday to the fact that one of the difficulties in our criminal justice system is that following a conviction the judge will often hear a plea in mitigation on behalf of the <Col N="1695" /> offender, but the prosecuting counsel acting on behalf of the State steps aside and does not make any plea in relation to sentence.  That can mean that a judge is not fully aware of the impact of an offence on a victim.  Even if he is aware, the main issue debated before the court is the degree of mercy that should be shown to the offender.</P>
      <P>Later sections provide that the judge will learn of the effect on the victim.  To anybody who looks at the criminal justice system from the outside, it has always been regarded as a wonderment that the prosecuting counsel does not have a role in seeking a sentence of particular severity and that it is left to the judge in the context of whatever submissions are made on behalf of the offender.  Deputy Harney's proposal is that the prosecuting counsel should address the court on that issue.  That proposal has some merit.</P>
      <P>I sought to approach the matter somewhat differently.  My amendment No. 6 was ruled out of order because one aspect of it involved a charge.  I intend to table a modified version of the amendment on Report Stage which would not have such an implication.  I had sought in amendment No. 6 to make provision for the court, following a conviction, to hear evidence specifically from the victim regarding the type of sentence he or she would like to see applied.  The court would then get a balanced view in that there would be evidence from the victim as to what sentence should be imposed and a plea in mitigation on behalf of the offender.  It would probably be more appropriate that the victim would be represented by counsel at the time sentencing takes place and that counsel would make the plea for severity of sentence. The court would hear whatever evidence is relevant from the victim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the anomalies under this Bill is that in certain circumstances offenders will be automatically provided with legal aid under the criminal legal aid system but victims are not given any aid under that system.  Following a conviction, a victim should be entitled to have representation through the criminal legal aid <Col N="1696" /> system where a serious offence is involved in order to make submissions on his or her behalf.  That would seem to be a way of facilitating the operation of other provisions designed to assist the court in obtaining information about the effect of an offence on a victim.  I would prefer the latter approach.  As it is clear that the Government will not provide the financial means for the representation of victims, serious consideration should be given to allowing prosecuting counsel to make a plea with regard to severity of sentence.  Victims should be heard on that issue.  In many cases a victim will want the maximum sentence imposed on the offender.  However, that is not always the case.  There may be special circumstances surrounding a particular offence and special insights that someone who has actually suffered the assault is aware of and may be willing to tell the court in the context of the court considering what is an appropriate sentence. I would have preferred the type of approach contained in amendment No. 6, but I would see a degree of merit in Deputy Harney's proposal.  It seems that the general public are somewhat taken aback at the concept that the State prosecutes, obtains a conviction and then stands back on the issue of sentencing and leaves it, in effect, between the judge and the legal representatives of the convicted offender.  I would be interested to hear what the Minister has to say in regard to this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I would certainly be very sympathetic to this amendment.  The points made by Deputy Shatter are notorious.  The people of this country feel it is about time that they saw more justice and less law operating.  The prosecuting counsel should have a right to suggest sentences.  This happens in other countries. I would ask the Minister to view this amendment sympathetically.  The mood of the people is for more justice.  To expand on it, the feeling at the moment is that the judges have had it very much all their own way and because of the disparity in sentencing etc. that has happened lately I would ask that the Minister <Col N="1697" /> view this amendment sympathetically.  I certainly feel very supportive of it.  It is a good amendment and we should be as constructive on this side of the House as we ask people on the Opposition side to be.  This is a very constructive amendment and I urge the Minister to accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>First, let me compliment Deputy Briscoe on his very generous remarks in relation to this amendment.  I hope the Minister of State will respond positively to what is emerging as the wish on all sides of the House that this amendment would be included in the Bill.  I certainly support it.</P>
      <P>One of the difficulties, particularly in the area of sexual offences, is the extent to which victims of sexual offences feel that they lose control of the whole situation once it is reported to the Garda, the charges made, the prosecution brought and it goes into court.  I suspect that that is one of the reasons many victims of sexual offences do not report it in the first place.  One of the questions that has been bedevilling people has been why cases are not being reported, why something that has been going on has not been reported and why it takes so long for a particular case to get to court.  It is because there is a very understandable reluctance on the part of victims to bring the cases to court.  One of the reasons for that is the extent to which the victims lose control of the situation in court and very often, particularly where the case is being contested, the victim is subjected to very difficult cross-examination and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I tabled amendment No. 5 seeking to give victims the right to independent legal advice and assistance while the case is being processed in court.  It was ruled out of order on the grounds that it would involve a cost to the State.  I do not want to challenge the Ceann Comhairle's ruling on that, but I am surprised that it was ruled out of order because I deliberately used the term &ldquo;independent legal advice&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;free legal advice&rdquo;.  However, the decision was made to rule it out of order.  My purpose in submitting it was to try to provide for a situation where the victim of a sexual <Col N="1698" /> offence, who in the vast majority of cases is a woman, having reported the case finds herself going to court into what is a very intimidating and very male institution. She very often feels alienated by the whole experience in court.  I thought that at a minimum the victim should have some independent assistance in court.</P>
    <P>I would agree that the prosecution, and indeed the victim, should have a say, and at least be able to make a case to the court as to what the appropriate sentence should be.  One of the things that horrified people about the Lavinia Kerwick case was that, the case having being brought to court, not only had she to endure the offence, the whole trauma of bringing the case to court, but then the laudatory statements which were made in court about the offender without any corresponding consideration being giving to the victim and the impact of the whole offence and its aftermath on her.</P>
    <P>It is time that there was a provision that at the very least would allow the prosecution to make a case to the court about sentencing.  I would go further, because I think it is important that the victim should be involved in a meaningful way in the whole process.  That could be done by the provision of legal assistance for the victim so that she does not find herself being a spectator during a very traumatic experience in a very intimidating environment.  Courts are intimidating places.  They are doubly intimidating if one has already had a very difficult personal experience.  To then find that that personal experience is in this kind of adversarial way in an institution which is male dominated and which is based on very archiac practices is very traumatic indeed.  I think the Minister should accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>Plea bargaining is a question for the prosecuting authority in this country, namely, the Director of Public Prosecutions, who is independent of the Minister for Justice and independent of the Oireachtas.  All I can hope to do in relation to what Deputy Harney has said is to pass on her comments to the Director of Public Prosecutions and inform him <Col N="1699" /> that I personally am sympathetic to what she is saying.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that some of those trials are tremendously traumatic for the victims.  I know of cases where the victim has been more traumatised by the experience of having to give evidence at the trial than she was by the original assault. Last year we brought in the Criminal Evidence Bill, which in some way eases the trauma for certain categories of victim.  Anything further we can do in that regard we should do.</P>
      <P>In relation to the amendment before the House, basically it is proposing to give prosecutors an active role in the sentencing process.  I am informed that the Judiciary are not too happy about it. It is seen as an encroachment by the Executive in an area which the Constitution has reserved for the Judiciary.</P>
      <P>I have listened carefully to the views on all sides of the House, including my own side.  I am conscious also that in most continental systems no sentence is imposed until the views of the prosecutions have been obtained.  Our tradition is different.  As I understand it, neither here nor in the video counsel for the prosecution say anything about the sentence that should be imposed because both countries have a common law tradition. That, however, is no reason for not changing our situation here now.  I cannot undertake to do so today, unfortunately. I shall have to give the matter more thought and I shall have to have more consultations.  I undertake to the House, however &mdash; and this is the most I can possible do today &mdash; to give the matter very serious consideration between now and the debate in the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister, Deputy Briscoe and other spokespersons for their general support of my proposal. The Minister said earlier that he was free to make all decisions the Minister might make, but I wonder whether that is really the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My proposal seeks to formalise a procedure that is carried out behind closed <Col N="1700" /> doors at present.  The Minister said that he would pass on my comments about plea bargaining to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  It is my understanding that in many cases of this kind the prosecution, presumably acting on the instructions of the DPP, goes to the defence and seeks to have the accused plead guilty in order to minimise the impact; or other things might happen, and the judge will be made aware of that and that is taken into account at the time of sentencing &mdash; obviously, someone who pleads guilty will face the imposition of a sentence or a fine.  The judge will be aware of that process, but it has all happened quietly, behind closed doors. Under this proposal I am seeking to bring the process out into the open so that the public will be aware, the trial judge will be publicly aware and the accused and the victim &mdash; the victim being very important &mdash; will be aware that the prosecuting counsel made a plea for a particular sentence.</P>
    <P>If formalising that process under the Bill were considered to be impugning the integrity and the independence of the Judiciary and if the Director felt that he or she might be going beyond his or her duties, the Director certainly would not make appeals against decisions either.  If the Director were not to use this minimum power and ask counsel to indicate what the appropriate sentence might be, the Director certainly would not use the power being given to appeal sentences considered unduly lenient.  My proposal would in many cases avoid the necessity of a 28 day period and all of the paraphernalia and work attached to the Director seeking to make a decision about an appeal, because great care would need to be taken and appeals would not be taken very often.  My proposal would minimise delays, workload and bureaucracy and would also demonstrate to the victim and everyone else what the Director feels is an appropriate sentence in particular circumstances.</P>
    <P>I advise the Minister of State, who is in the Chamber, that I am reluctant to let this amendment go.  I want to be reasonable in this debate but I feel that <Col N="1701" /> this amendment, though an innocuous one, is important.  When the Minister said earlier that he might accept amendments I considered that he would probably accept this amendment, because the issue is really no big deal.  To be quite honest, I was astonished that the measure I propose is not already followed in practice.  I did not realise that until made aware of the fact by practitioners of the law.  Because this amendment is so innocuous on the one hand but could on the other hand make a fair impact and could bring out into the open things that are happening privately behind closed doors without the knowledge of the victim or the public, I do not understand why the Minister is being so unreasonable. If the Minister would at least give me a guarantee that on Report Stage this afternoon he would consider a provision along the lines of this amendment, I would let this go.  However, if the Minister is not able to give me such a guarantee I shall not let this issue go because it is my feeling that he is being unreasonable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to emphasise once more my support for this amendment. It seems to me that most of the legal profession other than those who are judges would welcome such an amendment being brought into law.  Some years ago I was in a debate with a judge before some students.  I am not a lawyer myself and I spoke about there being a lack of justice and too much law.  The judge, who was a very senior judge, told me that it was the job of the legislators to give the Judiciary the laws and it was then the job of the Judiciary to carry out those laws.  Here we have an opportunity to give the judges the law.  We have an opportunity to tell the judges that this is a law that the Legislature, the people who are elected to represent the people of this country, give to them to implement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should be courageous and accept the Deputy's amendment here and now.  There would be unanimous support throughout the party for making this provision legislation.  I could understand the Minister if he were to say that <Col N="1702" /> he has to come back to the House on this issue on Report Stage, but I would prefer him to take his courage in his hands and accept the amendment.  The Minister has said that he also is sympathetic to the amendment so it is my hope that he will feel able to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I would shout &ldquo;Hallelujah&rdquo; if the Minister were to prove me wrong, but, along with Deputy Harney, I suspect that today the House is engaged in something that is slightly approaching farce.  That is probably not the fault of the Minister of State, I feel that the fault lies with the Minister for Justice.  If the Minister herself were in the Chamber there would be a possibility of some amendments being accepted.  I realise that the Minister of State probably has to report back to the Minister before the debate in the Seanad and before he can take on board amendments.  I deeply regret that the Minister appeared to have a great anxiety about the Bill and a sincere desire to process it and then flew off into the sunset yesterday.</P>
      <P>The legislation is being dealt with in the wrong way.  It is my opinion that Committee Stage and Report Stage should not be taken today; everything that has happened in the House since 11 o'clock this morning tells me that that is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State is in a very unfair position.  First, he has been left to carry the debate, yet he may not have the authority to accept amendments, although he tells us that he has.  Second, the Minister conveyed the impression that the debate was of huge concern to her and all Stages of the Bill are to be passed today under circumstances in which, if amendments are tabled, the Minister of State does not have the time or the capacity to get full and comprehensive advice on them &mdash; if we are to take what he tells us at face value.  It is unfair to the Minister of State and it is unfair to the House to be put in this position.  The passage of the legislation will not be hastened because it is clear that issues will have to be raked over in the Seanad, and if changes are made in the Seanad the Bill will come <Col N="1703" /> back to this House.  It would have been much better had the Minister for Justice been less economical with the truth and more up front with Members of the House.  Second Stage of the Bill should have been taken yesterday and Committee Stage and Report Stage could perhaps have been taken the week the House resumes after the Saint Patrick's Day vacation.  If that had been agreed, the Minister would have had more time to consider amendments and the House would have been able to engage in a real Committee Stage in which real change could have been effected.</P>
    <P>I am always interested in the labyrinthine digging that the Minister or officials on the Minister's behalf undertake to discover reasons that amendments tabled by any Opposition Deputy should not be accepted.  I have probably suffered more than most in that regard. I wish that the public service did not regard it a duty to find reasons that amendments should not be accepted. Certainly, if ever I find myself on the opposite side of the House I shall give a brief to civil servants that when Opposition Deputies table amendments I want to know positively whether the amendments are worth accepting &mdash; I do not want people to waste their time producing reasons for not accepting amendments.</P>
    <P>In fairness to Deputy Harney's amendment, the reason given by the Minister for not accepting it was so extremely threadbare that it is extraordinary that the Minister would refer to it.  The Minister quite rightly said that in continental Europe the prosecuting authorities take a different approach.  There is a different approach on behalf of the prosecuting authorities in the United States as well and in other common law jurisdictions.  Our system is a throwback to British colonial times, and the only reason for doing things as we do them, in the context of the prosecuting counsel not making a plea as to the type of sentence that should be imposed, is that we still labour under the shadow of the British colony and slavishly apply the traditions <Col N="1704" /> of British law unless someone gives us a kick in the backside and we are forced to change our approach.  The reason prosecuting counsel do not make a plea for a particular sentence is that that is the tradition of the British legal system, which we inherited in 1922, a tradition that in my opinion has no particular relevance or merit in the administration of the criminal justice system.  I do not understand the way in which a prosecuting counsel making a plea for the imposition of a harsh sentence is in any way treading on the constitutional path of the Judiciary any more than is the convicted person's counsel doing so making a plea for amelioration of sentence.</P>
    <P>I suppose the House should welcome the fact that the Minister is prepared to accept the proposal.  It is my hope that he will also consider the proposal that in the context of a particularly serious crime a victim should not only be heard on sentence but should also be represented to be heard on the issue.  We need to discard the remaining cobwebs of the British colonial past that dwell in the inner regions of our criminal justice system and put our own stamp on the type of system we want to see in place.</P>

      <P>I am not saying that I would not accept the proposal.  What I said was that I am not accepting it today. It constitutes quite a revolutionary change in the system which has operated here since Independence.  It is not just a question of following the British system. There is a fundamental distinction between ourselves and the British, namely, we have a written Constitution which makes the Judiciary independent of the Executive, whereas they do not. Therefore, it would be much easier for them to change the system than it would for us.  Having said that, I repeat that I am sympathetic to the proposal.  I will give it serious consideration.  I have already said that I am unhappy with the arrangement for the taking of this Bill but that is something outside my control. All I can ask is that the House take my <Col N="1705" /> word when I say I will consider this matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a question on section 2.  I raised this matter on Second Stage yesterday and it relates to amending the Director of Public Prosecutions Act, 1974 which makes it an offence to communicate with the DPP, presumably with a view to lobbying him to take or not to take a prosecution.  This extends it to apply that same provision to appeals.</P>
      <P>I asked yesterday what constitutes a communication.  Does it involve a telephone call, a letter or, for example, if a newspaper editorial were to report, following what they regarded as an unduly lenient sentence, that the sentence was appalling and that the Director of Public Prosecutions should use his powers of appeal, would that be considered a communication? If a Minister for Justice or Deputies were to voice their outrage at a particularly lenient sentence, would such a public statement constitute a communication? The DPP is not a hermit and he will be aware of these statements.  It is my view they would represent communications, although they are not formalised in the sense of one person writing a letter to another or making a telephone call.  I ask the Minister to clarify that.  I also ask would the Minister envisage that it should be contempt of Court for somebody to publish such a suggestion during the 28 day period the DPP has to decide on the question of an appeal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my view that the DPP would come under enormous public pressure.  I realise <Col N="1706" /> that his is an independent office. However, if what are perceived to be unduly lenient sentences are imposed, and they generate the mass public reaction witnessed in the most recent case involving newspaper editorials and media coverage generally, and if a Director of Public Prosecutions does not act in those circumstances, I envisage at some future time a Minister for Justice stating that the law has to be changed to provide for the removal of the power of appeal from the DPP.  Alternatively, it may necessitate a semi-political involvement in the decision as to whether to appeal.  I do not know whether the Minister understands the point I am making but to some extent we are bringing in this legislation to allay public fears that no action can be taken when these lenient sentences are imposed.  If power is given but is not exercised, or is exercised 20 years from now, we will in the meantime have circumstances where people will feel that the power is not strong enough or that there is an inadequate political dimension to it.  I am not saying I favour that but I am concerned about the nature of the communication and whether there will be any attempt made in the period intervening between the decision of the court and the 28 day period in which an appeal can be lodged to prevent the publicising of the case.  In that way we would not have this mass public outcry which one way or the other has to influence a Director of Public Prosecutions.  Anybody reading the newspapers is influenced by that.  One might be influenced to do or not to do something but reading newspapers does influence our thinking.  That is how we are informed, how we educate ourselves and how we reform and change our minds.</P>
    <P>In relation to the section, may I ask the Minister, where the DPP decides not to appeal a particular case, would he envisage that without prejudice to the independence of the office, the Director would make a short statement as to why, having read the transcript and studied the case, he felt on balance that the right decision had been made?  If the DPP does <Col N="1707" /> not give an explanation for his decision we may then have the worst of all worlds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I have particular questions about the section, and how it may work, that perhaps the Minister could respond to.  I have said for a long time that I want to see this power in place and exercised.  I am not sure how it will work in practice.  Subsection (1) of section 2 says:</P>
      <P>If it appears to the Director of Public Prosecutions that a sentence imposed by a court (in this Act referred to as the &ldquo;sentencing court&rdquo;) on conviction of a person on indictment was unduly lenient, he may apply to the Court of Criminal Appeal to review the sentence.</P>
      <P>How will it be conveyed to the Director of Public Prosecutions as to whether a sentence is unduly lenient?  Who will communicate that information to him? Presumably prosecuting counsel will simply inform the DPP.  Never having been a prosecuting counsel I am not familiar with the actual procedure but I assume that if a counsel is instructed to prosecute a case, he does so through the courts and that ultimately he reports back, perhaps by way of letter when returning his brief to the Director of Public Procecutions, stating the result of the case, both in the context of whether a conviction was obtained, and also the nature of the sentence imposed.</P>
      <P>Is it intended that prosecuting counsel will now have to report to the Director of Public Prosecutions whether prosecuting counsel regards the sentence imposed as reasonable or as unduly lenient?  How is that going to work?  Bearing in mind the Minister's worries about prosecuting counsel making pleas on sentences, does that not mean that it will be left to the subjective judgment of an individual prosecuting counsel, rather than the Director of Public Prosecutions, to report whether a sentence is harsh or lenient? Whereas the intention of this section is right I am not sure how it will actually work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1708" /> One must also link how this section will work with section 4 of the Act.  Section 4 reads:</P>
    <P>The registrar of a court which has imposed a sentence on conviction of a person on indictment shall&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  give to the Director of Public Prosecutions, on request,</P>
    <P>&mdash;I emphasise the word &ldquo;request&rdquo;&mdash; a copy of any reports or other relevant documents that were considered by the court before it imposed the sentence, and</P>
    <P>(b)  if the sentence has become the subject of an application under section 2, give a copy of those documents to the Court of Criminal Appeal and the convicted person.</P>
    <P>I am not sure what the interaction will be between sections 2 and 4.  It seems to me the Director of Public Prosecutions will not get copies of reports or other relevant documents automatically.  He will have to request them.  What will trigger the request?  The DPP will not sit in court and observe what is happening in every criminal trial that is taking place.  Will the Minister explain how this will operate in practice and how, within the 28 day limit, it will happen?  Will the DPP, for example, receive a copy of the transcript of the evidence in the case within 28 days and of submissions made in relation to the matter of sentence?  Will he receive a transcript of the judge's decision and his explanation for the type of sentence imposed?</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the Director of Public Prosecutions cannot, in the dark, determine whether a sentence is unduly lenient.  I am concerned that more flesh should be put on the provisions of this Act as to how it will operate procedurally and how a sentence will be drawn to the attention of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Will it be the case that the only occasion on which the DPP will appeal against a sentence is when there is some form of public outcry in the media?  We have been fortunate in that the media have informed this House of cases we would perceive as having resulted in unduly lenient sentences <Col N="1709" /> being imposed.  However, I would have reservations if the possibilities of appeal against unduly lenient sentences were dependent on whether the media reported the result of a particular case and whether they would do so in terms of praise &mdash; or criticism &mdash; of sentences handed down.  That would give rise to concerns in relation to mob rule rather than judicial rule in regard to the Director of Public Prosecutions making a decision.</P>
    <P>While we are grateful to the media for reporting recent cases, Deputy Harney should have referred to occasions when the media do not always get it right because the nuances of what happens in a criminal trial are not always fully understood and are open to misinterpretation. Perhaps, because we are running out of time, the Minister will explain how sections 2 and 4 will operate in practice and what will trigger the interest of the Director of Public Prosecutions in a particular case to warrant steps being taken to appeal against an unduly lenient sentence.  For example, what steps can be taken to ensure that a prosecuting counsel, with insufficient time, can tell the DPP what happens in a particular case so that the 28-day rule can be implemented?</P>
    <P>While I accept that someone who has been convicted of an offence should not be left in a position of uncertainty for an unduly lengthy period of time, I wonder whether the administrative problems and bureaucracy associated with implementing this would require the Minister to look at the 28-day provision and to extend it by additional days to ensure that cases which should be appealed do not go by default because of the difficulty of complying with timescales.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>This whole section need not have been inserted if it had not appeared to the public at large that sentencing leaves a lot to be desired in certain cases.  I do not think there is any question of mob rule, I would be totally against anything which would smack of that or intimidating the Judiciary or the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The section <Col N="1710" /> reads: &ldquo;If it appears to the Director of Public Prosecutions that a sentence imposed by a court or conviction of a person on indictment was unduly lenient ...&rdquo; It does not say how the Director of Public Prosecutions obtains this information; it could be from a member of the public writing a letter to the DPP saying that he or she was dissatisfied with the sentence.  The Director of Public Prosecutions will probably need more staff when this Bill is enacted.</P>
      <P>The media, although they have been criticised, act as a public watchdog in certain cases.  Deputy Shatter is right in saying that the media can very often miss the nuances of the imposition of a sentence in a particular case.  I know that, in the past, there were cases regarding which the public were not fully informed by the media as to why a certain action was taken.  However, we still have free speech and the Director of Public Prosecutions gets his information from the media or from letters written by the public, who are very quick to make their voices heard when the feel an injustice has been done.  I will be anxious to hear how the Minister thinks the Director of Public Prosecutions should act in regard to information he receives.  I hope he will not be required, within the 28 days, to submit a full case and that it will be sufficient to say he is preparing a case to appeal against sentence.  He could intimate he will give all the information when he has had more opportunity to study the papers from the courts.  Will the Minister clarify whether he has to give all the reasons within 28 days or is it sufficient to notify the court of his intentions in relation to certain cases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Briscoe is not correct because, as a result of section 2 (4) if a member of the public writes to the Director of Public Prosecutions complaining that the outcome of a case has been an unduly lenient sentence, the member of the public who wrote is committing an offence.  There is a problem in this regard as only a very limited and reserved group of people can communicate with the Director of Public <Col N="1711" /> Prosecutions about sentencing.  Perhaps the Minister will allay my fears in regard to section 2 (4).  When cases have been heard in the courts, relations of people who have been affected by crimes committed against them have written to Members of this House expressing outrage at the sentences imposed.  Much of what we have discussed today has dealt with sexual offences, rape and incest, because of the background to the case last week.  However, there is one area on which I hold very strong views and in which the courts are far too lenient in the sentences handed down: I refer to cases where deaths result from dangerous driving by so-called joy-riders who have stolen cars and driven irresponsibly &mdash; we have had instances of people being mown down while standing at bus stops &mdash; or where people who are driving their own cars blind drunk have killed people.</P>
      <P>Our courts are far too lenient in those circumstances and instead of bringing prosecutions under the Road Traffic Act, charges of manslaughter should be brought and extremely severe sentences handed down.  Over the years, the most frequent occasions on which I received letters from people in my constituency &mdash; and outside it &mdash; complaining about unduly lenient sentences are not in the context of sexual offences but have arisen from a number of cases in which pedestrians or cyclists have been killed by drunken drivers or people driving stolen cars.  People are very annoyed that courts have imposed a sentence of three to five years; a sentence of between ten and 15 years should be handed down in cases of this kind.  Relations who are distraught at the death or permanent incapacitation of a relative as a result of irresponsible driving of a car will very often complain about lenient sentences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The worst of all worlds would be for a person who has been bereaved or who has seen a spouse or a child turned literally into a vegetable by irresponsible driving by someone to find themselves, at the end of a criminal prosecution, convicted because he or she wrote to the Director of Public Prosecutions complaining <Col N="1712" /> about a lenient sentence.  That would be going down a very wrong and dangerous path.  I am sure that is not what the Minister intends but I am concerned about the manner in which section 2 (4) may interact with the 1974 Act.  We will not get many more opportunities to address the matter in this House and, therefore, I ask the Minister to reconsider that section.  We can probably take the view that the Director of Public Prosecutions is an independent person but it is not a matter of great public concern if he receives a letter from someone who is a relative of a victim complaining about the lenient sentence handed down.</P>
    <P>I would regard the Director of Public Prosecutions as sufficiently independent to read the letter and look at what is involved in the case without being constrained by the communication to take a specific course of action.  I think we have to be very careful as to how we extent the provisions of that offence.  Yet another example of the danger of rushing through this legislation is that while focusing on one area we fail to look at others.  If, say, the parents of a young girl who was sexually assaulted were to write to the Director of Public Prosecutions complaining about the leniency of the sentence imposed subsequently on the guilty party, that should not result in the invocation against them of the provisions contained in the 1974 Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened carefully to what Deputy Shatter said about section 2 (4) and I agree with him.  I will have the matter examined.  The Deputy can understand the reason for section 6 of the 1974 Act.  Section 6 of the Prosecution of Offenders Act, 1974, prohibits people from communicating with the DPP as regards his decision on whether to initiate a prosecution in the first place.  We are extending this with necessary modifications to cases where the Director of Public Prosecutions is making a decision to appeal a decision on the grounds of leniency, but from what the Deputy says I can appreciate that certain undesirable situations can arise which we do not want <Col N="1713" /> to happen.  I now give an undertaking to the Deputy to look at this matter again.</P>
      <P>In relation to the interaction of sections 2 and 4, the DPP, if he considers appealing a lenient sentence will look for the documentation referred to.  The Deputy asked what will trigger his decision.  We envisage that the Director of Public Prosecutions will get his information from the prosecution team and it is then a matter for himself to make the necessary administrative arrangements to set up a system whereby it can be decided in his office as to whether an appeal against the leniency of the sentence should be initiated.  On the matter of extending the 28 day period, we have spoken with the Officer of the Director of Public Prosecutions on this matter and they think they can make the necessary arrangements in that time-frame. They indicated they were happy with the 28 day period but I will undertake to ask them about it.</P>
      <P>This Bill will deal not only with cases which attract massive publicity but with cases where there will be no publicity at all and sentences will be appealed on the grounds that they were too lenient.</P>
      <P>This brings me to Deputy Harney's point on communications.  We are talking about communications as referred to in section 6 of the 1974 Act.  What I envisage is that we are talking about communications either written or oral, addressed specifically to the Director of Public Prosecutions or one of his officers.  Neither newspaper editorials nor debates in the Dáil fall into the category of `communication', as I understand it.  The Deputy will be aware of a number of high profile cases which attracted a great deal of publicity in recent times.  One case in particular in the past ten days attracted a great deal of publicity before the DPP decided to initiate a prosecution so that would have to come under the 1974 Act. Neither the Garda nor the DPP felt they had any legal function in regard to the publications I have referred to.  When the section was drafted the intention was that &ldquo;communication&rdquo; meant a direct communication, whether oral or written.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That covers most of the points raised. <Col N="1714" /> If anybody wishes to ask anything else, I will be happy to deal with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read the 1974 Act but the definition section does not define what a &ldquo;communication&rdquo; is.  I submit that an editorial in a newspaper the DPP gets every morning and reads over breakfast is a communication although not directly intended for this purposes but we are all influenced by things we read.  It may be necessary to amend the 1974 Act to include a definition of what constitutes communication.  If the Director of Public Prosecutions is going to make a decision whether to appeal on an informed basis he will have to have available to him a transcript of the proceedings.  As I understand it such transcripts do not become available for a considerable length of time.  The Director has only 28 days in which to make his decision and obviously he will need to read the transcript early in that 28 day period because he will need to discuss it with people in his office.  Will the Minister indicate if any new arrangements are being made to allow a transcript of the trial be made available to the Director of Public Prosecutions so as to allow him to make an informed decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally may I reiterate what I asked earlier?  Does the Minister envisage ever making it a contempt of court for the media to publicise details in relation to a case during the 28 day period when the Director is making his decision on whether to appeal the case?  In my view the DPP will come under enormous moral pressure as he would have done had he had this power during the past few weeks.  If we had a number of cases of the kind in question and the Director did not seek to appeal the sentence, his office would be brought into disrepute because people would feel that he was not doing what he should be doing.  We need to be fair and reasonable.  A great deal of pressure will be put on the DPP as a result of the enactment of this legislation. Public expectations have been raised.  Indeed, last Sunday I heard the Minister reassure the public that this was going to be put right by a Bill that would <Col N="1715" /> come before the House this week.  Most members of the public now believe that if we had another case similar to the Kilkenny incest case where it was felt the sentence given was too lenient, an automatic appeal would be brought forward by the Director of Public Prosecutions.  That is not the case and may never be the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the responsibilities of the Director of Public Prosecutions will increase.  It would be wrong of me to say that we could make arrangements to have transcripts of an entire case ready for the DPP within a 28 day period. I understand that would not be possible but perhaps we could arrange for a transcript of the judge's remarks on passing sentence to be available within that period.  As I said already in response to Deputy Shatter, we have spoken to the DPP's office and we will be speaking to them again.  They are quite happy that they will be able to administer this legislation properly.  Time will tell and if there are difficulties we will meet them as they arise.</P>
      <P>On the question of the Prosecution of Offenders Act, 1974, the term &ldquo;communication&rdquo; does not appear; rather the reference is to &ldquo;communicate with.&rdquo;  It states: &ldquo;it shall not be lawful to communicate with&rdquo; the various officers involved.  That has been interpreted as a direct communication with the officer rather than something that is written in a newspaper or said on television or here in the House.  If it had not been interpreted in that way there would have been a vast number of prosecutions against newspapers and RTE in the years since 1974.  I think I can allay the Deputy's doubts in that regard.</P>

      <P>Section 3 agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned that section 4 provides automatically for legal aid for the person convicted of an offence in the event of an appeal on the severity of the sentence.  It appears to provide that without even having a means test requirement.  Will the Minister clarify whether that is correct?  If someone has sufficient means to pay for his or her own solicitors and counsel when being prosecuted and there is an appeal subsequently against the sentence on the grounds that it was unduly lenient, there is no particular reason that the State should carry the burden of the convicted person's legal expenses.</P>
      <P>Second, I am concerned at the unequal position of the offender <i>vis-à-vis</i> victim. In section 5 the court is supposed to take into account the effect of an offence on the victim.  We are willing to provide all the legal panoply of support for the offender but the State is not willing to provide legal help for the victim who may wish to communicate to the court the effect of the crime that has been committed against him.  Will the Minister clarify why the victim is not being treated at least as well as the offender?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following a detailed review of third level student grant schemes, a range of improvements was introduced in 1992. One of the principal improvements was the substantial increase in the income eligibility limits.</P>
      <P>Now, for example, a family with one to three dependent children qualifies for full fees and maintenance grants on an income of £15,000 compared with the previous income limit of £10,787 and that was an increase of 40 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were other improvements in the 1992 schemes &mdash; the income limit for families was increased by £2,000 for each additional child after the first child attending third level education.  In other words, the ceiling is £15,000 income if a family has one child at third level and if a second child goes to third level the <Col N="1718" /> income ceiling becomes £17,000 and so on.</P>
    <P>Income is now assessed in the year in which the student actually enters third level, before 1992 income was assessed in the year the student sat the leaving certificate.  In relation to giving support to people who need it most, this has to be a significant improvement because the family income is now assessed at the time the student is proposing to enter third level.</P>
    <P>Mature students who secure a place in third level institutions are automatically considered when they meet the academic requirements for the award of a grant. Previously, they could not get a grant under the law, if they did not have a leaving certificate.  Mature students may be assessed on the basis of their own incomes rather than on their parents' income which had been the case.  Lone parents welfare payments under the lone parents allowance scheme are now excluded from the assessment of income. Maintenance grants were increased in line with CPI increases and fee grants were increased in line with increases in third level fees.  In order to further strengthen the equity of fairness of the income assessment process the Revenue Commissioners are &mdash; since 1992 &mdash; involved in the process of income verification.</P>
    <P>There was a significant attempt in 1992 to broaden eligibility and to ensure fairness. We must remember the original purpose of this was to ensure that students in need of support are identified and provided with assistance to pursue third level studies, and Exchequer resources are thereby directed to those most in need.  I am aware of the discontent in regard to the eligibility criteria for these schemes.</P>
    <P>I suspect that most Deputies will agree that establishing criteria which will satisfy all sections in the community is extraordinarily difficult.  However, the schemes are making a significant contribution to meeting the policy objectives which I have just set out.  Preliminary figures from 1992-93 indicate that approximately 50 per cent of new entrants to university this year qualified <Col N="1719" /> for assistance under the higher education grant scheme.</P>
    <P>I am committed to ensuring that schemes operate in the fairest and most equitable way.  In accordance with the programme for Government, we are committed to continuing improvement in these schemes.  Specifically in relation to student support, the programme states:</P>
    <P>We anticipate that under the new structural funds extra resources will be available to assist with the cost of third level education.  On that basis, it is the Government's intention to ensure that these additional resources are used to widen the access of all students to third level education in the interests of social justice and equity.  The promotion of social justice and equity will include continuing improvement of the higher education grant scheme to ensure that no student is deprived of access to third level education because of his/her financial circumstances.</P>
    <P>Obviously, before making any further changes, it is common sense that we should first assess the impact of the 1992 changes.</P>
    <P>I have a simple criterion here, if there still remains obvious cases of injustice the scheme will be changed within the constraints of Exchequer resources.  I am not sure that a change from an assessment of gross income as distinct from net income would make the scheme any fairer.  For example, let us take two families with the same gross income, one with a large house and a large mortgage and the second with a modest house and a small remaining mortgage.  If income is assessed on the basis of net income, the first family could benefit under the scheme while the second might not.  Is it fair that a family should qualify because they have a larger house and a larger mortgage?  Obviously, this also raises the question as to what is meant by net income.</P>
    <P>In summary, I have an open mind about the gross and net question at this stage.  In addressing this issue I will first review the impact of the 1992-93 changes <Col N="1720" /> and in that review I will draw on all expertise necessary to fully assess it.</P>

      <P>The Minister has learned the old tricks very quickly.  I never thought I would see a Labour Minister reading word for word a Fianna Fáil Minister's script.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister not realise that the Labour Party's manifesto, ironically misnamed Putting Trust into Politics, contains a clear commitment in the boldest possible print that the Labour Party proposes that income limits for higher education will be based on net rather than gross income?  Why is that clear unequivocal commitment not being honoured?</P>

I have asked to be allowed review the implications of the major changes made in 1992-93.  I will call on expertise to evaluate the impact of them and report on where changes are needed.  I am prepared, within the budgetary constraints, to introduce changes where necessary to ensure that students are not excluded from third level places because of their financial circumstances.</P>

Before I consign this document to the scrap heap, is the Minister aware that 65,000 students will do the leaving certificate in less than three months time when the whole third level grants system is in total disarray in terms of ESF grants, mature students' grants and higher education grants and that students have not a clue what they are entitled to?  Does the Minister realise that this is not fair to the people who will have to wait until she decides whether or not the scheme is to be rationalised?</P>

      <P>I do not agree with the Deputy's suggestion that the system is in chaos.  After much discussion new, rational proposals were introduced in 1992 and this resulted in an increase in the number of pupils taking up the grants scheme.  As I said, the figures indicate that 50 per cent of those who took up this scheme did not realise they were eligible for it.  I repeat that it would be more commonsensical if I was allowed to consider the impact of that scheme and if changes are necessary I will review the matter.  I disagree with the suggestion that the grants scheme as revised in 1992 is in a state of chaos.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 59 together.</P>
      <P>The standard rate of capitation grant paid to primary schools in 1992 was £28 per pupil and £150 per pupil for secondary schools.  This grant was last increased in 1990 from £26.50 to £28 per pupil at primary level and from £140 to £150 for secondary schools.</P>
      <P>I am happy to say that I have secured an increase of £3.4 million in the 1993 provision for capitation grant for primary schools.  This will enable me to increase the standard rate of grant to £33 per pupil in every national school, with pro rata increases for certain other categories of school.  This will cost in the region of £2.8 million and allow me to give increases above £5 per pupil to certain disadvantaged schools.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the primary schools have been underfunded in the matter of running costs.  In the current tight budgetary situation an increase of £5 per pupil is a very positive step towards improving the position and is the single largest increase in grant for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1723" /> I have particular concern for the position of schools in disadvantaged areas. Currently, such schools get an extra £17 per pupil.  The balance of £0.6 million from the additional £3.4 million to which I have already referred will be used to initiate further measures to assist the disadvantaged. Discussions will take place shortly with the interested parties regarding this matter.  I regret that in the budgetary situation it was not possible to provide an increase in the post-primary grant this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that, in view of the fact that the capitation grant has remained frozen for a considerable number of years at the inadequate level of £28, the General Secretary of the INTO was quite justified in dismissing the paltry £5 increase as playing slap-tickle politics with education? Does she not realise the tortuous pressure on low income families and schools to beg, borrow and squeal for £7,000 to £10,000 in order to keep schools open on a day to day basis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the grant is worrying for people who have children in school at present.  However, the Deputy should acknowledge the increase achieved by the Department in this year's budgetary figures.  In 1986 the capitation grant was £24 per pupil, in 1990 it was increased to £28 per pupil and in 1993 it was increased to £33 per pupil.  To take the example of a 100 pupil school, it will receive £3,300 for annual running costs while a school of 300 pupils will receive £9,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not accept that the present system of financing primary education has failed and a complete overhaul of the system is necessary? This reinforces inequity, consolidates poverty and maintains disadvantage in society.  The system needs a radical revamp at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree that to increase the capitation grant by £5 <Col N="1724" /> consolidates poverty.  The increase of £5 is a very clear signal of this Government's commitment to funding at primary school level.  My Department is undertaking a unit cost study at primary and post-primary levels on the costs of schools generally and in light of the result of this study I will be considering the existing rates of capitation grants to schools.  The Higher grant reflects the fact that part of the secondary capitation grant goes towards the cost of teachers' salaries.  I am in the process of reviewing the position and I am particularly committed to ensuring that poverty is not consolidated. There is a clink of light as we move forward to invest in the primary school system.</P>

      <P>It is my view on publication of examination results that, in the context of greater openness in the education sector, aggregate results of the certificate examinations on a national basis should continue to be published.</P>
      <P>Aggregate data on pupil assessment is helpful in highlighting specific needs in the educational system, but I am opposed to the publication of individual school results.  The publication of such results can be totally misleading as it would not take into account a variety of other important information such as previous attainment standards of the pupils, their socio-economic background and whether entry to the school initially was on a selective basis.  A league table of results may only encourage some schools to engage in further selectivity at entrance levels and I am certainly not in favour of schools picking and choosing at entry.</P>

      <P>I do not have to remind the Deputies of the status of the Green Paper.  It is a discussion document. Educational interests reacted negatively to so-called league tables, but it has opened discussion and has allowed people to appreciate the effect of publishing league tables.  It would not be in the interests of any schools, whether they select pupils or take the children from their own parish, to publish league tables. I gather that the Deputy also finds the matter rather distasteful.</P>

      <P>We have been examining the prospect of assessment at primary school level.  I am open to discussing my proposals in the matter.  It might be helpful to have voluntary assessment at the end of first class and fifth class in primary schools.  It would help teachers if they had an assessment process so that they could pinpoint the children who have not benefited from the first three years at school and if necessary at that early age they could seek the intervention of a remedial teacher or the psychological services.  Assessment on completion of fifth class might also be useful to help teachers to pinpoint pupils who are not benefiting from the school system but who would in the last year of primary school be able to avail of the support systems there for their benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that the support mechanisms available in primary and secondary schools will encourage such pupils to stay <Col N="1726" /> on and find secondary schools relevant. This has nothing to do with the publication of examination results on a league table basis.  I am interested in this process because I want all children to achieve their full potential within the school system.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Education</askee>
      <Quest>the steps, if any, she intends implementing in 1993 to ensure that the maximum class size in primary schools is brought down to 29, the figure mentioned in the Programme for Partnership Government 1993 to 1997; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 231 together.</P>
      <P>The Programme for Partnership Government provides that the pupil/teacher ratio in primary schools will be reduced to 22 to 1 by September 1996. It is also intended to introduce a scheme so that classes will not be bigger than 29.</P>
      <P>It is the intention that this will be achieved by retaining teacher numbers which would otherwise fall in line with falling pupil numbers.  It is projected that pupil numbers in primary schools will fall from their present level of 520,000 to 462,000 by 1996.  The current number of 20,800 teachers would enable the targeted pupil/teacher ratio to be reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Account must, of course, be taken of the fact that the system includes remedial teachers, concessionary posts for schools in disadvantaged areas, teachers in special schools and classes and administrative principals.  These teachers are included in reckoning over-all pupil/teacher ratio which is, therefore, not the same thing as class size.  To the extent that available teaching resources <Col N="1727" /> are directed towards these special needs, a choice has to be made in regard to the speed of progress towards reducing class size.</P>
    <P>Last year, all posts available were allocated to reducing class sizes.  This year, in line with the Government's priority for the disadvantaged, the 200 posts becoming available as a result of decline in pupil numbers will be targeted for schools in disadvantaged areas, for remedial teachers, for special education and for travellers.  This will, <i>inter alia,</i> enable class sizes to be reduced in a number of schools in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>As a result of these measures, pupil/teacher ratio, which was reduced effectively to 25 to 1 this year in line with the provisions in the Programme for Partnership Government, will further decline to 24.2 to 1 in the coming school-year. Average class size is at present close to 29.  This, of course, is an average and many classes are significantly above or below the average.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that the average class size she referred to is a national figure and that the average class size in Dublin is far bigger, that there are classes with in excess of 40 pupils, in some instances with 42 and 43 pupils in classes in disadvantaged areas and that this is causing dreadful problems for teachers and pupils in many Dublin schools?  Will the Minister at the very least ensure that no teacher is placed on the transfer panel this year in schools in disadvantaged areas, as one small step towards reducing the pupil/teacher ratio?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there are large classes but there are guidelines.  The maximum size guidelines at the moment are 39 pupils in a single grade class, 38 pupils in a combined grade class and 35 pupils in a multigrade class. I have visited schools that are under my patronage in the centre city where the class sizes are much smaller than that and because of the disadvantaged status we are supplying more help not only in capitation grants but in teachers' posts being <Col N="1728" /> retained in these areas in order to maintain those low figures.  We have rural schools where the class sizes are quite small as well.</P>
      <P>At the moment we are waiting to distribute the extra 200 posts that will become available.  I assure the Deputy that I share his concern for teachers who are doing a magnificant job in disadvantaged or remote rural communities. In the distribution of posts I will ensure that their work will be recognised. Everything will be done to maintain the ratio this year and to move forward in the areas of greater need to improve conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister this year officially reduce the guideline figure which currently stands at 38 pupils per class?  Does the Minister not accept that the first educational priority in the Programme for a Partnership Government is the commitment to reduce class sizes so that there will be classes comprising no more than 29 pupils by 1996, and yet she has not announced here today any additional resources or personnel to bring that about?  All the Minister is doing is maintaining the <i>status quo.</i></P>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>An extra 200 teaching posts are being retained in the system this year despite the demographic trends. The demographic trends will allow us to facilitate the retention of these posts in order to move towards a reduction of class sizes.  In the Department at the moment we are talking to parties interested in education about the guidelines and class numbers.  Last year we were allowed use the additional posts which were retained in an overall reduction of class size.  I hope that this year we will be able to target those extra teachers for specific areas.  The demographic decline is projected to free 2,400 posts by 1996.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 64 and 78 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had the post-primary capital programme reviewed following confirmation of the capital allocation for 1993 in the published Estimates for Public Services.  Regrettably, it was not possible to include this project in the 1993 capital programme within the allocation available and having regard to other commitments and priorities, including the needs of disadvantaged areas.  It will, of <Col N="1730" /> course, be considered for inclusion in due course in the light of available resources.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed to hear this news, as will the residents of the community of Scholarstown-Knocklyon. This issue has been around for the past ten years.  Is the Minister aware that on 12 November 1992 her immediate predecessor, Deputy Séamus Brennan, now a Junior Minister in the present Administration, wrote to the Knocklyon post primary committee saying he had sanctioned a 400 pupil school&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>On what basis is this sanction withdrawn since it was an electoral promise?  Is it any wonder that politics is held in such low esteem and repute in this country when a Minister can give a commitment two weeks before an election and when it comes to the point it is withdrawn?  It is an absolute disgrace. What is the criterion?  What does the Minister mean when she says that the needs of disadvantaged areas will be taken into account?  It is fast becoming a disadvantage for people to be in the middle income group.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a number of questions I should like to ask.  First, can the Minister confirm that it was not correct to state in November last that the project in question had been sanctioned for a 400 pupil intake and that the first intake would be in September 1994? Second, can the Minister confirm that at that time there had been no final irrevocable allocation of £250,000 in the 1993 Estimates to commence construction of this school?  Third, can the Minister indicate the names, if any, of the architects, quantity surveyors, structural engineers or service engineers who were appointed at that time or since 13 November with regard to the construction of this school? Fourth, can the Minister indicate whether her Department incurred any expenditure between 1 November 1992 and this date in relation to the construction of this school?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's first question asked about the position coming up to the change of Government.  I have to repeat that when I entered the Department of Education we were in a budgetary situation.  The spending of the capital allocation, which had been increased by 21 per cent, had to be reviewed by my Department in light of commitments made in the general election to the capital building programme.  Second, the Deputy asked if a specific sum of money had been earmarked for the scheme.  On the capital side the Department was given an overall budget figure.  There were contractual agreements already in place and some projects had begun, there were 18 projects which were not given the go-ahead. <Col N="1732" /> In the light of the overall figure the allocation of funding was done on that basis.  The project team was in place. I have not signalled to the House that this scheme is to be abandoned.  We had to look at the amount of money available to be spent in 1993.  The Deputy's final question asked whether I could confirm what moneys were spent.  I cannot confirm that for the Deputy now but I am sure I will be in a position to come back to him on it if he wishes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to get to the specifics.  Is the Minister saying that when her predecessor told the community in Knocklyon that this school would be built and that he had available to him funds for its construction to commence in 1993, he was misleading the community in Knocklyon?  When the Minister said she wanted to ensure that the capital allocation funds were being properly used can she confirm that in the context of the allocation being increased by 21 per cent this year there still was not sufficient funding to build this school?  Can the Minister indicate to the House how many other schools the former Minister for Education, Deputy Brennan, promised at election time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Conditions of service for substitute primary teachers have improved substantially in recent years.  In January 1990 the daily rate of payment of qualified substitutes was £38.  The current rate is £60.22.  Since September 1990 salary payments have issued directly to qualified substitutes instead of being issued through the boards of management.</P>
      <P>Incremental credit for qualified substitute service has been granted, subject to certain conditions, and my Department has put forward for consideration proposals for the award of pension credit for substitute service.

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I suspect, however, that the Deputy is referring not to the conditions of service of substitute teachers or the arrangements under which substitutes are appointed.  Currently, when a teacher is absent ill the principal must look for a qualified person as substitute.  In many cases this gives rise to problems for principals in locating a qualified teacher quickly.  Accordingly, it has been proposed by the INTO that there should be panels of regularly employed substitute teachers who would be available for assignment immediately as required.</P>
      <P>This proposal is being actively examined by my Department in negotiation with the INTO.  It has to be said, however, that it has potential cost increasing implications.  In a situation where additional money is being sought for a wide range of purposes in the educational system it is obvious that the matter of priorities must be taken into account.</P>
      <P>There are practical difficulties relating to how such panels of teachers would operate.  There is also the problem that much illness tends to happen in the winter months and to be less at other times in the year.  A system of supply panels might be too inflexible to meet this problem. I understand that in Northern Ireland, where a supply panel system has operated for some years, the authorities are considering discontinuing it, in view of difficulties in administering the system, and replacing it with grants to schools.</P>
      <P>As I have said, my Department is actively examining the matter and is in negotiation with the INTO about it.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for her reply.  Is she aware that a commitment was given, in the context of the primary review body report, to put in place a system of proper supply panels of substitute teachers for primary schools?  As a result of the failure of successive Governments to put such a system in place, the INTO has been driven to call a one-day stoppage on, I think, 25 March in a number of schools.  About 12 schools in the Munster region will be affected.  Is <Col N="1735" /> the Minister aware of this impending one-day stoppage?  Is she concerned that thousands of school children will be left without schooling for one day due to the pursuit by teachers of a claim which has in effect, already been conceded by her Department?  If so, has she had any recent discussions with the INTO in an effort to avert the stoppage?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the matter to which the Deputy has referred, and it has been discussed at meetings with the INTO.  The difficulty arose in formulating a practical scheme.  I have invited the INTO to talk to my Department so that we will be in a position to put forward to the Department of Finance proposals for a pilot scheme.  We have asked that it be put in writing, and this is now being done.</P>
      <P>With regard to the administration of supply panels, I am particularly concerned that supply teachers would be qualified.  In order to ensure this, there is merit in having teachers on a panel.  Of course, we are also moving towards the implementation of the commitment in the Programme for Government to set up local education structures.  I am interested in seeing whether it would be easier to administer such a scheme at local education board level than at central office level.  I would like to see a pilot scheme put in place before the local education structures are set up and to monitor any difficulties which may arise. This means that we will have had practical experience of the workings of a panel of teachers before the local structures are put in place.  We need to look at the operation of such a scheme both in urban and rural areas.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister content to see the continuation of the situation where a number of unqualified teachers are working in classrooms every day and carrying out what has best been summed up by the general secretary of the INTO as babysitting duties while qualified teachers remain on the dole?  If the Minister is not happy with this situation, will <Col N="1736" /> she show some more sense of urgency in putting in place permanent panels on a pilot basis in two or three regions?  Can she give a commitment to do this now so as to avert the one-day stoppage by teachers?  Four schools in my constituency will be closed for a full day as a result of this stoppage.</P>

      <P>I will, but I wish to finish my question.  The impending one-day stoppage by teachers is much more urgent than other matters which have been discussed at length.  Will the Minister concede that what is being sought by the INTO on a pilot basis would involve no additional cost to the Exchequer this year?</P>

      <P>As I said.  I am concerned that unqualified teachers are working in schools at present.  I think the ballot of INTO members was being carried out when I came into office.  The matter was brought to my attention very swiftly and I am now considering the structures for a pilot scheme which can be put in place.  This will enable me, after six weeks in office, to respond as quickly as I can to an issue about which the Deputy and I share a common concern.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister will agree that it is too early in her term of office for a strike involving 60 schools to occur.  As the commitment to establish the panels of supply teachers has been in existence in her Department for three years, will the Minister put in place before 25 March, the proposed date of the strike, a pilot scheme for a panel of supply teachers?  Will she give an assurance to the House that she will take the necessary steps to prevent this strike going ahead?</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not accept that the term &ldquo;pilot schemes&rdquo; has a rather ominous ring to it in that such <Col N="1738" /> schemes tend to become permanent?  For example, the school psychological scheme was introduced four years ago and there are two psychologists, one in Dundalk and one in Tipperary, still working on the scheme.  Is the Minister aware that outside the pilot areas one-teacher schools have to be closed when the teachers become ill?  Unfortunately the same applies when both teachers in a two-teacher school become ill simultaneously. We need a proper panel system immediately and not another series of pilot projects.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not afraid to use the term &ldquo;pilot project&rdquo; if I am satisfied that a project is being reviewed and it achieves what it set out to do.  I have referred to the problems which are being experienced in schools in rural areas.  For that reason I have suggested that when a pilot project has been put on paper and is in operation it should not be seen to be used only in large schools with a large number of teachers; the problems in rural areas also need to be addressed.  I want to ensure that when the intermediate education structures are put in place we can use the experience and expertise we have gained from the pilot scheme to set up a panel system on a regional or county basis.</P>

      <P>The promotion of gender equity is one of the main aims of the educational policy of this Government. The Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-1997 outlines a programme of affirmative action which will be undertaken in the education sector. The action programme will include the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;the enhancement of career guidance programmes to include a positive <Col N="1739" /> programme to encourage women to enter labour markets traditionally closed to them;</P>
    <P>&mdash;full range of course options for all students;</P>
    <P>&mdash;an emphasis in adult education on encouraging women to re-enter the work force;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the promotion of women's studies in third level;</P>
    <P>&mdash;a sports policy to encourage the participation of women at every level;</P>
    <P>&mdash;an adequate and comprehensive system of sex education, appropriate to the maturity of students, at second level.</P>
    <P>I have taken a number of initiatives to address gender equity in education and to begin to implement the action programme including:</P>
    <P>(a)  the establishment of a fund in order to improve career guidance counselling in second level schools &mdash; £200,000 has been allocated for the fund in 1993;</P>
    <P>(b)  increased provision of guidance teachers for second-level schools in the 1993-94 school year.  Over 100 schools will benefit from this measure;</P>
    <P>(c)  the provision of an increase of 11 per cent in the 1993 allocation for the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) which has a special remit to ensure that sexist and sex-stereotyping be eliminated from curricula and to work towards the implementation of gender equity in schools &mdash; the increased provision will enable the NCCA to proceed with:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the reform and restructuring of the primary school curriculum;</P>
    <P>&mdash;substantial revision of the curriculum and syllabuses at the senior post-primary cycle;</P>
    <P>&mdash;developing specific aspects of the junior post-primary cycle including <Col N="1740" /> civic and social education and technology;</P>
    <P>(d)  an examination of the existing provision for adult education to identify, <i>inter alia,</i> how it is meeting the educational needs of women;</P>
    <P>(e)  increased provision of almost 60 per cent in the funding for the adult literacy and community education scheme, bringing the total to £1.57 million &mdash; this scheme has brought great benefit to adults, both men and women, who cannot read or write;</P>
    <P>(f)  increased provision for second chance education and training.  The vocational training and opportunities scheme is being expanded by 900 places in 1993 to provide a total of nearly 3,000 places &mdash; the total allocation in 1993 for the scheme is £15.5 million approximately.  I am also providing a special fund of £300,000 in 1993 to alleviate financial problems of unemployed adults who enrol in second chance education schemes;</P>
    <P>(g)  I am having the proposals of the Report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women examined in my Department with a view to identifying short term and long term policy implications.</P>
    <P>In February this year I launched a skills development workshop at the Marino Institute of Education.  The workshop was aimed at women staff members of An Post and my Department who wished to develop supervisory and managerial skills appropriate to their next career stage.</P>
    <P>In the context of the preparation of the White Paper on Education I have arranged for gender equity issues to be treated as a matter of priority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her long reply.  I have no doubt that the measures she outlined will bear fruit in the years ahead.  In the short term I suggest that sometimes difficult problems respond to simple solutions.  I am thinking of the hidden curriculum in education. <Col N="1741" /> Very often 99 per cent of the teachers in a school are female but the 1 per cent that is male happens to be the principal teacher.  That is a powerful educational factor in shaping the minds and aspirations of young people.  If we are to remedy the imbalance we ought to start in primary schools.  Has the Minister any plan to rectify the matter or to encourage and assist more women to bid for the principalships of schools at primary and second level?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the concerns of Deputy Quill.  The teaching profession at primary level is predominently female but they represent only 51 per cent of principals appointed at that level.  Guidelines on interviewing are laid down by the Employment Equality Agency.  Rules and procedures for boards of management have been circulated.  A circular was issued as late as October 1991 to remind boards of management of their responsibilities in relation to gender equity in the allocation of teachers to classes.  Circulars are probably not enough.  Moves within my Department, taking on board the recommendations of the commission, will encourage women to apply for these positions.  They certainly are the more represented sex in the teaching profession and they have a huge impact on the next generation.  Men must expect to find women in authority without raising an eyebrow.</P>

Forgetting what happened in the past, is the Minister worried about the imbalance in gender equity at primary school that is going to occur? In view of the fact that someone forecast that male primary teachers would be a tourist attraction, might the Minister seriously consider putting a preservation order on male primary teachers now?</P>

      <P>As it was suggested on the other side of the House that things were better when it was left to gentlemen, I would say that when it is left to this Minister for Education I am concerned that the role models that are presented to our children, both boys and girls, at primary level reflect the society in which we live.  Perhaps there is something to be said for looking for positive discrimination in certain areas.  I am fully committed to equality for whichever sex. There has been an upturn again in the number of male applicants to the teacher training colleges and that is probably a reflection of the high regard in which the public hold the teaching profession.</P>

The Deputy referred to schools that are in a different structure from the primary school one.  I would ask the Deputy to bear with me as we further discuss the intermediate <Col N="1746" /> structures and the tasks they will be assigned.  I can assure the Deputy that I am committed to a voice for parents, and at least half the parents in this country are women.

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 73 together.  The situation in relation to the educational authority in Britain is quite different from that operating here in the case of most kinds of school.  The educational authority in question owns and operates over 1,000 schools and itself directly deals with insurance matters.  This is not the case here.</P>
      <P>In our situation, it is a matter for the managerial authorities of individual primary, secondary and vocational schools to ensure that adequate insurance is effected on school property and against public liability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The grants paid by my Department towards the current cost of schools may be used for this purpose.  In the case of model schools and of community and comprehensive schools, the position is similar to that of State property.  It might be that matters such as assisting with insurance arrangements would be appropriate for an intermediate tier in the context <Col N="1747" /> of the establishment of local education structures.  Even in Britain, however, the central Government Department is not involved and it would be very undesirable in our situation that my Department should become directly involved in insurance transactions and the legal and administrative apparatus that would be entailed.  It is, however, open to school authorities, or their representative associations, to take such initiatives as the collective negotiation of insurance premiums with a view to reducing costs.  This is, in effect, happening at present in that most of the primary and secondary schools are insured with the same company and the majority of vocational schools are covered by the one insurance company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her information about the difference between the systems in Ireland and Britain.  I am absolutely aware that they are very different systems indeed and that it will be some time before we have an education authority which might be able to undertake similar roles to those in Britain.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister not accept that insurance costs are one of the major costs that the boards of management of schools have to meet?  Certainly in my constituency, where there is a large number of disadvantaged schools, insurance costs take up to 70 or 80 per cent of their own local fund raising and eats up what might otherwise be available for improving facilities in the school.  It is in that context that I was asking the Minister to consider a new scheme based on the British experience where a central scheme has substantilly reduced the cost there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I must thank the Deputy for making available to me the information about the scheme she is referring to.  The rise in capitation grants can be earmarked, to some extent, for the ongoing management of the school if schools wish to do that.  We have studied the companies that are actually covering the primary, secondary and vocational <Col N="1748" /> schools.  The figures that were supplied to our Department show that they are operating school insurance schemes at a loss.  We have not found that it would be particularly cost effective to implement a scheme such as the one in Strathclyde and without encumbering the Department of Education with the administration of the scheme.</P>
      <P>In the Strathclyde area the authority operates the scheme for a very large number of schools.  No matter how large the task or how many the responsibilities, I would not like the energy, the facilities and the work being done by the Department of Education to be further encumbered by administration.  I shall certainly examine the matter, particularly in relation to the administration of the scheme, and I thank the Deputy for making the information available.  On departmental figures, it appears that there are losses in insurance.  If it were possible to administer the scheme more globally without asking the Department to take the full brunt of the administration through the intermediate structures, I would certainly consider that.</P>

      <P>In the absence of any other structure between the schools and the Department, the Department is the only body to which one can look for any central improvement.  I welcome the Minister's indication that she will reconsider the matter.  Would she consider regional educational boards in the operation of such a scheme?</P>

      <P>As I have said, I will consider this matter.  It will have to be examined in the context of their Irish education system, which is, of course, slightly different from the Scottish system.  The concern is that moneys that are available be expended in the interest of the children and that administrative and insurance costs be kept to a minimum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 38, 48 and 60 together.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the £18.7 million allocated this year for the national schools capital programme I have scheduled 43 major projects to proceed to construction during 1993.  This is in addition to the 38 major projects already under construction at the beginning of the year. Upwards of a 1,000 minor capital projects will be undertaken also at national schools during 1993 and, on past trends, 50 or so schools will require to be provided with prefabricated accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Teachers and pupils need to be provided with a reasonable working and learning environment in good quality accommodation, taking account of issues such as the demands of a modern curriculum, the changing nature of teaching and learning resources and the need to adapt styles of pupil learning.  Despite <Col N="1750" /> much investment over the years, much of which was needed to cater for increasing numbers, the condition of a great many schools leaves much to be desired.  In recognition of this, the Programme for a Partnership Government states:</P>
    <P>We will allocate an increased amount in each of the next five years to implement a planned programme of replacing or refurbishing sub-standard school buildings.</P>
    <P>As evidence of this commitment, the 1993 capital allocation for primary and post primary schools represents an increase of £6.9 million or 19 per cent over the 1992 expenditure.</P>
    <P>Experience since taking office has convinced me of the need for a more orderly approach to the process by which major building projects are selected for release to construction each year.  It is my intention to have future decisions on the progress of major projects, through the architectural planning process up to the signing of a contract, based on objective criteria related to relevant educational, building and financial factors.  I also consider it desirable that school authorities be made aware, in an open and transparent manner, of the position of their particular building projects at the various stages.  As a first step, I have, in a separate written reply to Question No. 164 of yesterday's date, provided details of the major projects which will commence in 1993 under the primary and post primary building programmes.  My intention is to build on this by disclosing the criteria on which projects are selected and prioritised and advanced through the planning process and then indicate on a regular basis where individual projects stand in relation to these criteria.</P>

      <P>I am amazed at the Minister's reference to prefabricated buildings.  I had thought that the era of that blight was over, as prefabricated accommodation is not suitable for education. I wish to again draw the Minister's attention to the very clear commitment given in the Programme for a Partnership Government:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1751" /> We will allocate an increased amount in each of the next five years to implement a planned programme of replacing or refurbishing sub-standard school buildings.</P>
    <P>The increase this year was a mere £1.9 million, an amount barely sufficient to complete one school for 500 students. Does the Minister not realise that the INTO has already determined that approximately 680 schools have no indoor toilet; others are tumble-down, insanitary and rat-infested and others still are battered prefabricated buildings that are a public health hazard?  Does she recognise that based on her current projections it would be 20 to 25 years before any dent could be made in the problem? What will the Minister do about it?</P>

      <P>I am aware of the survey carried out by the INTO.  We all share a concern for children who are being taught in environments that are not conducive to good health or wellbeing.  It is, therefore, extremely important that I be allowed to put in place a priority list that would be transparent, particularly to those who believe that the prevailing conditions are much worse than those in other counties, conditions of which they may not have intimate knowledge.  I have quite a lot of detail on this issue but I shall spare Deputies that.  Perhaps Deputy Higgins would like to request in writing details of how the process begins and the stages it goes through.  Under criteria that I am setting down with the building unit in my Department I will be able to draw up lists so that when schools are in need of a new building they will have information on the process <Col N="1752" /> involved.  I hope to be able to advise such schools of their place on the priority list. It is my belief &mdash; and this issue has been brought to my attention every time I have been in the Chamber &mdash; that there is a lack of confidence in the impartiality of the process associated with the school building programme.  I want people to regain faith in that process.  It is my intention to prioritise and select projects and to take them through the various stages. I want school authorities and local Deputies &mdash; who work very hard on behalf of their communities &mdash; to be made aware in an open and transparent manner of the position of particular building projects at all times.  All statements made regarding building projects must have credibility.  The possibility of establishing a formal appeals mechanism is being examined in my Department at present.</P>

      <P>There is no difficulty, a Cheann Comhairle.  Given the current state of many school buildings throughout the country, particularly primary school buildings, would the Minister agree that the 11 per cent increase granted this year is completely insufficient? I respectfully suggest to the Minister that to announce 43 major projects when it is known that there are 700 on the priority list is not to deal adequately with an appalling problem.  In view of the Minister's new policy of openness in the prioritising of certain projects, would she consider referring this matter to the Dáil committee that will be set up in the near future to deal with education?  In that way, everybody in the House could have a say in the drawing up of the new plan. We do not want to continue with a situation which depends on a Minister, or a Government Deputy, being in a constituency to ensure that somebody will get a replacement prefab or an extension to an existing primary school.</P>

      <P>In the past five years we have spent £84 million on capital works for national schools.  During the same period we have spent £107.4 million on post-primary schools and 6,800 grants were made available for post-primary schools for emergency and minor works. At post-primary level 166 major projects were completed, involving hundreds of minor projects.  I am concerned about the condition of school buildings, but we are committed in a five year programme to increasing the capital made available to improve the condition of school buildings. We are living in very difficult budgetary times and an increased allocation right across the board suggests not only that we are committed to delivering on our educational promises but that we are committed, and have shown that commitment, to ensuring that children will benefit from a better educational system in an environment conducive to learning.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred to transparency and the building programme and said those matters should be discussed at the education committee.  I will be happy to discuss these matters with Members of all parties and work out a common system for building priority projects.</P>

She did not do so because she cannot answer it.  Does the Minister accept that in many cases the parents have been waiting 20 years for a new school?  If a fire chief visited some of the schools in my constituency &mdash; I would say the same applies nationwide &mdash; he would close many of them because they are fire hazards.  There are no corridors left through which the children could get out of the classrooms. They are packed in like sardines.  Surely in this day and age we are not talking about prefabricated buildings as a solution to the problem?  They are outdated <Col N="1754" /> and are not a solution to the problem.

I also wish to refer to a school in Glaslough, which I raised in the House on another occasion, where the children have been divided and some classes are being held in another building.  This is a very urgent matter and I hope that the schools in Glaslough and Killanney will be treated as a priority.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) where a court is determining the sentence to be imposed on a person for an offence to which this section applies, the court shall, upon application by the person in respect of whom such offence was committed, hear the evidence of the person in respect of whom the offence was committed as to the effect of the offence on such person upon being requested to do so.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment seeks to insert a new subsection in section 5 which deals with the effect of the offence on the victim.  Section 5 provides that where a court is determining the sentence to be imposed on a person for an offence to which this section applies, the court shall take into account and may, where necessary, receive evidence or submissions concerning any effect, whether long term or otherwise of the offence on the person. In other words, it is left to the court where it deems it necessary to receive <Col N="1899" /> evidence or submissions as to the effect of the crime on the individual.  It appears that the court has to decide in a vacuum whether to hear evidence or submissions. The victim of the offence would not be a party to the proceedings and effectively it is left to a judge to determine whether to receive evidence on submissions on the effects of the offence on the victim.</P>
    <P>The subsection which I seek to insert reads as follows:</P>
    <P>(3) Where a court is determining the sentence to be imposed on a person for an offence to which this section applies, the court shall, upon application by the person in respect of whom such offence was committed, hear the evidence of the person in respect of whom the offence was committed as to the effect of the offence on such person upon being requested to do so.</P>
    <P>This brings me back to where I started yesterday when I said we should have a more victim-oriented system of criminal law.  Under the provisions of this subsection, the victim of a physical or sexual assault, following the completion of the court hearing and the conviction being made, will be allowed to ask the court to hear evidence on the effects of the crime, before the court will pass sentence and when they would make such a request the court would have to listen to what they had to say.  It would not simply be a matter of a judge or a third party, such as the prosecutor or prosecuting counsel making that decision.  I am concerned that people who are the victims of serious offences be allowed the opportunity so that the court truly understands the effect the offence for which the guilty person has been convicted has had on them. When I originally proposed this amendment on Committee Stage I also included a provision to allow the victim in such circumstances to have legal representation. It is desirable that this should happen, particularly when we appear to be giving legal representation automatically to the convicted person when the unduly lenient sentence is <Col N="1900" /> appealed.  I fail to understand why someone who is convicted of an offence should get free legal advice and be treated better by our legal system than the victim of the offence.  That seems to me to be a very unequal application of the laws of justice.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister accepts this proposal. If he does, I hope he will recognise that a victim should be given a right to have the effects that that crime has had on the victim's life heard by the court.</P>
    <P>As we have only a limited time, may I ask the Minister to clarify how he envisages section 5 (1) working in practice? Subsection (1) states that a court &ldquo;where necessary,&rdquo; may &ldquo;receive evidence or submissions concerning any effect...of the offence&rdquo;.  I am not sure how the effects of the offence will be communicated to the court in the absence of the individual, who is the victim, giving evidence.  Will a medical report be submitted to the court?  If so who will have to obtain the medical report for the court?  Will that be a function of prosecuting counsel?  If someone is suffering from psychiatric problems as a result of a violent or sexual crime, will a psychiatric report on the victim be made avaiable to the court and will the court welfare officers prepare such a report?  If the victim had been badly affected by the crime, for example, if a wife had been sexually assaulted, would her husband be allowed to give evidence to the court on the effects that assault had on his wife? Over whom will the court have jurisdiction to take evidence from in relation to the effects of a crime?</P>
    <P>On the other hand, there are occasions when crimes are committed against individuals who already suffer difficulties.  If the effects of the crime are of a psychological or psychiatric nature it will be difficult for the court on occasions to determine whether the difficulties relate to the crime.  Let us take the purely theoretical case of a young woman who had serious psychiatric problems, a teenager suffering from anorexia who was sexually assaulted and this exacerbated her condition. If the court is to determine the effects of the assault on her what information will be furnished to it about her <Col N="1901" /> health prior to the assault?  Let us assume that two men have a fight and one is held responsible for the serious injuries suffered by the other, who not only appears to have physical injuries but psychiatric problems as well.  The court will have to have regard to that issue in determining the sentence to be passed but what information will be made available to the offender about those matters and how will the court obtain information as to the health of the person before the assault took place?</P>
    <P>I very much welcome the provision which will require the courts to examine the effects on victims of crimes committed against them and require the court to take those into account when sentencing offenders, but this is a very small section and deals extremely briefly with the manner of the application of this principle. I think it is inadequate and needs to be beefed up to a considerable degree in order to ensure that the victim can communicate fully and comprehensively to the court the effects of the crime perpetrated but also so as to ensure that injustices do not result from the court assuming that someone is unwell because of the crime which was committed against them when they may have been unwell for a considerable period of time before the crime was committed.  I am concerned that the section may result in certain constitutional problems if courts take into account the effects on victims of crimes committed against them without the person being sentenced getting adequate information as to the alleged effects before sentence is passed. It should also be recognised that it is the right of the victim in cases as serious as those detailed in section 5(2) to be heard by the court as to the effects on them of the crime committed against them if the victim requests a court to so hear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, support this amendment.  We have spent a long time today arguing the case for a more victim-centred approach to the question of sentencing. It is clear that there are cases where the victim would wish to have an input into the sentencing by the court and <Col N="1902" /> to be able to volunteer information to the court about the effect of the offence on them.  However, in some circumstances the victim may not be in a position to do that, for example, if the victim is no longer around.</P>
      <P>In a case where a person is killed the Director of Public Prosecutions, for his own reasons, may pursue a charge of manslaughter rather than murder and the victim's family may feel aggrieved about this.  They may wish to give information about the effect of the offence on them as a family.  There are other offences, including sexual offences, where it may be necessary to take account of the impact, not just on the victim, but on the victim's family.  That area should be considered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe we can accept the proposition that the court would refuse to hear a witness who wanted to be heard.  The thrust of section 5 is to impose on the court the obligation to take into account the effect of the crime on the victim.  Therefore, the onus is on the court to ascertain the effects of the crime on the victim.  Obviously, the court may do this by requesting the victim to give evidence, but I can envisage many cases in which the court would not want to do that as it would put the victim through a great deal more trauma.  If the court does not think it is desirable to question the victim directly or if the victim, understandably, does not want to give evidence, the onus is on the court to obtain medical reports and so on.</P>
      <P>Subsection (1) provides that the court can receive evidence from any quarter in relation to the victim, including evidence from the victim.  I acknowledge Deputy Shatter's point.  He is trying to find a specific way in which the victim can submit an application to be heard.  I will accept the amendment in order to clarify the position.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;6.&mdash;(1)  On conviction of any person of an offence to which section 5 applies, in addition to dealing with him in any other way, the court may prohibit such person at any future date from attending at or near to or entering any place in which the person in respect of whom such offence was committed resides or is in employment and from using or threatening to use violence against, molesting or putting in fear the person in respect of whom such offence was committed or any member of such persons family.</P>
      <P>(2)  An order made pursuant to subsection (1) of this section shall be treated as if it were a barring order made under the Act of 1981 and sections 5, 6, 7 and 8 of the Act of 1981 shall apply to such order.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We dealt with this matter on Committee Stage where I sought to amend the legislation to allow the courts to make orders prohibiting a person who has committed the offences referred to from attending at or near the place of residence or business of the victim or from in any way interfering or molesting the victim.  The Minister disagreed with this on Committee Stage and for that reason I tabled it for Report Stage.  I will formally put the amendment, but I will not delay the House by regurgitating the previous discussion. Suffice it to say that I found it extremely disappointing that this amendment, which was designed to provide additional protection, particularly to women who are the victims of sexual and violent assault, was not accepted.  This provision was designed to provide them with peace of mind following the completion of a criminal trial where the offender is sentenced to a term in prison. I was extremely disappointed that the two Government parties, Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party, voted <i>en masse</i> against this provision.  I cannot help but speculate whether most of the Deputies on the <Col N="1904" /> Government side who voted against this proposal knew what they were voting on. However, ignorance is no excuse.</P>
    <P>The Government's opposition to this provision might come back to haunt it.  I hope some unfortunate person does not grievously suffer as a result of this provision not being agreed to on Committee Stage.  I urge the Minister to give further consideration to inserting in this Bill in the Seanad a similar provision so that this matter is addressed at an early stage.</P>

      <P>I realise that victims, as in the Kilkenny case, can be extremely worried as to what will happen when the offender is released from prison and both the Government and I are anxious to ensure that such victims have as much peace of mind as possible.  However, if violent people intend to commit another violent crime against the unfortunate victim when released from prison, no matter how the law is structured it will not stop them.  Nevertheless, I am anxious that a provision be put in place to ensure that there would be a ready remedy for those people to stave off the threat of violence or, at least, to make it as easy as possible for the Garda to arrest the offender without a warrant in order to prevent the violent act taking place.  I am anxious that the victim would at least be in a position to obtain a barring or protection order, based on the type of person the perpetrator is when he is released from prison.</P>
      <P>The objections I raised earlier were to the question of a court deciding, at the time of conviction, on a barring order against a person coming out of prison in six or eight years' time.  As I said, I am anxious that the victim, who has suffered enough, will have the maximum peace of mind possible for a person who has gone through such an ordeal.  I am still considering the matter and I think we can come up with a solution.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1905" /> In page 5, between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;6.&mdash;In any trial on indictment before any jury no reference shall be made in the course of such a trial to the power of the court to award compensation under the provisions of this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As I stated on Second Stage yesterday, in trial proceedings the essential function for the jury is to decide on the guilt or innocence of the accused.  My fear is that if a reference is made to compensation the jury will become distracted and sympathise with the victim as opposed to assessing the guilt or innocence of the accused.  Therefore, it is not appropriate in trial proceedings, prior to the jury's verdict that any reference be made to compensation &mdash; particularly by the defence counsel.  For example, if a person pleaded guilty the defence counsel could argue that that person would be willing to pay an amount of compensation and the case would centre on the issue of compensation and paying the victim rather than the guilt or innocence of the accused and the subsequent penalty that must be imposed by the trial judge.  I am anxious that the question of compensation to be decided by the judge arises only after a verdict has been agreed by the jury.  This suggestion was made to me not by lawyers but by those involved in working with victims of these crimes Although they support in principle, as I do, the notion of the payment of compensation, they are concerned that that might in some way be seen to be received in lieu of what otherwise could be a custodial or other appropriate sentence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not quite understand the purpose of the amendment.  The jury in a criminal trial decides on guilt or innocence and the judge imposes a sentence. In making the decision the evidence is outlined to the jury but reference to compensation would not be admissible because it is in no way relevant to the guilt or innocence of the accused.  If the accused is found guilty the judge will impose sentence and the judge knows of <Col N="1906" /> his right to give compensation in lieu of or together with a fine and/or prison sentence as the case may be.  I can see what Deputy Harney may be trying to achieve but her fears are groundless.  The question does not arise that compensation may be given if at the end of the process the judge passes sentence on finding the accused guilty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;6.&mdash;(1)  A person who receives a custodial sentence for a sexual offence shall be assessed for and, where appropriate, be required to undergo a medically approved rehabilitative programme of behaviourial treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  For the purposes of subsection (1), the Minister shall establish within the resources of the existing Prison Welfare Service, and in consultation with the Director of Medical Services, a scheme or schemes for the rehabilitative treatment of offenders, assessed <Col N="1907" /> and deemed suitable under this section.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Quite an amount of today's debate was devoted to dealing with the impact on the victim.  It has been stated here on a number of occasions that a prison sentence may not result in the rehabilitation of the offender.  The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that programmes are developed and implemented which are aimed at the rehabilitation of the offender.  Sexual abuse and sexual crimes generally are very serious problems here. It is not sufficient that these crimes are simply dealt with by way of disposing of the offender, so to speak, by imposing a prison sentence without taking some measures to correct the behaviour and rehabilitate the offender.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk about programmes which were supposed to be in place to deal with this problem.  In a report from <i>The Irish Times</i> of Tuesday, 15 December 1992, dealing with a case heard in the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court on 14 December before Judge Michael Moriarty it was explicitly stated that the claim made by the Minister for Justice that the most advanced programme in the world for the treatment of recidivist sex offenders was operating in Ireland since last December was simply not correct.  There are no programmes in place for the treatment of sex offenders. Quite clearly there is a need to put such programmes in place from the point of view of society at large because, first, it serves us very little if the offender, having being imprisoned, is released to commit the same crime again and, second, it serves the offender very little if some attempt is not made to rehabilitate him. In this amendment I am seeking to ensure that programmes are put in place and the most comprehensive treatment possible is made available for offenders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the intention behind this amendment.  However, I have one query in relation to the part of the amendment that refers to a custodial sentence. There have been cases when for <Col N="1908" /> what are regarded as technical reasons no custodial sentence is imposed and yet it is clear that treatment of the kind referred to by Deputy Gilmore in this amendment is necessary.  That is a small technical point and I would be interested to hear the Minister's views on it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore is right in that there is no appropriate treatment here for sex offenders and that is a disgrace.  A custodial sentence is intended in the main to take people out of society who are a danger to their families or others and also to deter other people from committing similar crimes.  It is equally important that it include rehabilitating the offender and dealing with what I regard as an illness, because people who behave in this way suffer from an illness.  Despite commitments from different Ministers it is sad that sex offenders do not receive appropriate treatment.  By imposing custodial sentences offenders may end up more frustrated, more violent, more aggressive and more inclined towards violence on coming out of prison than they were before going in.  It is extremely important, particularly given their confinement in a place of custody, that offenders receive the treatment referred to by Deputy Gilmore.  I will not go into any more detail on this matter because there is only half an hour left.  I will be interested to hear the Minister's comments.</P>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Gilmore on the clever way in which he made sure this amendment was in order.  He proposed that the finance for this measure be provided from the existing resources of the prison welfare service.  I am not certain that will happen but the amendment is framed in such a way as to ensure it is in order.  Apart from wages and salaries of prison officers and staff in places of detention, inappropriate resources are applied in the prison service generally in education, rehabilitation, training and so on, matters that are exceptionally important if prison is to be a place of rehabilitation.</P>

      <P>In support of this amendment I will refer to a more recent <Col N="1909" /> quotation than that referred to by Deputy Gilmore, from <i>The Irish Times</i> of Tuesday last which reports on a case in which Mr. Justice Flood, in the Central Criminal Court, made very critical comment of the absence of treatment and counselling programmes for sex offenders in Irish prisons.  He stated: &ldquo;Sex offenders are just placed in prison and left to rot.  Then they are tipped out on to the public again.&rdquo;  In that case Dr. Art O'Connor, a psychiatrist at the Central Mental Hospital, told the court that at present there are 140 prisoners in Arbour Hill, 100 of whom are sex offenders, and that in Wheatfield, which houses 240 prisoners, about 60 are sex offenders who are catered for on two special landings. He went on to say that there are a small number of sex offenders in Mountjoy Prison.  The judge took the view that the Government has reneged on its obligations in this area.  In the context of plans that are allegedly in place to provide a better service he said:</P>
      <P>I have heard of Government plans like that before.  The fact is there is absolutely nothing available at the moment.  This is an extremely serious predicament.</P>
      <P>When Dr. O'Connor was asked if he foresaw the introduction of a suitable treatment programme within the next 12 or 18 months his response was</P>
      <P>I would hope so.  I can't say.  I'm not a member of that committee.</P>
      <P>The Government's attitude to this area has been entirely unacceptable for far too long.  If a little more energy was put into addressing the problem and providing the services and a little less into public relations campaigns to portray concern when tragic cases arise, we would have a better country and better services.  I support Deputy Gilmore's amendment. I am not optimistic that it will result in any particularly revolutionary change taking place but the intention of the amendment is right and it will perhaps give the Minister the opportunity to say something more about this area.</P>

      <P>This amendment raises the question of treatment for sex offenders.  I notice that Deputy Gilmore has carefully worded the amendment so as to keep it within the rules of procedure of the House.</P>
      <P>I explained on Second Stage that at present these offenders have access to a range of medical, psychiatric, psychological and welfare services provided in the prisons.  However, the Minister for Justice has now directed that the working group examining various options for treating these offenders should report to her within the next few weeks.  She will then decide what services can be provided.</P>
      <P>The problems of effectively treating a sex offender in the enclosed artificial life of a prison, in the company of other prisoners, many with behavioural and other problems of their own, should not be underestimated.  These problems cannot be solved, and I know the Deputy is not suggesting that, by providing by law a requirement that offenders should compulsorily undergo a treatment programme. It is much more complex than that.</P>
      <P>Before such a legislative commitment could be undertaken it would be prudent to consider what options the working group come up with.  The group includes specialists with practical experience in this area and they have the benefit of the experience of other countries in trying to grapple with this problem.  My preferred choice is to wait to see the recommendations of the group.</P>

      <P>As both Deputies Harney and Shatter stated, it was really to get this issue aired in the context of this Bill that I tabled this amendment.  I do not have any great expectations particularly as the Minister of State pointed out that I have phrased my amendment in the context of the existing prison welfare service which is completely under resourced and inadequate.  However, my amendment has elicited from the Minister of State the response that some progress is being made.  Grandiose statements have been made in the past including the one to which I referred in my earlier contribution, about the programmes that were intended to be put in place to deal with this problem.  To date we have not seen the results we would like.  The response of the Minister of State today is an improvement on the response of one of his predecessors during the debate on the rape Bill who stated that this was a problem that was being dealt with by the chaplains in the prisons.  I am glad to see that we have come some distance from that, that a programme is at least under consideration and that a working group is to report.  There will be other ways open to us in the House to pursue that matter so I do not propose at this stage to waste the limited time we have left to us to deal with the remaining amendments by pressing a division on the issue.  I will withdraw my amendment but will raise the matter again in the context of questions to the Minister and so on to see what progress is being made by the working group and to ensure that their recommendations are implemented.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 34, to delete &ldquo;means&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;financial circumstances and capital assets&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments are designed to flesh out the powers of the court in relation to making compensation orders.  Under the section the court, in determining whether to make a compensation order, is required to have regard to the means of the offender.  What does &ldquo;means&rdquo; mean? I know what it is intended to mean, but if the Minister looks up the Oxford English Dictionary he will find that &ldquo;means&rdquo; may not actually mean what we intend.  I presume the Minister intended that in determining the capacity of an offender to pay a compensation order, the courts would have regard to the offender's circumstances and capital assets.  The words &ldquo;financial circumstances&rdquo; would mean income or moneys in the bank or financial obligations such as to pay the mortgage on a family home or support obligations towards the family.  One of the things we should try to aim at in legislation is to use language that is comprehensible in this day and age and to try to ensure that the language is clear.</P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;means&rdquo; concerned me because if someone had little or no income but owned substantial capital assets, it might not be taken to be included within the word &ldquo;means&rdquo;.  It is an odd word to use, the sort of word I would have expected in legislation from the last century.  I would urge the Minister to accept the suggestion that the word &ldquo;means&rdquo; be deleted and the words &ldquo;financial circumstances and capital assets&rdquo; be used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was also concerned that the court in determining what compensation order to <Col N="1913" /> make, must have regard to either the means or the financial circumstances and assets of the offender so far as they appear or are known to the court.  If someone is in court and is found guilty of an offence of violence or sexual assault, it is quite likely that the court will know absolutely nothing about his means.  I am not quite sure how what their means are will &ldquo;appear&rdquo; to the court.  By some sort of miraculous apparition will the court suddenly have knowledge of somebody's means?  It is agreed on all sides that the courts should have the powers to make compensation orders but it is recognised that it may be futile in some cases to make compensation orders particularly in cases where it is clear that the person who has been found guilty of an offence is someone of no financial standing and with no income.  In such circumstances the court cannot exercise its mind in making compensation orders.  Because of the way the section is drafted it appears that no power is vested in the court to require an offender to fully appraise the court of his financial circumstances.  It is as if the judge must guess what his means are.  Neither does the prosecuting counsel have a role in this but instead opts out once conviction is established.  It is not for the prosecuting counsel to cross-examine someone about their financial circumstances. What is going to happen? When the offender is in the witness box following a conviction a judge may ask him a few questions concerning his financial circumstances.  There will be no way in which the judge can determine the veracity or truthfulness of what he is being told.  Someone who is not impecunious may pretend to be impecunious, so that amendment No. 8 is important in this regard.  If we are to work the compensation provision correctly there must be a legal provision which allows a court to compel someone who is convicted of an offence to make a disclosure to the court of his financial position.  In my view the court should receive notice of that disclosure and the person making the disclosure should be open to questioning on the trustworthiness and truthfulness of what they <Col N="1914" /> say.  Hence, I suggest that a new subsection (6) be inserted in section 6 which would read as follows:</P>
    <P>(6) Prior to making a determination under this section as to whether to make a compensation order the court may require the convicted person to make a full disclosure by way of affidavit to the court of his financial circumstances, and capital assets and the convicted person may be heard in evidence in that regard if the court so directs.</P>
    <P>In other words, if someone is found guilty and convicted of an offence as serious as the listed offences in the Bill there would be a further procedure which would apply.  They would have to do what is often done in many court cases, complete a court document or affidavit in which they detail their earnings, savings and capital assets which would be submitted to the court.  They could then be called to give evidence on their financial circumstances and what they had stated in that regard would be open to questioning. For example, if they stated they had moneys in particular bank accounts or savings accounts it would be open to the court to require that they make a disclosure of those accounts to the court to determine what compensation, if any, might be awarded.  Without such a provision this section would lack teeth and would not work.  I appreciate that the Minister's amendment, No. 9, which seeks to insert a new subsection (13), is designed to ensure that when the court discover someone's finances they also discover what financial obligations or commitments they may have already.  I would argue that that is well defined within the concept of financial circumstances but if the Minister is not of that view there is nothing incompatible with this proposed amendment No. 9 and my amendments Nos. 6 and 7.  If the section is to work all those amendments require a provision such as the insertion of the proposed new subsection (6).</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will look favourably on this amendment as a constructive proposal to ensure that the compensation <Col N="1915" /> provisions work and that it is not made easy for a person convicted of a serious offence to actually mislead the court as to their true financial circumstances.  The court is entitled to insist on the type of disclosure I am proposing.  I hope the Minister will agree to this.</P>

      <P>I support the amendments in the name of Deputy Shatter as they make the position much clearer.  I share Deputy Shatter's view that &ldquo;means&rdquo; is not a very precise word and means different things to different people.  &ldquo;Means&rdquo; is assumed to be weekly income, in some cases gross income. When one is applying for various State benefits gross income rather than actual disposable income is taken into account. It varies and it does not take into account possible assets and other financial interests as Deputy Shatter said.  The terminology used by Deputy Shatter is much clearer than that used in the Bill.  I do not wish to delay the House because we have only 15 minutes left.  I support the amendments in the name of Deputy Shatter.  They are technical amendments but they make the position much clearer as to what is involved in calculating the payment of compensation or a possible review of the amount of compensation and I would ask the Minister to accept them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to quibble too much about this because the difference between us is very slight.  Deputy Shatter will notice that my amendment No. 9 deals with the matter in a different way, not only from the point of view of definition but rather in regard to what &ldquo;means&rdquo; encompasses where it appears in the Bill.  The term &ldquo;means&rdquo; appears about five times throughout the Bill whereas the new definition proposed by the Deputy to replace the term &ldquo;means&rdquo; would apply only in the two places suggested by the Deputy.  I do not think there is any great difference in substance between the two definitions.  In fact, I would tend more towards the Deputy's definition because I want to ensure that <Col N="1916" /> capital assets are taken into account.  I do not think any great difficulty will arise in practice &mdash; the Deputy will be more aware of this than I am &mdash; because of the procedure for an examination order.  The legislation covering that refers to the person's means.  We are familiar with statements and means for the purpose of determining what instalment order is to apply and I think all financial assets are taken into account.  I have no problem in changing the definition but I am sure the Deputy will understand the reason I cannot accept his amendments as they stand.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Deputy's more substantive point concerning the court requiring a convicted person to make a full disclosure by way of affidavit the Deputy will note that Committee Stage amendment No. 15 in the name of the Minister states:</P>
      <P>.... the court may require the convicted person or his parent or his guardian, as the case may be, to give evidence as to his means and financial commitments.</P>
      <P>The official amendment is only slightly different from that of the Deputy's amendment on Report Stage.  The only change of any substance is that the disclosure need not be made in all cases by affidavit.  There would be situations where that procedure might be unduly formal.  I will undertake to change the definition of &ldquo;means&rdquo; once I can change it in all five places where it occurs.  In fairness, the case the Deputy is trying to make in amendment No. 8 is met to a large extent by Committee Stage amendment No. 15.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his constructive reply and welcome the fact that he will take on board the concept of financial circumstances and capital assets and that they will be dealt with consistently throughout the Bill.  The fact that I did not notice that the word &ldquo;means&rdquo; appears elsewhere in the Bill is symptomatic of the rushed way we have had to deal with Committee and Report Stages of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the Minister's point in relation <Col N="1917" /> to Committee Stage amendment No. 15. Perhaps what we need is an amalgamation of my amendment No. 8 and Committee Stage amendment No. 15 which is what the court may require the convicted person or his parents to give evidence as to means and financial commitments. My problem with that is &mdash; and we are all people of the real world and have seen these things happen &mdash; that at the end of a trial when a conviction is recorded a parent of a convicted offender will be put back in the witness box and asked to give oral evidence about their finances and the court will have no power to compel them to produce bank accounts or any other documentation.</P>
    <P>It is mainly envisaged that this procedure will be applied in the area of serious offences.  I believe there will be a huge temptation on the part of convicted persons not to tell the truth.  They may simply decide to take a vow of silence on that issue.  In addition, it may be virtually impossible for a court to check the truthfulness of what it is being said about means unless some procedure is put in place which, in advance of the matter being heard, requires disclosure by way of documentation of a person's financial position, documentation which may authenticate what may be said in oral evidence.  It may very well be that that would be an unnecessarily complex procedure to undertake in minor cases. However, a judge or jury, having convicted someone of an offence which comes under this section should, at the very least, have the power and discretion to order, before determining sentence, that an affidavit detailing a person's finances be lodged in court.  This would enable the judge to consider a person's financial circumstances and decide what authenticating document was required.  I do not think the Bill provides for such a procedure at present, and my amendment would allow for this.</P>
    <P>I am not clear &mdash; the Minister might enlighten me on this &mdash; as to who will cross-examine a person at a trial about their finances if there is a doubt about the truthfulness of what is being said &mdash; if someone has been economical with the truth, if not having deliberately lied &mdash; in the context of the evidence given about <Col N="1918" /> their finances, as the Minister envisages, or in the context of the information on the person's financial circumstances contained in the affidavit or court document filed in advance.  Will the prosecuting counsel cross-examine or will counsel stand back from the issue if the person is not independently represented?  Will the judge carry out the cross-examination and, if so, to what extent will he do this? I am not sure how this system will work in practice in truly discovering the state of the finances of someone who has been convicted.</P>

      <P>Ar dtús ba maith liom buíochas a ghlacadh leis an Aire Stáit as ucht teacht agus éisteacht leis an aighneas seo.  I thank the Minister of State for being present in the House to reply to this debate.</P>
      <P>Athenry vocational school has been overcrowded for some considerable time. The school was designed to cater for 325 students but at present has an enrolment of more than 650 students.  For the past number of years students have had to be accommodated in a plethora of prefabricated class rooms.  There is an urgent need for an extension to this school.  I understand that the project has been priced and that the cost would be in the region of £215,000.  This is not a major amount of money, even during a time of scarce resources, to build an extension to a school, particularly a school which is so short of proper accommodation.  I ask the Minister to say when sanction will be given for the building of this extension.</P>
      <P>I understand from local people that a considerable amount of money has been collected locally which will be offset against the cost of the extension.  In cases where the local people are willing to make a contribution it is important that such effort is rewarded.  This extension is urgently needed.  Because of its proximity to Galway it is expected that student numbers at Athenry vocational school will be maintained at a very high level.  It is testimony to the interest of the teachers, parents and pupils that this school is attracting such large numbers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mar sin, d'iarrfainn ar an Aire <Col N="1920" /> breathnú go báúil ar an gcás seo agus an tógáil ar an scoil seo a cheadú chomh luath agus is féidir agus a chur san áireamh go bhfuil suim mhór airgid bailithe ag na tuismitheoirí, suim atá ar fáil freisin le dul ar aghaidh leis an obair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I thank Deputy Ó Cuív for raising this matter as it affords me the opportunity to assure the House of my Department's total commitment to the basic principle that teachers and pupils be provided with a reasonable working and learning environment in good quality accommodation.</P>
      <P>Despite substantial investment over the years, the condition of many schools leaves much to be desired.  In recognition of this, the Programme for Government states:</P>
      <P>We will allocate an increased amount in each of the next five years to implement a planned programme of replacing or refurbishing sub-standard school buildings.</P>
      <P>As evidence of this commitment, the 1993 capital allocation for post-primary schools represents an increase of over 25 per cent on the 1992 expenditure.</P>
      <P>As regards the school in question, I am aware of the accommodation situation at Athenry vocational school and of the necessity to have some replacement accommodation provided as soon as possible. Indeed, architectural planning of a project to provide 575m² of accommodation has been completed and tenders have been submitted to my Department.  This new accommodation will provide: a science laboratory, an arts and craft room, a technical drawing room, a lecture room, a staff room and a remedial classroom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the increased allocation for 1993, the ongoing commitments and priorities precluded the inclusion of the Athenry project in the programme for 1993 which I detailed in a reply to a question in the House a few days ago. Furthermore as I indicated in that reply, I am having prepared a detailed prioritised list of all projects whereby school authorities <Col N="1921" /> can be aware of the status of their particular project at any given time.</P>
    <P>In that context I can assure the Deputy that the claims of Athenry vocational school will be considered as favourably as possible with a view to the provision of the accommodation at the earliest possible date.  I will ask that the Deputy's case be favourably considered and that this project be included in the next round.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Chair for choosing this matter for this evening's Adjournment Debate.  I do not wish to be disrespectful to the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach but the person who should be here for this debate is the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn.</P>
      <P>Clare Morris Limited have been based in Claremorris, County Mayo, for the past 22 years.  At peak production it employed 80 people.  Today it employs 38.  Unless urgent intervention is forthcoming at top level &mdash; by &ldquo;top level&rdquo; I mean by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment making eyeball to eyeball contact with the parent company &mdash; then all 38 jobs will be lost.  A padlock will be on the gate and another, albeit a relatively small international company, will have fled our shores.  This is bad for Mayo as a community locally.  It is bad for the country in a national context.  It is extremely bad for Ireland's image internationally because it confirms the abandonment of Ireland syndrome by foreign companies located here and which will be used effectively to damage us by our international competitors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problems of Clare Morris Limited are essentially fourfold.  First, the company is facing savage and unfair competition from rainwear products being dumped at extremely cheap prices on the Irish market from the Far East.  The second factor is crippling bank interest rates.  Thirdly, there is the failure of the Government to allow the company to qualify for the scheme introduced by the Minister responsible for trade for currency compensation for companies exporting to the United Kingdom and <Col N="1922" /> affected by sterling devaluation.  Last, but by no means least, the 21 per cent VAT has paralysed the company's competitiveness. When one considers that 21 per cent adds more than one-fifth to the price of the product and when a company is faced with goods produced in the sweatshops of the Orient, then the VAT rate can be the final killer, as it is in this case.</P>
    <P>I request the Minister of State to ask the Minister to make contact with the parent company in the United Kingdom, Peter Storm Limited of Nottingham, with a view to offering the parent company every possible assistance to overcome its present difficulties here.  I further request, if the parent company does not intend staying here, that its Irish subsidiary be kept open as a going concern by it until such time as a buyer is obtained.  The workforce at Clare Morris Limited are highly skilled.  The quality of the rainwear products produced is superb in terms of finish and extremely durable. There is a substantial investment in machinery and plant.  This is the type of assembled enterprise which will be extremely hard to put together in the future.</P>
    <P>I am pleading with the Minister to use his powers of persuasion with the company to keep the doors open and to give the existing management and staff a chance to show all concerned that they have the capacity to engineer and trade their way to a successfully re-established venture.</P>
    <P>I would make the point, that a few years ago Claremorris had one of the longest-established best known bacon curing and processing plants in the country. Rationalisation plans in the bacon industry meant that it went to the wall. What was once a thriving factory employing several hundred people is now a sad, drab spectacle.  We do not want the same to happen to Clare Morris Limited.  The west of Ireland has seen a massive pattern of decline and decay.  The Castlebar bacon factory has gone with the loss of several hundred jobs.  Tuam sugar factory, a huge employer in its day, has now been razed to the ground.  Irish Spinners Limited in Kiltimagh has been closed. Creagh Agricultural Institute in Ballinrobe <Col N="1923" /> has been closed.  Ballinafad Agricultural College is a thing of the past. Does one need to mention Digital?  The list goes on and on.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to convey the concern of the House to the Minister for Enterprise and Employment as 38 jobs, families and livelihoods are on the line.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Dempsey) Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Dempsey)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I convey sincere apologies on behalf of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, who intended to be here but, unfortunately, was held up.  The Minister has asked me to assure the House, and the Deputy, of his concern about the proposed closure of the manufacturing operations of Clare Morris Limited and the consequences for the workforce involved.  The House will realise, of course, that in the case of any enterprise a closure decision is a matter essentially for the owners and management of that enterprise.</P>
      <P>This company, a subsidiary of Peter Storm Limited, Nottingham, England, has experienced difficulties in the past few years because of a decline in demand for the company's products in the UK due to severe import competition on that market.  The company's problems have also been exacerbated by the overall downturn in retail sales in the UK due to the recession.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the adverse impact both economically and socially of the loss of 38 jobs as a result of the proposed closure of the Clare Morris factory. Despite the best efforts of the IDA, who met with the managing director of the parent company on 4 March 1993 in an effort to avert or at least defer the closure, the parent company was adamant that the decision to close, in May, was irreversible.  The Minister has asked the IDA to do everything in its power to find an alternative company to take over the operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The clothing and textiles industries in Ireland continue to be very important sectors in our economy, as indeed they are in the European Community generally. More than three million people are employed in these sectors in the Community <Col N="1924" /> and the importance of them nationally should not be underestimated.</P>
    <P>About 23,000 people approximately, one in eight jobs in Irish manufacturing industry, are directly employed in these sectors and many more jobs depend on them indirectly at local level.  Virtually every area of the country has employment in these sectors.  Gross output amounts to about £900 million.  More than 80 per cent of the industry's production is exported, mainly to European Community Countries, and this underlines the importance for Ireland of the export market.</P>
    <P>The future well-being of the clothing and textiles industries in Ireland is inextricably bound up with the Community markets.  The Community has been suffering for a number of years from recession which has had an effect generally on demand and prices of the products of these sectors.  This has had a knock-on effect on demand for our products. We therefore have a vital interest in seeing the Community strong and growing again because such growth could provide the basis for a recovery in terms of employment and exports in these industries.</P>
    <P>Obviously with the advent of the Single Market, competition is intensifying and our industry must continue to face up to these challenges.  While competition from other member states' industries has been increasing on the Community market, external competition, especially from the newly emerging democracies of Central and Eastern Europe continues to pose serious challenges for the Community as a whole.</P>
    <P>The Minister would like to stress that he is acutely aware of the current problems of the clothing and textile sectors and the extent to which its problems have been exacerbated by the currency crisis. A number of provisions have been put in place to address these issues.  The Government decided in October 1992 to make £50 million available over a six month period to help firms, the employment and output of which were under threat due to the currency crisis and, in particular, the devaluation of sterling. The bulk of this money was allocated to a new scheme &mdash; the market development <Col N="1925" /> fund &mdash; which was subsequently approved by the EC subject to a range of specific criteria.  The Minister understands that Clare Morris Limited did not apply for funding under the market development fund.</P>
    <P>Given the history of trade links with the UK, firms in the clothing and textiles sectors have been very significant beneficiaries under this scheme.  These measures on their own will not solve all the industry's problems.  The Department has had regular contact with the relevant State agencies to examine the problems of the industry on an ongoing basis in an effort to take account of specific sectoral needs.</P>
    <P>In the case of clothing and textiles, the strategy is to develop strong companies, which are able to compete in the domestic, but particularly in the international markets, by improving management and production expertise.  Clothing manufacturers are now being actively encouraged to switch from overdependence on the UK market, and to exploit competitive advantages in design, service and shorter lead times in order to gain a foothold on the broader European and other markets.  The industry has undergone significant restructuring over the past number of years.  Structural adjustment was due to a number of factors including ongoing improvements in technology, rationalisation, increased competition for low-cost sources, changes in distribution, currency fluctuations and the level of demand.</P>
    <P>The Minister is confident that the clothing and textiles sectors can respond to the challenges that lie ahead.  He is hopeful that with proper management and manufacturing expertise these sectors of Irish Industry can use the advantages in the areas of design, quick response and so on to explore new markets and continue to maintain their place of importance to the Irish economy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this matter.  I appreciate the presence of Deputy Dempsey, the Minister of State to reply to this serious matter.  I am <Col N="1926" /> annoyed that the Minister for Health did not see fit to come here to respond.</P>
      <P>I am concerned at conditions at Cavan General Hospital.  Due to the conditions there the general public formed an opinion of the hospital that does not reflect the excellence of the hospital, its surgeons, consultant physicians, doctors, nurses and lay staff.  I wish to place on record my appreciation of their great work which goes far beyond the call of duty.</P>
      <P>We have an excellent medical unit in Cavan General Hospital with two conscientious hard-working, concerned physicians in Dr. Frank Walker and Dr. Noel Smith.  They are doing an excellent job particularly in the light of the financial constraints placed on them.</P>
      <P>Immense pressure is now being brought to bear on them to reduce their bed occupancy rates and to close more beds.  This is unacceptable in the running of a proper service as patients are already being discharged too early.  It is common to hear of patients being readmitted on the day after discharge because they were sent home too soon.  That is not the fault of the consultant.</P>
      <P>I have received letters from three medical practitioners who were called to visit patients whom they had sent to the general hospital the previous day.  They could not believe that the patients had been sent home and they had to make emergency arrangements to have the patients readmitted.  This caused great annoyance to the families of the patients.</P>
      <P>I received a telephone call only an hour ago about an elderly patient who is presently in the Mater Hospital in Dublin.  That patient was in Cavan General Hospital, was sent for further treatment to the Mater Hospital and wishes to return to Cavan because she is terminally ill.  The doctor in Cavan General Hospital is anxious to accommodate her but he has no bed available.  This is not good enough.  I will give the name of the patient to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cost factors must be taken into consideration, but I can assure the Minister that he will find there is no more cost conscious hospital in the country than Cavan General Hospital.  In regard to running costs over the past five years, <Col N="1927" /> Cavan General Hospital comes out on top.  There should not be such a thing as a bed quota.  Emergencies will arise and there will be outbreaks of influenza. There will be serious traffic accidents and so on and beds will be needed.  The beds are availalbe in the hospital, they are in wards that are locked with padlocks.  That is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>The North Eastern Health Board is one of the most cost conscious boards in the country and for its diligence it is being heavily penalised in the context of the contributions it gets from the State.  At £38 per capita the amount of State funding it receives is the second lowest in the country.  The reduction represents a loss of £12 million per annum to the area.  I have no doubt but that is the reason sufficient finance is not being made available to Cavan General Hospital.</P>
    <P>The people in Cavan are extremely diligent.  A number of those mentioned are involved in community fund-raising projects.  They are on call for 24 hours a day and are prepared to meet community groups and fund raisers.  The Minister needs to ensure that those people are provided with the proper facilities which will not be abused and will give the people of the area the service to which they are entitled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to convey apologies on behalf of the Minister for Health who could not be here this evening.  I acknowledge what the Deputy said about the staff of the hospital.  I am in the North Eastern Health Board region and am aware of the problems of Cavan General Hospital which has a very good reputation.  I am sure the Minister would like me to acknowledge that in the House.</P>
      <P>I would also like to thank the Deputy for bringing the three cases to my attention. If he gives me the full details I will convey them to the Minister.  I will also convey them to the chief executive officer of the health board whom I will be meeting shortly to deal with other matters.</P>
      <P>I would like to thank the Deputy for giving me an opportunity to clarify the position regarding Cavan General Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1928" /> The Deputy will be aware, of course, that the provision and organisation of services generally at Cavan General Hospital is a matter for the North Eastern Health Board in the first instance.  The Minister feels it is important to explain also that the admission of a patient to hospital and the discharge of a patient from hospital are clinical decisions for the consultant in charge of the case.  With regard to length of stay in hospitals generally, it is necessary to be aware of the success of modern surgical techniques and equipment in reducing lengths of stay and indeed eliminating the need for overnight stay in hospital in some cases.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be interested to learn that the average length of stay for surgical patients at Cavan General Hospital in 1992 was in line with that in other hospitals in the region.  The North Eastern Health Board has assured the Minister that there is absolutely no basis for the suggestion that surgical services at Cavan General Hospital have been or are to be curtailed.  In fact, the opposite is the case &mdash; the board is striving to provide the best quality surgical service possible at the hospital.  Surgical activity levels at the hospital rose from 1,888 patients treated in 1991 to 2,137 in 1992, an increase or more than 13 per cent.  The board is, in fact, planning for a further increase in surgical activity levels at Cavan General Hospital in 1993.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be interested to learn that interviews will be held shortly for the post of temporary consultant surgeon at the hospital arising from the recent sad death of Mr. Hanna, consultant surgeon there.  I take this opportunity to pay tribute again to the dedication and the commitment Mr. Hanna had to the hospital and to the people in his care.</P>
    <P>The Minister trusts that all of these matters will help reassure the Deputy and, indeed, the people of Cavan, that there is absolutely no threat to surgical services at Cavan, quite the contrary.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.20 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 12 March 1993.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 27, 65 and 76 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present Department of Education funding for research in universities is not distinguished from funding provided for <Col N="1756" /> teaching and in effect is linked to the number of students in the particular institution. Targeted funding for research projects is made through the Office of Science and Technology of the Department of Enterprise and Employment.</P>
    <P>The provision of additional resources for research and development is being addressed by the Department in the context of the forthcoming National Development Plan and Structural Fund Programme for the Higher Education Sector.  No decision has yet been made regarding the total sum to be invested. However, I am confident that we will secure further increased investment for research and development facilities at third level.  As the Deputy will be aware a substantial programme of investment of research and development facilities is nearing completion under the current National Development Plan.</P>
    <P>The present capital programme for the Higher Education Sector includes the provision of major improvements in research and development facilities at Dublin City University, St. Patrick's College, Maynooth, University College, Cork, University College, Dublin, University College, Galway, University of Limerick and Trinity College, Dublin.</P>
    <P>There are also a number of significant developments in this context in the Dublin Institute of Technology and in a number of regional technical colleges, e.g. Waterford, Tallaght, Cork.</P>
    <P>Examples of the areas included in my Department's programme are:</P>

    <P>&mdash;the Science and Technology Centre in Maynooth;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the Science and Technology facilities in Dublin City University.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently in close consultation with the Universities and Technological Colleges to identify future needs in order to facilitate a comprehensive plan for State support, assisted from the structural funds, for research and development facilities in the medium term.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 20 and 116 together.</P>
      <P>The school transport service comprises a complex and integrated nationwide route network and any proposal for route alteration requires careful consideration. Where such requests are achieved, it is necessary for my Department to get a detailed report from Bus Éireann on the feasibility and implications of any proposed change.  The time-scale involved in assessing such requests will vary, depending on the complexity of the issues, but I can assure the Deputies that every effort is made to arrive at decisions as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>An issue which is sometimes involved in proposals for re-routing is that of bringing a service closer to the homes of the children concerned.  This invariable leads to additional cost and often also extends the first pick-up times of the service in the morning and the last set-down time in the evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a principal object of the School Transport Scheme to provide a basic level <Col N="1758" /> of service for children who live long distances from school and which might otherwise experience difficulty in making a regular attendance at school.  Where pupils living off the main route of a service are considered to have a reasonable and adequate level of service it will not usually be possible to approve re-routing to add further mileage to the service.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned to ensure that the system is operated in the most efficient and cost-effective manner possible.  In 1991, a consultants' report prepared for my Department and the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications jointly indicated that Bus Éireann, who are my Department's agent in managing the school transport scheme, was providing a cost-effective service. This report did not, however, treat in detail the possibility of alternative locally-based arrangements.  A second consultants' report was commissioned in 1992 by my predecessor to look at this aspect of the matter and I am now considering this report.</P>

      <P>The pupils in question live in the Collerus (Shelbourne) closed school area and are, therefore, eligible for free school transport to the school of amalgamation only, which is Lauragh National School.</P>
      <P>They are not entitled to free transport to Eyeries National School but may avail of fare-paying transport to that school, subject to certain conditions.  One is that there must be room on an existing service. I understand, however, that there is no room on the bus in question at present.</P>

      <P>This school is at present in rented accommodation at the Presentation Brothers former residence in Douglas.  My Department is aware of the need to provide new accommodation for the school as the Presentation Brothers wish to repossess the building in order to have it refurbished for their own use.  My Department is at present finalising the legal formalities for the purchase of a site for a new school building and the necessary steps have been taken to initiate architectural planning.  Having regard to the necessary timescale to complete architectural planning and obtain planning permission the earliest time by which tenders could be invited would be in the latter part of 1993.  This is one of the projects which will be considered for inclusion in the 1994 capital programme in the light of the allocation made and other commitments and priorities.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Junior cycle syllabuses in all subjects have been revised in the context of the new Junior Certificate Programme which was examined for the first time in 1992.  In the revised programme, provision was made for three levels of syllabuses in Irish &mdash;<Col N="1760" /> Higher, Ordinary and Foundation.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is currently working on the Syllabuses for the Senior Cycle, which at present has two levels of Irish Syllabus, Higher and Ordinary.  In this context, particular attention is being given to the question of Irish.</P>
      <P>I am aware that pupils who took the Foundation Level Irish for the Junior Certificate examination in 1992 may now have a difficulty in taking the Ordinary Syllabus in the Leaving Certificate Course.  I would like to point out, however, that a programme exists &mdash; the Senior Certificate Course &mdash; which has an Irish component in it.  It is open to pupils taking the Leaving Certificate to study Irish from the Senior Certificate Programme if they find that they are unable to pursue the Leaving Certificate Irish at Ordinary Level.  I am asking the NCCA to give priority attention to the Irish syllabuses in their review of subjects for the Senior Cycle.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 23, 28, 40, 82, 88, 96 and 119 together.</P>
      <P>In August 1992, proposals were invited by public advertisement from development consortia for the provision of a site and for the design, construction, financing and management of a national 50-metre swimming pool complex.  A brief for the project was issued on 2 October, 1992 to the 25 consortia who responded to the advertisement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following representations from the Construction Industry Council in relation to the competition conditions, the Department agreed that a number of consortia should be shortlisted and invited <Col N="1762" /> to submit detailed proposals including designs, based on the project brief.  A questionnaire was issued to all consortia to enable the shortlisting process to be completed.</P>
    <P>Twelve consortia responded to the questionnaire by the closing date of 18 December, 1992 and these submissions are under consideration by my Department.</P>
    <P>It would not be feasible at this early stage to say when construction might commence.  It is not envisaged that construction would commence in 1993 and accordingly no provision has been made in the financial Estimates for 1993.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 35, 45, 115 and 253 together. <Col N="1763" /> My views are reflected in the undertaking in the Green Paper on Education reform that discussions will be held with the authorities of fee-paying schools with a view to determining whether or not it would be appropriate for them to join the non fee-paying sector.  In these discussions, regard will be had to whether these schools are fulfilling an educational requirement in their own specific catchment areas, and whether or not this could improve the availability of second-level places in their area.</P>
      <P>In the case of those schools which continue to charge fees, discussions will be held with their authorities on the extent to which they would be in a position to introduce reforms that I consider desirable such as the establishment of Boards of Management, community use of buildings, non-selective admission policy and full financial reporting.</P>
      <P>State funding to fee-charging schools in 1992 amounted to about £25 million, of which about £23 million was in teachers salaries.  The remaining £2 million covers items such as minor equipment grants, grants for orchestras etc.</P>

      <P>There are a range of measures in place to relieve hardship from examination fees.  These include:</P>
      <P>&mdash;waiver of the course fee of £100 for repeat Leaving Certificate school candidates whose parents or guardians are medical card holders.</P>
      <P>&mdash;allieviation of examination fees in the case of any pupil attending school who is experiencing particular hardship.  The amount of the reduction in the case of any individual pupil concerned under this scheme is determined at the discretion of the school authorities subject to the total amount of such deduction not exceeding the specified amount allocated to each school.  For the purposes of the scheme a pupil in need may be defined as a child from a home where genuine hardship exists because of unemployment, prolonged illness of parent, large family with inadequate means, single parent, more than one child from same family doing the Certificate Examinations, or other circumstances that would indicate a similar degree of domestic financial hardship.</P>
      <P>The Central Application Office is a private company.  Accordingly, I have no direct responsibility for, or involvement in its operations, including setting the level of the application fee.  But I am satisfied that it is an efficient operation. Any relief for needy applicants would have to be by way of a direct exchequer subvention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present package of measures applying to second level fees costs almost £400,000.  The cost of increasing the eligibility <Col N="1767" /> for assistance would depend on the criteria used.  For example, if examination entry fees were abolished for pupils whose parents were medical card holders the cost would be about £1.7 million.</P>
    <P>Given the many competing demands for resources within the education sector I am anxious that all expenditures be as effective as possible.  However, I am committed to use the resources at my disposal to combat disadvantage and if I am persuaded that the examination fees represent a barrier to educational access for disadvantaged pupils I will be open to proposals to review and to improve the existing package of measures. However, I will have to emphasise that I would also need to be convinced that this was the most effective way of spending the money involved to combat disadvantage.</P>

      <P>Where access to education services is concerned, I would regard any individual or group as being disadvantaged if, for socio-economic reasons or because of handicap or disability, they are in any way impeded in participating in and benefiting fully from the normally available range of educational services.</P>
      <P>The Programme for a Partnership Government attached particular importance to the need to address educational disadvantage in its variety of forms and the Deputy is correct in noting that it is my firm intenion to target extra resources in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed, as far as the particularly difficult area of socio-economic disadvantage is concerned, I am pleased to announce that an additional 80 ex-quota teaching posts will be made available to <Col N="1768" /> primary schools in disadvantaged areas with effect from September, 1993.</P>
    <P>The procedures for selecting recipient schools for ex-quota posts have to-date been based on a range of socio-economic criteria agreed by a Working Party comprised of representatives of my Department, the INTO and schools' management.  The factors taken into account have included the incidence of unemployment, Local Government housing and Medical Card holders among the parents of the children concerned. Account has also been taken of the views of my Department's Inspectorate on the relative levels of need between schools and the prevailing pupil-teacher ratios.</P>
    <P>In the context of the proposed allocation of the 80 additional posts to disadvantaged schools, this Working Party is being reconvened to consider what, if any, refinements might be desirable in the arrangements for determining disadvantage.</P>
    <P>As is the case with schools currently designated as disadvantaged, any new schools included in the distribution of the 80 posts will also receive an additional capitation grant at the rate of £17 per pupil.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25, 104, and 105 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies will be aware, important and significant changes in relation to the eligibility of mature students for financial support, to pursue third level studies, were introduced in 1992.</P>
      <P>The changes were designed to facilitate the access of older students to third level education by removing legal and financial obstacles in their path.</P>
      <P>The essence of the changes were:</P>
      <P>(1)  Mature students who secure a place in a third level institution are automatically considered to meet the academic requirements for the award of a grant.  Previously a student was not legally eligible for a grant unless they had a prescribed level of attainment in the Leaving Certificate,</P>
      <P>and</P>
      <P>(2)  Mature students are now assessed on the basis of their incomes (and, if applicable, their spouses' incomes) rather than on their parents' income which had been the case hitherto.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These changes have been widely welcomed. They, of course, recognise the importance of ensuring a &ldquo;second-chance&rdquo; opportunity for adults to pursue third level education at various stages of their lives.  They are no longer penalised <Col N="1771" /> because they did not proceed straight to college from secondary school or indeed because they did not complete the leaving certificate.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated in reply to earlier questions, my Department is currently reviewing the operation of the student support schemes, taking account of the changes introduced last year.</P>
    <P>In this context and in the context of the commitment in the Programme for Government to improve access to third level, I will address any further improvements which are necessary and possible to facilitate mature students pursuing third level studies.</P>

      <P>Schemes of conciliation and arbitration for teachers have been in operation since the fifties.  The present scheme was agreed in 1973 and has by and large worked well as a means of dealing with claims and proposals from the teacher unions.  However, claims for improvements in conditions of service, other than pay and allowances, are not covered under the terms of the scheme. I consider that the absence of conditions of service from the ambit of the scheme is unsatisfactory because it means that all claims involving teachers' pay and conditions are not addressed at the same forum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a more general note my colleague, the Minister for Finance, indicated in his recent budget speech that the Government is totally committed to changing the public service pay determination system. He pointed out that we intend, through discussions with the public service unions, to press forward during 1993 with the introduction of a new system which would be more transparent and operate on assessment criteria which, while being fair to staff, would be responsive to the <Col N="1772" /> interests of the Government and the community as taxpayers.  This issue will form part of the agenda for the ongoing discussions with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions which have commenced following an invitation from the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>The Programme for a Partnership Government reflects the Government's strong commitment to addressing the needs of socio-economically disadvantaged children in national schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary mechanism for addressing these needs is the disadvantaged areas <Col N="1774" /> scheme which provides special extra teaching assistance and extra funding to schools in designated areas of disadvantage. At present under this scheme, a total of 208 primary schools have the services of 225 additional ex-quota teaching posts.  The schools in question also receive supplementary capitation grants at a rate of £17 per pupil.</P>
    <P>In addition to the above supports, certain disadvantaged schools are included in the Home-School-Community Liaison Project which seeks to encourage greater parental and local community involvement in children's education at local level.  To-date, a total of 45 locally based co-ordinators have been put in place covering 80 schools.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that these measures constitute a valuable mechanism for assisting disadvantaged children at national school level.  I have therefore decided to allocate a further 80 ex-quota teaching posts to the disadvantaged areas scheme with effect from September, 1993.  I also propose allocating additional posts to the Home-School-Liaison Programme to facilitate an extension of this programme to other disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>I have also stated that I propose targeting for the disadvantaged some of the extra money available this year to increase the capitation grant.  An additional £600,000 will be allocated in this way in the current year.  I am conscious also of the needs of pupils who may be disadvantaged in schools which are not designated as being in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>It is not easy to make specific provision for the disadvantaged outside of school-based schemes.  These pupils can, however, best be helped by improved remedial teaching services, greater home-school links, reduced class sizes, the development of the schools' psychological service and more effective schools generally.  Individual pupils are also helped through the grant scheme for free books for needy pupils.  The Deputy will be aware that I am committed, under the Programme for Partnership Government, to improvements under these headings.</P>

      <P>Remedial teacher posts are allocated on the basis of priority of need as indicated by the information collected from schools.  It is this level of need, rather than any question of location, which determines allocations and the appropriateness of allocations are subject to ongoing review.</P>
      <P>In the primary school system one of the results down the years of determining allocations on the basis of need was that large schools in urban areas ranked as higher priorities.  According as the available resources were increased over the years however, smaller schools and, in particular, groups of small schools in rural areas, were allocated these posts. In the last allocation of 80 remedial posts in 1991, 220 of the 240 schools which benefited were outside the Dublin-Cork-Limerick city areas.  The likelihood is that this trend will continue.</P>
      <P>In the case of post-primary schools, over two-thirds of the schools to which remedial teachers have been allocated are situated outside urban areas.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33 and 98 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1776" /> The question of the provision of a new second level school in the Riverstown-Glanmire area of County Cork has been the subject of detailed and continuous review in my Department in recent years. The most recent review revealed that the provision of a new second level school in the area is not warranted at present. However, my Department will continue to monitor the situation in the light of the most up to date statistics available on demographic trends, housing developments and primary school enrolments.</P>
    <P>Following on submissions made to the Taoiseach and to the Tánaiste during the election campaign I recently met a deputation from the Glanmire-Riverstown second level school action committee.</P>

      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy is referring to the design, finance and build pilot-scheme initiated in 1988 which involved four second level school building projects.  Two of these projects, Castlerea and Cashel community schools, did not proceed as design, finance and build contracts for technical reasons.  In the case of Newbridge college extension the financial proposals received from the lowest tenderer were unacceptable.  The fourth project, Newcastle West secondary school, has been completed and is under evaluation.</P>

However, a submission on remedial educational <Col N="1778" /> needs in the Galway area generally was made to a former Minister for Education by an organisation called the remedial education action group.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 46, 58, 69 and 108 together.  I am circulating to the Deputies a statement outlining a range of programmes of initial vocational education and training and infrastructural development operated by my Department within the context of the current EC-funded Community Support Framework.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Insofar as the Deputies' questions relate to the provision of the Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-1997, they will be aware that the Government is committed to ensuring that the respective roles of the Departments of Education and Enterprise and Employment <Col N="1782" /> will be defined more clearly in relation to vocational education and training to ensure a better service.</P>
    <P>The Programme further provides for rationalisation of the wide range of training and employment schemes operated by my Department and FÁS so as to respond better to the needs of local employers, workers and job-seekers.  In this context, the House will be aware that an Action Group, representative of the Education and Training sectors, is at present examining the issues involved including the establishment of a National Education and Training Certification Board.  I expect this Action Group will submit proposals for consideration by the respective Ministers, within the next three months.</P>
    <P>A National Development Plan is in preparation and the Deputies can be assured that my Department's proposals for inclusion in this Plan adequately take account of the provisions of the Programme for Government, of the proposals in the Culliton/Industrial Review Policy Review Group Report and of the recommendations of the Moriarty Task Force on the implementation of those proposals.</P>
    <P>My Department's role will be one of contributing to the development of a coherent national system of vocational education and training to the highest international standards.  This objective will be a significant factor in the preparation of the White Paper on Education which I hope to publish later this year.</P>

      <P>I have already dealt with the general matter of class size in my reply to Priority Question Number 5.</P>
      <P>Up to 31 August 1992, the staffing in the Central Model Infants School consisted of a principal and three assistant teachers together with a concessionary post under the special scheme of teaching assistance for schools in disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>The post of third assistant was discontinued on 31 August 1992, as the enrolment at the school had fallen below that required for the retention of the post.  However, the teacher concerned claimed exemption from panel re-deployment on grounds of maternity.</P>
      <P>That exemption expires on 24 June 1993 but, in view of the exceptional circumstances of this school, I will be considering the question of whether the school may qualify for a remedial post under the allocation of such posts this year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 74 and 89 together.</P>
      <P>There are two second-level schools in Ballincollig, i.e. Ballincollig Community School and Colaiste Choilm (Community College).  The total capacity of the two schools is 1,440 pupil places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to a recent request from the Management Authorities of the two schools and in the light of the likely future demand for places in the area, the question of increased provision for second-level education in Ballincollig has been under consideration in my Department. All the evidence available to my Department <Col N="1788" /> indicates that extra provision will be required to ensure that adequate places will be available for pupils from the primary schools in the catchment area who are seeking admission to the Ballincollig Schools in 1993-94 and subsequent school years.  Accordingly, arrangements are being made in my Department to have Phase I of this provision in place, at the Community College, for September 1993.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Deputy's statement that a number of pupils have been refused entry to the Community College, I would like to point out that intake policy is primarily a matter for school management subject to acceptable criteria being applied.  My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that in each postprimary centre sufficient accommodation is available to satisfy the overall demand for pupil places.  I am satisfied that the provision being made in this case will be adequate to meet the future needs of the area.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to express my own and my Department's appreciation of the initiative taken by the authorities of the Community School and the Community College in relation to the formation of a Sub-Committee representative of the Boards of the two schools in order to regulate the future intake into both schools.</P>

The allocation of teachers to post-primary schools will continue to be determined by reference to the number of pupils enrolled.  Requests from school authorities for additional accommodation to cater for increased enrolments will be considered favourably by my Department.  In the allocation of teachers and the provision of accommodation account will be taken of the fact that the increase in enrolments arising from the six year cycle option will be temporary as it will be offset by a declining post-primary school intake due to a fall in the birth rate.</P>

    <P>I am concerned to bring order to the process by which major building projects to proceed each year are selected. Accordingly I have instructed my Department to establish a system whereby major projects will be regularly listed in order of priority by reference to clearly defined criteria of need.  The objective would be to achieve a consensus among all interested parties &mdash; the Department, school management organisations, teachers' organisations, parents' organisations on a transparent and fair system which will determine the major school building projects to be released each year having regard to the resources available.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 92 and 263 together.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to improving the access of all students to third-level education in the context of increased resources under the new Structural Funds.</P>
      <P>I will be considering how most effectively to achieve this improved access and I will be placing special emphasis on facilitating the entry of students from disadvantaged backgrounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My approach to ensuring greater <Col N="1794" /> access to third-level for students from disadvantaged backgrounds will encompass a number of strategies including: increasing retention up to the end of second-level through curricular initiatives and the development of support services in schools, e.g. student counselling and guidance services; tackling &ldquo;out-of-school&rdquo; factors, particularly, for example, through the development of home-school liaison in disadvantaged areas; further building on links between universities and second-level schools in disadvantaged areas in collaboration with the institutions; encouraging and supporting institutions in the development of access courses for students who require special assistance in making the transfer to third-level.  I am not convinced that the abolition of all fees at third-level is the most effective way of achieving greater access to third-level, particularly from the lower income groups who are currently under represented at third-level.  I believe that the resource needed for such an initiative can be more effectively utilised in targeted interventions aimed at students from disadvantaged backgrounds. This I believe is the more effective way to redress the current imbalance in participation rates and the most effective use of resources rather than a blanket abolition of all fees.</P>

      <P>Everyone will agree that teachers and pupils need to be provided with a reasonable working and learning environment in good quality accommodation, taking account of issues such as the demands of a modern curriculum, the changing nature of teaching and learning resources and the need to adapt styles of pupil learning.</P>
      <P>Despite the investment over the years, much of which was needed to cater for increasing numbers, the condition of a great many schools leaves much to be desired.  In recognition of this, the programme for Government states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will allocate an increased amount in each of the next five years to implement a planned programme of <Col N="1796" /> replacing or refurbishing sub-standard school buildings.</P>
    <P>As evidence of this commitment, the 1993 capital allocation for primary and post-primary schools represents an increase of £6.9 million or 19 per cent over the 1992 expenditure.  This increased allocation has enabled me to allow 43 major national school building projects to proceed to construction in 1993 as well as 15 major post-primary projects and 18 substantial emergency and minor post-primary schemes.</P>
    <P>Experience since taking office has convinced me of the need for a more orderly approach to the process by which major building projects are selected for release to construction each year.  It is my intention to have future decisions on the progress of major projects through the architectual planning process up to the signing of a contract based on objective criteria related to relevant educational, building and financial factors.  I also consider it desireable that school authorities be made aware, in an open and transparent manner, of the position of their particular building projects at the various stages.  As a first step, I have, in a separate written reply to Question No. 164 of yesterday's date, provided details of the major projects which will commence in 1993 under the primary and post-primary building programmes.  My intention is to build on this by disclosing the criteria on which projects are selected and prioritised and advanced through the planning process and then indicate on a regular basis where individual projects stand in relation to these criteria.</P>

      <P>I do not accept that the extent of substandard accommodation is anywhere near the proportion implied by the Deputy in his question.  Such a situation would not accord with the knowledge on the condition of schools within my Department nor with the level of capital expenditure at £84 million which has taken place over the last five years involving upwards of 300 major projects and thousands of minor projects.  Between major projects and minor projects it is estimated that the National Schools Capital Programme for 1993 will impact on 45 per cent of all national schools in the form of projects in course of planning or already underway.  As provided for in the Programme for Government there will be increased capital expenditure over the five years 1993-1997 which will be directed systematically at the most deserving cases in order to eliminate as far as possible unacceptable standards of accommodation.</P>

Permission is granted subject to acceptance by the Governments concerned that certain conditions must be met, the most important of which are that the relevant aircraft are unarmed, carry no arms, ammunition or explosives and do not engage in intelligence gathering and that the flights in question do not form part of military exercises or operations.</P>
      <P>Application for permission to land is made by the Embassy of the applicant country accredited to Ireland.

      <P>I am aware of the report on the situation of human rights including the situation of the Baha'i community, in the Islamic Republic of Iran, which has been presented to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights <Col N="1804" /> by the Special Representative, Professor Reynaldo Galindo Pohl.</P>
      <P>The Government have already taken steps to press for the improvement of the human rights of the Baha'is.  Ireland is a cosponsor of the Resolution on the Situation of Human Rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran, which was adopted by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights on 10 March 1993.</P>
      <P>That Resolution expresses concern at the special representative's criticisms of the human rights situation in the Islamic Republic of Iran, including discriminatory treatment of groups of citizens because of their religious beliefs, and singles out the Baha'i community for particular mention in this respect.</P>
      <P>The Resolution endorses the special representative's view that the international monitoring of the human rights situation in the Islamic Republic of Iran should be continued.  The Resolution also called on the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to cooperate fully with the special representative and made clear its dissatisfaction that the authorities there have not permitted him to visit the country for more than a year.  The Commission accordingly renewed his mandate and asked him to report again on the situation to the United Nations General Assembly next Autumn and to the Commission itself next Spring.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the joint Ireland/Northern Ireland INTERREG Programme, which was approved on 25 July 1991 and runs to the end of 1993, the EC is providing 76 million ECU, approximately £58 million, in 1991 prices in Structural Fund assistance towards expenditure under the Programme in eligible border areas in the North and South.  Assistance is provided under the programme for both cross Border projects and projects on each side of the Border carried out within the joint planning framework of the programme <Col N="1807" />&mdash; the great majority of projects would fall into the latter category.</P>
    <P>The programme covers expenditure in the areas of tourism; agriculture, fisheries and forestry; human resources; environmental protection, and regional development (local community development, economic development and infrastructure).</P>
    <P>The eligible area comprises the counties of Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan and Louth and all of Northern Ireland except Belfast.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Jobs Fund is comprised of three mutually supportive elements and provides for a total of £260 million in funding during 1993 to promote recovery and sustainable job creation.</P>
      <P>The first head under which the Government is providing substantially higher levels of resources is in respect of the 1993 Exchequer-funded element of the Public Capital Programme, excluding Cohesion Fund related provisions, which will increase by £87 million over the 1992 outturn.  This £87 million will be fully taken into account in the Voted capital allocations to be included in 1993 Revised Estimates Volume and, accordingly, it will be subject to the usual Government statutory, administrative and accounting procedures applicable to all supply services expenditure as approved by the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most significant element of the 1993 Jobs Fund provision is in respect of Cohesion Fund related expenditure.  A total of £148 million in additional funding will be provided under this head in 1993 to aid projects in the areas of environment and transport infrastructure.  Of this <Col N="1808" /> £148 million, £82.8 million is incorporated into the Exchequer PCP and, as such, will also be subject to the usual procedural requirements governing the disbursement of Voted monies approved by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The non Exchequer Cohesion Fund provision of just over £65 million will, in the first instance, be funded by the individual commercial State sponsored bodies out of their own resources pending recoupment from the EC.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Cohesion Fund, I might just mention that this Fund is provided for in the Treaty on European Union.  As the EC Regulations to establish the Fund cannot be adopted until that Treaty is ratified, the European Council at Edinburgh decided that a regulation, based on the existing EEC Treaty, which would establish a Cohesion Fund interim instrument should be adopted before 1 April 1993.  The EC General Affairs Council of 8 March 1993 adopted a common position of agreement on the interim instrument.  Further technical work will continue in preparation for the next Council with a view to adoption by 1 April 1993.  Negotiation of the permanent Cohesion Fund regulation to establish the Fund under the Treaty on European Union is close to completion and the regulation should be adopted in due course.</P>
    <P>While all the detailed arrangements at national level are not yet finalised, expenditure on projects to be aided under the interim instrument and the Cohesion Fund will, as with existing Structural Fund expenditure, be administered by the Departments and associated State bodies in whose areas of competence the projects will arise.  In general, no special statutory arrangements will be required.</P>
    <P>The final area in which the Government is providing additional resources in the context of the overall Jobs Fund provision in 1993 is in respect of the establishment of the county enterprise partnership boards.  An allocation of £25 million for spending via the CEPB's this year is being included in the Vote for Enterprise and Employment to be published in the 1993 Revised Estimates <Col N="1809" /> Volume and as a voted expenditure item will again be subject to standard Government statutory and accounting procedures.</P>

      <P>There are 375 persons currently participating in the Part-Time Job Incentive Scheme of which 20 reside in County Mayo.  The scheme is designed to allow long term unemployed persons to work part-time for up to 24 hours a week while receiving a flat rate allowance instead of their unemployment payments.  The allowances are currently £36.50 for a single person and £60 for a married person with a dependent spouse.  They will be increased from July next in line with the general increase in social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>I am not happy with the level of takeup of the scheme.  Schemes of this kind which are designed to facilitate the transition from unemployment to work have considerable potential and I am looking at ways in which they can be further and more effectively developed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very concerned with all aspects of the problem of under-age drinking and all possible steps are being taken to keep the problem under control.</P>
      <P>A wide range of controls designed to tackle the problem of under-age drinking were included in the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988.  In essence, the Act is designed to make it as difficult as possible for persons under 18 years of age to lawfully purchase alcohol, or to be in possession of it or to consume it other than in a private residence.</P>
      <P>I am continuing to monitor carefully the operation of the controls contained in the Act.  Overall there are some indications that the controls are having the desired effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, legislation alone cannot be expected to solve the problem of under-age drinking.  A broader approach, having regard to the social, cultural and economic factors involved, is required.  It is for this reason that I am anxious to promote and encourage the idea of community based initiatives and I have encouraged the Garda Síochána to become involved in organising and assisting such local initiatives.  The Garda in co-operation with local groups are playing a prominent role in organising local <Col N="1815" /> Programmes to deal with the abuse of alcohol and other substances by young people and they are willing to help with such local initiatives wherever these are contemplated.  In this context I would mention there were 47 voluntary identity card schemes in operation throughout the country last year.</P>
    <P>Education of young people about alcohol is also very important and in this regard I would refer the Deputy to the information provided by my colleague the Minister for Health in his reply to a question by Deputy Connor yesterday.</P>

      <P>All offenders are strip searched on committal to prison and on discharge. They are also searched on departure and return from court, hospitals and periods of temporary release.  In addition offenders are selected on a random basis for strip searching after visits.</P>
      <P>The procedures governing searches of offenders are contained in the Rules for the Government of Prisons (1947) and the General Prison Regulations (1953). The searching of an offender is conducted with due regard to decency and self respect and in as seemly a manner as is consistent with the necessity to discover any concealed article.  No offender is stripped or searched in front of another offender.  For the actual search the offender first removes her outer garments and hands them to the officer to be searched.  She is then issued with a dressing gown or nightdress whereupon she removes her underclothes for searching. Body orifices are not searched.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not possible to give the number of strip searches carried out in 1992 but <Col N="1816" /> some idea may be inferred from the fact that 534 female prisoners were committed to custody in 1992.</P>

      <P>A number of special measures were introduced on a pilot basis in the 12 areas designated under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> area based strategy to combat long term unemployment. One of the measures is the Community Employment Development Programme which operates on the same basis as the social employment scheme but participants retain their secondary benefits and a training module is provided for participants where feasible.</P>

    <P>I am very conscious that extending one person's period on the scheme would be at the expense of someone else awaiting an opportunity to participate in it.  I am accordingly having the whole question <Col N="1822" /> of extensions examined with a view to establishing revised guidelines for FÁS on the issue.  I hope to have this examination completed shortly.  Individual applications for extensions will then be a day to day matter for FÁS to consider within the revised guidelines.</P>

      <P>The EC structural fund initiative PRISMA (Preparing Regional Industry for the Single Market) was launched by the Commission in February 1991.  Ireland's Operational Programme to take advantage of the funds available from PRISMA was adopted by a Commission Decision on 5 December 1991.  This decision allocated a total of 9.382 mecu (or £7.22 million) to Ireland to support infrastructural development work in four highly specialised fields in the period 1992/1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The four objectives of PRISMA in Ireland are: the improvement of calibration and metrology infrastructure and services; the improvement of third party testing and certification services; to increase or enhance the information available to firms regarding business opportunities in EC public procurement markets; and to provide some additional <Col N="1823" /> support to previously protected sectors (eg. textiles, clothing and footwear) to enhance their future competitiveness.</P>
    <P>Two particularly substantial and important projects are being supported under PRISMA &mdash; the modernisation of Ireland's Legal Metrology Service and the European Procurement Information Network (EPIN) being developed at ESBI Computing Ltd.  Together these projects account for 76 per cent of the allocations made from the PRISMA fund by the Technical Selection Committee established under the OP.  A further 15 projects are also being assisted.</P>
    <P>The Legal Metrology Service has not evolved significantly since its establishment in the last century and is, at present, inadequate to meet the needs of a modern industrial economy.  The OPIN project, in turn, is intended to base in Ireland a comprehensive and commercial computer network bringing together the information needs of suppliers, electricity utilities throughout Europe and the European Commission in the context of the newly liberalised EC public procurement markets.</P>
    <P>I am hopeful that, by using PRISMA funds in this way, the maximum benefit for Ireland can be achieved from this small EC initiative.  The metrology work and that on public procurement should help to improve the status of Irish exports and the potential access of Irish suppliers to the new commercial possibilities of the Single Market.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 150, 151 and 152 together.</P>
      <P>European Commission Decisions on the Irish operational programmes to implement the Community Initiatives &mdash; Euroform, Horizon and NOW &mdash; were taken in the latter part of 1991 and the beginning of 1992.  The financial allocations under the three Initiatives apply to the period 1992 to 1994 and are outlined in the tabular statement set out below.</P>
      <P>Projects are supported to pilot innovative training on a transnational basis. A brief description of the focus of each of the Initiatives is set out below.  The numbers of projects included under each of the three Initiatives and expenditure of Structural Fund moneys up to the end of 1992 are also indicated.  Projects receive up to 65 per cent of their funding from the Structural Funds (mainly the European Social Fund) and they must themselves source the required matching funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Human Resource Community Initiatives, Euroform, Horizon and NOW, are a particularly innovatory form of Structural Fund investment.  They have an important role to play in the development of vocational training interventions in Ireland and the rest of the European Community.  Horizon and NOW target groups which may not traditionally have had access to Structural Funds assistance &mdash; the disabled, disadvantaged <Col N="1825" /> people and women.  Euroform focuses on innovation in training.</P>
    <P>Under these Initiatives, a wider group of organisations are in receipt of European Social Fund moneys than has traditionally been the case.  They include voluntary organisations, trade unions, professional institutes as well as statutory education and training agencies.</P>
    <P>The European Commission has not yet decided on the future of Euroform, Horizon and NOW.  From a national <Col N="1826" /> perspective, I consider that these programmes represent a significant and welcome development.  They direct Community funds to the local level and allow for the piloting of new approaches to training across a very wide spectrum. Accordingly, I have strongly made the case to the European Commission for the continuation of these three Initatives and for the provision of necessary funding in the next Community Support Framework for Ireland.</P>

    <P Just="Center">Euroform Community Initiative</P>
    <P>The Euroform Community Initiative concerns transnational projects in the area of new qualifications, new skills and new employment opportunities induced by the completion of the internal market and technological change.  The European Social Fund allocation for Euroform up to the end of 1994 is £10.6 million.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Projects</i>
    </P>
    <P>At the end of December 1992, 64 projects were approved under Euroform. These projects will fully take up the Community funding available.  Promoters must source matching funding for their projects amounting to 35 per cent of the total cost.  The projects cover a wide variety of areas, ranging from qualifications in arts administration to distance learning for the long term unemployed to local tourism responses in the West of Ireland. Fifty different organisations in all parts of Ireland are involved in the delivery of projects.</P>
    <P>The Euroform Initiative is being used in Ireland to pilot new kinds of training and new responses to the problem of unemployment.  In many cases, voluntary organisations which have not had significant funding to date have been given the opportunity to test their approaches to training.</P>
    <P Just="Center">NOW Community Initiative</P>
    <P>The NOW Community Initiative promotes equal opportunities for women in the field of employment and vocational training.  All projects supported under this programme have a transnational aspect &mdash; they are linked with compatible counterparts in other EC member states. The total EC contribution to Ireland under NOW in the period 1992-194 is IR£4.8 million.  The EC funds are primarily contributed by the European Social Fund with a small contribution from the European Regional Development Fund.  Matching funding at the rate of 36 per cent may be sourced either publicly or privately.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Projects</i>
    </P>
    <P>To date 29 projects have been <Col N="1827" /> approved for funding under NOW. Another seven projects are at the technical assistance phase.  These projects will fully take up the Community funding available.  Both community groups, voluntary organisations and statutory training bodies are benefiting from the ESF assistance available under NOW.  While NOW is providing voluntary organisations with the opportunity to directly implement ESF co-financed activity, it provides statutory training organisations with the resources to target their activities in the area of positive action programmes for women.  Approximately 3,000 women will have benefited from the training and advisory services supported by NOW.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Horizon Community Initiative</P>
    <P>The Horizon Community Initiative provides structural funds for innovative projects involving transnational partnerships and aimed at assisting the disabled and disadvantaged.  The programme seeks to facilitate the social and economic integration of its participants into the labour market in particular and society in general.  The total aid allocation for Ireland, following a significant reinforcement of the programme in 1992, is £14.4 million from the European Social Fund and £1 million from the European Regional Development Fund to the end of 1993.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Projects</i>
    </P>
    <P>Ninety-four projects have been approved to date and they will fully take up the Structural Funds available.  It is anticipated that projects will have a multiplier effect, creating sustainable employment and that innovatory activity undertaken will serve as models for future developments in the provision of services to the disabled and the disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>Funding is provided to successful applicants at a rate of 65 per cent.  An important criteria for selection is the ability of any particular organisation to provide matching funding of the balance of 35 <Col N="1828" /> per cent.  The Horizon Initiative, and the other Community Initiatives, have broken new ground in providing funding to both voluntary, community and statutory organisations and, as a result, the number of direct beneficiaries of funding from the European Social Fund has been greatly extended in Ireland.</P>

      <P>
        <i>The Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-1997</i> states that the review of the Conditions of Employment legislation dating from the 1930s will lead to new or amending legislation to bring the relevant Acts into line with modern employment conditions taking account of the EC Directive on Working Time expected to be adopted in 1993.</P>
      <P>The Conditions of Employment legislation is comprised of six Acts dating from the 1930s which regulate working time in industry and in the retail trade. This legislation is largely informed by conditions and consideraions which were current more than 50 years ago.  A number of provisions, in the interim, have been repealed or altered by subsequent enactments and certain of those that remain are no longer of relevance in a contemporary context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In pursuance of a commitment in the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, the Acts have been under review in my Department to determine the options which need to be considered for the repeal or amendment of the legislation. However, in tandem with this review, consideration is being given to a proposed EC Directive on the Organisation of Working Time.  It is understood that this Directive will be on the agenda of the Social Affairs Council for the adoption of a common position next month. If adopted, the Directive will form the basis for a new framework for the regulation <Col N="1830" /> of working time in most employments.</P>
    <P>The introduction of such a regulatory framework would require implementing national legislation and a consequent replacement of the existing Conditions of Employment legislation.  It will be apparent, therefore, that the timing for the introduction of new or amending legislation on the regulation of working time is linked to the adoption of the Working Time Directive and the specified dates for the impelmentation of that Directive. It is not possible to be more specific on this issue in advance of the final adoption of that Directive.</P>

      <P>The powers and functions of the proposed Employment Protection Unit are the subject of wideranging consultations between my Department, various State agencies and the social partners.  These consultations are designed, firstly, to assemble all relevant information about services already available which can assist firms in difficulty with a view to the preservation of employment and to identify areas in which additional services might be provided. Secondly, the consultations are aimed at canvassing and discussing ideas and suggestions as to how the new Employment Protection Unit should operate in close liasion with &mdash; but not duplicating &mdash; facilities offered by other bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The series of consultations will be concluded very shortly.  I will then consider, in the light of all information and ideas which have emerged, not only from those consultations but also from inquiries about procedures in operation in other <Col N="1831" /> countries, what the powers and the functions should be.</P>
    <P>I do not anticipate that legislation will be required, at least in the initial stages of operation of the unit.</P>
    <P>I am fully conscious of the need to establish the Employment Protection Unit as quickly as possible and the whole matter is one of priority for my Department. At the same time, I believe that the unit should be established after prior research and careful planning so as to ensure its effectiveness as an instrument in helping to save jobs at risk.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should stress that until such time as the unit is formally established &mdash; and that will not be very long delayed &mdash; the services of my Department and the relevant State agencies are available to provide all possible advice and assistance to firms which may find themselves in difficulties with consequential threats to employment.</P>

Those meetings were attended by representatives of the social partners, the Department of Education, FÁS and my own Department of Enterprise and Employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the initiative is to devise a training system incorporating in a coherent manner the best of what is <Col N="1833" /> already available and offering standards based training leading to national certification. The system would in particular provide opportunities for those who leave school but do not proceed to third level education to acquire additional skills which would equip them to compete for existing jobs and to contribute to improvements in the competitiveness and productivity of enterprises employing them.</P>
    <P>Details of the likely cost of the Scheme have yet to be determined.</P>
    <P>It would be premature to presume that legislation will necessarily arise in connection with the introduction of a new training system.

      <P>Local authorities are not required to report to my Department the action taken by them to review or test their plans for dealing with major emergencies. However, information available in my Department indicates that, in the past year or so, reviews were either completed or were being carried out by the great majority of the county councils and county borough corporations, and that exercises of various types to test their plans were undertaken by Dublin, Dún Laoghaire and Waterford Corporations and Dublin, Kerry, Limerick, Offaly, Roscommon, Wexford and Wicklow County Councils.</P>

      <Col N="1837" /> Since 1985, the main emergency services &mdash; local authorities, health boards and Gardaí &mdash; have put in place major emergency plans based on a common framework for co-ordinated response. The contents of the plans are generic in character and are therefore capable of being applied to all types of emergencies.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the number of households accepted by the housing authorities in County Mayo for inclusion in the assessments of needs carried out under section 9 of the Housing Act, 1988 at 31 March 1991.  The results of the assessments are published in the Department's Annual Housing Statistics Bulletin 1991, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library.  A further assessment is being carried out by housing authorities to determine the position at 31 March 1993.</P>
      <P>The housing policies set out in the Programme for a Partnership Government, particularly the greatly increased programme of 3,500 new local authority housing &ldquo;starts&rdquo; in 1993 and the commitment to an appropriate long term building programme, together with the implementation of the various schemes in &ldquo;A Plan for Social Housing&rdquo;, will make a significant impact on reducing pressure on housing lists in County Mayo and elsewhere.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Wexford):</i> Details of prosecutions under the Litter Act, 1982 are set in the following table.  My Department has not yet completed the compilation of information for 1992.</P>
      <P>Litter is one of the most persistent environmental problems and continuing action is needed to prevent and limit it. The Department of the Environment last year provided considerable support for local clean-up activities by organising a mixed media campaign against litter.  I will consider the possibility of further support in 1993.</P>

      <P>The provision, management and conservation of drinking water supplies is, in the first instance, a matter for individual local authorities.</P>
      <P>Conservation of supplies is a normal feature of the water management strategy of the authorities.  This strategy has been made more effective in recent years in the Dublin area through the provision of a modern telemetry system and metering of supplies to individual large water users.  The watermain rehabilitation scheme in the Ranelagh area which is currently under construction at a cost of £1.5 million is specifically designed to eliminate leakage and conserve supplies.</P>
      <P>My Department continues to liaise with the Dublin authorities on proposals to improve water supply in the region. Construction work has recently been completed on a further stage of the expansion of the Ballymore Eustace treatment works.  The planning of the next phase of the expansion programme for these works, which will increase production capacity to 70 million gallons a day, is being finalised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Work on a further multi-million pound contract has recently commenced on the North City Arterial Watermain to Fairview and Griffith Avenue.  This will improve water supplies and pressure for domestic and commercial users in a large <Col N="1841" /> area of the north city.  The Dublin authorities are also advancing the planning of a number of other schemes, including improvement of the efficiency of the Vartry works and of the Dún Laoghaire distribution system.</P>

      <P>Ireland's STRIDE Operational Programme is directed at developing research, innovation and technological capacity in the four natural resource based areas of Marine, Environment, Forestry and Food by providing an enhanced level of RTD (Research and Technological Development) facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish STRIDE Operational Programme (Science and Technology for Regional Innovation and Development in Europe was approved by the Commission in 1991 and runs until the end of 1993.  The Programme comprises a total funding package of £13.5 million (co-financed by national and European Regional Development Fund funds) of which £8 million is devoted to the marine resource.  All projects benefit from a 75 per cent EC grant aid level providing a total Community aid allocation <Col N="1846" /> of £10.125 million over the full period of the programme.</P>
    <P>The Department's expenditure measures under the STRIDE Programme fall under three principal headings: (1) investment in the Department's fisheries Research Centre to provide essential equipment to support the fishing and aquaculture industries; (2) the provision of specialised equipment for the national research vessel &ldquo;Lough Beltra&rdquo;; and (3) the establishment of a national centre for the management and verification of marine data.</P>
    <P>In addition to measures applicable to my Department, the STRIDE Programme funds other centres of marine expertise: (1) investment in the Martin Ryan Irish Science Institute at UCG to fit out laboratories and facilities in the new Institute and (2) investment in the Coastal Engineering and Resource Management Centre at UCC to equip the hydraulics laboratory and Coastal Management Unit.</P>
    <P>In addition to the Marine sub-Programme some £3.426 million has been allocated to Environmental research measures; £1.024 million to measures on forestry research and £0.677 million to underpin research and development in the Food sector.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the improved research infrastructure which is being put in place under the STRIDE Programme will stimulate development and related job creation in the sectors concerned.</P>

      <P>One of my priorities as Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, is to encourage diversification of species in our forests which means both an increased planting of broadleaves and a diversity of conifer species.  Diversification is important from a number of viewpoints, including the environment, plant health, import substitution, quality, yield and end use.</P>
      <P>The planting of broadleaves is encouraged by a higher level of grant support and the recently introduced Planned Recreational Forestry Scheme for the planting or upgrading of forests with public recreational facilities which specifically requires a minimum of 10 per cent broad-leaf planting.</P>
      <P>Approvals for afforestation grants may also include directions on the specific species to be planted, to take account of the silvicultural and environmental aspects and suitability of sites.</P>

    <P>The projected planting level for 1993 is approximately 24,600 hectares.  I am confident that the overall annual planting target of 30,000 hectares, as set out in the Government's Partnership programme, will be achieved by 1994 and can be maintained at that level to the year 2000, when the total effective forest area will approach 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>While employment statistics are a matter for the Central Statistics Office and not for my Department, I can provide the Deputy with the following information which may be of assistance. However, this information does not include employment in primary or secondary processing of timber.</P>
    <P>There were 1,689 permanent employees in Coillte Teoranta on 31 December 1992.  The gross employment created by the expansion of forestry activity under the Programme for National Recovery up to the end of 1990 was some 1,400 jobs.</P>
    <P>Under the Programme for Economic and Social Progress over 620 full-time job equivalents were created in 1991 and I expect gross job creation in 1992 and 1993 will exceed 500.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to oral questions on Leader on 25 February.  A copy of the information promised to Deputy Deasy on that occasion relating to details of the applications received by my Department under the Leader programme will be provided separately to Deputy Kenny as well as a list of the successful applicants and the amounts of grant approved for them.</P>

    <P>While the Leader programme is a pilot one and has been operating for less than a year it is envisaged that investments under the programme will generate a substantial number of jobs in rural areas.

      <P>An Organic Farming Unit was set up in my Department in 1990 to develop all aspects of organic farming.  The value of output of the sector is estimated to be worth about £1 million per annum and there is considerable potential for expansion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under a Pilot Scheme of Grant Aid for <Col N="1852" /> Investments in Organic Farming Enterprises operated by the Unit, some £88,000 was paid to 32 organic producers, co-ops and firms under this scheme.</P>
    <P>Also the following initiatives have been supported to date at a cost of approximately £536,000.</P>
    <P>(i) the establishment of an organic farming module in UCD's agricultural science degree course.</P>
    <P>(ii)&nbsp; the establishment by Teagasc of an organic research and development programme at Johnstown Castle and training demonstration units at Kildalton College and Mount Bellew Agricultural College.</P>
    <P>(iii) a survey by CBF on the market at home and abroad for organic meat.</P>
    <P>(iv) a SFADCo programme to develop organic farming in the Mid-West region.</P>
    <P>(v) development by the Irish Organic Farmers and Growers Association (IOFGA) of its organisational structures and its promotional and educational activities.</P>
    <P>(vi) an information leaflet and, with Teagasc, a video on organic farming have been produced by the Unit.</P>
    <P>The promotion and development of organic farming will be facilitated by the implementation of EC Regulation 2092/91 on organic farming standards which came into effect on 1 January 1993. This Regulation applies to:</P>
    <P>(i)&nbsp; unprocessed agricultural crops products, and</P>
    <P>(ii)&nbsp; products intended for human consumption composed essentially of one or more ingredients of plant origin.</P>
    <P>Such products may not be labelled as &ldquo;organic&rdquo; unless they comply with the rules of production set out in the Regulation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1853" /> Organic operators i.e. producers, processors and distributors must notify their activities to my Department and submit them to the inspection system set out in the Regulation.</P>
    <P>My Department has approved three private inspection bodies to carry out inspections under the Regulation:</P>
    <P>1.  Irish Organic Farmers and Growers Association (IOFGA).</P>
    <P>2.  Organic Trust Ltd.</P>
    <P>3.  Demeter Standards Ltd.</P>
    <P>Implementation of the Regulation will guarantee that produce, for which consumers pay a premium price, meets minimum EC standards.</P>
    <P>A draft scheme is being prepared in my Department to give effect to the Agri-Environment measure of Common Agricultural Policy reform.  Among the elements being considered for inclusion in this scheme is an incentive payment for farmers who introduce or agree to continue with organic farming methods.</P>

      <P>The question of improving the safety of nuclear installations in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, including Chernobyl, is being co-ordinated at Community level by the EC Commission.  The Commission and all member states are concerned about the dangerous state of Soviet-designed reactors and major technical assistance programmes to address immediate operational safety and technical improvement measures have been put in place.  A multilateral programme by the major economic powers (The G.7) has also been established following the Munich Economic Summit to enhance the safety of such reactors.</P>
      <P>It is clear that certain Soviet-designed reactors, particularly the RBMK type at Chernobyl, are high-risk and should be shut down.  They are being operated at present to supply critical electricity needs.  I understand that the Ukranian Parliament has recently taken a decision to shut down the remaining operating units at Chernobyl.  Replacement electricity stations are coming on stream this year.  Keeping unsafe stations in operation until replaced is not ideal but it is moving in the right direction.</P>
      <P>This country has consistently supported the positive action of the Commission and member states both at political and official level.</P>

      <P>On 1 February 1993, the most recent date for which figures are available, Ireland's oil stocks as reported to the EC were 107 days petrol, 98 days gasoil (also known as diesel) and 144 days heavy fuel oil. The number of days supply held other than by the Irish National Petroleum Corporation was 50 days petrol, 52 days gasoil and 132 days heavy fuel oil.</P>
      <P>Records are kept in compliance with EC and IEA procedures, which do not require that stocks of LPG or jet fuel be recorded, nor is it necessary to make a distinction between operating and strategic stocks.  Kerosene, other than jet fuel, is included in the gasoil figure.</P>

    <P>The performance of oil companies in relation to their stock holding obligations <Col N="1861" /> varies.  However, you may be assured that every effort is being made to improve the performance of those companies which are not meeting their obligations in full at present.</P>
    <P>Ireland currently meets EC and IEA obligations in relation to all specified stock categories and it is my intention that we should continue to do so.  There is, therefore, no need to increase stocks at present.</P>

      <P>Victims of sexual harassment are afforded legal redress under the provisions of the Employment Equality Act, 1977.</P>
      <P>There are no EC Directives or Regulations on the issue of sexual harassment. However, an EC Resolution on the Protection of the Dignity of Men and Women at Work was adopted by the Social Affairs Council during the Irish Presidency of the EC in 1990.  As a result of the Resolution, the European Commission undertook to prepare a Recommendation and a Code of Practice on the subject which were published on 4 December 1991.</P>
      <P>This Recommendation will be taken into consideration in the context of developing proposals to amend employment equality legislation in line with the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government and the response of Government to the recommendations of the Second Commission on the Status of Women, both of which envisage more explicit legal provisions on sexual harassment.</P>

To that end the Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-1997 provides for the enactment of legislation aimed at putting the rights of people with a mental handicap on a statutory basis.  That legislation will also provide a means of redress for people whose rights are ignored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Discussions have already taken place on this matter with the Department of Health.  Further consultation will take place with that Department and with the appropriate representative bodies.  This <Col N="1865" /> process of consultation is necessary to explore what legislative measures may be necessary to vindicate the rights of people with a mental handicap.</P>
    <P>The legislation in question will be enacted during the period of the Programme for a Partnership Government. It is too early to estimate what costs may arise from the proposed legislation.</P>

      <P>In keeping with the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government, legislation is being prepared in my Department which will prohibit discrimination on a wide range of grounds including race, colour and national or ethnic origin.</P>
      <P>This legislation is being brought forward as soon as possible, and in order to achieve early progress I propose to extend the prohibition of discrimination in employment to include these grounds in the current review of employment equality legislation.  Equal Status legislation will follow and will seek to prohibit discrimination in education, the provision of goods, services and facilities and in the disposal of accommodation or other premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In pursuing these legislative measures I will examine the extent to which I can provide for the outlawing of all forms of racial discrimination and thereby enable the ratification by Ireland of the United Nations' International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. In doing so, I expect to build on the work done already by the interdepartmental committee established to examine measures to allow ratification of the UN Convention which has been chaired by the Office of the Attorney <Col N="1866" /> General.  The methods of enforcement and sanctions which might be used will be considered in the context of the preparation of the legislation referred to above.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that there are sufficient long stay beds available for the elderly throughout the country in geriatric hospitals, district hospitals and nursing homes.</P>
      <P>Since the publication of <i>The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly</i> in 1988 health boards are placing greater emphasis on services to maintain elderly people at home and to improve their care in general hospitals.  It is recognised that good home support and respite services and specialist services for the elderly in general hospitals can prevent unnecessary admissions to long stay care.  In the past three years an additional £9 million has been made available to expand home support and respite services and to develop specialist hospital services for the elderly.</P>
      <P>Health boards have used this funding to expand home nursing, home help, respite and day care services and to open departments of medicine of the elderly in general hospitals.  This year, new departments of medicine will open in five more general hospitals, bringing the total number of such departments to 17.  I recognise that, in the Eastern and Southern Health Board areas, the boards rely on contracting and subventing beds in the voluntary and private nursing home sector in order to meet their obligations to the dependent elderly.</P>
      <P>A particular problem arose in the Eastern Health Board area last year and earlier this year in relation to elderly people in general hospitals who required long stay care.  My Department gave additional financial aid amounting to £.05 million to the board to provide additional extended care beds for these patients.</P>

      <P>Since 1991 an amount of £1 million has been included in the health boards' allocations each year to enable them to develop orthodontic services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These special provisions have resulted in considerable improvements in the <Col N="1874" /> number of treatments provided in each board.</P>
    <P>Consultant orthodontists have now been recruited to six of the eight health boards and the other two boards (Midland and North Eastern) have entered into arrangements with private specialists. In addition to their own clinical involvement, the newly recruited consultant orthodontists are in the process of organising and carrying out a programme of training in orthodotic procedures for existing health board dental staff.  This will allow for further increases in treatment levels.  Treatment is currently being provided for over 13,500 children.</P>
    <P>The Government has provided an additional £2 million this year to provide for further improvements in dental services as part of the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i> and a portion of this amount will be allocated to the orthodontic services.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy in relation to the replacement costs of the existing yellow bus fleet is not readily available.</P>
      <P>Bus Éireann has been pursuing a replacement programme for the buses in question for some years now, and the total number of yellow buses in use has been reduced from 798 in 1983 to 455 at present.</P>
      <P>Under its replacement programme, Bus Éireann seeks to replace an average of 60 yellow buses a year through the acquisition of more modern stock. However, the rate at which such replacements can be acquired, and the cost involved at any particular time, will be dictated by the availability of suitable alternative vehicles.</P>

      <P>Arising from the report of the Hamilton Committee on Public Safety and Crowd Control, two Codes of Practice, one dealing with Safety at Sports grounds and the other with Safety at Outdoor Pop Concerts and other Outdoor Musical Events are currently being finalised by an expert committee, following a detailed consultative process with sporting and other interested groups and organisations.

      <P>It is my Department's aim to issue the results of rechecks at the earliest possible date.  In 1992 4,318 applications for a recheck were received of which 4,215 notifications of results were issued on the 15 October with the final 103 results issued shortly afterwards.  This represented a significant improvement in the <Col N="1885" /> situation as pertained in previous years. However, my Department is currently reviewing the system with a view to having rechecks issued even earlier in 1993.</P>
      <P>In regard to places in third level colleges, the position is that it is the practice of third level colleges to facilitate as far as possible candidates who qualify for entry to a particular course as a result of an examination recheck.</P>

      <P>The eligibility of pupils in general for entry to post-primary schools is governed by regulations, but my Department does not have statutory power of control over the admission of individual pupils to a particular post-primary school.  The selection of pupils for admission, and the criteria used for this purpose, are decided by the school mangement authorities in each case.</P>
      <P>I would deprecate the use of tests for the purpose of &ldquo;creaming&rdquo; pupils of higher ability.  The Green Paper, &ldquo;Education for a Changing World&rdquo;, envisages that State-aided post-primary schools will be required, as a condition of funding, to have an admissions policy that will not discriminate on the basis of means, educational level or social background and to provide a comprehensive system of education suitable for a wide ability range.</P>
