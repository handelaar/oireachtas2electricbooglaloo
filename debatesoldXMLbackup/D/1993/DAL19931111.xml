      <P>Today the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Select Committe on Enterprise and Economic Strategy will commence consideration of the Diplomatic and Consular Officers (Provision of Services) Bill, 1993, and the Merchant Shipping (Salvage and Wreck) Bill, 1993.</P>

      <P>The Chair is prepared to allow some latitude at this time but I do expect Members to have regard to the normal procedures.  The matter raised by the Deputy ought to be raised at a more appropriate time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, with respect, the ceremony is on Sunday. I am anxious to know whether the Government will be officially represented. I think the Taoiseach was offering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I was only offering to clarify the position.  As the Deputy well <Col N="1438" /> knows, this matter was the subject of all-party discussions in the early eighties out of which emerged an agreement that all commemorations would take place on one day.  That position has not been altered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to make the point that, at a time when the Government is seeking peace and reconciliation on this island a very strong signal would be sent out by the Government being represented at the ceremony on Sunday next.  I see no good reason the Taoiseach could not arrange for that.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach something that is in order in the hope that, when he is on his feet, he will answer the question I have just put to him.  The circulation of 32 Bills has been promised for this side of Christmas, of which I understand six only have been published to date.  Will the Taoiseach say when the remainder will be published? For instance, can he indicate what Bills will be published next week?  Perhaps, when he is on his feet, he might answer also the other question I put to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has set out the list of legislation to be published this session and that task is being pushed ahead with all possible speed.  It was not intended to finish 32 Bills but to publish them.  We will continue to do the best we can in that regard.</P>

He said it would be published before the end of the present session, which is not much of an improvement on anything we have seen before. We were led to believe there would be some improvement.  Can the Taoiseach be more specific?  What does he mean when he says the book of Estimates will be published before the end of the session? When are we likely to get the Book of Estimates?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 20 and the name of the Member in each case: (1)  Deputy Crawford &mdash; the excessive number of pupils travelling on certain buses between Kingscourt and Carrickmacross, County Monaghan, (2)  Deputy Ó Cuív &mdash; the need for funding for the Athenry extension scheme to ensure an adequate water supply for the town which has no water from 12 midnight to 7 a.m. at present, (3)  Deputy Upton &mdash; the need to further develop the country's science and technology resources through research and development to improve the level of innovation in Irish industry, (4) Deputy Shortall &mdash; the refurbishment of the Holy Spirit schools in Ballymun, Dublin 11, (5)  Deputy Theresa Ahearn &mdash; the penal financial consequences for a farmer (details supplied) who, due to illness, failed to inform the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry of the <Col N="1443" /> death of an animal within the correct time limit, thereby losing almost £3,000 in beef premia, (6)  the delay in payment of salaries to approximately 700 substitute teachers in the primary sector, (7) Deputy McGinley &mdash; the fact that six primary schools in the Falcarragh and Creeslough areas of County Donegal are without the services of a remedial teacher.</P>
      <P>I have selected for discussion the matters raised by Deputies Crawford, Shortall, Quill and McGinley.</P>
      <P>At this point, I must advise the House that Deputy Quill indicated that she was unable to be present after the selections had been made but not in sufficient time to select another matter for discussion.</P>
      <P>In the unavoidable absence of the Minister for Education, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications will respond to the matters raised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for the opportunity to raise this issue.  I also thank the Minister for coming to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully understand the serious financial limitations under which the Minister for education has to work so far as the whole education system is concerned. However, in my opinion, the issue of the transfer of children from Kingscourt to Carrickmacross is very serious It is unacceptable that there are 99 children on one bus and 78 or 80 children on the other. They have to travel eight miles and many of them have to stand for the entire journey. That is not the fault of the Minister for Education who has been in office for such a short time.  Nevertheless it is difficult to understand how a town the size of Kingscourt does not have its own vocational school or some type of second level education.  The result is that children from the area have to go in all directions to get to school.  Because the <Col N="1444" /> children do not have a school nearby they should at least be given the best possible school transport service.</P>
    <P>I note from a reply from the Minister's Department recently that the most a 52-seater bus can legally carry is 78 children. I understand that if children are over the age of 15 years the permitted legal number is even less.  As the majority of the children are over the age of 15 it is difficult for families to understand how this can be allowed.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be aware that the issue of over-crowding on school buses has been raised in many other areas.  It would appear to be a general problem.  I raise this matter on the Adjournment because discussions between some of my colleagues and the relevant bodies have been ongoing for some time.</P>
    <P>The road from Kingscourt to Carrickmacross must be one of the most dangerous in Ireland.  It is a narrow winding road on which very heavy trucks travel from the gypsum mines in Magheracloone into Kingscourt.  It is easy to understand why the parents of these children are so worried, not alone about the over-crowding but especially about the question of safety and insurance cover.</P>
    <P>We are very good at passing laws and telling others how to run their business. Car owners, lorry owners and bus owners all have to adhere to laws and this is only right.  However, we seem to ignore all these regulations.  Departments should and must show example to others by obeying the rules.</P>
    <P>I come from an agricultural constituency and many of my farmer colleagues have not, as yet, been paid their subsidies because of some minor difficulties with their files.  They may not even be paid for two years if some small mistake is made.  Yet here, as I understand it, rules are completely ignored.  I urge the Minister to take immediate steps to have this very serious and dangerous problem rectified in the interests of all concerned.  Over-crowding on the buses leads to all kinds of misconduct because <Col N="1445" /> the driver cannot see what is happening at the back.  If the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications is not in a position to improve the position can he encourage the Minister for Education to have this situation rectified as soon as possible?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Deputy Crawford for his contribution to this debate.</P>
      <P>One of the areas of responsibility of the Minister for Education is to ensure the safe delivery of about 165,000 primary and post-primary pupils throughout the country who are carried on the school transport system on a daily basis.  The Minister for Education also has the responsibility of ensuring that the State gets the best possible value for the money it expends on the provision of this service.</P>
      <P>In the current year, approximately £39 million will be spent on this service.  This figure includes about £4 million which Bus Éireann receives in fares from those pupils who are liable for such charges.</P>
      <P>Bus Éireann operate the school transport scheme as agents of the Department. That company assesses the eligibility of all children for school transport and organises the provision of school transport services for those who are eligible. The Department does not make detailed arrangements on the ground.  Bus Éireann decide on the routes, set-down and pick-up points and the size of vehicles to be used in individual areas.</P>
      <P>The post-primary transport scheme is organised, in the first instance, by the transport liaison officer &mdash; who is the chief executive officer of the vocational education committee of the county &mdash; in co-operation with the school authorities and Bus Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should explain that, for the purposes of the post-primary education transport scheme, the country has been divided into catchment areas, each of which has its own post-primary education centre.  In order to be eligible for transport, pupils <Col N="1446" /> must live at least three miles from the post-primary centre of the catchment area in which they reside.</P>
    <P>In order to be eligible for primary school transport, children between the ages of four and ten must live at least two miles from the nearest school, while older children must live at least three miles from that school.</P>
    <P>In the organisation of school transport services, all routes are planned in such a way as to ensure that, as far as possible, every eligible pupil has a reasonable standard of service from the point of view of time-table and distance from the route, while at the same time ensuring that all vehicles are fully utilised in the most efficient manner, within their authorised carrying capacities.</P>
    <P>In order to achieve this, individual vehicles are generally required to operate a number of services to both primary and post-primary schools.  This inevitably means that the timetable often requires some pupils to make an early start in the mornings and wait some time in the evenings.  This is, and always has been, a feature of the transport schemes throughout the country.</P>
    <P>When establishing a primary service, routes are planned in such a way as to ensure that most children will have no more than 1.5 miles to travel to the route of service.  When establishing post-primary services, routes are planned in such a way as to ensure as far as possible that no pupils will have more than three hours' travelling and waiting time daily and live no more than three miles from the route of service.</P>
    <P>Buses used solely for school transport purposes are licensed under Article 60 of the Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) Regulations, 1963, and the legal carrying capacity of such vehicles is specified on the actual licence issued by the gardaí and strictly adhered to in school transport arrangements.</P>
    <P>The majority of vehicles used for school transport purposes are also licensed for more general uses under <Col N="1447" /> Article 80 of the Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicle) Regulations.  While engaged for school transport purposes, the vehicles in question may carry three pupils for every authorised two seats.  Hence, a 52-seater vehicle falling into this category may carry up to 78 school-going children.  Bus Éireann also operate a small number of 61-seater buses which may carry up to 91 schoolchildren.</P>
    <P>The services from Kingscourt to Carrickmacross post-primary centre are operated by two large buses, a contractor's 53-seater licensed to carry up to 79 pupils, and a Bus Éireann 61-seater, licensed to carry up to 91 pupils.  The Minister has been assured by Bus Éireann that they are satisfied that all vehicles servicing the school transport scheme are operating within their legal carrying capacity and that sufficient seating is provided to make standing by pupils unnecessary.  She is further assured by Bus Éireann that such is the case on the Kingscourt to Carrickmacross route.  All vehicles operating under the school transport schemes meet rigid safety standards and, where vehicles have over eight adult seats and are more than one year old, they are required to pass the Department of the Environment tests, in regard to roadworthiness.</P>
    <P>Bus Éireann are justifiably proud of their safety record in operating the school transport scheme and safety procedures are reviewed on an ongoing basis to ensure that standards are maintained. This includes maintaining passenger safety through the prevention of mis-behaviour by pupils in transit.  The procedures for dealing with vandalism on school buses over the years have been very effective and, bearing in mind the number of pupils travelling on a daily basis, the incidents that arise are very isolated.</P>
    <P>Where such incidents do arise, as happened recently on the route to which the Deputy refers, the causes are investigated <Col N="1448" /> by Bus Éireann in consultation with the relevant school authorities and any necessary remedial action is promptly taken.  In such cases, the service in question is closely monitored by Bus Éireann to avoid any recurrence.  Bus Éireann has been monitoring the service mentioned by the Deputy and has assured the Minister that at no stage were 99 pupils carried.  It also points out that the existing capacity of the service is such that there is no need for pupils to stand.</P>
    <P>In view of the Deputy's concerns, the Minister has asked Bus Éireann to continue to monitor the service and to advise her of any difficulties.</P>

      <P>I raise the question of the refurbishment of the Holy Spirit schools which are situated in the centre of the Ballymun housing estate.  Ballymun housing estate was a quick fix response to the housing crisis in Dublin in the early sixties.  Families drawn from numerous areas of the city and county were placed in a new &ldquo;high rise town&rdquo; but the new town had not the necessary facilities to meet the needs of these developing families. As with the development of the Ballymun housing estate over the past 25 years, the history of the Holy Spirit schools is testimony to the State's neglect of primary schools and their pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problems regarding the schools pre-date their foundation in 1967.  They were build in response to the demands created by the housing crisis.  As with the high rise flats, I question the lack of foresight during the planning stage.  If the Ballymun housing estate was meant to serve Dublin as a long term solution why were these buildings erected with the poorest of materials?  Both schools are built with softwood panels which need to be maintained on an annual basis.  Sadly <Col N="1449" /> these softwood external panels have only been painted once in the 26 years.  Can one imagine the condition of a house that only received one coat of paint in 26 years?  Worse, this building was never painted internally until a group of concerned parents recently raised the money to do so.</P>
    <P>It is unacceptable that the parents of children attending the Holy Spirit schools, the majority of whom are on social welfare, should be expected to raise the funds to provide a bright environment for their children while the Department of Education has under-funded primary education for years.  The Department has failed to fight its corner to ensure an adequate budget for building improvements from the Department of Finance.  The Minister has stated that she will allocate the increased funding for the capital school building programme in a fair and transparent manner.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that in the past week the Minister has approved funds for remedial works to the roofs of the Holy Spirit schools.  While this is greatly appreciated, the boards of management and the parents are very anxious that the comprehensive refurbishment programme will follow without delay.  Unfortunately, the experience of seeking funds for refurbishment over the past five years has been anything but fair and transparent. The response from the Department has ranged from denying the existence of the problem and commissioning reports to expressions of concern by successive Ministers.  I know the Minister for Education intends that spending in her Department will be on the basis of priority and not political consideration. She has said that works on substandard schools for which she has sought funding must be completed within the next three years.</P>
    <P>At a recent public meeting in the Holy Spirit schools I witnessed the anger and frustration of hundreds of parents and the teachers who are no longer prepared to be fobbed off by empty promises.  The <Col N="1450" /> parents fully support the position of the 40 teachers who have been balloted on strike action if their schools are not included in this year's Estimates.  I trust that the Minister for Education's deeply held concern for the 800 disadvantaged pupils at these schools will ensure that remedial works on the schools will be included in the forthcoming estimates. Following her recent visit, the Minister no doubt realises the great efforts being made by parents and teachers.</P>
    <P>The Holy Spirit schools are the focal point of the community in the Sillogue parish.  There is a tremendous respect in this deprived community for the work, dedication and commitment of the teachers over the years.  There is an exceptional bond between the schools and the community.  What angers everybody is the obvious neglect of the school building over the years.  How can a community be expected to respect an institution which is neglected by the authorities?  The refurbishment of the flat complex and the shopping centre in Ballymun is welcome, but as a public representative I find it strange that various public bodies and other Departments are prepared to invest in the future of the area yet our most valuable asset, our children, is neglected.  If we continue in this unsatisfactory manner we will manage only to alienate and marginalise the products of such an uncaring system.</P>
    <P>I whole-heartedly agree with the Minister's assertion that we must prioritise when dealing with scarce resources.  I accept fully that a clear set of criteria must be established to ensure that the capital programme for schools is fair and is seen to be fair.  Under any criteria the present condition of the Holy Spirit schools is totally unacceptable and not conducive to learning.  I urge the Minister to guarantee as a top priority that these schools will be refurbished completely and not in a piecemeal fashion.  I ask her to ensure that we are given a clear time scale on the full refurbishment of these schools.  It is about time that the faults of <Col N="1451" /> the past 26 years were rectified once and for all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Minister for Education, I am glad to have the opportunity to clarify the position in relation to this matter.  Let me assure Deputy Shortall that the Department officials are keenly aware of the fact that these schools are located in a highly disadvantaged area of high population density.  This awareness has motivated them to devote sustained consideration to the condition of the schools buildings. It was necessary to appraise the accommodation situation carefully in the light of projections of pupil numbers in the area and of general demographic trends. This consideration has now been finalised for some time.  Clearcut decisions on how to proceed with rectifying the physical condition of the schools to provide adequately for future needs have now been made.</P>
      <P>The total teaching staff at the Holy Spirit boys' and girls' national school, Ballymun consists of 39 teachers.  The enrolment at the schools in September 1992 was 414 pupils in the boys' school and 382 pupils in the girls' school.</P>
      <P>As a first phase of the refurbishment scheme the Department has authorised emergency remedial works to the roofs of the two schools.  The contract for these works has been awarded and I understand that the contractor will be proceeding with the works within days.  It is hoped that this work will be completed by mid-January.</P>
      <P>Architectural planning of the major refurbishment project which has already been approved in principle is proceeding. Because of the nature and scale of the work involved, a quantity surveyor is to be appointed.  This major project will be considered for inclusion in the national schools capital building programme for 1994 in the light of available resources and other commitments and priorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1452" /> However, I assure the Deputy that the Department considers this to be a project of the highest priority in the context of the decisions to be made in due course on the projects to be selected to proceed to construction in 1994.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - County Donegal Remedial Teacher Service.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to raise this important matter on the Adjournment this evening.</P>
      <P>The area from Falcarragh to Creeslough in north west Donegal is left without the services of a remedial teacher. This region is situated between Muckish Mountain and Horn Head on the Atlantic Ocean with Tory Island on the distant horizon &mdash; incidentally also without recourse to remedial facilities.  There are eight primary schools in this area.  As one travels north from Falcarragh the first is Murroe national school.  In the town of Dunfanaghy there are two schools, namely Dunfanaghy national school and the Church of Ireland school.  As you drive further north you have Ballymore Church of Ireland school and Faugher national school.  In the town of Creeslough there are two schools, the national school and the Church of Ireland school and outside of Creeslough there is an eighth school, Glassan, incidentally a Gaeltacht school.  There we have a total of eight schools, 16 teachers and several hundred children but without remedial facilities.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to understand why such a large area should be completely ignored so far as remedial education is concerned. It would seem to meet all the criteria and conditions necessary for the provision of such a service as outlined time and time again by the Department of Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have spoken to teachers, parents and other interested parties in the area and it would seem that all the usual socioeconomic conditions employed in deciding <Col N="1453" /> where to provide remedial educational facilities are there.</P>
    <P>It is noteworthy that of the eight schools I have mentioned, three are Church of Ireland and five are Catholic schools.  The ideal solution in this area would be the appointment of two remedial teachers, one to cater for the needs and requirements of the three Church of Ireland schools and the other to look after the requirements of the five Catholic schools.  There is an excellent spirit of co-operation and goodwill, not alone between the schools of different denominations but indeed in the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>As a former teacher I strongly believe in the benefits of providing remedial services at the earliest possible date in the necessitous pupils education cycle.  It is more helpful and advantageous to undertake solving this problem as early as possible in the career of the school child and the results are often more effective if the service is provided at primary school rather than leaving it until they go to post primary school where the problem is much more difficult to overcome.</P>
    <P>The teachers and parents in the Dunfanaghy-Creeslough areas find it difficult to understand that other parts of Donegal have been fortunate enough to have the services of remedial teachers for years but that their needs and claims are overlooked and ignored.  I understand that altogether there are 20,000 primary pupils in Donegal with the services of 30 remedial teachers.  It is a mystery that such a large area comprising so many schools, pupils and teachers is left without such a service.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister and the Department to give this matter urgent attention. I am sure the Minister, Deputy Cowen, who was good enough to be present this evening, will convey to the Minister for Education that the most valuable gift the pupils, parents and teachers in the schools from Murroe to Creeslough and Glassan could receive is the news that the Department will sanction at least one, if <Col N="1454" /> not two, remedial teachers for the area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister for Education has indicated to the House, in the past remedial education at primary level is a matter in the first instance for the ordinary class teachers.  The majority of pupils with remedial needs would, therefore, be helped within the scope of the normal service.</P>
      <P>However, it is acknowledged that remedial teachers constitute the main additional resource for addressing the problem of underachievement in primary schools.  It was with this in mind that a further 86 posts were allocated for remedial purposes out of the quota of posts made available under the Programme for a Partnership Government for the school year 1993-94.</P>
      <P>These appointments were made following the collection of information from schools by the Department's primary inspectorate.  The posts were then allocated on the basis of priority of need, as indicated by the information collected. There were applications from in excess of 1,100 schools for these posts and, in all, 308 schools benefited from the allocation.</P>
      <P>This latest allocation brings to 1,033 the total number of remedial teachers operating within the primary school sector at present, Of the 3,209 ordinary national schools in the country, approximately 1,700 have the services of a remedial teacher, either on a full-time or shared basis.  As a result of the current level of service, 77 per cent of all primary school pupils have access to remedial support.</P>
      <P>At this stage, all primary schools in the country with enrolments above 362 pupils, which sought a remedial service, have at least one remedial teacher and many more smaller schools have the service on a shared basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of the 178 ordinary national schools in County Donegal, 71 have the services of a remedial teacher, either on a full-time or shared basis.  This includes 17 schools <Col N="1455" /> allocated a remedial service in the current school year as part of the national distribution under the Programme for a Partnership Government.  This latest allocation means that 63 per cent of pupils attending national schools in County Donegal currently enjoy a remedial service.</P>
    <P>The appointment of further remedial teachers will be kept under regular <Col N="1456" /> review as part of a broader commitment to provide a substantial number of additional remedial teachers in the coming years.  In that connection, I can assure the Deputy that the needs of the schools referred to by him will be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5. p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 16 November 1993.</P>

      <P>Ireland's opposition to nuclear weapons is of long standing and well known.  Successive Governments have made clear our policy of seeking the complete elimination of all nuclear weapons and the conclusion of a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty. We have made known our views on this subject both multilaterally in the United Nations and bilaterally to the nuclear powers.  During his visit to Ireland on 25 October 1993, I made clear to the Russian Foreign Minister our views on arms control and disarmament, particularly in the light of the forthcoming extension <Col N="1426" /> conference on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.</P>
      <P>The Russian Defence Minister has stated that the new Russian military doctrine, adopted by the Russian Security Council on 2 November, states that Russia reserves the right to strike first with nuclear weapons either against nuclear weapon states, or against non-nuclear weapon states allied to nuclear weapon states, who attack Russia or her allies.  With the exception of these two cases, in principle Russia will not employ nuclear arms against another party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty which does not itself posses nuclear weapons.</P>
      <P>The Government regrets that, at a time when the nuclear arms race between the nuclear states has effectively ended, and far-reaching reductions in the level of nuclear weapons have been agreed, there should be any suggestion that nuclear weapons might be used in a conflict, whether in a first strike or in retaliation.</P>

      <P>The US embargo on all political, economic and commercial relations between the United States and Cuba was instituted in 1962.  The embargo does not preclude other countries from developing trade and commercial links with Cuba, nor has it prevented the provision of humanitarian aid to Cuba.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The US &ldquo;Cuban Democracy Act&rdquo; of 1992, however, introduced a new extraterritorial dimension to the embargo. Ireland is opposed to this.  We have made this clear to the United States and, together with our partners in the European Union, we took the opportunity of the recent vote at the UN General Assembly to restate our opposition to the Act and to reject American actions <Col N="1427" /> designed to implicate third countries in US commercial measures.</P>
    <P>I regret both the continuing poor relations between the United States and Cuba and the circumstances which underlie that situation.  I have already said in relation to this issue that it is my hope that the changes that have taken place in international politics in recent years will create the conditions for an end to Cold War animosities everywhere.</P>
    <P>Ireland abstained on the recent resolution in the UN General Assembly because we believe that this situation is better addressed as a bilateral matter between the United States and Cuba rather than being made the subject of a motion amounting to censure in a multilateral world forum such as the UN General Assembly.</P>

      <P>I propose answering Questions Nos. 6 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>The Department of the Marine, in order to draw up a national coastal protection plan, invited all maritime local authorities to submit proposals for addressing serious erosion problems in their areas.  Kerry County Council has identified a number of locations requiring attention, including Beale, where the council has proposed a rock armouring scheme costing in excess of £3 million and Ballybunion where a £1.3 million rock armouring scheme has been proposed.</P>

    <P>All the proposals currently with the Department of the Marine are being examined with a view to their possible inclusion in the plan.  However, the cost of the proposals submitted far exceeds the moneys available for this purpose under the national plan.  As a result, the Department of the Marine will only be able to grant-aid local authorities in respect of the most urgent coastal erosion problems proposed, having regard to <Col N="1430" /> economic, environmental and ecological impacts.

      <P>RTE state that planning work is in hand to provide a transmitter to serve the Maam Valley area.  While this is a very difficult area to serve with quality television reception, RTE would hope to have the proposed transmitter on air around April 1994.</P>
      <P>As regards Cornamona, RTE say that on completion of the Maam Valley transmitter installation, when remaining coverage difficulties can be assessed, Cornamona will be treated as a matter of priority with a view to having improved service by the end of 1994.</P>

      <P>Comhairle na n-Ospidéal has indicated to my Department that there are currently 81 consultant paediatricians in this country.  The figure encompasses posts <Col N="1433" /> in the sub-specialities of paediatrics and neonatology.</P>
      <P>The ratio of consultant paediatricians per thousand children aged 0-14 in Ireland is 0.06.  Comparisons with other European countries are difficult because of the absence of a standard definition of a consultant or specialist.  In addition, larger European countries may have a greater range of paediatric sub-specialisation making valid comparison even more difficult.</P>
      <P>Ireland compares favourably with our nearest neighbours in the United Kingdom where it is easier to make comparisons due to the similarity of the structure of the medical profession.  The relevant ratios are as follows:</P>

    <P>The VTOS provides important education led programmes for the long term unemployed in County Meath, increasing their employability and enabling them to <Col N="1434" /> progress to further education and training opportunities.  The scheme is of considerable social and economic benefit to the participants and to their families and communities.</P>
    <P>Courses under the scheme are provided free of charge to the participants, including books, material and examination fees.  The participants continue to get the allowance or their equivalent to which they would be entitled if they did not join the VTOS.  They may also get travel and meal allowances depending on circumstances.</P>
    <P>As elsewhere, the scheme in County Meath is operated by the vocational education committee whose address is the County Office, Navan, telephone (046) 21447 or 21881.  Applications to participate in the scheme should be made to the vocational education committee which works in close co-operation with the employment exchanges/offices in its area.  The main recruitment time is in September/October and the 40 places available to the vocational education committee for 1993-94 are filled at this stage.  There are some applicants on a waiting list.  Where possible vacancies that arise will be filled from this list.</P>
    <P>The VTO is open to people who have been in receipt of unemployment payments, signing for credits or in receipt of lone parents allowances for at least 12 months.  The scheme is open to disabled persons and spouses also in certain circumstances.</P>
