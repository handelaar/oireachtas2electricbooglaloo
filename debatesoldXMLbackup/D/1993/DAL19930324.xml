      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 7 and 8.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders that: (1) the Second Stage of No. 7 shall be brought to a conclusion not later than 6.45 p.m. and the following arrangements shall apply in relation to the debate: (i) The speech of each Member called on shall not exceed 20 minutes; and (ii) The Minister or Minister of State shall be called on not later than 6.30 p.m. to make a speech in reply not exceeding 15 minutes; (2) In the case of the resumed debate on No. 8, the speech of each Member called on shall not exceed 20 minutes and (3) Private Members' Business shall be No. 13 and the proceedings thereon shall be brought to a conclusion at 8.30 p.m. today.</P>

      <P>May I now ask if the proposal for dealing with the Second Stage of the Social Welfare Bill, 1993 &mdash; that is No. 7 &mdash; is satisfactory and agreed? Agreed.  Are the proposals for dealing with No. 8, the budget debate, agreed?</P>

      <P>Before proceeding with the budget debate it is very important that there should be a clear statement from the Government about their proposals for the disposal of shares in Greencore. <Col N="454" /> There seems to be quite an amount of conflict coming from Government benches on the subject and as this is a central part of the Government arithmetic we should know what the situation is.</P>

      <P>There is nobody in the House more appreciative of that than I. I would not do anything to get you to rule me out of order from time to time.  May I ask the Taoiseach whether he is in a position to set a date for the legislation which was promised in the 1992 budget to provide for maternity leave for adoptive parents?  Has he had an opportunity to speak with the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, or the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, about this matter?  I am not sure which of them is holding up the <Col N="455" /> introduction of the social welfare provision for maternity leave for adoptive parents because the labour law regulations have not yet been made.  Can we have a clear statement from the Taoiseach or from either of the two Ministers as to when this legislation will be introduced or have they made up their minds which Minister is responsible?</P>

      <P>In view of the expressions of concern by all parties in this House yesterday with regard to the ongoing campaign of savagery by the Provisional IRA and the current situation with regard to the talks in Northern Ireland, would the Taoiseach agree it is time this House had a debate on the issue?  Would he agree to set aside Friday of next week for such a debate?  I appreciate that the Taoiseach may indicate it is a matter for the Whips but I am sure if he was to indicate a willingness to have such a debate agreement between the Whips would be forthcoming.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise a matter with you, a Cheann Comhairle.  I suppose it is an important matter for those of us who spent some time trying to get into this House and wish to stay there.  It relates to access to this House in the morning.  The Merrion Street gate is not opened before 9 a.m.  In the past it used to be possible for us to slip in through the Ministers' gate but for some reason or other &mdash; perhaps it is because Ministers do not come in early &mdash; this gate is also closed up to 9 a.m.  Could you arrange, Sir, that those people who want to come in through the Merrion Street gate before 9 a.m. will be able to do so?</P>

    <P>That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>

    <P>(3)  the decision to withdraw unemployment assistance from students and school leavers which will penalise a substantial number of young people.</P>

      <P>Aréir bhí mé ag caint i dtaobh na social employment schemes a bhfuil muintir an iarthair ag baint an oiread sin leasa astu.  Last night I referred to the social employment schemes which have been so successful in the west.  These schemes give a good indication of people's willingness to work provided work is available.  I have always believed that at times we have a rather Victorian attitude towards our social welfare system &mdash; this goes back a long way.  We tell people who receive social welfare that they must be available for work and we tell people who work as a self-employed that very strict penalties will be imposed on them if they try to evade paying tax. I know that the Minister has made great strides in this area and is endeavouring to deal with the anomalies which exist.  I should like to see the introduction of a family income supplement scheme for the self-employed.  This supplement could be based on the previous year's tax declaration and paid to the self-employed so long as they did not enter the PAYE system.  This issue needs to be addressed in view of changing work patterns and the availability of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the question of making work available for people when they require it, the position of third level students has to be taken into account. I have been surprised by some of the remarks made by people in regard to this issue.  Their comments clearly show a lack of understanding as to who was gaining <Col N="460" /> under the present regulations.  In my experience the situation was as follows. I will refer first to the position of a third level student from Galway who was receiving a grant and whose parents were on social welfare.  If he applied for social welfare benefit during the summer months he was means tested and, depending on his parents' income, he would receive a maximum of £27 per week.  Second, I wish to refer to the position of a student who did not come from a university town and whose parents were well off.  If that person stayed in the university town during the summer months &mdash; in other words, did not reside with his parents &mdash; and his parents' income made him ineligible to receive a third level grant, he could receive full unemployment assistance and in some cases a supplementary allowance for rent.  Surely the purpose of our social welfare system is to direct resources to those people who are in greatest need.  It is a total contradiction in this scenario that those people who are least well off are at more of a disadvantage than those who are better off.  Therefore, the system had to be changed to ensure that our resources are directed to those in greatest need.</P>
    <P>Reference is often made to the futility of making payments, particularly to young people, without giving them the opportunity to work.  The Minister has stated clearly that if no work is available the payments will be made, but that it is his intention to make work available for young people.  When I was in college there was a movement among students to do voluntary work during the summer months.  I believe most young people would grasp the opportunity to get involved in community work during the summer months as long as they received payment for it.  The notion of making community work available is a positive step in the right direction, and I hope the Minister, in drawing up the scheme, will make it attractive to students.  This concept has much to offer.  I am disappointed that instead of putting forward proposals on how the resources can be directed towards those in greatest need and ensure that useful work is carried out, the Opposition <Col N="461" /> are criticising the proposals in this respect.  I am convinced that the vast bulk of young people and communities at large regard this as a good idea which needs much development and ironing out and which has much to recommend it.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer briefly to our tax and social welfare systems.  A question has to be raised regarding the overlapping of our tax and social welfare codes.  The overlapping of the income limits for family income supplement and the thresholds or exemption limits for tax is anomalous. This overlapping means that a person could receive family income supplement during the same week as he pays tax.  This anomaly has to be addressed.  I know it is basically a tax issue, but in view of the overlap I hope this nettle will be grasped by the Minister for Social Welfare during the next few years.  It means that as income goes up there is no increase in take home pay.</P>
    <P>Another matter which has to be sorted out between the Department of Social Welfare and Revenue is the criteria used in deciding certain cases.  In the Social Welfare code cohabiting couples are treated as if they were married, whereas under the tax code a couple must be legally married before they get the benefit of the tax free allowance.  In the case of a cohabiting couple where one is working, the other is not entitled to claim social welfare benefits because the income of the working partner will be taken into account.  On the other hand, the working partner cannot claim a tax free allowance in respect of the partner who is not working.  That kind of anomaly must be dealt with.</P>
    <P>I recently came across a sad case involving a grandparent who had looked after a young child from birth.  The child is now aged ten or 12.  The grandparent was in receipt of a widow's pension and of a child dependant allowance from the Department of Social Welfare.  There was also a small income of £400 or £500 a year from self-employment.  The Department of Social Welfare had no problem in paying the child dependant allowance to the grandparent, but the tax authorities would not recognise, for tax <Col N="462" /> exemption purposes, the child as being dependent on the grandparent without legal custody.  As a consequence, because of the very low exemption limit for widows, the income was taxable and a small amount of tax had to be paid.  That is a crazy anomaly which should be eliminated. In such circumstances it is wrong that tax should have to be paid.</P>
    <P>In certain cases people have to wait up to three months for a means test and the final decision regarding eligibility for unemployment assistance.  The Minister might consider carrying out a preliminary examination based on self-declaration of income and on documentary evidence such as the P. 45.  An applicant for unemployment assistance who passed such a test should be paid immediately, pending verification of entitlement in a full means test.  Such a system would not cost anything. Where people are waiting a long time for a decision on their application for unemployment assistance, they are generally paid by the community welfare officer.  It would be simpler to make conditional payments of unemployment assistance by the means I suggest, with provision for recoupment of any overpayment following the decision.  This would be better than the current system.</P>
    <P>I welcome the change in the carer's allowance.  To the outsider it looks as if the rate has increased slightly.  It is much more significant because the allowance has moved from the short term to the long term rate.  This will make a great difference in many cases, particularly in rural areas.  Pensioners often lost their free electricity allowance and free television licence because there was a son or daughter living at home in receipt of unemployment assistance.  These sons and daughters were also acting effectively as carers, but if they transferred from unemployment assistance to the carer's allowance the rate of payment dropped by more than the value of the free electricity allowance and the free television licence.  They could not declare themselves as carers because of the consequent loss.  That anomaly has been removed.  Such people will be able to transfer to the carer's allowance and will <Col N="463" /> not have to declare themselves as available for work.  The old people will be able to retain their entitlement to free electricity and free television licence, which is so important.  That is a small but very significant change which I welcome.</P>
    <P>Some years ago the Minister introduced a provision whereby the lump sum received by a pensioner from the sale of a place of residence would not be means tested.  That provision was widely welcomed. It meant that if a nest egg was put away by somebody moving to a smaller house or into a home, it would not be means tested for social welfare purposes. The Minister should do something similar in regard to redundancy lump sum payments. Many people who are made redundant do not get alternative employment during the 15 months when they are in receipt of unemployment benefit. Then they are means tested for unemployment assistance.  Those who have used the lump sum wisely by putting it into the bank are penalised at the rate of 10 per cent on the capital sum.  That rate is usually higher than will be paid by the bank for the money on deposit.  I suggest that this is encouraging people not to save this money but to spend it.  The exemption of redundancy payments from means testing would encourage people to hold onto the money and to use it as a nest egg.  Currently people feel they would be penalised if they do not spend the money.</P>
    <P>I refer to the need for a direct debit payment scheme in respect of essential services.  I should like to see a voluntary scheme of this kind introduced as quickly as possible.  It would mean that people would not have to worry about putting money aside for council rents or electricity bills.  Obviously this would be the choice of the client, but it is important that the service should be available.</P>
    <P>There is a long delay in dealing with appeals.  The Minister should consider devising a system for dealing in a summary way with appeals which will obviously not be successful.  The client would get a quick answer.  There should be a preliminary examination of appeals and where it is decided that there is no <Col N="464" /> case the client should be informed, without having to wait three or four months. I accept that in other cases a more thorough examination has to take place.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with my colleague, Deputy Kenny.  In the limited time available to me I would like to concentrate on two areas that I do not think have been touched on by other contributors.  I wish to add my voice to those who raised certain issues and urge the Minister, if possible, to take them on board.</P>
      <P>First, I would be pleased if the Minister, or the Minister of State, would consider the ongoing difficulties resulting from the lack of social welfare payments to widowers as distinct from widows under the social welfare code.  The Minister will be aware of the ever increasing number of cases of widowers who feel discriminated against under the social welfare code, particularly those with young children who are struggling to keep the family together, perhaps hold down a job and ensure that the children are not affected anymore than they have been by the loss of a mother.  There are many well documented cases.  I appeal to the Minister to take a personal interest in discrimination against widowers in the context of the lack of a widowers pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should look at the ongoing difficulties of pensioners who have mixed or intermittent insurance contributions going back to 1954.  A man in my constituency in the mid-fifties joined Wexford County Council and was temporary for the first nine months before his appointment was made permanent. During those nine months he was paying a full PRSI contribution and subsequently went on the public service rate.  Now he is working in the private sector and when he retires in seven years time he will only have 13 years contributions <Col N="465" /> but they will be reckoned back to the mid-fifties when he started in employment and had nine months at the full PRSI rate or stamp rate at the time. There are many anomalies for pensioners because of mixed and intermittent contributions. Great hardship is caused to elderly people who have worked most of their lifetime here and maybe some years abroad.  The Minister should resolve the anomalies that still exist as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>The Minister should look again at the whole concept of the carer's allowance which has been improved nominally in the budget.  Apart from the justice of rewarding carers for the job that virtually no one else could do there are actually economic reasons for the State to reward them properly for doing that job.  Carers looking after elderly or very infirm people are saving the State hundreds of pounds each week, money the State would otherwise have to pay to keep these infirm and elderly people in our institutions at £400, £500 or £600 a week which is the going rate.  To quibble over whether to give them £70 or £58 or £59 a week is nonsense; it makes no sense in not recognising the work they do and it makes no economic sense as far as the State is concerned.  I make those three points in passing as I feel very strongly about them, because I want to go to two other matters that have not been touched on.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to look at the ongoing difficulty being experienced by share fishermen under the social welfare code.  I represent a maritime county. Indeed, there are dozens of maritime counties where fishing is a very important industry, particularly in some of our more remote and peripheral regions.  If the Single Market in looking after the peripheries, is to mean anything, it means we support our remote fishing communities. Share fishermen, as defined in the McLoughlin judgment in 1986, are self-employed; they are no longer employees of their skipper or the boat owner.  As a result major problems have arisen with regard to their entitlements under the social welfare code.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="466" /> The Minister should look at the system operating in other jurisdictions and amend the social welfare code.  We need a special category for share fishermen, virtually all of whom do not fish from December to February because of the weather.  There is enforced idleness there and, because of the history of difficulty with their PRSI contributions, particularly since the McLoughlin judgment, they are not entitled to unemployment benefit, they cannot prove their entitlement to unemployment assistance, get medical cards or get a reduction in their rent.  They have all sorts of mortgage repayment problems.  I can show the Minister a file I have on Wexford share fishermen alone with regard to the problems they have had, particularly since the appalling storms of the winter of 1989 when Kilmore Quay was devastated and many boats wrecked.  Countless families would have been hungry but for the local parish collections and the local St. Vincent de Paul Society.  Indeed, the national St. Vincent de Paul Society came to Wexford to support our fishing families when the social welfare system could not because of the way the code is formulated. Countless families are hungry and miserable for several months during the winter.  It was ten weeks this winter; we had a very stormy December, January and February and the fishermen got back to sea sometime around the second week in February.  There were virtually no payments to these fishermen who have worked hard all their lives to eke out a living in remote rural communities.  I appeal to the Minister not to let another winter come before sorting out this problem. There have been public meetings at Kilmore Quay and in other maritime constituencies and yet we have failed to resolve this problem under the social welfare code.</P>
    <P>The Minister recently met the Irish Fishermen's Organisation to discuss this general situation.  It has been particularly difficult since last year's clarification in the High Court of the position of share fishermen in relation to PRSI.  Many options were discussed when the Minister met the IFO.  He met the chairman, Mr. <Col N="467" /> Joe Maddock, and the general secretary, Mr. Frank Doyle, to discuss this issue. The Irish Fishermen's Organisation needs a sub-committee to look after the interests of share fishermen specifically because there are divided loyalties among the executive there between the skippers and the share fishermen which are causing problems.  The Minister wanted companies to be set up around each boat and the share fishermen to be paid as employees of those limited companies.  Apparently that is unacceptable to the fishing industry for various reasons.</P>
    <P>However, other options can be considered. The share fishermen could be allowed full benefits for the 7.7 per cent class A employee contribution and those benefits regarded as part of the individual's taxable income.  The Minister, apparently, was not enthusiastic about that but it seems a very reasonable option.  The upper limit could be set for the period during which short term benefits could be claimed during the year, for example, 12 to 16 weeks.  That is another option that could be employed by amending the social welfare code.  The Minister could consider allowing the lower limit of benefit to be claimed without a time limit or &mdash; I prefer this option &mdash; a special fishermen's PRSI contribution could be established which would qualify for full PRSI benefits as happens share fishermen in the UK.  Share fishermen in the United Kingdom will be paying £7.75 per week from 1 April for what they call an insurance stamp.  The system is being changed there.  The fishermen will now be issued a bill every 13 weeks in arrears and their first payment will be made at the end of June.  The fishermen in the UK will have 28 days to pay their insurance contributions to stay in benefit and to protect them and their families during bad weather or at times when there is no fishing.  With quota restrictions in fishing, bad weather is not the only reason fishermen are forced off the seas.  Often if a particular species has been fished to its quota in any year the fishermen have no more work.  This problem gets no airing <Col N="468" /> in social welfare debates but there are thousands of families around our coast suffering misery every winter because of difficulties in the operation of the social welfare code for share fishermen.</P>
    <P>I would like to raise another point in response to the Minister's reference to work return supports.  In view of the major problems with the numbers unemployed, the tragedy for the families of those unemployed, particularly second generation unemployed and the sub culture that is now creeping particularly into bigger urban areas where children have not known their parents or grandparents ever to work, will the Minister consider the creation of district service companies as part of the scheme of work return supports?  These are new concepts which help those who have been on the dole queues for a long time to use their talents and work their way back into full employment. I suggest that the Minister look specifically at well documented proposals for these district service companies. Their legal structures, their management and staffing have all been put on record over the years and they remove a blockage to employment creation.  A person who is long term unemployed is losing skills rapidly and is rapidly losing even the ability to motivate himself to work. There are major problems in the tax code relating to the incentive to work, but I will not dwell on those because I do not have time.</P>
    <P>At the moment if one wants part-time or short term work done in any area &mdash; perhaps engineering, painting, gardening or help on the land, in a pub or in a shop &mdash; one virtually cannot get that work done without having to resort to the black economy.  One cannot take a person off the live register for short term or part-time work because of the bureaucratic difficulties experienced by such a person in trying to get back into the social welfare system once the work is completed.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of work to be done here and there are hundreds of thousands unemployed, yet apparently, because of bureaucratic complications in the tax and social welfare codes, we cannot marry <Col N="469" /> those who want to work with the work that has to be done.</P>
    <P>District service companies, which would be private limited companies and would be formed in all major urban areas, would ensure that those who are willing to work and join the companies voluntarily receive each week a minimum payment equivalent to their social welfare rate.  The companies would market the skills of the local unemployed on strict commercial terms.  Those who employed people through a district service company would benefit in that the money spent on their work would be tax deductible.  That would be an incentive for employers to come out of the black economy and use district service companies. As individuals who registed with the district service companies set up in each exchange area increased their workload and found an increased demand for their work they would slowly be able to work themselves off the unemployment register and towards a full-time job, having developed their skills or having acquired new skills.  This system would benefit the unemployed and the community. Society at large would benefit from a reduction in the huge number of unemployed, particularly in the urban areas, who cannot get themselves off the dole queues because of bureaucratic restictions and because of the length of time they are unemployed, which effectively results in a loss of skills and a loss of ability to motivate themselves to work.</P>
    <P>Time does not allow me to develop my very strong views on district service companies.  I ask the Minister and the Minister of State to examine this concept as part of the work return supports referred to by the Minister.  Unemployment is the single major tragedy in our society and anything that any of us can contribute to the debate that might alleviate the problem must be taken seriously.  I hope I shall have more time on another occasion to develop my views, and the views of others who are much wiser than I am, on the concept of district service councils, which is well worth serious examination.  What is needed to help those in our community who feel <Col N="470" /> that they have absolutely no hope of getting employment in the short or medium term is novel, radical thinking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1943 the late Eamon de Valera looked into his heart and proclaimed his view of the Ireland of the years to follow.  Fifty years on, Ireland has immense social problems.  Indeed, Ireland has moved a long way from the days of former Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, who said that if our unemployment rate exceeded 100,000 the Government of the day should remove itself from office.</P>
      <P>The problems facing the Minister for Social Welfare and his Government are partly of their own making but they are enormous.  Payments of £10 million a day to social welfare recipients of all descriptions represent an immense charge on those who pay through taxes, PRSI and other contributions.  Projections for the future are not at all good and have been compounded by the action taken by the Government in the budget to place a 1 per cent levy on all income.</P>
      <P>It would be true to say that in the past five years a great number of prominent people in the Irish business world and in the area of high finance have been subjected to the rigors of various laws for straying across the line of conventional behaviour, both moral and ethical.  It is no wonder that the unemployed become cyncial and feel very strongly when they learn of the level of alleged activity taking place at the higher scale.  The anti-establishment feeling that exists would become very much more real and would be expressed much more strongly were it not for the fact that this country has a thriving black economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole concept of our employment exchanges is wrong.  Employment exchanges are areas where the unemployed sign on for receipt of various social welfare benefits.  Those exchanges are not employment exchanges, they are unemployment centres.  Employment exchanges should be areas where the unemployed would be welcome to attend and where they would have not only the right to receive with privacy their due social welfare payments but also access <Col N="471" /> to opportunities for training, education and advice and encouragement as to the way in which they should and could remove themselves from the unemployment register.  It is sickening to see every week lines of young and middleaged people standing outside dirty, grey, drab buildings, often in the rain, as if they were unwanted people, waiting to go inside and sign for payments made under the various social welfare codes.  It is my opinion that if this country can spend £10 million a day on social welfare payments it should be possible to consider the idea of bringing employment exchanges into the nineties and making them places of encouragement, initiative and employment.  Those incentives should be found in the one building for the people who have to attend there.</P>
    <P>There are very important aspects to the Bill, some with which I agree and some with which I do not agree.  I should like the Minister to indicate when the bilateral agreement between the United States Government and the Irish Government will come into effect.  The agreement will benefit a great number of returned Irish emigrants who were forced to leave this country in times gone by when this State was not able to offer them anything.  Those emigrants made their living in America in the fields and in various other walks of life and they often kept their people here alive by way of the traditional monthly cheque from the United States or the parcel from America, as the case might be.  Some of those emigrants have returned to Ireland to find that they are not eligible for benefits. I have raised this issue throughout the past ten years and an agreement has finally been reached.  I commend the agreement to the Minister.  I hope the Minister will tell the House the number who will benefit under the agreement, the cost to be incurred to the State and when the scheme will come into operation and allow returned Irish emigrants who are now pensioners drawing social security benefits from the United States to avail of those benefits in this country.</P>
    <P>Many people are refused payment of <Col N="472" /> children's allowance on the grounds that application has not been made in time.  Surely this is an anomaly.  Having become a parent fairly recently myself, I am able to understand that people might forget to apply for the allowance in the time specified.  The requirement to apply for the allowance by a particular date should at least be made less rigid and the time for application extended; after all, the children have been born and eligibility should not rely on a date of application.</P>
    <P>Many speakers in the debate have referred to the carer's allowance.  The love, concern and humanity that is traditional in our family life and in our society is neither rewarded nor seen to be rewarded through the carer's allowance scheme.  Hundreds and thousands of families are looking after their elderly and next of kin.  Those in need are being given love, concern and affection in the privacy of their own homes, qualities that would not be available in State institutions.  Our carers save the State millions of pounds every year yet because the spouse in a household might be working the carer who looks after someone &mdash; a full-time job &mdash; is denied the carer's allowance.  We should have some mechanism whereby carers are paid for the care and attention they give.</P>
    <P>I have a concern in relation to the free telephone rental allowance.  In Ireland there used to be tradition of &ldquo;marriages by matchmakers&rdquo;.  Many pensioners now find that because their spouse is many years younger the free telephone rental allowance to which they should be entitled is denied them.  If they are married and living in the same house and if one reaches pension age he or she should not have to seek a doctor's certificate to enable him or her to apply for assistance.  In cases of that kind they should be entitled to free telephone rental allowance.</P>
    <P>In regard to medical examinations there is an increasing number of cases where people send in a doctor's certificate that they are unable to work. However, a doctor attached to the Department of Social Welfare can test <Col N="473" /> a person's reflexes and decide that the person is fit for work.  This involves an appeal to a third doctor.  If a GP issues a certificate to say that a patient is unable to work professional ethics should dictate that it is acceptable to the Department. There are many anomalies which I should like the Minister to examine.</P>

      <P>I should like to put on the record the elements which we have included in our Programme for Government which contain guidelines in regard to this and subsequent budgets: (1) to at least maintain the real value of social welfare payments, to protect the income of pensioners and to continue implementation of the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare; (2) to increase child benefit this year to £20 per month per child &mdash; our target is to raise child benefit even further over time following the integration of the tax and social welfare systems.  (3) We are committed as a long term policy to the maintenance of the social insurance system. (4) We will examine measures to faciliate unemployed people who wish to study or to take up further education.  (5) Anomalies in the system will be removed. (6) The administrative requirements of the social welfare system will be simplified and made more compatible with human dignity.  The system of payments will be streamlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This budget is one of a series in a programme covering four years and I am pleased that a number of issues which I am concerned with have been addressed in it.  I am also pleased that the budget has increased by 3.5 per cent all weekly social welfare and health board payments.  These increases will apply to personal rates and adult dependant allowances.  It will come into effect at the end of July and will cost £113 million in a full year and £50 million this year.  I <Col N="474" /> welcome the special increase of 4.9 per cent on all short term payments at a cost of £7 million.  I welcome in particular the fact that child benefit is being increased to £20 per child for each of the first three children and up to £23 for the fourth and subsequent children, an increase of £4.20 per month.  I particularly welcome this development as it was raised on many occasions during the election campaign. It will be of great benefit to young married mothers and single parents who have difficulty in coping.  The £12 increase in the family income supplement is also very welcome.  An increase of £6.20 per week in the carer's allowance, which will raise it to £59.20, is also very welcome.  There have been difficulties in regard to this scheme, but I have no doubt that over a period of time there will be major improvements in this area.  Due recognition for the work of carers will be given in further developments.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase of £5 in the minimum and maximum rates of maternity benefits and the new grant of £200 for mothers who give birth to twins. There is also a better deal for unemployed people who qualify for third level education; the maintenance element of the higher education grant will be disregarded in determining their allowances. I have a particular interest in this matter as I have been involved in the educational system for most of my life. On many occasions I advocated the participation of unemployed people in the educational process.  I welcome the pilot scheme developed in Tallaght which allowed unemployed people to return to full time education.  This provision further strengthens that commitment and I look forward to further long term developments in this area as I operate part of this scheme by teaching people who come off the unemployment register. This is probably the most imaginative provision in regard to the unemployed and I look forward to further developments in that area.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the extra £1.37 million in grants to the voluntary sector to assist in measures to counteract moneylending. We all know the evils of moneylending <Col N="475" /> and in difficult times, when people have to resort to these measures, any help is welcome.  The sum of £1.37 million is not much money but it will go some way towards alleviating the problems which these people face.  An additional grant of £100,000 to the Combat Poverty Agency will also be welcomed by this group.  Of course they could do with much more money, but in difficult times anything is welcome and I am sure it will be put to good use.  I greatly admire the work done so far by the Combat Poverty Agency and I look forward to further developments in that area.  I will do what I can to enable such developments to take place.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the changes in recent measures which adversely affected people claiming unemployment assistance and disability and treatment benefits. Pensioners were adversely affected by the increase in the contribution condition requirement of five years instead of four years.  However, they will have their benefits restored to them and the former contribution conditions will apply.  I also welcome the commitments in regard to supplementary welfare allowances; the total expenditure on these payments by community welfare officers is now a staggering £112 million.  There is to be a detailed review of the operation of the scheme, which I welcome as there are many anomalies in this area.  There are many instances in which the community welfare offices use their discretion where people are not quite sure of their entitlements. Clearer guidelines will probably be required to make sure that people are treated fairly where the discretionary element of social welfare is not working properly.</P>
    <P>The suitability of dealing on a regular basis with periodic household bills for people in exceptional need will be addressed.  I am concerned at the effects on my constituents in Dublin South-West of some of the disputes in the area and the confusion they caused.  I would welcome clarification so that these groups of people will not feel they are being deprived of anything to which they are entitled.  The Government has allowed <Col N="476" /> an extra £11 million overall to the supplementary welfare allowance for 1993 to meet current and exceptional needs of those on social welfare.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the commitment to part-time workers, a very large group in society.  As a teacher who dealt with students in the past, I understand the difficulties these people experience on first entering employment.  They usually start as part-time workers and anything which improves their conditions and rights is welcome.  I also welcome the fact that the Department of Social Welfare will allow people with colour television to be issued with a free licence if they were entitled to a free licence for a black and white television.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions in the budget, although I appreciate that they do not meet all the demands of the Commission on Social Welfare or, indeed, of everyone in society.  However, in the circumstances and the difficult times in which this budget was framed the commitments given in the Programme for Government and by the Labour Party prior to the general election and thereafter are being honoured.  This Programme for Government, continuing over a four-year period, will show a development of such commitments in a more beneficial manner for social welfare recipients.  This is to be welcomed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to be afforded an opportunity of saying a few words on the provisions of this Bill.  I contend that the benchmark of a caring, Christian society is how it treats its less privileged members &mdash; the elderly, the unemployed, the sick, the disabled, the young and the homeless.  Taking all of these considerations into account I contend that Ireland would feature very high on any league table for care despite the shortfalls obtaining in our system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past five years in particular social welfare policies have been rigorously pursued to render the system more efficient, effective and user-friendly, increasing benefits to those in real need.  The control and/or elimination of waste and fraud has been and continues <Col N="477" /> to be the aim of this Government. In this respect I should like to congratulate the present and former Ministers, Senator Brendan Daly and Deputy McCreevy, who played an important role in effecting improvements in our social welfare system.  I should also like to pay a tribute to civil servants at all levels who do a tremendous job in difficult circumstances.</P>
    <P>Social welfare payments have been increased continuously, year on year, in order to ensure that those dependent on assistance benefit are adequately helped. In addition, certain sectors of our society who have been excluded from benefit for many years, such as carers, are now being catered for, thanks to the present Minister, Deputy Woods, who introduced a carer's allowance a number of years ago. On its introduction, and in fact to date, this allowance has been much maligned and misrepresented by Members of the Opposition, who when in Government over many years never catered for or thought of such carers.  I welcome the percentage increase proposed in this budget and the changes wrought to ensure that people with carers will not be deprived of their rightful benefits as had been the case heretofore.</P>
    <P>Despite the scepticism uttered and cynical articles published, the family is still recognised as being of central importance to our society.  Indeed, in the provisions of this Bill the Government has recognised the importance of the family. For example, there has been a substantial increase in child benefit, a grant for mothers who give birth to twins and the income ceiling raised with regard to eligibility for the family income supplement. In addition there have been increases effected in the minimum and maximum rates of maternity benefit and a special increase of 20 per cent in the orphan's non-contributory pension.  There has been an extension also of the after-death grant.  All of these benefits illustrate that the family features highly in the priority of this and former Governments.</P>
    <P>I agree with what Deputy Ó Cuív said with regard to the extension of the family income supplement to self-employed <Col N="478" /> people.  I would ask the Minister to ascertain whether any method can be devised to allow such benefit to small business people and farmers in need of such.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's response in that respect.</P>
    <P>I contend that education constitutes the gateway to employment opportunities. Many members of our society formerly did not have an opportunity of availing of education beyond primary level.  For example, in the fifties and sixties to a large extent it was not the general trend for people to continue into secondary and/or third-level education.</P>
    <P>The present Minister for Social Welfare, in a previous period in office, initiated a more flexible approach to unemployment payments, especially in regard to providing educational opportunities for the unemployed to extend their education.  Resulting from that initiative there are now over 2,000 unemployed engaged in second level courses and approximately 330 people engaged in fulltime, third level courses.  I am glad to note the Minister's expressed intention to encourage young, lone parents to continue their education, a most worthwhile objective.</P>
    <P>Job creation is the central objective of this Government, a recognised priority on the part of members of all sectors of our society.  The introduction of the new PRSI exemption scheme in October last was of enormous help to employers, the dates specified for the employment of people being between October last and March 1993.  I am glad to note that the Minister had decided to extend its closing date to 19 September 1993.  This will afford employers enormous scope to recruit people under the provisions of this scheme, thereby effecting considerable savings for themselves while reducing our present unemployment levels.</P>
    <P>The Minister's decision to disallow students claiming unemployment assistance during the summer holiday period has been hitting the headlines in recent days.  I contend that this is not an unwise decision since our resources are not unlimited and such funds as are available should be allocated to those in real need. <Col N="479" /> There were anomalies obtaining with regard to that scheme in that sons and daughters of well-off people if they did not return home during the summer holiday period could claim unemployment assistance and rent allowance from the relevant health boards, while others in dire need of State assistance were deprived of such.  I am glad the Minister has introduced this proposal because I believe that students who legitimately qualify for aid will receive it under the new scheme.  I look forward to the relevant regulations being published.  The concept of summer work schemes is a good and proper one.  Idleness is of no benefit to anyone.  I cannot understand people who say that they should be paid over three months for doing nothing.  It has been my experience in the past that students always were willing and eager to gain work experience, whether paid or unpaid.  If the Minister intends devising schemes for people who experience difficulty in obtaining employment and pay them for doing so, I cannot then understand why they should complain.</P>
    <P>The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General for 1991 shows over-payments of social insurance written off in the sum of £3,723,000 and over-payments of social assistance written off in the sum of £4,128,000, totalling £7.8 million, representing .02 per cent of the total social welfare budget.  Although the percentage is small, the sum itself is not insubstantial.  It is important that over-payments, whether caused by fraud, negligence or accident, be reduced.  I would request the Minister to tighten up on the regulations to ensure that such over-payments do not recur.</P>
    <P>We have been awaiting the new Social Welfare (Consolidation) Bill for many years.  I am delighted to note that the Minister has announced its publication in the very near future, all the more so since he has said that a layman's guide will also be published.  There are many voluntary workers advising members of the community on social welfare matters to whom it is important that such a guide be made available.  Reading through an entire <Col N="480" /> Social Welfare Bill can be quite confusing when benefits included in its provisions can often be lost through ignorance of their existence.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister consider assessing income on the amount of actual interest earned rather than use the standard figure of 10 per cent?  A number of years ago the self-employed were required to pay into a State pension fund.  However, those people who were aged 55 years and over will not benefit from the payments they have made under that pension scheme.  In the past the Minister promised that he would review the scheme and consider whether these people should be allowed &ldquo;to buy&rdquo; years.  I ask him to outline the up-to-date position.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that money is being made available to eliminate the need for people to go to moneylenders who are parasites in our society.  This will be of help in cleaning them off the face of society.  Deputy Doyle referred to share fishermen.  There are many such fishermen along the Youghal-Cobh coastline and these are encountering difficulties in the area of social welfare.  I ask the Minister to try to resolve their problems.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I welcome the Bill as it continues the improvements which Fianna Fáil began to make in 1987.  I know that in the years to come we will make our social welfare system better for those in need in our society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms F. Fitzgerald Ms F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned that, once again, the Social Welfare Bill shows the signs of a lack of what I would call a coherent strategy or reforming intent. The social welfare system has been examined by a number of bodies, the Commission on Social Welfare, the Commission on Taxation and the NESC, while various recommendations have been made to improve the quality of the system.  Its quality, ethos and direction have a profound influence on the lives of many families in Ireland, women, men and children.  There is no doubt that any changes made to the system have profound implications for their well-being. It is extremely important, therefore, that any changes made in the system are <Col N="481" /> thought through, part of a coherent strategy and have a reforming intent.  I want to focus on a number of areas in this Bill where this is lacking.</P>
      <P>I want, first, to mention child benefit. While I welcome the increase, which is long overdue, I have to ask why is child benefit not increased routinely?  Women are delighted that child benefit is being increased this year but it is a number of years since there has been an increase. Two-thirds of Irish women have no independent income and, given our problems in relation to equality as evidenced from the report of the Commission on the Status of Women, child benefit forms an incredibly important part of their income.  I ask therefore why is it not increased routinely?  This question should be examined.  Why do we have to wait for a number of years before there is an increase in child benefit?  I ask the Minister to address this issue.</P>
      <P>I note from the Bill that child dependant allowances are being increased in the normal way.  The report of the Commission on Social Welfare and other reports have suggested that this can lead to the creation of a poverty trap for families, for large families in particular. Surely we should have continued the strategy of indexing child benefit each year to remove families from the poverty trap in which they find themselves.  This was recommended in the NESC report. We must make every effort &mdash; this is mentioned on a number of occasions in the explanatory memorandum &mdash; to remove families from the poverty trap and I welcome the initiatives which have been taken in this regard.  This issue needs to be examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second issue that I would like to mention &mdash; this is referred to on page 2 of the explanatory memorandum &mdash; is the extension of the provisions mentioned to the pre-retirement allowance.  I do not know whether the Minister has a policy on the report of the review group on households dependent on social welfare but I would like to know if he is extending to the social welfare system and, in this case, to pre-retirement allowances a policy in relation to payments to couples. <Col N="482" /> Does this mean that elderly pensioners &mdash; a couple &mdash; will have less income from now on?  Would the Minister clarify this issue?  Again, I make the point we have not heard what is his policy in relation to this matter.  I would like to know what it is as it has profound implications for many couples.  This provision has slipped in without any real explanation being given.</P>
    <P>In the explanatory memorandum there is the following phrase, &ldquo;clarification of the basis for the assessment of non-cash benefits as means for lone parent's allowance&rdquo;. I note that the Bill contains a provision whereby non-cash benefits can be taken into account and a comment about the income which the children of lone parents receive.  What exactly does the Minister have in mind here?  Is he giving himself the power to make regulations in relation to children's income? I do not understand what it means and I ask the Minister to clarify the matter. It is unclear &mdash; I am referring to the amendment of the Third Schedule to the Principal Act on page 14 of the Bill &mdash; and I am sure that lone parents would like to know what it means.</P>
    <P>In relation to other reforms I would like to comment on social insurance contributions which are dealt with on page 7 of the explanatory memorandum where the moves that the Minister is going to make in relation to these contributions are mentioned.  Again, there is no restructuring.  In the budget a rather lazy tax was introduced &mdash; an income levy.  In line with the reports of the NESC, the Commission on Social Welfare and the Commission on Taxation what we ought to be doing is reforming and restructuring social insurance contributions and perhaps removing the ceilings.  Certainly a determined effort should be made to reform the system as opposed to introducing an income levy.  This area should have been examined and a more reforming and thoughtful approach should have been taken in dealing with this issue instead, as I said, of introducing a lazy income levy which penalises people further. In relation to pay-related benefit, is there an upper ceiling?  Section 6 provides for an increase from £78 to £80 in the <Col N="483" /> amount of weekly earnings which may be disregarded.  I would like the Minister to address this question.</P>
    <P>I would now like to deal with the issue of maternity benefit. I note that in his speech the Minister said he was providing improved benefits such as better maternity provisions, including entitlement to maternity benefit, on their return, for volunteer development workers.  While I welcome this &mdash; it is an improvement &mdash; there is a bigger question in relation to maternity benefit and that is why the Minister has not reversed the &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; cuts which were made last year when the general maternity scheme was abolished?  Under that scheme maternity benefits were provided to women who satisfied the contribution conditions but who were not in employment. I understand that the number of women claimants in respect of the year 1991 was 620.  In addition, the minimum payment in maternity benefit at that time was reduced from £76 to £60.</P>
    <P>In relation to the section which deals with maternity allowances, section 8 (1), I would like to know if the Minister intends to reverse the decision taken last year in the regulations referred to.  This is not clear.  These women should be entitled to maternity benefit and it was anti-family and children to introduce this regulation in this way.  The least we can do for women who find themselves in this situation is to deal with this issue, given that the number affected is not enormous.  In a sense we are reducing maternity coverage and removing entitlements.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of policy and reform, is this an attack on entitlements? Surely, if people have entitlements one does not remove them arbitrarily.  It appears that is what has been done in this case to the detriment of women.  This is extraordinary given that many Irish women are living in poverty. I am concerned because the issue of the provision of social security for women during pregnancy and the period after birth is of considerable importance in the overall context of our social welfare system, <Col N="484" /> given the number of births per annum. This area has received little detailed consideration.</P>
    <P>The social welfare provisions have developed or in some cases disappeared without any great discussion on the intent of maternity policy.  In 1991 the Minister announced a pilot scheme for expectant mothers on unemployment benefit which would mean that they would not have to sign on for a period of 12 weeks and payments would be made through the post.  What were the results of this pilot scheme?  Let me point out that the maternity allowance covers a limited category of persons: it does not cover the self-employed, as do similar schemes in Denmark and the United Kingdom. Indeed we are out of step with a number of our European partners in terms of both the duration and amount of maternity benefits.  While I am conscious that the European Directive on maternity is in place, this lays down the minimum standards and we should be aiming for an improvement on these.  In fact, we should be trying to lead the way in the development of appropriate allowances in this area.  I urge that it be prioritised, given that it is a support for families.</P>
    <P>There is also evidence from a recent survey that the means-tested maternity grant and the exceptional needs payments under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme are not, in many cases, being taken up by those eligible for them. Apparently many applicants have been deterred from applying because of the difficulties of receiving these benefits. The number taking up the maternity grant declined from 6,108 in 1984 to 3,963 in 1988 &mdash; about 7 per cent of the total number of births.  This is quite a low take-up, given that all mothers who have a medical card are entitled to this grant and 35 per cent of the population is covered by the medical card.  I would like to see a review of these benefits as well as a comprehensive policy in this area. Resources should be directed in this area so that support to families can be developed.  I would like to see an information campaign on this issue.</P>
    <P>I was concerned at some of the comments <Col N="485" /> made by the previous speaker who seemed to imply that students were fraudulently claiming social welfare.  If there has been fraud, it should have been investigated and appropriate action taken.  We should not remove entitlements on the supposition of fraud until it has been proven and steps taken to eliminate it.  We have evidence that many low income students are debarred already from third level education. Indeed I was speaking to a lecturer this morning who told me about the poverty that many students are living in and the great efforts they have to make to continue their education.  I think that we do not have enough respect for students and for those who try to put themselves through third level education, very often with extreme difficulty.  I was told there are numerous requests for endowment grants and many students can hardly feed themselves properly.</P>
    <P>We should not make assumptions about students when the reality is often very different for many of them. I contend that this provision will also hit the families of those students who find it very difficult to go to college in the first place. It will prove a further barrier to young people availing of third level education. How does this fit in with the Labour Party promises in the Programme for Partnership Government to make education more equitable and accessible to a wider group in our society?  Will the Minister clarify the hardship criteria that will apply to supplementary welfare allowance? Surely further hardship will be caused to many students by their disqualification from supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
    <P>There are many assumptions behind this.  There is the assumption that parents will support young people right through their education, although we know that is not always possible.  There is an assumption that low income single parent students will get through the summer months.  Surely tighter policing of the system is required if one is concerned about fraud.  Has the fact that certain groups of people are suddenly no longer entitled to sign on more to do with reducing the number on the live register than <Col N="486" /> any real concern about the cost to the system?  I suggest it has.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that work has been done in implementing the equality Directive, and that it is expensive to implement.  I call for a clear information campaign once again on equality.  My colleague, Deputy Allen, gave figures for the number of women who have been forced to seek legal advice to get what is owed to them, and this is not acceptable. Why should people have to consult a solicitor to get their entitlements?  We should have an information campaign setting out clearly what equality measures will be enacted in the coming year and what payments will be made to women.  Clearly there is confusion and we need a targeted information campaign to clear it up.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that carers are one of the most unsung groups in our society. Increasingly men are taking on this caring role.  The carer's allowance is a step in the right direction.  The increase in the allowance is very welcome but we need a greater extension of eligibility for it because it is still too narrowly based.  We should make it more accessible and this should be undertaken in conjunction with the development of community care services in addition to the provision of more residential accommodation.  We should clarify who is eligible for support in residential accommodation. There are pre-requisities if we are to support those who are caring for others.  Let me point out that the priority rates set out in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> are not being achieved.  Payments were increased by 5 per cent but a 10 per cent increase is necessary to bring the level of payment up to the commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>Will the Minister clarify the question of the personal number?  Clearly the public have to be convinced that there are adequate protections built into this development and that adequate confidentiality is ensured so that it is not abused in any way. People need to feel confident that the personal number will <Col N="487" /> give us a better and more targeted system.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, of course I welcome the increase in the carer's allowance and a number of other provisions in this Bill. Sadly, however, it does not contain a reforming strategy as evidenced by the number of areas I highlighted which shows that we have not yet taken on board the implementation of the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare which in 1987 the Minister committed himself to do.  The Minister said then that he would be operating within the framework of the Commission on Social Welfare.  I urge the Minister to become more reforming and tackle some of these very difficult issues.  I am not suggesting that these are simple reforms, but in the four areas I mentioned, the unit of payments, child benefit and child dependency, social insurance contributions and the concept of a couple in relation to pre-retirement allowances, reform is needed.  I have put some questions to the Minister and I look forward to hearing his responses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Ms Burton) Joan Burton">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that this year's Social Welfare Bill has been introduced against a difficult economic background, but in spite of this we have managed to make significant improvements.  In this House yesterday and in earlier statements Deputy De Rossa joined the bandwagon of attacks on Labour's participation in Government. It is regrettable that Deputy De Rossa, who is not here at present, should display the sort of culpable ignorance of the position which is normally associated with other commentators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party's participation in Government is solemnly reflected in this Bill, in particular in the major improvement in child benefit, in the overall level of increases and in the reversal of the major cutbacks introduced last year.  One of the aims and objectives of Labour participation in Government has been to stop and reverse the drift of policy <Col N="488" /> towards more and more cutbacks that had a severe and unfair effect on many disadvantaged families.  We made this an election issue and, with a degree of poetic licence, some colleagues coined the phrase &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; to draw attention to the dramatic form of those cuts.  In Government we have succeeded in doing what we promised.  The most draconian of the cuts have gone completely and others have been substantially modified. Deputy De Rossa, therefore, is flogging a dead horse.</P>
    <P>In regard to exceptional needs payments, it has been reiterated again and again that the circulars issued by the Department of Social Welfare do not limit the discretion of community welfare officers in dealing with families in need but, more importantly, we have provided an extra £12.5 million for this scheme this year.  How could a 14 per cent rise in money available be possibly considered a cutback?  This is a major boost for the scheme.  The scheme needs a total and rigorous review and this is taking place at present.  We must examine other ways of helping families to cope.  We are doing that and at the same time we are ensuring that substantially more money is available for the scheme.  We are involved also in talks with various agencies and commercial operations such as the ESB and the gas board in regard to payments for fuel.</P>
    <P>The Minister and I read with great interest and concern the reports produced by the Combat Poverty Agency, which highlight the deficiences in the current scheme.  As a constituency Deputy, I am aware of the type of difficulties which users of the scheme experience and express to Deputies on all sides of the House.  For example, some people are included in the scheme, others are excluded and it may appear that community welfare officers are not exercising their discretion fairly.  This is a complex scheme but many people are dissatisfied with it.  Our objective is to make the scheme more acceptable to those it serves and to target the most needy.  A figure of £12.5 million extra for this scheme cannot be described as a cutback.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="489" /> In relation to treatment and disability benefit, the main concern which arose from last year's cutback in treatment benefit was the effects that would have on the long-term unemployed.  This benefit is being restored to the long-term unemployed and to some pensioners who have been adversely affected by the changes. This is a major reversal of last year's policy.  Similarly, disability benefit is being restored to the long-term unemployed. Therefore, we will not have a repeat of the scenes which occurred last year of unemployed people who became ill having to go the community welfare officer for assistance.</P>
    <P>We have significantly improved the position for people on unemployment assistance who get casual work.  The amount of the earnings to be disregarded is to be increased by 50 per cent.  This will restore the incentive for people on unemployment assistance to take up casual work.</P>
    <P>As I have outlined, we have reversed many of the cutbacks; but I would like to emphasise the positive shift in policy towards improvement in child benefit, the first such improvement in many years. Child benefit improvement was the cornerstone of the Labour Party's election programme.  It is an essential weapon in the fight against family poverty and it is our intention to continue that improvement. Research, both in Ireland and abroad, shows that child benefit is used to very good effect and benefits in particular families in need.  Child benefit has no effect on the incentive to work.  Therefore, it is preferable to route extra help for families through this benefit.  All the evidence suggests that child benefit is well spent and is a major benefit for all families, especially for those who are less well off.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, it is paid to the caring parent, who in most cases is the mother, and that is an additionally desirable feature of the scheme.  As a Labour Minister of State, I am proud to be associated with this measure and hope to see child benefit become the major instrument of child support.  It is difficult to understand how anybody can say that the Labour Party has not had an impact on <Col N="490" /> this Bill and on social welfare policy when there has been such a major improvement in this key policy measure.</P>
    <P>The question of incentives, which has been brought up by many Deputies during the debate, brings me to an issue raised yesterday which is part of my brief &mdash; the integration of tax and social welfare. I intend to make an announcement in the near future in regard to the formation of a working party to examine this area and to bring forward proposals for change.  This will be a small expert group who will initially identify the poverty traps caused by the current lack of integration.  It is my intention that these traps be rectified as soon as possible and that the working group then tackle the longer term problems of integration. I intend to ensure that this will not be a lengthy process and I hope that the initial phase will produce some proposals for adoption in next year's budget.</P>
    <P>Some of the difficulties arising from lack of integration between the income tax and social welfare codes, such as the existence of poverty traps for those in low paid employment, are clear-cut and Deputies from all sides have detailed them on many occasions.  Correspondingly, integration of the tax and social welfare systems is often seen as a solution; but integration means different things to different people, alternative sets of reforms which can all claim to be unifying the tax and welfare systems.  There are, therefore, important choices to be made in regard to the overall shape and direction of reform in the medium to long term.</P>
    <P>The implications of some of those choices can be teased out analytically, but many require empirical analysis to show the difference in costs, tax rates and so on required to finance the changes as well as the broader redistributive and incentive effects of the various reforms. Even if long term goals are agreed, many important questions about the process of reform need to be answered.  It is sometimes argued that a big bang approach is needed to avoid the reform process being stalled by the opposition of those who have a vested interest in the <i>status quo.</i><Col N="491" /> There is some merit in this argument, but it is not clear that such an approach is feasible.  If an incremental process must be used careful attention should be given to the phasing and packaging of various measures and in some cases to the issue of whether interim payments cushioning losses would be provided to avoid the process becoming stalled in this way. There is need for a long overdue and honest debate in this House on the integration of the tax and social welfare systems with a view to the best way of approaching such reform.  Inevitably in this process there will be changes which will affect some people for the better and may have adverse effects on others.  We must face up honestly to the process and to the political questions which such reform involves.</P>
    <P>In regard to the provisions in the Social Welfare Bill relating to students, I represent a constituency which probably has more deprived communities than any other constituency, including areas such as north Clondalkin, Cherry Orchard, parts of Ballyfermot and west Blanchardstown.  I am very conscious that the vast majority of students do not come from deprived backgrounds.  I do not regard students as unemployed during their summer holidays and therefore I have no problem with the removal of entitlements from them during the summer months. It should be remembered that the age of qualification for unemployment assistance &mdash; 18 years &mdash; was introduced at a time when relatively few people stayed in school up to that age.</P>
    <P>However, I am also conscious that it is very difficult for students from unemployed or otherwise deprived backgrounds to survive to and through third level.  I am pleased that in the proposed scheme students whose parents' income is solely from social welfare will be eligible to take part in a community work scheme or for the equivalent of their unemployment assistance entitlements during the summer months provided they apply from their homes.  This provision will be incorporated in regulations.  It <Col N="492" /> will ensure that students from deprived backgrounds will receive every assistance possible to complete third level education. As somebody who until very recently worked in third level education and who went through third level by way of scholarships and part time work, I am very conscious that families have to struggle to send their children to third level education, particularly those from deprived working class backgrounds where parents are unemployed.  In my experience as a teacher for many years in a third level institution, unfortunately the number of such students attending third level institutions is very small. I make no bones about saying that any assistance by way of the social welfare code should be directed at those students with the greatest need.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that mature students will be exempt from the regulations under section 14, contrary to statements and letters I have seen in the newspapers. I was surprised to hear the Progressive Democrats spokesperson on Social Welfare use the term &ldquo;droning on&rdquo; in respect of the reference by my colleague, the Minister for Education, to deprived children. I regret that references to the poor and marginalised and to a determination to bring them in from the margins should so bore Deputy O'Donnell.  The Deputy will have to listen to many more boring statements about the poor and marginalised in the future.</P>
    <P>In relation to equal treatment, a matter raised by a number of Deputies, the provisions for paying equal treatment arrears to married women for the period December 1984 to November 1986 are contained in the European Community Social Welfare Regulations, 1992, Statutory Instrument No. 152 of 1992.  The regulations provide for, first, the payment of a higher personal rate in the case of social welfare payments; second, the extended duration of unemployment benefit; third, payment of a household supplement in respect of a dependent husband and/or children; and, fourth, payment of unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure that married women affected by the equal treatment provisions <Col N="493" /> were aware of their rights to claim arrears the Department carried out a survey of potential claimants in June and July 1992.  Some 111,000 married women were identified from these records and were issued with personalised claim forms.  There was also an extensive advertising campaign in the media and as a result a further 9,500 claim forms were issued, totalling 120,500.  A separate section was set up in my Department to process the claims.  Payment of arrears is made on a phased basis in 1992, 1993 and 1994 at a total cost of £57.5 million. Arrears due in respect of the higher personal rates and the extended duration of unemployment benefit have been made within three months of the decision of the deciding officer.  Payment of arrears in respect of household supplement and unemployment assistance entitlement will be made in 1993 and 1994.  Therefore there is no reason for women whose claims have been recognised to fear that payments will not be made.  Provision was made in the budget for the payment of such claims.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase in the budget in moneys made available for the various schemes operated by the Department for community and voluntary groups and locally based women's groups. In many deprived areas such as those in my constituency I mentioned earlier, in areas where unemployment is at an unacceptably high level, community schemes involving partnership between the local community and other agencies, which are partly assisted by funding from the Department of Social Welfare, have given hope.  With the developments that are taking place at present in terms of the national plan and county enterprise boards, together with the work being done by the Department of Social Welfare, we are developing a participatory model of community development.  It is important that there be community involvement and that development takes place from the bottom up.  I am pleased the Department has been able this year to announce substantial increases in the amounts of money being made available in this area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="494" /> In the case of locally based women's groups, many groups involved in these schemes have done a great deal of work in their own communities in terms of the personal development of women.  This adds to the growth of the community and helps identify solutions and the kinds of development deprived communities want to see.</P>
    <P>In addition this year we are making substantial extra resources available for schemes to combat moneylending.  In many deprived areas families who unfortunately are not in a position to budget properly have to resort to moneylending. Pilot moneylending schemes operated by the Department involve detailed work with families experiencing difficulties. The extra money allocated in this year's budget will allow for an expansion of these schemes.  The work involved in assisting families in terms of budgeting is slow and tedious, but this is a worthwhile scheme that will bear fruit.</P>
    <P>From 1 May the Department, on a pilot basis, will make arrangements at a number of selected exchanges to allow people on social welfare to make direct payments in relation to matters such as rents and utilities. This will ensure that people on social welfare have the same facility as have people with bank accounts.  It will probably take some time to develop this system but it is important to offer the same consumer facilities to families on social welfare as are available to families with access to banking and other credit systems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome some of the points made by the Minister of State but I would like to know more about them. The Bill, like the budget, is deeply conservative. The Minister's speech yesterday, the contents of the Bill and the budget did not indicate an appetite for a radical overhaul of the social welfare system to bring about an integration of tax and welfare or to bring about with any vigour the kind of change people would have expected on foot of the apparent will for change in the minds of the electorate in the recent election. Yesterday in a statement the Minister said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="495" /> This year's Social Welfare Bill is the first major piece of legislation to come before the House in fulfilment of the new partnership Government's programme to protect and improve the position of those dependent on social welfare.</P>
    <P>The protection and improvement of the position of those dependent on social welfare has been the agreed consensus in the case of every administration for almost two decades.  That consensus is shared by the Progressive Democrats. The Minister simply restated what is accepted by all and the statement was unexceptional in terms of the ambition of any welfare Bill.  That was a very limited statement of intent.  We were entitled to presume that in this the first welfare legislation of the Government we would see change and that it would have signalled an appetite for change. The Bill does not do that.</P>
    <P>I was most disappointed that neither the budget nor the Social Welfare Bill have produced any significant policy signal with regard to what is being explored in this public forum, the integration of the tax and welfare codes. There are different models one could look at and they have different costs and implications for individuals.  I urge the Minister, in the context of my response to this Bill and to the budget, not to hang about on this.  The Minister described this as the something that potentially can take a long time.  Of course the Minister wants some basis to help him wade through choices, but he should not let some science about all this bamboozle us, because what we have is failing.  It is trapping too many people into a web of dependency. Some of those people could be lifted out of it.  There is no point in perpetuating the politics of dependency where it is possible to remove people from that web.</P>
    <P>Apart from the integration of tax and welfare, which is a very big issue, many things could have been considered this year but they were not. Each year we hear talk about taking people out of the tax net but they slip back into it. Will <Col N="496" /> someone in the Department of Social Welfare begin to talk seriously to whoever organises exemption limits, for instance, in the Department of Finance and recognise that it is a useless way to try to meet the objective of keeping lower paid employment on the map for people who might be able to take it?  Under the conventional system when one takes up employment one loses the FIS, the medical card and various other rights but there must be some way to induce more people from dependency into work.  The Minister should not allow the big plan to get in the way of solid progress in the meantime. I am disappointed that the Bill does not show an appetite to progress even within the conventions we have. The Bill only tinkers with the problems but it does not display any novelty.  It is disappointing when we have a new partnership Government who loudly proclaimed the kind of things it wanted to do, that we cannot find, in its first major welfare legislation, even a hint of the imagination or innovation we expected. Improvements could have been made in the system without a big plan for radical change.</P>
    <P>On the tax/welfare interaction with employment, under the last administration in which my party took part, we introduced in welfare terms, the second chance education process.  So far as it goes, it has been good.  Two thousand people who were unemployed are availing of second level education and 330 are in full-time third level education.  What is happening in this area, in trying to get more people into voluntary work and with regard to the PRSI exemption, is marginally useful.  The schemes are of significance but we are failing to sell them to many people who, sensitised to their wroth, would probably want to go back for a second chance in education and take up voluntary work.  We are failing in this.</P>
    <P>With regard to the FIS, for instance, genuine attempts were made in the past few years to push this scheme.  We must impress on people the worth of schemes that lift them out of unemployment, that give them hope while looking after their welfare needs.  Some of the ideas have <Col N="497" /> been there for some time and they are good as far as they go.  Why are they not reaching more people?  There is a problem which must be addressed in relation to policy and the Department finding a better way to advertise some of the innovative material which has been tried and tested and which works reasonably well.  The Minister yesterday talked about supporting people returning to work and said:</P>
    <P>I am considering at present a new programme of measures to support people in making the transition back into the workforce....  This programme of measures will build on the success of the area-based companies set up under the PESP working closely with the new County Enterprise Partnership Boards.</P>
    <P>The county enterprise board idea first saw the light of day in a period of bad political and economic weather which my own party was riding out, along with the Minister's party, in Government last autumn.  It was a bad week because, regrettably, unemployment always seems to set an historic record every time we examine it and because various companies were contemplating closing down plants.  Lo and behold, up came this umbrella on a wet day which was called county enterprise boards.  Ever since then, like the Kit-Kat advertisement on television, we have not been able to work out whether it is a biscuit or a bar.  As a result, months after we discovered this phenomenon we still do not know what it is.</P>
    <P>God bless the Minister for Employment and Enterprise, Deputy Quinn, who he is now stuck with something which the Department of the Taoiseach wisely got rid of, because they did not know what to do with it either.  I have two fears about it. The first is that it will turn into an awful bureaucracy with over 40 chief executives, who theoretically are interested in partnership and bottom up development.  However, because of the manner in which the wheels grind and systems work, I wonder, as I look at the Leader programmes and the amount of <Col N="498" /> bureaucracy being forced on these partnerships, just how flexible our systems can be in terms of the State.  My second fear is that they will be full of political mickey mouse gimmicks.  I am worried about it.  If we want to encourage a return to work on a partnership basis there are many models that can be examined and the idea is excellent. There is a question mark about the worth of the county enterprise boards.  I realise money has been provided in the budget, but I suggest to the Minister for Enterprise and Employment &mdash; through his colleague the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods &mdash; that if the Minister were to have some mature reflection on the matter and decide there was a better way to approach the task, he would have the full support of my party.  I do not think he should get into this awful Banquo's ghost haunting this administration when the last administration used it as an umbrella on a wet political day.  By all means encourage a return to work, but I have grave doubts about the kit-kat formula being the best route to follow.</P>
    <P>The Minister alluded to the PRSI exemption scheme which was introduced last year.  I am glad to note that it brought 1,100 people back into the workforce, though I thought the figure would be greater.  I query the level of penetration of these schemes.  One can bring a horse to water, but that is as much as one can do.  I am surprised it has not had a better outreach and that it has not gone further down into the system.  As the Minister told us, for anyone on the average industrial wage of £260 per week the PRSI exemption amounts to a subsidy of £31 per week or £1,647 per year.  I accept the Minister's description of the PRSI exemption as a subsidy in that context.  In regard to PRSI in ordinary employment, even hitting people the minute they earn money, since there is no allowance system of substance, like the tax free allowance system, PRSI is a tax on employment and when it is removed it is implicitly an employment subsidy.  If we are to integrate these systems we will have to cut out the mickey mouse formula of regarding taxes on work as something <Col N="499" /> else.  We know that PRSI contributes substantial funding and that the funding rules allow certain entitlements, but the plain fact is that if Paul Newman can get Barrettstown Castle for £1 per year we could devise a scheme that gives funding rights for £1 per year and get down to the tax welfare integration, including PRSI. There are plenty of schemes that could be examined.  I do not accept the logic that one is always stuck with the fund process.  There are ways of getting over it. Even at the lowest rates of pay one is liable for PRSI, which is another disincentive, unlike the tax free allowance system.  I welcome the logic which the Minister sees in extending the exemption scheme.  Extending it is a subsidy and continuing the way we approach it is a tax on work and we have got to face the logic in both directions.</P>
    <P>On the matter of the integration of the systems, I would urge the Minister of State to make haste but not to ignore changes in our conventional system.  In the meantime I hope that when choices have to be made they will be discussed in this House and that the political choices on reform will be made in this Chamber and in the Seanad and that, no matter how committed we are to partnerships, we will not hand over the right to choose in the public interest to various other consensus seeking bodies unrelated outside the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I believe in having a consensus approach if it works &mdash; and it beats the hell out of conflict &mdash; but it cannot be used to siphon away from the democratic process the general public will in this House and in the Seanad.  If we are to make basic political choices let us have the opinions of those who should be heard, but let this House decide and let us not hand over to others outside the House basic choices for our society.</P>
    <P>I should like to turn to the question of students.  I listened with great interest to the Minister of State, who spoke about her own background going to college, how she got there, how she worked there and how she knows students and so on. I know it well, I too went down the same <Col N="500" /> road, but I have a problem with a few things concerning students.  The Minister told us yesterday that about 12,000 full-time third level students take up unemployment assistance and an unspecified number claim a rent allowance, because they live away from home, which costs in the region of £8 million per year.  He went on to say that:</P>
    <P>This cost could rise to at least £60 million a year plus the cost of rent allowance if all students were to take up this practice.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Bill hides something I did not see, but when I examine section 210 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, I know that if I am unemployed and want assistance I must put in a claim.  The claim is means tested and is in accordance with section 210.  I know section 210 (d) refers to the value of benefit or privilege enjoyed by such person, which includes the income of that person's household, if there is any contribution.  I wonder whether this item has been dropped from the legislation. All students could not benefit because the rules would not allow them.</P>

The Minister will give voluntary work-dole a bad name if he has consulted nobody, has done no homework, has set up no schemes but has used it to drive people off the dole.

Essentially, it is a Cromwell-style policy &mdash;&ldquo;To hell with wherever you are at and move to somewhere else because we do not give a damn and we have not even consulted.&rdquo;  The Minister can say it is a new Administration and that it needs time.  If the Government needs time it should take time, but it should not introduce Mickey Mouse, half-baked, ill thought out measures which do not add up to anything and only drive people off the dole.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State referred to the contribution made by my colleague, Deputy O'Donnell, and her reference to the Minister for Education droning on about people who are underprivileged. It is not that we lack any concern, compassion or sympathy for people who are underprivileged.  The question <Col N="502" /> Deputy O'Donnell asked was how somebody in Cabinet who was worried about the underprivileged could turn a blind eye to the Cromwell boot being used to remove from the welfare system very many needy students who draw the dole. These students have been told, &ldquo;We might come up with a scheme; we have not come up with one yet as we are only in office a short while; we will come up with a way of getting rid of you this summer, whether or not we have a scheme&rdquo;.  My colleague was perfectly correct in asking if the Minister for Education with all her concern for the underprivileged had bothered to speak up and ask questions.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill and compliment the Minister on the improvements he has proposed in the social welfare area.  Of course, the Minister is carrying on his tradition &mdash; he has shown himself to be a man of great skill in the Department of Social Welfare and a man who cares greatly for social welfare recipients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main improvements proposed in the Bill include the increase of 3.5 per cent from next July in the weekly rates of social insurance and social assistance payments, a special increase of 4.9 per cent from next July in all short-term payments and a subtantial increase of 26.6 per cent from next September in child benefit, bringing the rates to £20 for each of the first three children and £23 for the fourth and any subsequent child.  There will be increases also in the income supplement from next July.  All families in receipt of the family income supplement will be £12 per week better off.  This improvement has to be welcomed.  There will also be a special increase of 11.7 per cent in the carer's allowance giving a new rate of £59.20 a week, which is in line with the long-term rate.  This increase is to be very much welcomed. There will <Col N="503" /> also be increases in the minimum and maximum rates of maternity benefit and a special increase of 20.6 per cent in the orphan's non-contributory pension which will be the same as orphan's contributory allowance of £39 per week.</P>
    <P>In the limited time available to me I wish to concentrate on a few points.  I would like to draw the Minister's attention to two facets of our social welfare system which I regard as anti-family and which require urgent attention. The first deals with the situation where in most cases young people cannot avail of unemployment assistance unless they are prepared to leave their homes.  At a time when our young people are under extraordinary social pressure due to the national unemployment crisis, I find it astounding that we should be offering incentives to vulnerable young people to leave the protection and comfort of the family home so as to accommodate artificial regulations.  The position is that unemployment assistance is means tested on the income of the household, with no regard being given to the independent needs of the young applicant.  The consequences of this regulation is that in most cases the young applicant will receive no payment while living at home but if he is prepared to move out of the home into a flat or digs the social welfare system will pay him, even adding a rent allowance.</P>
    <P>Young people are suffering frustration and depression as a result of the shortage of job opportunities.  We must be concerned about the influences which young people, scarcely adults, will fall under once they leave the protection of the family home.  A substantial proportion of our crime is committed by young people, some of whom may be under the influence of drugs.  How can we pretend to be a caring society if we force young people out of their family homes before they can collect a few pounds in dole?  I call on the Minister, whom I know to be a caring man, to address this problem immediately and to re-establish the reality behind the Irish reputation of a society <Col N="504" /> in which the integrity of the family is highly cherished.</P>
    <P>I wish to make an earnest appeal to the Minister on behalf of the thousands of families who are suffering from the most flagrant prejudice.  I am referring to those families where, unfortunately, the mother has died, the father has become a widower and the children have been orphaned.  A structure is in place whereby a family which loses the father is supported by the State. While there is always room for improvement, it must be admitted that these supports are wide-ranging in terms of the State's ability to pay.  The absence of a similar structure for a family which loses the pivotal presence of the mother is inequitable and grossly unjust.  I am sure all Members know of cases where a man has had to adopt both the role of the father and the mother in the family.  His life may be turned upside down by not only having to provide for the economic needs of his family but also to give them the level of care, attention and protection they require, a task which he previously shared with his partner.  Admittedly, the lone parent's allowance covers widowers but it is means tested and widowers are excluded from the State insurance schemes. Furthermore, the State penalises the family by taxing the wage earner as a single person, thus drawing money from them.  This is an horrendous penalty to be paid by people who have fallen victims to the loss of a mother.</P>
    <P>Much has been made in recent weeks of the denial of equal treatment to half our population when they were refused membership to an exclusive private club. I ask the advocates of equality to join with me in championing the cause of families who have fallen victim to the most pernicious and destructive prejudice by the State on the basis of the person's gender.  Explanations have been given about the complications which arise in giving relief to the families of widowers. Even if only one family in the State suffered such inequitable treatment, the excuse of administrative inconvenience or cost would be grossly insufficient.  I call on the Minister to <Col N="505" /> address these issues at the earliest possible opportunity.  I know that there are many other demands on the resources of the State, many other provisions the Minister would like to have included in the Bill and many changes he would like to introduce in the social welfare code generally, but these two issues, affecting as they do families, the young in our society and widowers and their families, are central to our social welfare system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Before dealing directly with the different aspects of the Minister's proposals, I wish to refer briefly to the context in which the Bill has been drafted.  There are a number of factors in our society which combine to place a particularly heavy burden on our social welfare system.  The high level of unemployment continues to exert huge demands on the Department's resources. Changes in the structure of our population are having a major effect on the level of unemployment and a range of other matters which, in turn, have a direct impact on the need for social welfare support.  For example, the high birth rate, particularly during the seventies and early eighties, led to a major increase in the number of young people.  In addition, increased life expectancy has resulted in a growing number of elderly people in our society.  These population trends have led to a sustained increase in the level of revenue required to fund schemes such as the children's allowance, old age pensions and a range of associated social services.</P>
      <P>Anyone who refuses to acknowledge the effects of such population dynamics on the fundamental ongoing needs of the Department is unlikely to play a constructive part in any attempt to improve further the quality of support given by the State to those with the greatest need. I stress the need for more realism when examining current social welfare proposals. The revenue available to carry out improvements is limited.  This year's budget provides £3.7 billion for the Department of Social Welfare but there is great need in the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Minister, Deputy <Col N="506" /> Woods, for his foresight and his listening ear.  He has introduced enlightened schemes and made changes to eliminate bureaucracy and anomalies.  This is evident also in this Bill, which shows his continuing concern for those most in need.  I appeal to the House to support him in this matter.  The Minister has managed to introduce a number of welcome proposals.  An overall view of this Bill shows that increases have been made across a wide range of services in line with the rate of inflation.  In a number of areas increases exceeding the likely rate of inflation are evident.  I welcome the significant increase in short-term unemployment benefit and disability benefit. The substantial increase in child benefit is likely to be of great help to many families who depend on it as a supplement to their weekly cashflow.</P>
    <P>One is aware of the extra financial strain imposed on young couples by a multiple birth.  The grant of £200 to mothers of twins is imaginative and welcome. The relatively high rate of twin births may surprise some people &mdash; it is approximately one in 80.</P>
    <P>These provisions are supplemented by a number of other positive proposals covering a wide range of services and including the carer's allowance, maternity allowance, orphan's pension and limits placed on the family income supplement.  A number of smaller changes add to the generally positive nature of the proposals.  The decision to provide a free colour television licence to certain pensioners is an example.</P>
    <P>Improvements in the PRSI exemption scheme are welcome because they provide an incentive to employers to increase staffing levels.  There are also proposals which will directly benefit the individual. For example, recipients of pre-retirement allowance may be exempted from liability for self-employment contributions.</P>
    <P>I strongly support the Bill's specific proposals and its general shape and direction. The Minister, and his staff, have managed to achieve significant progress within major financial constraints.  The revenue needed to fund the Department <Col N="507" /> of Social Welfare is enormous, with daily requirements exceeding £10 million. Almost half our population receive weekly payments from the Department. This very high level of demand places a major burden on the State's income and consequently places severe limitation on the ability of the Government to carry out much needed improvements in our tax system.  The full acknowledgement of the major revenue requirements of Departments such as Social Welfare, Health and Education must be made before we can realistically consider any proposals regarding tax reform.</P>
    <P>The size of the social welfare budget makes it imperative that every effort be made to detect and eliminate systematic abuse of the system, which ultimately reduces the resources available for genuine recipients.  Progress in detecting such abuse must not lead to a reduction in the level of courtesy and respect shown to the genuine recipient.</P>
    <P>The high level of demand on the Department of Social Welfare highlights the urgent need for the creation of greater national wealth.  This can only take place when we have a systematic and sustained period of industrial development and growth. Such growth will only be possible through the joint efforts of all the social partners.  I strongly support the maximum possible level of co-operation between the Department of Social Welfare and all other Departments which are directly or indirectly involved in economic development.  It is vital that the quality of information coming from the Department of Social Welfare in terms of the skills and potentials of the unemployed be of the highest possible standard.  Such information should play a central role in determining the location and nature of new industries.  Similarly, comprehensive information on the skills base among the unemployed is fundamental to the design and operation of training programmes which are likely to have the greatest impact in terms of job creation. I stress the twin needs of maximum co-operation between related Departments and agencies and quality <Col N="508" /> information if we are to make early and significant progress in reducing unemployment.</P>
    <P>Every Member is aware of the major problems in society and the need for support from the State.  It is important to realise that the cake is only a certain size and we must ensure that it goes to those most in need.  That does not always happen. We have a job on our hands and we must ensure that we play our part in supporting the Minister and the Government in their endeavours to channel assistance to those most in need of it.  We have made significant improvements over the years but there is still a tremendous need for support.  I compliment the Minister again on his initiative and foresight and the way he has tackled this very difficult area.  He has made welcome progress but more needs to be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  The over-bureaucratisation and other ills of social welfare have been much discussed in this House.  The major report from the Commission on Social Welfare has been lying on the shelves for years.  That report pointed the way out of the difficulties under which the system labours, but few of its recommendations have been implemented.  We have heard much reforming rhetoric from the junior partner in this Government but we are disappointed to find that they have basically tackled only six areas in this Bill, most of them traditional ones.  The Bill does not strike out into any new area and does not tackle the weight of bureaucracy on the social welfare system.  Above all, it does not address the new needs in the system.  While one welcomes the increases, although they are barely in line with the rate of inflation, one must express disappointment that other areas <Col N="509" /> have not been tackled.  That comes in the light of the rhetoric we heard about what would be done if certain people got their hands on the reins of power.  I expect the traditional attitudes of Fianna Fáil to remain pretty much the same, but in respect of the Labour Party and social welfare I am very disappointed.</P>
      <P>Because my time is limited I will speak about a few marginalised groups in society who rely on the social welfare system to survive and about the bureaucracy which they have to deal with, which does them an injustice.  I come from a rural constituency. Because of the economic situation there and the lack of outreach of Government economic policies to do anything positive for us, we find that the majority of the population rely to some extent on social welfare payments of one kind or another.</P>
      <P>Because it is widespread in my part of the world, I would like to deal with the question of small farmers who receive social welfare payments as a supplement to their income by way of small farmers' dole or small farmers' assistance.  The method of means testing for these benefits has long been a contentious issue. The procedures I see adopted towards small farmers and old age pensioners is particularly unjust.  Back in 1984 this House introduced a new system which took us away from the national assessment of income based on poor law valuation to an actual/factual system of assessment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The system that the Department operates could not be further from that.  I know this from practical experience, because I have gone before appeals officers on behalf of constituents.  Let me pay tribute to the fairmindedness of the appeals officers, all of whom I have met. Many other officers of the Department of Social Welfare, because of their lack of independence, have closed minds on so many issues.  We are told that there is nothing notional in the system of assessing small farmers; but there is, because when totting up expenses the social welfare officer will not allow for a car or for depreciation of fixed assets on a small farm. However, someone who comes <Col N="510" /> under the tax code is, by definition, better off than the poor unfortunate who is looking for social welfare, and here there is a similar system of assessing means where one can write off depreciation of fixed assets, motoring expenses and a whole lot of other items.  The unfortunate social welfare applicant cannot write off these things.  I submit to the Minister that that is a grave injustice to people who are on a very low income and who are only trying to improve their marginal income by the addition of a marginal sum which the Department can add.</P>
    <P>I would particularly mention the part of the method of determining income where it says that while the value of sales may be fixed at £4,000, the social welfare officer because of regulations has to estimate the value of sales, and that estimate always goes up. When one substracts the amount for expenses from the notionally inflated amount per gross income or value of output, one reaches an artificially inflated level of income for that person.  It is artificially inflated by the introduction of this notionality which we were told was abolished in 1984 by Act of these Houses of the Oireachtas.  The adding in of a notional aspect to people's incomes is wrong and unjust.  I understood it had been legislated out of existence by this House and that we should be dealing only with actual income in the year of operation.</P>
    <P>I want to speak about another group in society, widows.  There are about 104,300 widows in this country.  I am not quite sure how many widowers there are, but they are included in the system now.  I have great sympathy for widows because I meet so many of them during the course of my constituency work.  They are very badly treated under the social welfare system.  They are people who get themselves caught in the poverty trap within the social welfare system.  I was talking to a widow last week whose husband died some time ago.  He was in receipt of the full rate of non-contributory old age pension and also of the full adult dependant allowance for her.  Because they lived alone he was in receipt of a free electricity allowance and some other fringe benefits. <Col N="511" /> However, once the husband died the widow was reduced to the basic widow's pension with no fringe benefits other than an entitlement to apply for a fuel allowance. Widows, particularly those who live alone or who live with dependent children, should be eligible for things like free electricity, telephone rental allowance and the other fringe benefits that apply to the ordinary old age pension.  I appreciate fully that that will cost money, but because widows are a group in society that we have not done well by we owe it to them to extend those benefits to them.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of means testing is the disregarding of a certain small sum of money by way of income by the Department when making an assessment of means.  In the case of widows it is £6 a week and £7 a week in respect of non-contributory old age pensioners.  That was introduced by the Department in about 1972 and has never since been adjusted upwards.  I asked a question in the House as to whether that sum has been adjusted to take account of the value of money in all the intervening years since then.  It amazes me to find that if that adjustment were made that figure would now be of the order of £30 per individual.  It means that in assessing means for old age pensioners or widows who may have a small business the first £30 of income would be disregarded.  I ask that this figure be brought up to date. I would also ask that that figure be extended to applicants for unemployment assistance, who do not at present benefit from it.</P>
    <P>I see my colleague, Deputy Finucane, almost straining at the leash to get started, so I will hand over to him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank Deputy Connor for sharing his time with me.  I listened with interest during the last two hours, particularly to the Minister of State.  The Minister of State would appear to be a very sensitive type of person.  Any time I have seen her in the Dáil or on television speaking about the performance of the Labour Party she complained about the attacks being made <Col N="512" /> on the Labour Party within this Coalition and about the poetic licence that was taken in classifying the social welfare cuts as &ldquo;the dirty dozen&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party made those cuts very much an election issue which contributed to the success of many Labour Party Deputies, including the Minister of State, Deputy Burton.  Many Labour Party Deputies would not have been elected to the House if they had not given so much prominence to the issue.  The Labour Party gained the benefit at the polls but its Deputies in Government have to face the music.  Minister Burton said that many of the so-called dirty dozen social welfare cuts had been abolished but that is only the position in regard to some of them.  Minister Burton should realise that she is not above criticism in this regard.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the apparent element of contradiction in the budget.  The PRSI exemption announced by the Minister is welcome and represents an incentive to employers to create more jobs.  On the other hand, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment has decided to abolish the employment subsidy which was a vital mechanism to encourage people into employment.  The subsidy resulted in the creation of about 7,000 jobs at a cost to the State of less than £3,000 per job.  It is regrettable that the subsidy has been abolished.  It behoves all of us to encourge as much employment as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Deputies have spoken about the poverty trap.  The Bill offers nothing to make a dramatic improvement in the position of those caught in that trap. Throughout my constituency, throughout the country, many of those in work have an income inclusive of overtime payments of about £8,000 per year.  We all recognise the frustration of those people, if they have a few children, who find that the extra incentives built into the social welfare system such as eligibility for a medical card make it more attractive to be unemployed than to be in work.  I admire those who continue in work although it is not financially attractive for them to do so.  The taxation and social welfare codes do not remedy that <Col N="513" /> imbalance, which remains a dilemma and reinforces the poverty trap.  It is estimated that the value of a medical card is almost £500 a year, a significant sum. Eligibility for a medical card can often tempt someone who is in employment and has a family to decide that the balance tips on the side of social welfare assistance as opposed to continuing in employment.  Neither the Bill nor the budget contains measures designed to correct the imbalance and alleviate the poverty trap.</P>
    <P>The issue of eligibility for payment of the disability benefit is a great frustration for many, including public representatives. On many occasions I have been surprised when someone comes limping into my clinic, almost crippled with arthritis, and says that a medical officer has determined that he or she is not eligible for disability benefit and should be able to work.  Often a medical officer determines that someone is not entitled to payment of the disability benefit even though that person has obtained medical opinion to the contrary.  The amazing outcome is that the person concerned is frequently put on unemployment assistance.  The objective of unemployment assistance is that one has to be physically available for work. People can be put on to unemployment assistance when it is patently obvious, either because of age or a medical condition, that they are not able to work, and no employer would give them a job in times of high unemployment.  There is conflict between professional advice and medical opinion preferred on behalf of a patient and a medical referee's interpretation as to eligibility for disability allowance.  The problems need to be examined and the system should be simplified. In previous social welfare legislation the appeals system was introduced in a ministerial attempt to correct concerns but inherent deficiencies remain.</P>
    <P>The principle of the family income supplement was to give extra incentive to those in employment so that the difference between social welfare assistance and low-paid employment might be bridged.  Special surveys commissioned <Col N="514" /> from time to time show that more families are eligible for payment of the family income supplement than are taking advantage of the scheme.  It is regrettable that information on this scheme does not appear to be percolating to the employee. Various attempts have been made to publicise the availability of the family income supplement but it seems that the information has to be more directly accessible to the employee.  Would it be a good idea to advertise the scheme by way of giving each worker likely to be eligible for the family income supplement a leaflet setting out details of the scheme and what payment of the supplement would mean for a family that was eligible?  Distribution of such leaflets to all workers in factory-type employment would be a means of getting the message through to those who count.</P>
    <P>When the self-employed pension scheme was extended in 1988 many farmers, and other self-employed people, welcomed it.  The scheme was attractive in that after ten years' contribution one would at least be entitled to a contributory pension.  However, many people were caught in so far as they would not be able to make a full ten years' contribution.  Strong feelings are evident because the self-employed feel they are paying into a scheme yet when they arrive at pension age they will not be eligible for the contributory pension. If they so desire, they will be able to claw back a certain percentage of the total amount of contributions made through the years.  In many cases a farmer who decides to go ahead and claim the old age pension is forced to hand over the farm before doing so because the scheme is means tested.  Why was it never considered that a <i>pro rata</i> payment might be made for people in the self-employed pension scheme?  I envisage a system whereby someone who had made contributions for eight years might receive four-fifths of the pension and someone who had made contributions for six years might receive three-fifths.  My idea may sound simplistic but such a move would help to pacify many of those who are very upset at the impact the scheme has on <Col N="515" /> them.  There is a common perception among the self-employed that they pay in for many years but will receive no material return.</P>
    <P>The increase in child benefit is welcome. It is regrettable that the increase takes effect only from September next. Those who will benefit from the increase, mainly the women of Ireland who claim the benefit, are extremely concerned at the degree to which the increase will be eroded as a result of the VAT increase in clothing and footwear.  Yesterday those involved in the clothing industry held a demonstration to express their extreme concern about the punitive increase.  The consumer is equally upset at the increase in the VAT rates.  It seems that what the Minister is giving a family by way of an increase in child benefit is quickly being taken away by the increased cost of clothing and footwear.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  Any Minister who is given the authority to look after 1.5 million people every day has an extremely onerous task.  It is incumbent on him to ensure that that money is spent <Col N="516" /> wisely, particularly so when one realises that we spend £10 million per day, which is a major drain on the State.  Any Minister therefore must look at how the money is spent and if there is a return on the pay-outs.  He must also ascertain whether there is any hope that these people will return to the workforce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many positive aspects to the Social Welfare Bill.  I am particularly glad that the Minister has restored disability, dental and optical benefits and entitlement to treatment benefits for workers earning up to £30,000 per year and £60,000 if there are dependants.  The increases in line with inflation &mdash; in some cases above it &mdash; are also welcome as so many people are unemployed.  We are now spending £3.7 billion per year on social welfare.  The Minister has done exceptionally well in ensuring that he can bring these increases forward.  I also welcome the PRSI exemption scheme and the fact that the Minister has extended the time limit.  It is interesting to note that many people called for increased employment by reducing PRSI from October to March.  During that period 1,000 people were taken off the dole.  In many respects this is not a great number of people; one would have thought, given the sentiments expressed in this House, that at least 5,000 people would have been employed during that period. However, it is a good scheme which offers an incentive to employers to take people off the dole.  During the extension of this period I will be interested to see the exact take-up by employers in regard to this scheme, particularly as the Government examined provisions which would inspire confidence in the money markets.  It held its nerve, the borrowing requirement was kept within the limits set out and now interest rates have fallen dramatically.  The Government, in particular the Minister for Finance, can take great credit for the fact that when everybody around them were losing their heads, they were objective and singular in what they wanted to achieve.  Now, within a very short space of time they have reaped the reward of low interest rates.  The prognosis is that by the end of <Col N="517" /> the year interest rates will be down to single figures.  The Minister for Social Welfare must be very pleased because it will mean that people will be willing to borrow money and to invest in projects which heretofore had been put on the long finger.  I hope there will be a great uptake in regard to developing projects which will lead to increased employment and provide more money to the Minister to ensure that he can do even more for people who need it.</P>
    <P>I was a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Employment set up during the lifetime of the last Government but which has not been re-established.  One of the areas at which we looked was the suggestion that people would work for their dole and have that money topped up by local authorities, health boards or other statutory bodies.  Members of the committee thought this was a worthwhile scheme and were interested to see how it would proceed.  As part of our mandate we asked local authorities all around the country to give us an indication of how many people they could take on board if unemployment benefit was paid directly to the local authority or health board. We asked how much more would be needed to give a meaningful wage.  As I understand it, we could create up to 50,000 jobs within health boards and local authorities if that scheme was in operation.  Will the Minister state the present situation in regard to this proposal? One of the suggestions I made when debating this issue was that if we provided a training element we could apply to the EC for funding.  If we could show that part of the employment we were giving under this arrangement had a training element the EC would provide 75 per cent of the funding, thereby making a major saving to the Exchequer. At present we must pay 100 per cent unemployment assistance directly from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister referred to encouraging training and education.  I was also very pleased that as part of the Programme for Government it was intended to look at the role of the Departments of Labour and Education as it pertained <Col N="518" /> to training, apprenticeships, etc. We should initiate a scheme of training within local authorities and health boards which would perhaps allow us to get 75 per cent funding from Europe.  It would be a worthwhile investment of time and energy and I strongly urge the Minister to seriously consider this in consultation with the other Ministers concerned.</P>
    <P>I am also delighted that the Minister has provided an opportunity for part time work which includes payment of a weekly allowance by the Department.  It also provides an opportunity for people to do voluntary work without interfering with their unemployment benefits.  I should also like to draw the attention of the Minister to local partnership schemes and the difficulties caused by the 12 pilot projects, particularly in Cork.  The Minister will be aware that the scheme applies to the northside of the city, but unfortunately the southside, where I live, does not benefit from the scheme.  In a school last Christmas four people were employed, two from the northside and two from the southside.  The two employees from the northside received the double payment at Christmas but the employees from the southside did not. Obviously, they felt they were discriminated against.  The difficulty about pilot schemes which go on over a long perod of time is that they can lead to legitimate claims that there is discrimination against a particular sector. Will the Minister look at the pilot scheme to assess whether it provides a basis on which we can work?</P>
    <P>I come from a regional college background and I am interested in the provision in the Bill which relates to third level students.  Prior to the Social Welfare Bill there were extremely lenient regulations defining who could receive unemployment assistance.</P>

      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for the comprehensive nature of his reply and look forward to reading the schedule. Can the Taoiseach confirm to the House that the numbers of civil servants now employed by him and by various Ministers and Ministers of State are as many as five and six doing constituency work?  Can he explain to the House the logic of employing political activists as advisers to do the work of civil servants, then requiring civil servants to do the work of political activists engaged essentially in constituency work on behalf of Ministers?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is being somewhat naive and hypocritical trying to insinuate that civil servants are becoming involved in politics when clearly they are not.  It has been a long tradition in this House, on the part of successive Governments, that, when Ministers and Ministers of State are appointed at the Taoiseach's Department, one employs the necessary staff to carry out one's duties thereby enabling one to do the job properly.

Yesterday the complaint of the people opposite was that my answer was too long.  Today they contend my answer is too short.  There are 17 people in the three constituency offices in my Department.  I answered the other part of the question posed by Deputy Gilmore but, as usual, he was endeavouring to anticipate a different question being posed by himself.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will receive all the information he desires.  The reason the questions are being taken together is that they must be considered in the context of overall resources spent on producing statistics here and the strategy to be followed in spending those resources.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, strategy for statistics has, following on the 1985 Government White Paper <i>A New Institutional Structure for the Central Statistics Office</i>, been decided on by Government on the advice of the National Statistics Board.  The board first recommended a five year stretegy for statistics in 1988. The Government accepted the board's advice and the strategy implemented was monitored by the board in annual reports.</P>
      <P>The National Statistics Board has just recently completed work on a five-year strategy for statistics for the years 1993 to 1997.  Before putting the board's advice and recommendations to Government I propose to offer the Opposition Parties in the Oireachtas the opportunity of making an input into that strategy for statistics.</P>
      <P>I will, therefore, forward to the Leaders of the Opposition Parties a copy of the National Statistics Board's document <i>Strategy for Statistics 1993 &mdash; 1997</i> and ask that they forward any views they wish to offer within three weeks.  I, for my part, undertake to take account of any views offered in finalising proposals for Government.</P>
      <P>I am circulating detailed answers to the specific questions raised by Deputy John Bruton in the form of a statement.  I would be happy to arrange that Deputy John Bruton and the Leaders of the other parties in the House receive any other background information they require in formulating their views on strategy for statistics.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I was trying to be helpful to the Opposition.  The statement reads as follows:</P>
      <P>1.  EC Statistical Requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a considerable overlap between national and EC statistical <Col N="528" /> priorities.  Legal and other obligations under EC Directives, Regulations and special agreements limit the scope for redeploying existing CSO resources to statistics that might be of particular national relevance.  The balance between competing demands is kept under continual review by the National Statistics Board which guides the strategic direction of the CSO.</P>
    <P>The obligation to meet EC statistical requirement has improved the Irish statistical system since the country joined the Community in 1973. Examples of statistics that might otherwise have been developed at a different pace are:</P>
    <P>&mdash;Annual Labour Force Survey,</P>
    <P>&mdash;Annual Census of Industrial Enterprises,</P>
    <P>&mdash;Monthly Industrial Production Inquiry,</P>
    <P>&mdash;Monthly Industrial Turnover Index,</P>
    <P>&mdash;Annual Road Freight Survey,</P>
    <P>&mdash;Labour Cost Surveys (every four years).</P>
    <P>EC requirements are, however, often more detailed (e.g. in terms of information to be collected and sectors to be distinguished) than would normally be required for national purposes.</P>
    <P>The EC contributes partially to the cost of compiling statistics for Community purposes.  The amount expected in 1993 is approximately £2.5 million; the gross 1993 CSO Estimate is £14.76 million.  EC contributions mainly relate to start-up and development costs although an annual contribution is made towards the cost of the annual Labour Force Survey.</P>
    <P>2.  Household Budget Survey.</P>
    <P>The most recent large-scale Household Budget Survey was conducted in 1987.  A summary release giving the main national results was issued in August 1989, and the two volumes of the detailed report were published in December 1989 and June 1990.  The next Household Budget Survey is <Col N="529" /> scheduled for 1994.  This will continue the established seven-year cycle for undertaking these surveys and related Consumer Price Index weighting updatings, namely:</P>

    <P>*Results were first published in the Department of Finance's <i>Review and Outlook</i>.  Printing difficulties delayed the publication of the <i>National Income and Expenditure</i> report to the following December.</P>
    <P>The current Irish publication schedule <Col N="530" /> compares favourably with the position in the three other EC Member States who do not compile quarterly National Accounts.  These are Belgium (seven months), Greece (ten months) and Luxembourg (nine months).  New EC demands and staff losses contributed to the deterioration in publication dates in the late 1980's.</P>
    <P>Eight EC Member States (Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and the UK) compile quarterly accounts. These countries can use the quarterly results to derive initial quick estimates of annual trends in the principal macro economic aggregates.</P>
    <P>The National Statistics Board has set the objective that the CSO should publish the annual National Accounts results in the month of April following the reference year.  This is considered the best time schedule that can be achieved using the methods and data systems required to compile annual accounts.  It is hoped to achieve this objective gradually over the next few years.</P>
    <P>4.  Seminar on National Accounts on 17th June, 1992.</P>
    <P>The CSO seminar on 17 June 1992 related to the National Accounts.  It is not proposed to publish a formal report on the seminar but a copy of the papers which were presented is being placed in the Dáil Library.</P>
    <P>This was one of three seminars organised as part of the consultative process undertaken to assist the National Statistics Board establish priorities for their plan for official statistics covering the period 1993 to 1997.  The other two seminars related to Demographic Statistics and Labour Market Statistics, respectively.</P>
    <P>Invitations to the Seminar were issued to over 200 individuals representing Government Departments, Local Authorities, semi-State bodies, research organisations, the finance and banking sector, economic consultants, <Col N="531" /> representative bodies, the national press and political parties.</P>
    <P>The Seminar was well attended and consisted of a series of brief presentations highlighting the main issues of importance to users followed by open discussion.  Participants at the Seminar were strongly of the view that the overwhelming priority was to improve the timing and quality of the existing annual National Accounts.  A full set of Quarterly Accounts was considered to be a lower order priority which should be developed only after the annual Accounts were compiled according to the required standards.  In the meantime, however, participants proposed that CSO should extend the range of the monthly and quarterly indicators and undertake new inquiries to fill remaining gaps such as data on stock changes which currently make it difficult to comprehensively analyse short term economic growth.  The development of Regional Accounts was acknowledged to be a very low priority.</P>
    <P>5.  Consumer Price Index (CPI)</P>
    <P>The introduction of a monthly Consumer Price Index is not considered a national statistical priority.  A monthly index was proposed by a number of respondents to the general canvass of statistical users conducted by the National Statistics Board for the preparation of its &ldquo;1993-1997 Strategy for Statistics&rdquo;.  However, the Board does not consider this to be a national priority within the resources available for statistics.</P>
    <P>Discussions are commencing at EC level on the compilation of harmonised national indices as required under the Maastricht Treaty in the context of European Monetary Union convergence criteria.  A special Working Party has been established by the Statistical Office of the EC (Eurostat) for this purpose.  The first meeting is scheduled for June.</P>
    <P>6.  Co-ordination of Statistics Published by Other Departments</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="532" /> The CSO does not have under the Statistics Acts 1926 and 1946 any statutory co-ordinating authority in relation to the publication of statistics by other Government Departments.</P>
    <P>A co-ordinating role was proposed for the CSO in the 1985 White Paper &ldquo;A New Institutional Structure for the Central Statistics Office&rdquo; in relation to statistical standards and classification used by other Government Departments. However, it was not envisaged that the Office would be given the authority to direct Departments as to what statistics they should publish.</P>
    <P>For the preparation of its &ldquo;1993-1997 Strategy for Statistics&rdquo; the National Statistics Board took a wide view of national statistics encompassing data available from other Government Departments.  The CSO, on the recommendation of the Board, is now contacting these organisations with a view to discussing:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the statistics they currently compile, whether published or not;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the possibilities of disseminating further statistics;</P>
    <P>&mdash;plans for the redesign of computer systems or extensions to administrative systems that could generate further useful statistics;</P>
    <P>&mdash;statistical aspects (such as coding, classification or sampling) on which the CSO could provide assistance or guidance.</P>
    <P>To date discussions have been initiated with the Departments of Education, Energy, Health and Social Welfare.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply.  I now have three questions.  First, do other countries produce household budget surveys more frequently than we do, which is every seven years, in view of the fact that this is the only available information on income distribution affecting those who are not in the tax net?  In view of the Government's commitment to social justice one needs to know something about income distribution <Col N="533" /> for that purpose.  Second, why have successive Governments not accepted the recommendation in the White Paper that legislation be introduced to give the CSO an overall co-ordinating role in regard to statistics? Would the Minister consider introducing such legislation?  Finally, is the Minister of State satisfied with the recommendation that there be no information about regional income distribution, in view of the fact that if there is to be a fair system of local government reform we need to have information on the relative incomes of counties, and of one region as against another, as a basis for distributing funds fairly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to the Deputy's first question, I understand that other countries publish household budget surveys more frequently than is the case here.  However, I will check that out and will give the Deputy the information he requires as I am not aware which countries do so at present.  On the question of legislation and of giving the CSO a co-ordinating role in relation to statistics, I am looking at that matter and am favourably disposed to putting it forward. Finally, while I accept the point the Deputy makes with regard to the desirability of having regional accounts, it is not a high priority for statistics users so, basically, it has to take its place in the queue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the absence of relative income statistics on a county basis has acted to the detriment of the midland counties, in particular Counties Laois and Offaly which have traditionally been seen as having higher incomes than what they actually have.  They have lost out due to the absence of simple information about relative income statistics.  Would the Minister reconsider this in the light of our anxiety to achieve fairness for parts of the country which are not too far from his constituency and mine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Minister for agreeing to consult the Opposition parties on the new report on statistics which he is preparing. <Col N="534" /> Would he agree to extend the time limit for submissions from three to five weeks?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that there are time constraints and that we want to get the strategy document published as quickly as possible but I will try to accommodate him.  He suggested that some counties lose out but while we may not have statistics on a county or regional basis, every party has very active advocates in each one of the counties who make sure that their own county does not lose out when largesse is being dispensed, through decentralisation or various other Government policies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>On Question No. 2, the statistics required for the EC, is it the responsibility of the CSO to furnish these statistics to Europe, and if not, whose responsibility is it?  I have heard here, there and elsewhere that this country has been building up a bad reputation for returning statistical information to such a degree that it has been mooted that sanctions such as the withholding of payments will apply if our statistics and the information required are not furnished more promptly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>

      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>the steps, if any, the Central Statistics Office must take from the collection of new census data to the publication of the data on a district electoral division basis; the extent to which modern information technology is used in each of these steps; and the reason that the use of information technology has not led to any reduction in the time lag between the collection and the publication of the data.</Quest>
      <QRef>
      </QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Approximately one million completed census questionnaires are received in the Central Statistics Office from the 3,200 temporary census enumerators about six to eight weeks after census day.  When all the returns are accounted for, preliminary figures, down to the level of district electoral division, are compiled on the basis of summaries prepared by the enumerators at the end of the field operation.  In 1991 preliminary figures for over 200 urban and rural districts were published within three months of taking the census.  These figures have displayed a high degree of accuracy when compared with the final figures as these have become available.</P>
      <P>The compilation of these final figures has to await the completion of two intensive processing operations which are undertaken simultaneously.  The first is the area coding operation and involves a detailed examination of enumeration summaries, maps and listings with a view to correctly classifying every household and institution geographically.  In addition to classifying households to district electoral divisions they are also allocated where appropriate within other legally defined boundaries.  International recommendations have to be followed in determining the existence of new population clusters and in extending the suburbs of existing towns.  Detailed comparisons are also done with the previous census returns in order to ensure consistency and completeness.</P>
      <P>This area coding operation is of necessity extremely detailed and time consuming since it requires the clerical scrutiny of enumerators' maps and other field work documentation.  The application of information technology has not had a major impact on it to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second opertion entails the <Col N="536" /> detailed statistical processing of each of the 1 million individual census questionnaires. This is carried out using CSO's highly computerised network environment and for the 1991 census consisted of the detailed coding of the 33 census questions, keying the coded information to computer and subsequently editing or correcting the output generated.</P>
    <P>While information technology plays an increasingly important role in the census processing, substantial clerical resources are also needed, particularly for coding and keying the basic data.  The major gain from the use of information technology has been the ability to generate a greater variety of analyses than was possible when the results were processed clerically.</P>
    <P>The timelag between the taking of a census and the publication of final district electoral division figures for the State essentially reflects: the staff resources devoted to the production of the census results and the strategy adopted in the overall processing of the census, particularly regarding the balance between the finalisation of detailed and summary results.</P>
    <P>In response to user demand, the emphasis in the 1986 and 1991 censuses was placed on finalising basis demographic details, that is age, sex, marital status, household size and composition, as early as possible and publishing these in local population reports on a county by county basis as soon as they were available.  This strategy has been favourably received by general census users but has led to a longer publication timelag for the volume 1 report containing the full set of final DED figures for the State.</P>
    <P>In the case of the 1991 census the timelag was also longer because a census of agriculture was carried out immediately following the fieldwork stage of the population census, using the same field staff. This joint operation, resulted in savings of approximately £1.5 million over the cost of two separate operations but meant that census headquarters staff were involved in the payment of field staff for <Col N="537" /> longer periods than in previous censuses and, therefore, were not available for the processing of census of population results.</P>
    <P>A summary statistical release will be issued at the end of this month giving the final 1991 population figures for Dáil constituencies.  The final 1991 DED figures have been published already for most counties in the series of local population reports.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the delay between the taking of the census and the publication of the detailed district electoral division breakdown of the census has been longer in the case of the 1991 census than in any census since 1926?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have answered a question on this matter.  I gave detailed statistics, which I do not have at present but which the Deputy may have, which show that on average the timelag has been roughly the same since 1926.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a political matter, but will the Minister of State agree that the general public must be bamboozled, particularly younger members of the public and children who are familiar with the use of computers, that despite the availability of computers we are still slower in producing census data than in any years since 1926?  The Minister has offered fairly convincing explanations, but they are not totally convincing. Will he agree that we should examine this matter further to see if there is adequate use of computers in this area or if the use of computers is as backward in the Central Statistics Office as it is in reporting the proceedings of the Houses of the Oireachtas?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan has informed me that once the office is transferred <Col N="538" /> to Cork, data will be produced much faster.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the availability of statistics, while the general public have a great interest in getting various figures from the Central Statistics Office in regard to the census, the CSO has tried to respond to the requirements of the users of those statistics rather than appealing to what the population might consider a fitting timespan.  Nevertheless, I accept the Deputy's point and I assure him that every available opportunity is used by the statistics board and by the Central Statistics Office to avail of computerisation where possible.  In addition to the approach adopted by the CSO to meet user demands for census figures, the details of censuses now are much greater than was the case in 1926 or in the years since then.  The more detailed the statistics become the longer it takes to produce them.  When the Deputy reads the report of the statistics board he will note that it makes a number of suggestions for speeding up the process and I am open to any suggestions in that regard.</P>

      <P>When the Minister has completed his consultative process in regard to statistical requirements will he consider having a short debate in this House in view of the fact that we are all users of statistics and must have accurate and reliable ones?

The method used in recruiting staff for the office in Cork will be, first, to ask for volunteers from within the Central Statistics Office and, second from other Government Departments. Any staff shortfalls arising following that will be filled by promotion competitions and direct recruitment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>

      <P>Will the Minister explain the rationale behind spending £2.11 million to provide for the transfer of jobs from Dublin to Cork?  I appreciate that Cork will be pleased to get the spending power of the people transferred, and no doubt the office block owner will be pleased to get the rental, but Dublin is a seriously affected area in regard to unemployment with the highest rate of job losses in any part of the country.  There are no new jobs being created with this £2.11 million, therefore, I would like to know the Minister's rationale behind such move.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second question I wish to ask relates to the office space currently occupied by the Central Statistics Office. What is the status of the leaseholdings currently held by the Minister or the Office of Public Works?  The office presumably will be vacated.  To what extent will the Office of Public Works be penalised for vacating the offices or what leasehold <Col N="541" /> arrangements exist?  What costs will be incurred as a result of vacating the premises, or will they be left lying idle with rent being paid on them, as happened on previous occasions with offices held by the Office of Public Works and other Departments?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The second part of the Deputy's question is a matter for a separate question and I can supply the information to him separately.  At present the Central Statistics Office is located in three separate buildings in Dublin: in St. Stephen's Green House, Earlsfort Terrace; Ardee Road, Rathmines and Hume House, Ballsbridge.  It is anticipated that when the Central Statistics Office is transferred to Cork the residual Dublin office will be housed in Ardee Road, Rathmines. I will endeavour to get the information in relation to rent and so on for the Deputy.  I would be completely out of order in answering the first question asked by the Deputy because it relates to decentralisation, which is worthy of a separate question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may suggest, Sir, you should not be so indulgent to the Minister because the question relates to the cost implications of the proposed move and for the Minister to pretend this is a wider matter is absolute nonsense.  We are talking about the cost implications here.  Will the Minister say whether the costs he has given are net or gross costs?  That is an important question to be asked in this context.  Is the Government going to spend more or less on buildings and equipment for the Central Statistics Office after this move and is it going to employ more people after the move? What, if any, are the short term implications for employment in the Dublin and Cork areas?  It seems those are legitimate questions about the cost of this move that the Minister is seeking to avoid.</P>

      <P>The Programme for Government envisages the creation of a vigorous third banking force from within the State sector by merging ICC Bank and ACC Bank and by seeking a merger of the new entity with Trustee Savings Bank Bank. The programme also raises the possibility of involvement with a major international bank.</P>
      <P>It is intended that this issue will be pursued by the Government as quickly as possible and preliminary contacts have already been made with ACC Bank and ICC Bank.  The Deputy will appreciate that in-depth analyses are only at the initial stages and it will necessarily be some months yet before precise details of the plan may be formulated.</P>
      <P>The Association of Co-operative Banks of the European Community brings together banks with origins in the agriculture sector and its members meet regularly.  ACC Bank and the French Bank Credit Agricole are both members of this association.  At the invitation of the board and management of ACC Bank to me as shareholder, I had a courtesy meeting with Credit Agricole during their recent visit to Ireland.  Discussions were informal and ranged over a number of items of mutual interest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 53 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the concerns of retail and manufacturing interests in the clothing and footwear industry about the increase in the VAT rate which I announced in the budget.  I have had a number of meetings with representatives from the industry, as have officials of my Department.</P>
      <P>As I explained in my Financial Statement, the budget proposals in relation to VAT reflected the prevailing budgetary circumstances, the requirements of the Single Market and a desire to keep the rate of VAT on areas of expenditure which are particularly employment-intensive at the lowest possible level.  In regard to those items formerly on the 16 per cent VAT rate, because the EC Directive obliges member states to have only one rate over 15 per cent, it was no longer possible to retain both the 16 and 21 per cent rates.  While I was able to avail of the flexibility allowed by the EC agreement to move certain labour intensive services temporarily to the reduced rate, budgetary circumstances ruled out a more widespread application of a low rate to other goods and services, including adult clothing and footwear, which were previously at the 16 per cent rate, or a reduction of the standard rate. Accordingly, I decided to move these items to the existing standard rate with effect from 1 March 1993.  I should point out that there was no change in the VAT treatment of children's clothing and footwear, which remain at a zero rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise that the increases in retail <Col N="548" /> prices of the items concerned are unwelcome in current trading conditions.  Naturally the sectors facing rate increases feel aggrieved.  The Government, however, had to take a view, in formulating the budget, of what is best for the economy as a whole, in terms of promoting economic growth and the sustainable jobs which flow from it.  A significant contribution towards budgetary correction from the indirect tax area was unavoidable on this occasion.  I would point out that the financially responsible and balanced nature of the overall budget has already contibuted significantly to the downward move in interest rates which have now emerged.  This will be a major benefit to all sectors in the economy, and to the clothing and footwear industries at both manufacturing and retailing levels.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in the supply and retail of clothing there are 35,000 people employed?  Surely that industry qualifies as being labour intensive. Is the Minister aware that yesterday more than 8,000 people protested at how out of touch the Minister was and about the real threat that 3,500 jobs may be lost because there is such a slump in the clothing sector?  Is he aware that they consider it will not be a tax on consumption but on jobs because they cannot pass on this price increase to the public?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I have met sectors of the clothing industry and they inform me that the figure involved in the retail and manufacturing services is 25,000 jobs. The Government had to produce a responsible budget.  Under the new EC directive we can only have one rate over 15 per cent for the standard rate.  I made it clear last year that the 16 per cent rate was a holding rate which would change. For the clothing and footwear industries the rate moved from 10 per cent to 12½ per cent, from 12½ per cent to 16 per cent and from 16 per cent to 21 per cent.  For budgetary reasons these rates have been changed this year to comply with the EC directive.  Prior to the budget I met all of the concerns of industry.  On budget day <Col N="549" /> we had a number of questions from all parties on certain industries and I was asked to take into account the VAT levels for various sectors of industry.  I examined the position in great detail and 80 per cent of clothing and footwear bought here is imported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be 100 per cent from now on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Fifty per cent comes from the UK, 25 per cent from other European countries and 25 per cent from the Far East.  Sixty five per cent of what we manufacture in clothing and footwear is exported.  VAT remains at the zero rate for exporters.  In balancing the various demands I considered where employment lay, what was home sourced, what was indigenous and what was imported. It would have been nice to be able to bring everything down to 12½ per cent but that was not possible.  About 50,000 jobs are in the areas in which VAT was reduced from either 21 per cent or 16 per cent to 12½ per cent.  I know that most industries are under strain but not necessarily because of VAT rates or the currency crisis.  I opted for protecting the areas with most indigenous jobs.  There are far in excess of 50,000 jobs in the areas in which VAT is reduced as against 25,000 jobs in the clothing industry, half of which would have been in manufacturing, and two out of three of those jobs would relate to exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that VAT on clothing and footwear in the UK is 17½ per cent and that it will not pay retailers, from a cash flow point of view, to import more goods?  Will the Minister also agree that this will have the effect at retail level of increasing the trade through black economy casual traders? In view of the fact that this is the most jobs negative issue in the budget, will the Minister reconsider this measure in the context of the Finance Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Casual trading concerns me.  In the Finance Bill last year I introduced a number of regulations and procedures <Col N="550" /> to deal with casual trading in all industries, particularly in the clothing industry.  The VAT rate in the UK for exporters of goods from this country is a zero rating.  The people in the consumer business in the UK who pay 17½ per cent will continue to source more of their goods in Ireland.  The VAT rate works both ways.  What is bad for imports is good for exports.  Some elements of the trade are finding things very tight, but in other areas there are huge profit margins. One way or the other the standard rate is effective over the next few years.  I made my VAT decisions in the budget and I do not intend to change.</P>

      <P>Since it constitutes £150 million of his budgetary arithmetic, would the Minister at least tell us the Government's policy on the matter?  It would not reveal anything injurious to the Minister's future prospects for raising funds if he told us whether the privatisations he proposes to undertake will be, like Greencore, the selling off of assets that were already deemed worthy for privatisation, or whether the new administration is prepared to drop its apparent ideological hang-up about privatisation in the Programme for Government?</P>

      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>if, in view of his statement to Dáil Éireann to the effect that the management of Greencore had contacts with a series of potential trade purchasers of the State's shareholding in the company, without the Minister or his Department being aware of these contacts, he will give details of the steps, if any, which are being taken to ensure that shares held by him in any company are not again offered for sale without his knowledge; if he has spoken to the Board of Management of Greencore about their actions in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither the board nor the management of Greencore public limited company offered the State's shareholding in that company for sale. The question of taking any action of the type suggested by the Deputy does not therefore arise.  The position is that the company had, over recent months, made contact with a series of potential development partners.  On 16 February 1993 the company advised my Department that it had identified a US based major food company which it described as the ideal partner for the growth strategy planned by Greencore and which was interested in acquiring virtually all of the remaining State shares.  Before the Government had an opportunity to consider the proposal, several Irish food companies expressed an interest in acquiring the Government stake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should add that, under the rules of the Stock Exchange, I would, as a shareholder, be excluded from any information which would not be given to all the shareholders in the normal course. Neither I nor my Department are privy to <Col N="555" /> the workings of the board of Greencore public limited company.</P>
    <P>As I indicated to the House on 3 March last, the Government allowed a period of three weeks, which expires today, to all interested parties to put forward proposals to my Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if he accepts that a stake which he holds in the name of the Irish people, which may be worth £60 million or whatever, was being touted around by his own word &mdash; if I were permitted to quote at Question Time I would give the date &mdash; without the Minister again, in his own words &mdash; even being aware of it?  Is it not a reasonable question to ask whether against the background of the scandal which took place in the same company approximately 18 months ago, when the Minister for Agriculture and Food gave undertakings in this House that in that instance, where executives used borrowed funds from the parent company to buy a minority stake in Sugar Distributors Limited, which they resold at a sixfold profit, and it was admitted here that the Government did not know, undertakings were given to this House that we would know in future, it amounts to a dereliction of duty on the part of the Minister and his Department that we did not know our remaining stake holding was being sold off by executives in the existing Greencore company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept it is a fair question but I would reiterate what the position was.  The Greencore mangement or board did not sell any shares.  What they did was to look at what would be the best strategic advantage for the development of Greencore in the future.  As I told Deputy Rabbitte here three weeks ago, I had no knowledge that they had any of those meetings until 16 February when they advised my Department.  I should also like to inform Deputy Rabbitte that under the rules of the Stock Exchange I do not own Greencore, neither do I control the board or the management.  I am a shareholder.  Under Stock Exchange <Col N="556" /> rules I would be excluded from any information which would not be given to all the shareholders.

      <P>I cannot accept that if somebody is outside Croke Park on an All-Ireland Day selling the colours of the teams that they are there simply to offer them; they are actually engaged in the business of selling them.  The Minister for Finance owns the stake in the name of the Irish people.  There are no Stock Exchange rules that remove from him the responsibility to know if the company purported to sell off that stake.  What does the Minister purport to do if the only bidder at the end of today is a Chicago-based multinational?  For example, does he intend to have any regard to the revolt on his own backbenches or does he consider Deputy Upton and others merely to be all talk and no action?  Does he not accept that it is inconsistent with the Culliton report which argued for a State shareholding rather than to dole out grants in strategic indigenous companies? Here is a major indigenous food company and it is inconsistent with the strategy of <Col N="557" /> building up indigenous companies, capable of trading abroad, to go ahead with the sale of these shares.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte has asked a number of questions.  First, I should say that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry holds the golden share and the Minister for Finance deals with the ordinary shareholding.  In so far as the management of Greencore were selling shares that would certainly upset the Minister for Finance.  They were not selling shares.  Like any good State board they were looking at how they could strategically develop Greencore plc., how they could continue to expand it and how this could be done in the best interests of the company and agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

      <P>Whatever proposals I receive by 5 p.m. this evening will be brought to the Government in due course and they will decide what action to take. In connection with Archer Daniels and Company I do not see them as a Chicagobased company only; they are major players within the Irish economy both in employment and in investment terms. That has to be taken into account but equally any other proposals will be fully examined and evaluated.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>his views on whether women are totally unrepresented at managerial level in the Civil Service; whether he intends to take any action to redress this imbalance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be quite wrong <Col N="558" /> to suggest that women are totally unrepresented at managerial level in the Civil Service.  Of those serving at managerial level in the main general service grades, more than 25 per cent are women.  While women are still underrepresented at the higher levels in the Civil Service, I am pleased to say that the situation is becoming more balanced each year.</P>
      <P>Since 1991 the executive officer grade has been made up equally of men and women.  As that grade is one of the chief grades from which future higher civil servants will be drawn, the gender balance there is a significant step towards achieving a greater balance further up the ranks.</P>
      <P>I am happy to say that equality of opportunity is a live issue in the Civil Service.  The implementation of the policy is looked after by the equality section in my Department in close consultation with the staff side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that since 1991 the executive officer grade has been made up equally of men and women.  Can he say whether he will rely exclusively on the natural evolution of people over their career cycles to maintain this level of representation or whether any positive measures to encourage greater female representation at higher levels will be undertaken by the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe it is enough to leave the matter to natural evolution within career cycles.  Some time ago the Department set up an equal opportunities policy and guidelines group.  It has undertaken a number of initiatives &mdash; for example, the equality workshops.  I think these have been initiated in a number of Departments, but I am not too sure of the full extent of these.  I know from my time in the Department of Labour that all Departments were being encouraged to get involved actively in these workshops.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the various Civil Service examinations, an examination is carried out at all times to see if the gender results meet the standards which are seen to be reasonable.  Many other initiatives are <Col N="559" /> being taken to ensure that there is equality of opportunity &mdash; for example, there is also an examination following interviews.  All of the data are accumulated on an annual basis to ensure that increases in female representation in the Civil Service, particularly at the higher levels, are being achieved.  This is being achieved throughout the system but, naturally, female representation at the higher levels is still very low.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>As Minister with responsibility for the public service does the Minister not think it is appalling that there is not one female county manager or regional health board manager?  I do not think there is any female representation on the next grade either.  Will the Minister do something about this area, a crucial area of managerial authority within the public service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There is still no female representation at the top managerial levels.  There are a number of female assistant secretaries, Revenue solicitors and general solicitors.  There is also female representation at many of the other senior grades.  The training course being run for female management in the Civil Service and the other proposals I have mentioned are seeking to ensure that there is an even balance at the top managerial levels.  It may take some time to achieve this, but the level of female representation at the top grades is improving each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I think they all have targets, but there are no quotas.  I raised the issue of quotas some years ago but they are considered in both European and national law to be against the spirit of equality: there has to be equality of opportunity for men and women without any discrimination or building-in of fixed quotas.  The efforts being made by the <Col N="560" /> equal opportunities policy and guidelines group and the various research which has been carried out will help to ensure a fairer level of female representation at the senior grades.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. B. O'Keeffe Mr. B. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I was talking earlier about the removal of third level students from the unemployment assistance register during holiday periods.  There are currently 78,000 third level students, of whom 66,000 find alternative means of getting by during the summer months. Some of them find employment in Ireland and others work abroad.  We should welcome the fact that some of our students benefit from experience abroad. My daughter is going to the United States and I can see nothing but good coming from that.  Certainly I would not frown on it.  Many families have sufficient means <Col N="621" /> to cater for students during the holiday period.  Some of them find that grants and loans will get them by.  The students seeking unemployment assistance are very much in the minority.  Some students are already in receipt of benefits, for example, disabled students and lone parents.  Is this much ado about nothing and is it worth cutting off students from unemployment assistance?</P>
      <P>As somebody who has taught in a regional college for many years, I am aware that the system was abused by students.  Students from areas removed from regional technical colleges and universities claimed that they were living in these centres of population during the holiday period and sought not only unemployment assistance but a rent subsidy. This action could not be condoned if such students could be well catered for at home.  There are, however, large numbers of students who find it difficult because of parental circumstances to survive on grants and student loans.</P>
      <P>The Minister has indicated that if students want to receive unemployment assistance, schemes will have to be devised which will involve work.  I see great merit in that suggestion.  There must be liaison between the universities, the regional technical colleges and community groups.  There is a wealth of experience and expertise among students which could be of benefit to local communities during the summer.  We should look at the matter in a threefold way. The universities and the regional colleges should be asked to liaise with local bodies and community groups and to seek suggestions for projects suited to the skills of students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of our students will become teachers and there is a great opportunity for them during the summer months to ply their trade in summer play schemes. Architectual students should be asked to look at a local village or suburb and to bring their expertise to bear in devising a scheme of improvement.  This would be helpful to the local authorities and to community groups.  A large number of students are involved in learning languages.  There is a great opportunity <Col N="622" /> for the State, the universities and the community to become involved in promoting language learning during the summer.</P>
    <P>There is a problem with the suggested amount of payment.  How can the Minister ask a student to work for five days and earn only £53 while an unemployed person on a social employment scheme would receive double that amount?  That aspect of the scheme must be reconsidered. It has great merit but much more thought will have to be given to it.</P>
    <P>I refer to section 22 of the Bill.  Section 204 of the Consolidation Act, 1981 states categorically that the chief executive officer of a health board is the deciding officer in relation to supplementary welfare allowance.  My experience is that many of the chief executive officers have conferred that right on the superintendent of community care.  There is a contradiction here.  Section 22 states that where somebody is found defrauding the system that person is to be cut off for nine weeks and will not be entitled to supplementary welfare benefit for that period, except for an adult dependant and a child dependant. Am I right in saying that the deciding officer of the Department of Social Welfare is now usurping the powers of a chief executive officer in a health board?  Is this in fact legal under the Consolidation Act 1981?  What happens, for instance, when a deciding officer disqualifies a person on the grounds of fraud?  Can the chief executive officer of the health board quite legitimately state that there are exceptional circumstances here and he is using his prerogative to make a supplementary welfare payment to this particular person?  I am sure the chief executive officer will say he has every right to do so.  I would cite also the case of a single person who is cut off by a deciding officer. Who is to feed that person for nine weeks?  Why are we closing every door? Will that person be easy pickings for a loan shark?  Would such a person not be fed in prison and get an allowance? Surely a caring Minister should look at this provision again.  At the end of the day why would the rigours of the law not <Col N="623" /> be appropriate in circumstances where somebody perpetrates fraud?</P>
    <P>Section 12 deals with interruption of employment.  Up to now we have been calculating the interruption period from 6 April to 5 April in the following year. What is suggested in the Bill is that from here on the interruption period will be calculated from the day of the interruption so that a person could have spent 300 days and now find himself entitled to only 12 days.  I see that there is a hidden difficulty here that will only manifest itself down the road and that the Minister, and each of us as TDs, will be ballyragged about it because the Minister is removing a major benefit to people on disability benefit.  Surely the difficulty lies with the general practitioner who certifies the person as being sick.  Maybe we should be looking at GPs who are certifying people.  If there is fraud out there it is on the basis of people being certified as being sick when that is not the case.  If that is so, it is the GPs around the country we should be looking at and not individuals.</P>

      <P>At my clinic recently in Ballina town a lady of 62 years of age came to me in absolute desperation at her inability to survive on her husband's disability benefit.  The husband who is also 62 years of age has been ill for the past three and a half years.  He worked all his life as a labourer and is now trying to exist on £87.30 per week.  His rent to the urban council is £13 per week, leaving £74.30.  They use three bags of coal at £7.50 per bag because they do not qualify for fuel allowance.  The cost of the coal amounts to £22.50 leaving a balance of £51.80 per week.  Their electricity costs a conservative £5 a week.  That leaves them with £46.80.  Meagre insurance policies cost them £4 per week, leaving £42.  Television repayments cost £16 per month or <Col N="624" /> £4 a week &mdash; that is the only luxury item they have.  That leaves them with a net sum of £38 per week.  They have not got a dishwasher; they have not got a washing machine; they have the minimum number of domestic appliances, and a television set but no radio.  They have £38 per week with which to feed and clothe themselves having given their lives to the service of this State.  They have gone to the supplementary welfare officer in vain on several occasions.  They have told him of their plight.  They have shown graphically their day-to-day costings, their week to week costings, what they spend on essentials in order to keep body and soul together and they have been turned down because the discretion of community welfare officers in coming to decisions has been largely terminated.  In a situation like that that discretion should be restored.  Where it is possible to prove chapter and verse that one is not capable of surviving it should be possible to give another £20 minimum to assist in propping up that kind of family.  These people are not living.  They are not even surviving.  They are existing, they are living in misery and, unfortunately, their lot for the foreseeable future will not improve.  In that situation one cannot live with any kind of dignity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a massive chasm widening between the social welfare classes in this society and the well off, between the &ldquo;haves&rdquo; and the &ldquo;have nots&rdquo;&mdash; and I do not include the PAYE people among the &ldquo;haves&rdquo;.  When I talk about the &ldquo;haves&rdquo; I mean the entrepreneurs, the well-to-do, the people to whom we pander in the Green Paper on Education, the people among whom we try to nurture a philosophy of an enterprise culture.  The people on social welfare are trying to exist at subsistence level on weekly payments from the Department of Social Welfare and they are turned away from the door of the community welfare officer, yet on the other side of society they see the captains of industry appearing before tribunals, inquiries and court hearings.  The people who are supposed to be leading society are the subject of inquiries and the people on social welfare <Col N="625" /> see the &ldquo;squandermania&rdquo; with millions of pounds worth of taxpayers' money. We do not realise it yet but we are fast reaching a stage in our society where we have, in unemployment, unleashed a Frankenstein.</P>
    <P>I hope the unemployed will not take to the streets.  However, they are becoming increasingly organised and they are very articulate.  They know their entitlements and they are able to read the signs.  They see the divisions and inequalities in society, and their patience will not last forever.  If they take to the streets this country will be in a very serious predicament indeed.  We would be well advised to read and react to the warning signs before things get out of hand.  We heard the bland statement of the Minister for Finance during the week when he declared quite publicly that the anticipated growth in unemployment for this year will be 25,000 bringing the total to 325,000, 22 per cent of the population, now the largest percentage within the EC.  That is the conditioning process, the process of acclimatising people to the harsh reality.  That type of bland defeatism &mdash; maybe it is realism &mdash; is leading us down the road to a very delicate and desperate situation for the foreseeable future.  What has happened in other countries can happen here also.</P>
    <P>I look at the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which was the blueprint of the previous Taoiseach.  I look at the section headed &ldquo;Social Welfare and Social Reform&rdquo;.  There is much in it, some items fulfilled and very welcome. Many other things too numerous to itemise have not been completed and fulfilled. It is difficult to see how they can be in the current tight economic climate.  There are one or two basics which do not cost anything which have not been addressed and would actually save money.  The Minister stated:</P>
    <P>Further attention will be given to greater integration of social assistance provisions and a streamlining of means test to ensure a more effective and client orientated system.  This will include the greater integration into the <Col N="626" /> social welfare system of the supplementary welfare allowance provisions and other related provisions currently administered by the health boards.</P>
    <P>Put simply, what is meant is a simple single means test, which we still do not have.  In my office I have a file that contains conflicting assessments of a person's means carried out in subsequent weeks, first by a community welfare officer and then by a social welfare officer.  In the interests of equity and common sense &mdash; apart from efficiency and economy &mdash; I wish there could be final settlement on some kind of means test, whether that be a notional means test or an actual means test, a factual assessment of means.</P>
    <P>It is ridiculous that somebody on a small farm could be visited by a social welfare officer and have his or her means assessed &mdash; a gross income being listed and a figure for net income being arrived at after subtracting expenses incurred &mdash; and on the following week be assessed for eligibility to a medical card by another officer.  That person, by virtue of a notional assessment based on a global figure in terms of the value of an animal or something else, could be assessed as having means amounting to a figure 60 per cent greater than the figure as assessed by an equivalent officer the previous week.  That happened in one case of which I am aware.  There is something fundamentally flawed and inequitable in that system.  It does not make sense that the two assessments do not equate.  It is inequitable, it is wrong and it is false economy.  We have a habit of creating bureaucracy for the sake of bureaucracy.</P>
    <P>Recently I was talking to a woman who went out of business because her rates had trebled.  Now she pays no rates and she gets a widow's pension.  Therefore, the local authority gets no rates and it pays out a pension.  That woman listed for me 11 officials who might knock on her door when she was running the small business.  They were the rates officer, the rent collector, the social welfare officer, the tax inspector, the weights and measures inspector, the health inspector, <Col N="627" /> even the egg inspector, who carries out an inspection of any premises in which eggs are stored.  Many officials can knock on the door of anyone in business.  Of all the self-perpetuating bureaucracies Ireland must be the finest example. Unfortunately, the more EC directives we have imported into our system the more we perpetuate the ridiculous bureaucracy.  I have suggested a simple measure that will not cost anything and I urge the Minister, and the Minister of State, to consider it.  The Office of the Ombudsman has referred to this in his four most recent annual reports but a change has not been implemented &mdash; there have been pious platitudes but no action.</P>
    <P>In relation to the payment of student dole, there has to be some merit in getting work for money paid.  The principle of extracting work for payment of money is basically good, but at present there are 300,000 people signing on at employment exchanges every week.  In many cases those people have been unemployed for up to and beyond five years and they would give anything to be afforded the dignity of taking up a shovel, of having a reason for drawing the blinds and getting up in the morning, but they do not have that dignity.  I am contacted every week by two FÁS officers in my county, from Castlebar and Ballina, who ask me to put pressure on the Government to release the much-vaunted job proposals and social employment schemes.  If we have the money, the expertise, the structures, the projects and the management skills, the long term unemployed should be the priority.</P>
    <P>Many long term unemployed are living at home in misery and see absolutely no light at the end of the tunnel.  The proposal to put students on work projects will not work.  There may be intermittent, occasional, isolated oasis projects here or there but to claim that the proposal could be carried out on a nationwide basis is incorrect.  In some urban areas it might be possible to get a group of people together but, by and large, we do not have the <Col N="628" /> resources, expertise or management skills to make the proposal work.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the Minister in his heart of hearts considers the proposal to be possible or practical.  The theory is fine but, in my honest opinion, in practice it would prove to be beyond the resources of the Department or any other Department or agency given the task of administering it.  Students should not be brought out just for the sake of having them do something.  If we are thinking of getting students to cut nettles in graveyards, we should forget it.  If it is not possible to implement this proposal &mdash; I do not believe it is possible &mdash; we should admit that and abandon the measure. That would be preferable to chaos during the summer months resulting from there being no schemes, no dole payments, and a large number of students roaming the streets with not a shilling in their pockets.</P>
    <P>Social welfare matters are extremely complex but of all of the matters that need urgent attention the priority has to be the long term unemployed.  In the interests of equity, peace and the salvation of this country &mdash; we do not seem to realise that there is a Frankenstein that could and will unleash itself on our society unless corrective action is taken &mdash; I urge that that social difficulty be given urgent attention.</P>

      <P>In the few minutes I have I should like to deal in general with problems that have arisen in social welfare, rather than criticise some of the measures in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party was given tremendous help last year by Labour Party Deputies when we found it difficult to ask supplementary questions about the carer's allowance and the farce encountered by people who are genuinely looking <Col N="629" /> after people when they apply for payment of the carer's allowance.  I do not wish to belittle the £6 increase in the allowance, but carers have much the same chance of qualifying for that increase as one has in a national lottery draw when an extra £500,000 is thrown in for a special occasion.  It is almost impossible to qualify for the carer's allowance and that has been discussed in the House in the past three years.  It is a farce that a carer who earns £2 will be subject to deduction, pound for pound, on any amount above that.  I am amazed that the Government made no attempt to change the ridiculous system.</P>
    <P>The carer's allowance is probably the best scheme we have in terms of value for the Government.  People are prepared to keep their elderly parents and relations in their homes yet they get no reward for that.  If the spouse of a carer is on social welfare or is in employment the carer's income is assessed as being half the income of the spouse, which automatically results in disqualification for the carer's allowance.  It is my hope that by this time next year the Labour Party will have made some input to back up all that its Deputies said about the unfairness of the system while in Opposition in the past three years.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the position of the self-employed.  It is impossible to accept, as I said in the House on other occasions, that someone who lost his or her job last week can be told that he or she has an income this week of £150 because that was his or her previous income.  I know of a man who was told he has an income of £155 a week simply because for three months in the latter part of last year he worked overtime. That man is now out of work but because of our system, which could not stand up to any challenge, he is deemed to have the same income he had when working. We know that the person would not be looking for unemployment assistance if he were being paid.  This farce continues. I hope I will not have to talk about it again in next year's budget, if I am here, because it cannot be defended.  If you lose your job you lose your income and <Col N="630" /> there is no point in pretending otherwise. It is outrageous.</P>
    <P>A working wife may earn £55 without being penalised.  However, if she inadvertently earns £56, £57 or £58 per week, all her benefit is cut.  It is quite obvious that if a person goes £2 or £3 over the limit it is through innocence because no one would risk losing £38 in dependant allowance.  If somebody earning £150 did this they might be chancing their arm and hoping they would not be caught, but there is no justification for applying a sledgehammer to crack a nut.</P>
    <P>I know a student who is being assessed at present in relation to his means last summer by dividing his ESF grant by 52 and deciding that he had so much money to spare during the school term that he had £25 per week all during the summer holidays.  Can you imagine a student travelling 20 miles, paying for his bus fare, meals and books being expected to have £25 per week in the summer season?  I have said every year since I came into this House that the social welfare system is crazy.  I am sure the Minister heard me saying so on other occasions.  If every office in the country went up in smoke, burning all the rules and regulations, perhaps we could get back to some form of sanity, because it is glaringly absent at present.  How can students have money left for the summer holidays when they cannot survive on what they have?  The concept of students working for their dole money is a con job because it is an effort to create jobs which do not exist.  I do not know who thought of this idea, but it is silly.</P>
    <P>The conditions applying to net income in regard to medical cards have been changed, but I have discovered that the health boards have not been notified about the change and that only PRSI is taken into account.  Who came up with the idea that if somebody pays £40 in tax it is income?  I can accept that someone paying £15 in PRSI should have it taken into account, but there is a difference when somebody takes £40 off your income as taxation.  I hope the Minister will do something about this.</P>
    <P>If a person is allowed £25 under the <Col N="631" /> family income supplement that amount does not change over the whole year regardless of whether you earn another £100 or lose money.</P>

      <P>The overall Estimate for the Department of Social Welfare has increased from £2,000 million to £2,122 million, an overall increase of 6 per cent, double the rate of inflation.  We must look at this figure to see what the State can afford in these very hard times to look after the least well off in the community &mdash; the unemployed, the old, the sick and the young people who need assistance from the State to keep body and soul together.  As long as I have been a Member of the House no one ever agreed that the social welfare rates were sufficient, we always fought for improvements in them.  However, I recall a time when I was in Government when the inflation rate was at 25 per cent and an equivalent amount was given in social welfare by the then Minister for Labour, Eileen Desmond.  An increase of that size was never given before, or since, but I recall at the end of the year that the rise was not as good as it seemed because the rate of inflation had risen to 26 per cent. I am glad that all the increases announced this year are in excess of the rate of inflation and I hope that if the economy stays strong and healthy the small <Col N="632" /> increases granted will help people's purchasing power.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to note that there has been an increase of 3.5 per cent in adult and dependant rates and in child benefit and social insurance and social assistance payments.  These are the largest areas in the social welfare budget.  While one would welcome higher increases, we all know that we are facing the biggest economic recession ever known in this country. There has been an increase of 5 per cent in disability and unemployment benefit and an increase above the rate of inflation in the carer's allowance.  We know that the Minister for Social Welfare made a strong case as there have been reductions in the Estimates for other Departments.  There is no argument from any side of the House that the Minister for Social Welfare should ensure that any money which can be squeezed out of the system should be directed towards the least well off in our community.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party has been attacked almost exclusively since their participation in Government.  All parties in Opposition seem to be paying a sort of reverse compliment to the Labour Party by blaming them for all our ills although it has been in Government for only seven or eight weeks.  The Labour Party entered Government for a period of five years and I hope people do not think that five year programme can be completed in five weeks.</P>
      <P>One of the planks on which I fought the general election was on the &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; cuts in social welfare.  Many of them have been reversed in the budget and the most extreme cutbacks have also been reversed by the Minister.  I compliment him on taking a more sensitive approach to his Department than his predecessor. I am glad that the result of the election brought home to people the fact that you cannot ignore your constituents; you must at all times have your ear to the ground and attend clinics regularly to appreciate people's difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the changes in unemployment assistance under which the amount of earnings to be disregarded has been increased by 50 per cent.  I particularly <Col N="633" /> welcome the promise made during the election campaign to improve the child benefit scheme, the first for many years.  The pledge was made during the election and I am glad that it was implemented within the first week in Government by a Labour Minister in the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>I am happy to note other changes proposed in the provisions of this Bill which will relieve the circumstances of many social welfare recipients to some degree at least.  The proposed child benefit increase, which had been ignored over many years, will be of enormous benefit to families where resources are best targeted at mothers who will receive such benefit into their pockets enabling them to spend it on their families.  That is one promise which has been delivered.</P>
    <P>The issue of the payment of unemployment assistance to third level students over the summer period is one with which we have all experienced difficulty, whether that be the Labour Party in Government or Fianna Fáil in Government. The argument has been made strongly by the Opposition parties that the Minister's latest proposal constitutes a retrograde step.  I welcome the changes announced today by the Minister of State <i>vis-á-vis</i> parents on social welfare whose children are attending third level colleges, which changes will ameliorate their position somewhat.  Like other Members I shall be anxious to know how the proposed schemes for students in third level education will operate in practice.  We shall be seeking more information in regard to such proposals.</P>
    <P>I represent a county with considerable tourism attractions.  At a recent meeting of our local authority we pointed out the need for more young people to act as guides and instruct visitors to our country over the summer holiday period.  There was a near accident recently in the Glendalough area when young people from County Meath were involved in a very serious incident, one person having been very lucky not to have been killed there. I suggested that it would be beneficial to employ young people during their holiday period to act as guides in many areas <Col N="634" />&mdash; where beaches and so on are quite dangerous &mdash; for visitors who will be unaware of the dangers of tides etc.  I contend that many such young people could be gainfully employed by local authorities, acting as guides, wardens and so on in tourist areas.  It is difficult to say how many would be needed.  I should imagine that something in the region of 200 jobs could be provided in a county like Wicklow, certainly for young students on holiday, thereby ensuring they would be gainfully employed in that period.  I am sure most would be anxious to undertake such work.</P>
    <P>I found Deputy Cox's contribution this morning most constructive, probably the only constructive speech that has emanated from the Opposition benches since we resumed our business after the general election.  He mentioned areas and issues with which he was concerned and drew up a list of proposals and directions to be followed by the Department of Social Welfare.  It would be difficult to disagree with many of the ideas he put forward.  If we were to adopt that type of approach in Government Departments, particularly in the Department of Social Welfare, enormous progress could be made.  We are all anxious to make progress and succeed over this very difficult period for the country generally.  A constructive approach on the part of everybody would be much more beneficial than endeavouring to find fault with parties who may have taken certain stances in the course of the general election and who are endeavouring to deliver on promises given.</P>
    <P>Already the benefits of my party being in Government are being felt in my constituency. For example, I welcome the five-fold increase in housing there.  I am also glad that the first Bill passed by this House secured the jobs of workers in Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta in Wicklow.  I welcome the new factory announced for Wicklow and another for Bray.  I am also glad to note approval of the extension to the Talbotstown national school which had been sought for some time past.  In addition, consideration is being given to improvements in the Arklow Harbour <Col N="635" /> area and money is to be allocated to Wicklow by-passes.  At least we should acknowledge that developments do take place if and when representations are made to a Government who will listen.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to compare developments which have taken place within the short period of the Labour Party being in Government as opposed to that when the Progressive Democrats formed part of the last Coalition Government and when there were cutbacks in social welfare. This is evidence that Members of the Fianna Fáil Party will listen to strong representations if and when voiced by people who understand the needs of our people.  I am glad to say that there is now a Fianna Fáil Minister in the Department of Social Welfare prepared to sit down with his junior Minister of the Labour Party in order to devise improvements for the least privileged in our society.</P>
    <P>I am happy to hand over now to my colleague, Deputy Broughan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to welcome the Minister's return to the Department of Social Welfare.  During his previous period in office he demonstrated real capacity to cope and a deep knowledge of the intricacies of the social welfare system and its close relationship to the taxation system.  Since returning to this Department he has reinstated the same calm, competent touch in its administration.</P>
      <P>I should like to welcome also his junior Minister, Deputy Burton, who has a long track record in taxation and social welfare and has prepared many papers and books for the Labour Party over the years on the requisite reforms in the overall social welfare area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The introductory remarks of the Minister yesterday demonstrated graphically the task confronting us with 1.5 million, one-third of our population, almost completely dependent on the State for their welfare.  However, it should be remembered that the plight of two-thirds of that group has been brought about directly by the curse of unemployment.  Therefore, the overall task and drift of this Government's <Col N="636" /> activities in relation to social welfare and everything else must be towards reducing the numbers of unemployed and the attendant expenditure of £3.7 billion on social welfare payments through the provision of jobs.  For example, had we 200,000 people unemployed our present social welfare bill would be considerably less than £3 billion.  That is the direction in which they should be gearing their objectives.  The overall drift of the previous administration was to cut social welfare allowances <i>per se,</i> as an end in itself, without ascertaining its graphic social consequences.  It would be my hope that this new Government has a different objective, will play a different role and resolve their present budgetary problem without resorting to making the poorest in our society suffer.</P>
    <P>I welcome all the social welfare improvements to be effected this year in the first tranche of the implementation of the Programme for Government, such as the 3.5 per cent increase in social insurance and assistance, the 5 per cent increase in short term rates, the policy of targeting available resources at children, allowing for child benefit of £20 for the first three children from September next, a dramatic increase.  I also welcome the extension of the eligibility ceiling for family income supplement to £235 for a family of four.  All of these increases will alleviate the position of families merely existing on social welfare payments.  Such families are never concerned with matters such as long term budgeting, long term investment, equities or whatever, issues often discussed in this House, because they have no discretionary income at their disposal having purchased the bare necessities of life.</P>
    <P>However, we must never be complacent about the less privileged in our society.  I would ask the Minister to remember especially the real levels of so many of these social welfare payments and what they mean for their recipients. The old age non-contributory pension and blind pension are to be increased to £59.20 from July but in this day and age can any citizen exist on that amount? Who would like to be faced with that <Col N="637" /> prospect?  Also from July &mdash; this is an area I am very familiar with as I deal with such cases each week &mdash; the lone parent's allowance is to be increased to £74.10. This is survival money.  As Deputies are aware, there are many restaurants and new hotels in this city in which one could spend this amount on a meal for two without being unduly lavish.  Yet, we expect people to live on that amount for a week.</P>
    <P>The old age contributory pension is to be increased to £68.90 while the invalidity pension for a single person is to be increased to £60.80.  Those increases are very small if we take into account supplementary welfare allowances and other benefits.  It is astonishing that we expect citizens to exist on this amount.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister, a constituency colleague, to do something to tackle the jobs crisis.  It is intolerable, almost a decade after the report of the Commission on Social Welfare was published, that we have not reached some of the basic monetary targets.</P>
    <P>Social welfare recipients always ask why they have to wait until July or September for increases.  Many Members rushed out to announce proudly the new rates on leaflets; yet on the night of the budget we increased indirect taxation. Indeed, the party of the Deputy opposite has to take responsibility because it shifted the burden of its economic policy. Indirect taxation is always regressive and as a consequence the people on social welfare have been suffering.  They will always say to us, who started it?  Was it the former Taoiseach or the late George Colley?  It is unfortunate that increases are constantly deferred.</P>
    <P>In relation to child benefit is there not a clawback despite the fact that there is a big increase?  I note, for example, that the child dependant allowance paid to persons in receipt of unemployment benefit will be increased by 30p or 2.4 per cent from £12.50 to £12.80.  Therefore, while people will gain on the swings they will lose on the roundabouts.</P>
    <P>In relation to the carer's allowance, I congratulate the Minister for granting an increase but, as he is aware, unfortunately, <Col N="638" /> many women &mdash; it is women in the main who carry out this important task &mdash; lose out because the regulations and the means test are so strict.  I will return to this issue later.</P>

      <P>I would like to bring a number of points to the attention of the Minister.  As he is aware, in relation to alleviation payments and supplementary welfare allowance, last January in many areas on the north side of the city a leaflet was issued stating that assistance with normal ongoing bills would not be considered. This is the kind of brusque note people in desperate straits received from the Eastern Health Board &mdash; they were told to get lost.  The Minister should ensure that his recommendation that there be flexibility in this area will be implemented quickly.  I am aware that both he and the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, are working on this issue.</P>
      <P>Recently the Minister assured me in our constituency that he would try to make it possible for students to do community work.  I am still very dubious about this and I wonder if the Minister's Department, and the Department of Education, would consider a system of grants to help students who will not be able to find work during the summer. This workfare scheme should not be applied to students from a working class background in particular.  Last Saturday in my constituency I met the fathers of two students who were unemployed and they were angry about this matter.  They want to know what was the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the previous Administration many changes were made by way of regulations. When introducing future Social Welfare Bills the Minister should inform us of what is likely to happen during the year.  In relation to the means test the benefit and privilege rule should be looked at particularly with regard to <Col N="639" /> young people and those parents who are barely surviving.</P>
    <P>I welcome the initiatives taken in relation to the VTOS and PRSI exemptions. We are on the right road and I applaud the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Burton for the initiatives they have taken.  I hope that they will be able to take some of the points I made on board.</P>

      <P>One of the most disturbing aspects of the Bill is the poverty of thinking within the Government.  No attempt has been made, for example, to see social welfare within the larger context of taxation and job creation policy.  There is no comprehension of the dignity of the individual and the degradation inherent in the outmoded concept of adult dependency which I find offensive nor is there any recognition that the social welfare system can be transformed into a positive force for job creation and the creation of a pro-work culture.</P>
      <P>The introduction of a basic income support for all citizens would form the basis for many new types of economic activity which in our present jobs crisis must not be ignored.  Instead, the Bill perpetuates the old dependency relationship which keeps many thousands of people in subjection rather than in security.</P>
      <P>Our social welfare system is antiquated, lumbering, inefficient monster which succeeds in diminishing people as much as supporting them.</P>

      <P>The people who come to see me, and other Deputies, often feel helpless and powerless and unable to meet their household bills every week. The system seems to have been designed <Col N="640" /> to deprive them of their rights as much as to enable them qualify for those rights. The Minister had an opportunity in this Bill to face up to reality and tackle the difficulties which people face but he failed to take it.  Instead the Government is unable or unwilling to do more than tinker with the rules and regulations.</P>
      <P>The Government has failed to bring all allowances up to the levels recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare. The lowest rate recommended was £64.50 for a single person and £103.20 for a couple in 1993 terms.  When we take inflation into account &mdash; many predict that this may be 3.5 per cent &mdash; the lowest rates are almost £10 below the figure recommended by the commission.</P>
      <P>Very often increases in social welfare are cancelled out almost immediately by increases in council rents which are pegged to income and by increases in service charges which are pegged to council rents.  I am aware of instances where last summer people went to their social welfare office to collect their £5 increase and then handed over that £5 to the council to meet the increase in rent.  Very often people are struggling to live with some dignity and self-respect.  They spend much of their time wating in queues in overcrowded rooms, being made feel degraded, to collect what is theirs by right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been much talk by the Government about the increases in social welfare provided for in the budget but these are very limited.  The old age contributory pension is due to be increased by £2.30 per week while deserted wives' benefit is due to be increased by £2.10 per week in July.  This works out over a year at 15p per day.  The mothers of Ireland who have been left holding the baby are well aware of the limitations of such increases.  The cycle of poverty continues and little attention was given to the issue in the budget and in this Bill. But now the screw has been tightened in a very immediate way for people living on social welfare.  In the past many thousands of poor people were able to depend on the community welfare officer to meet their acute needs, like paying the ESB <Col N="641" /> bill or arrears in rent to the council.  That support has been knocked out from under them and now they are coming back to the public representatives and asking us how they will meet their bills. No matter how well meaning the community officer may be, he or she is not in a position to provide that vital support that existed in the past.</P>
    <P>The increase in the carer's allowance simply brings it into line with other social assistance payments.  It is estimated that only 2 per cent of all those involved in caring can avail of this allowance.  The work of the hidden battalions of women who care daily for elderly parents, invalids or young children, is never really acknowledged.  No value is placed on this vital work, although it saves the State millions of pounds every year.  It would mean a great deal to carers who receive the allowance, although the cost to the State would be negligible, to receive credited contributions in order to keep their pension and other benefits alive.  This undertaking was given when the carer's allowance was introduced in 1990.  It should be tackled.  Credits for carer's in receipt of the carer's allowance should be allowed.  We should recognise at long last that this caring work, which is primarily carried out by women has a value.</P>
    <P>The decision to disallow social welfare benefit for students who cannot find work during the summer holidays is another cynical attempt to manipulate the unemployment statistics.  This new method, which has not been tried before, is a carbon copy of the British Tory policy, although their students can avail of grant and loan schemes.  The proposal to introduce community service schemes does not recognise that there are already over 300,000 people registered as unemployed or that many students are living in rural areas with little or no public transport provisions and far away from areas of population.  I cannot see how a community service scheme can be set up in areas like that.  At present we have all sorts of difficulties in creating job schemes for people living in rural areas and I cannot see how this scheme would be feasible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="642" /> I have very strong views on second chance education and the mature students who take the leap into education &mdash; very often at great economic loss to themselves &mdash; because they are so passionately determined to avail of an education they may not have had the opportunity to avail of in the past.  A letter from one such student to <i>The Irish Times</i> hits the nail on the head:</P>
    <P>The loss of approximately four months unemployment benefit, on top of the many other drawbacks which rejoining the education system involves, will be a far greater disincentive to those in the lower socio economic groups than any positive effects of last year's extension of the third level education grants system to mature students.  The Government has succeeded with this recent move, in introducing into the sphere of &ldquo;second chance education&rdquo; the same inequality and injustice that already exists in other spheres.</P>

      <P>I apologise for raising that matter now.  I welcome that point of information.  This was raised in the media today and people were not aware of this exclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the demographic bulge many thousands are leaving school every year and they will be hit by this change. I hope the Minister will exclude them from this scheme also in view of the importance of availing of unemployment assistance.  We have to ensure that our young people go on to further training and see education as an opportunity to grasp and not as something beyond the reach of them and their families.  The president of the National Youth Council <Col N="643" /> of Ireland pointed out that if we do not do that we are flying in the face of the Culliton report, which makes it abundantly clear that the longer a person is without training or employment the greater difficulty they will experience in finding a job.  There are so many pressures on young people not to go on to further education once there are economic demands at home that it is incumbent on the Government to change its view on further education.  The Government should encourage young people to come into education and, indeed, pay them if necessary to ensure that every person leaving school has an equal chance.  At present it is an absolute disgrace that in certain local authority areas when a student applies for a higher education grant he or she is prevented from availing of it because his or her parents cannot afford to pay arrears in rent or service charges.  This happened in the past and was subsequently raised in the Dáil.  I understood it was not an obstacle any more, but today I have a case where somebody in my local authority area is being prevented from availing of a grant because of her parents' debts.  That is wrong.  It should be eliminated from the regulations immediately.</P>
    <P>The joint programme for Government undertook to examine measures to facilitate unemployed people who wish to study or take up further education opportunities. I remind the Government of that commitment, because there seems to be a widening gulf between the commitments made in the joint programme for Government and the reality of Government policy.  To give an example, we could look at what the Labour Party described as the &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo;.  No action has been taken in the following areas: maternity benefit, injury benefit, redundancy, deserted wife's benefit, equality transitional payments, disqualification, health board payments.  There has been a promise of some rolling back on part time workers but no abolition of last year's rule; indeed, pay related benefit has been further reduced.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="644" /> Before the budget the population at large were willing to recognise that the twin problems of unemployment and poverty could and should be tackled by the new Government.  That opportunity was lost.  The cynicism and despair that has arisen as a result of the Government's failure to take that opportunity is very deep.  I urge fresh thinking, particularly in relation to education, to encourage young people to avail of our system of education, in which we take great pride.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, Deputy.  The daily expenditure of £10 million on social welfare puts into context the problem the Minister faces.  A figure of such magnitude is frightening and it is likely to increase significantly during 1993. Members from rural constituencies will be aware of the number of returning emigrants, who are not alone seeking living accommodation but medical cards and social welfare benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's approach to child benefit and the carer's allowance. In general it was a caring budget.  I would like to see the carer's allowance maximised, and the only way that can be done is in conjunction with the health boards. Any member of a health board will be aware of the number of geriatric patients clamouring for beds and the daily cost of such beds &mdash; an average of £30 to £35 &mdash; is much too high.  In my area in a number <Col N="645" /> of small geriatric hospitals the cost per patient per day can be as high as £50. Having regard to those costs we must examine the possibility of caring for more of our elderly in their own homes, with a community input.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's approach to second chance education and the provision whereby 2,000 unemployed are currently attending second level courses and a further 330 are full-time third level students.  In my area two chief executive officers of the vocational education committee have done tremendous work to ensure that unemployed adults continue to get education and training so that they will be ready if jobs come on-stream. The people I mentioned, who have done tremendous work, do not get proper recognition when they seek additional facilities or funding.  People who show initiative and enterprise in seeking adult education should be facilitated in every way possible, including the provision of the necessary accommodation and equipment.</P>
    <P>The whole social welfare system is unwieldy.  It needs to be streamlined to avoid the unnecessary work caused, for instance, by duplication.  I refer in particular to the means testing procedure whereby a non-contributory old age pensioner, despite having satisfied the criterion for benefit, is assessed again in terms of means if, subsequently, he applies for a medical card.  Co-ordination and co-operation at all levels &mdash; departmental, local etc &mdash; is needed to make the system more workable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The background to the Social Welfare Bill is a record level of unemployment.  The budget figures predict that the number on the live register will increase to 328,000 in 1993.  Higher unemployment means a higher dependency ratio.  The combination of these underlying trends places an ever greater demand on the social services.  I congratulate the Minister on making the best of a very tough job.  His long record in the Department of Social Welfare is one of reform and attention to social justice. I recognise that a section of our people <Col N="646" /> will always need State support, but I regret that they are not now even getting the resources they need and deserve.</P>
      <P>The causes of unemployment are twofold. First, mass unemployment has placed huge demands on our resources. People who should be paying taxes and contributing to the economy are on the dole.  Second, we have not exercised sufficient political courage in making the choices necessary to ensure that our scarce resources are targeted at the most needy.  Work, not welfare is the solution for the 300,000 plus on the dole.  Within the social welfare policy it is crucial that nothing acts as a brake on the impetus towards employment creation.  In general, this can best be achieved by the implementation of the report of the Commission on Social Welfare and the integration of the tax and social welfare codes.  No progress has been made along those lines this year which is disappointing. I welcome the appointment of the Minister of State, Deputy Burton. Her duties are specifically to oversee the integration of those two codes in future years.  Her work is likely to meet with a great deal of opposition from vested interests, particularly from the Department of Finance but I wish her well in that important work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of how we choose to use our resources, I will cite one example. We should compare the budget allocation for public service pay with the allocation for social welfare.  Between 1986 and 1993 the numbers in the public service remained relatively static, but the number on social welfare increased by 102,000.  Despite the fact that this additional number of people have been dependent on social welfare since 1986 they have had to survive on a 51 per cent increase in resources between them.  In the same period a static number of public servants enjoyed an increase of 54 per cent in pay and those in employment gained because of the reduction in tax rates from 1986 onwards.  That top rate was decreased from 58 per cent to 48 per cent and the standard rate from 35 per cent to 27 per cent.  The cumulative cost to the Exchequer of income tax reliefs <Col N="647" /> introduced in 1988, 1989 and 1990 was much more than £800 million.  In 1993, should we have cared to do so, it would have cost £150 million to raise social welfare payments to the minimum level recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.  Instead, only £71.5 million was found and, given our very stretched resources, this is apparently generous.</P>
    <P>Appearances are deceptive.  We should compare the £71.5 million given in extra social welfare payments to the £297 million increase in public sector pay.  We were correct in our decision to reduce taxes in the past few years, but lower taxes must be accompanied by pay restraints and in the public sector this has not been so.  This increase of 7.4 per cent in public sector pay this year is an outrage.  It is funded in two ways.  First, the hard pressed private sector pays for a public sector in which standards of productivity and efficiency are a great deal lower, and this situation endures apparently without consequence.  Second, the unemployed, the disadvantaged &mdash; those without power to strike and disrupt &mdash; forfeit a basic standard of living to subvent public service pay.  Effectively, we have pandered to the powerful and ignored the poor.  The hypocrisy of the social partners is glaring.</P>
    <P>On the question of rural poverty, the brunt of our political inadequacy is borne by the unemployed and the disadvantaged. In County Wexford, 25 per cent of the people are unemployed and the numbers who are disadvantaged and excluded from the mainstream of society are even greater.  This Bill will result in certain small advantages for them, which is to be welcomed.  However, it is not enough.  Long-term solutions lie in employment.  A certain amount of employment must be created in rural Ireland because of the flight from the land, which causes not only dire economic hardship but a loss of morale which is equally as bad.  I wonder how many of today's urban poor were yesterday's rural poor.  Rural poverty and depopulation is not only a serious problem in itself; it is <Col N="648" /> the source of a multiplicity of problems elsewhere.  Those least able to cope with being down on their luck in Dublin and London are, generally speaking, from a rural background.</P>
    <P>I would like to raise two specific matters with the Minister.  The first relates to lighthouse keepers.  Lighthouses around Ireland are being decommissioned and de-manned and a centuries old tradition is being ended. When I raised the issue of lighthouse keepers and their proper compensation in a special debate on the Adjournment on 9 March last, the Minister, Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan, expressed his appreciation for the service those brilliant men had provided.  I ask the Minister today to offer more than platitudes.  Twelve lighthouse keepers have been served with compulsory redundancy notice, effective from 1 April next.  In the history of the State, they will be the first people who pay the public service rate of PRSI to receive compulsory redundancy notices. A compulsory redundancy notice is not a fitting end to such an honourable service.</P>
    <P>The second matter I would like to raise with the Minister relates to share fishermen. I am pleased to see Deputy McGahon in the House because I am sure he shares my view on this matter.  I wish to bring to the Minister's attention that share fishermen now find themselves in a no-man's-land.  Since the Griffith and McLoughlin cases boat owners found themselves relieved in law of having to pay the employers' share of PRSI for fishermen working on their boats.  There is now no scheme in existence for share fishermen.  They are unjustly and unfairly deprived of the benefits of PRSI.  I know the Minister met recently with the IFO but the IFO does not represent the view of the share fishermen, some of whom I met recently.  I ask the Minister to take these points on board and to ensure that when fishermen become sick or unemployed they, too, will have the protection of social welfare.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister for Social Welfare on bringing before this House the Social Welfare Bill, 1993, <Col N="649" /> which proposes extensive social welfare changes and regulatory measures in relation to social welfare.  The Bill contains 52 sections, addressing a broad range of matters relating to approximately 1.5 million people.  Social welfare expenditure will amount to more then £10 million a day, 365 days a year, with increases to all social welfare recipients well ahead of inflation.  This highlights the priority this Government gives to social welfare recipients, and I hope this trend will continue in the next four to five years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>One matter needs to be put in perspective.  There is a large number of people, particularly those in a working environment, who, while they appreciate that many people are in need of assistance from the State by way of social welfare payment, feel they pay excessive taxation and do not get a just reward at the end of the week.  Very often those who are working, after paying all their taxes including levies, such as the new 1 per cent levy, take home little more than those on social welfare payment. This is one area that must be addressed in a sensitive and progressive manner. The Minister and all relevant Departments should consider this matter which warrants investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have reservations about certain aspects of the Bill.  I would have welcomed the inclusion of certain provisions but I hope, that with successful lobbying of the Minister and Minister of State, these areas will be addressed in the future.  In the short time available to me I want to refer briefly to a number of matters.  I welcome the increase in the carer's allowance to £59.20, bringing it into line with long term unemployment payments.  When the Department of <Col N="650" /> Social Welfare introduced this allowance I believed this was an area of great potential, that it would ensure that people in need of constant care would not have to go into State or private nursing home care but could be cared for in the home. The potential in relation to the carer's allowance has not been achieved.  I take this opportunity to call on the Minister for Social Welfare and the Minister for Health to set out an agenda with a view to maximising the potential that exists.</P>
    <P>Many of my constituents are prepared to provide the necessary care for the elderly, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, but the payment of £59.20 does not meet the requirements.  Health boards provide subventions towards the care of the elderly, at a minimum cost of £42 a week and a maximum equal to the cost of a bed in a private nursing home, which could amount to £200 to £500 a week. The Minister for Social Welfare has done well in bringing this allowance into line with long term unemployment payment but it should be considered in terms of the cost of caring for people in institutions.</P>
    <P>The proposal in the Bill in relation to a code of practice is welcome.  Great confusion has been caused in recent months in relation to a circular issued by the previous Minister.  That matter has been clarified, but supplementary welfare officers are not fully taking into account exceptional needs.  I call on these people, prior to the introduction of the code of practice, to address this area of supplementary welfare, particularly as it affects those in need, and not to be confusing the matter.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the setting up of an appeals officer there should be a further structure for a final appeal for those whose disability benefit has been cut off but who are still submitting certificates. The present system is very bureaucratic and involves a lot of paperwork.</P>

I am pleased that the Minister has taken the opportunity to allow for a free colour TV licence, even if it is limited to those in receipt of free fuel.  I understand that the Minister wishes to extend this.</P>
      <P>The Minister should consider the feasibility of opening a free telephone line for people who want social welfare information and making it available at all social welfare outlets.  I regret that I have to conclude, as I would welcome the opportunity to refer to the summer work schemes for students.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>My views on social welfare are rather unconventional which will not surprise several of my colleagues.  I would remind the Chair of our visit to India some years ago in which the Chair had his finest hour when he addressed 10,000 people.  We saw poverty there on a scale that beggars description.  When I hear suggestions of poverty here I feel anger, because we have no poverty.  We may have self-induced poverty from the evils of gambling and drinking, and Governments cannot be blamed for that. This country is only 70 years old and the progress we have made is staggering. That can be exemplified by the fact that we pay £12 to £15 a week more in unemployment assistance than is available in England, a country with the might of centuries behind it.  I do not believe this &ldquo;bull&rdquo; about poverty in a country that can gamble £6 million a day, can drink £8 million a day and can spend millions on the lottery at the weekend.  We have cultivated a social welfare mentality which has gone out of all proportion.  We have the best social welfare system in the world, which, unfortunately, because of <Col N="652" /> the political system every Government will featherbed to the exclusion of the working man.</P>
      <P>The number of poorly paid people who are now refusing work or who are leaving employment for the benefit of the best social welfare system in the world is staggering. As Deputy Callely suggested, it is in the interests of people to be in receipt of social welfare and to do nixers.  The black economy is alive and well here and perhaps that is no harm.  I have turned a blind eye to poorly paid people who do occasional nixers, but I would not turn a blind eye to people in conventional jobs who are signing on and receiving large sums of money from the backs of the unfortunate workers who are paying through the nose to carry several monkeys on their backs.  Having visited India and seen frightening sights I was thankful that we have developed a caring society, but I draw the line at people signing and working.</P>
      <P>I do not accept the unemployment figures. Perhaps because I am an Opposition Deputy I could point the finger and cry about that, but the unemployment figures are bum figures.  Sadly, there are thousands of people who cannot obtain employment and who do not have the opportunity to do nixers; but there are many thousands who are milking the State, and that is what I object to.  I believe in giving social welfare payments to people who need them but not to those who are stealing from the backs of the people who are working.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no difficulty with this Bill.  It gives a reasonable increase.  Facilities to safeguard the dignity of people who have to go to unemployment exchanges have been improved in recent times and a certain amount of privacy has been provided. I welcome that.  I have a difficulty with the carer's allowance, which was a magnificent concept.  The cost of keeping an aged person in hospital is enormous and staggering figures amounting to £700 a week have been bandied about.  This scheme must be broadened.  Only a few thousand people are actually in receipt of the carer's allowance.  I had a bereavement about a year ago; before that my <Col N="653" /> very aged father had to be cared for on a 24 hour a day basis, which was very costly.  Such care is beyond the means of the average family.  A sum of £60 a week is a relatively small amount of money to encourage people to keep their aged relatives at home.  It is a concept that can be broadened in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>As my colleague knows, his views and mine are somewhat different. I share his concern about some of the issues he raised, but it is impossible to compare poverty in India with poverty here.  Poverty is a comparative thing.  It is a question of having a reasonable standard of living and a reasonable quality of life in the society in which one happens to live.  That is the kind of poverty we should keep in mind when discussing the problems here.</P>
      <P>I share Deputy McGahon's view on serious fraud.  Like the Deputy, I would turn a blind eye to some areas.  Later in my contribution I will refer to the proposal to go after old age pensioners when they die to reclaim money from their estates because they might not have declared their few pounds savings.  That is an extraordinary proposal.</P>
      <P>Organised fraud is an attack on those who pay for the system and those who depend on the system.  We would join with every effort of the Minister to eliminate serious orchestrated fraud, which impoverishes everybody and creates hostility between people who depend on social welfare and those who are paying for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry that the Minister is not here, but I am glad that Deputy Woods has been reappointed to this Department. If one must undergo surgery one would much rather that it be at the hands of a skilled surgeon rather than the sort of axeman approach that was all too evident in the approach of the outgoing Minister. I acknowledge that Deputy McCreevy is a very nice gentleman with very strong views, not dissimilar to those of my colleague, Deputy McGahon.  Deputy McCreevy's approach to the Department of Social Welfare left a trail of damage behind.  I am glad to see that some of it <Col N="654" /> is being repaired in this Social Welfare Bill.  To that extent we welcome the Bill, in particular the restoration to old age pensioners of their optical and dental benefit and the restoration to workers of treatment benefits up to a high level. Thankfully, at least two of the &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; have been dealt with.  I also welcome the proposals to clarify the area in relation to supplementary welfare.  I am concerned that the Minister has given no indication of a timescale within which he intends to introduce the new code of practice.  People are suffering on a daily basis and community welfare officers are struggling to interpret the variety of circulars with which they have been issued. Tomorrow could not be too soon for this code of practice to be introduced, as it is urgently required.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that I had to phone the Minister's office to get action with regard to local social welfare payments. I am sure the Minister would not want me to continue doing that but until there is some clear, coded improvement or if I find that the needs of people are not being met in the way they were up to now, I will continue to take that course of action.  If one were a returning voluntary worker expecting twins, one might find this a very attractive Social Welfare Bill. I am aware the Minister was obviously constrained by the growing numbers of unemployed but apart from reversing a small number of last year's negative measures there is not a great deal to signal new ways forward in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I listened to the extraordinary contribution of Deputy Byrne in which he attacked public service workers and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> agreements.  It was as if the Deputy had no hand, act or part in this. The Government was an equal partner to this agreement.  I share his view that perhaps it is an area that should have been examined.  However, it was up to the Government to suggest to the unions alternative ways of spending the money allocated to the public service.  It did not do that.  It did not suggest a package to the unions involving a pay freeze which would have allowed for the appointment <Col N="655" /> of an extra 2,000 gardaí, the reappointment of school caretakers, the commencement of programmes to employ security personnel in our schools and investment in energy efficiency measures in local authority houses.  The Government did not offer to provide jobs for sons and daughters, brothers and sisters if the unions were willing to agree to this.  That was not put to them.  It is unacceptable to bemoan an agreement and bemoan the fact that the money has been eaten up in increasing pay to one group while the Government have made no effort to alter that situation.  This is an opportunity that should have been seized and put to the unions and those involved in the various partnership programmes. More importantly it should be on the agenda for the future.</P>
    <P>I believe in partnership programmes, they are important and they create stability. However, there is no reason why a Government should not take an initiative of the kind I have mentioned, sell it hard and see if it would be accepted.  There is such a deep anxiety concerning the level of unemployment that people would be willing to accept proposals which would lead to job creation, even if it meant that their share of the income would be unchanged.  It is an affront to our consciences that so many people have no stake in this country at the moment and the numbers are increasing daily.  It diminishes the pleasure we get from our employment.  We worry for our children, our brothers and sisters.  Most politicians are used to this sense of insecurity but it is now widespread in almost every walk of life.</P>
    <P>I welcome the marginal improvement in the level of the carer's allowance.  I was spokesperson for social welfare when the Minister introduced that allowance. That allowance fell far short of what people had expected and was a major disappointment when it was introduced. People had expected that allowance to relate to the carer's work and time given to the care of young or old dependants. However, it was just another basic income maintenance allowance that was <Col N="656" /> only available if the carer had no other income.  The allowance has been a failure because it is means tested and is only available to carers with no other income; it does not give additional recognition to the role of the carer.  The carer might as well be on supplementary welfare benefit or unemployment assistance.  Those benefits would categorise the carer's allowance more neatly.  The allowance is of no benefit to carers because it is subject to means testing; the carers could simply have been included as a group in one of the other social welfare schemes.  A better approach might have been for the Department of Health to provide a reduced carer's allowance that would have been more widely available.  I meet people regularly who are disappointed with the carer's allowance.  Others do not even know that such an allowance exists. The carer's allowance affects mainly older people and old age pensioners who are very disappointed when they are told they are not entitled to it, having learned of its existence through the media.  This is an issue that will remain on the agenda and must be addressed.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed that no further reference was made in the Bill to the establishment of a single means test which has been on the agenda for some time.  The adoption of such a measure would make calculations of benefits easier for all Departments and save the State a good deal of money.  The Minister might explain what has happened in relation to the commitment given at many levels to the implementation of such a measure. The Fine Gael Party has done much work in this regard and the matter should be put back on the agenda.</P>
    <P>The expansion of educational opportunities for the unemployed is another matter I kept on the agenda by debating it with the Minister in the House.  One element in this Bill which will be of assistance to the unemployed is the increase in daily earnings which will be disregarded in assessing earnings from casual insurable employment.  Any measure that makes it easier for people to take up available work legitimately is welcome.  Much more must be done in <Col N="657" /> this area.  There is potential for the introduction of new schemes that would increase flexibility in this area.  I am also concerned that there are no proposals for further developments in the area of education.  Perhaps the existing schemes could be expanded and when the Minister is replying he may be able to give an assurance that such schemes will be developed.  The number of people involved in education who are long term unemployed is very small.  There has been a great improvement but it was an improvement from a very small number of 15 to 20 some years ago to over 1,000 now.  However, given the scale of our unemployment those figures are totally inadequate.  This area has enormous potential for expansion which would be to the benefit of society and the future potential of the people involved in finding employment.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned that in relation to the existing schemes women are virtually excluded unless they have remained in full-time employment.  Women wishing to return to work are excluded from those educational opportunities unless they have been in the workforce.  This is an issue which we had hoped to have addressed and it is one that we will not be able to introduce by way of amendment, it would be ruled out of order because it would be a charge on the Exchequer. Nevertheless, making that point will enable us to ascertain the Minister's thinking in relation to it.  Women are excluded from those opportunities and for a society that claims to value the great work women do in rearing children, the net result, if they take on such work full-time, is that they will lose their entitlement to even those limited opportunities. I am concerned that while we have had a substantial improvement in child benefit, which I welcome, we are still at the bottom of the league in European terms for the support of families with children. There should be a comprehensive examination of this area because it is families with children who experience poverty most.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy McGahon, raised the question of the low paid and <Col N="658" /> the attractiveness of social welfare. Coming from my constituency I see the struggle which many people on social welfare have to endure to exist.  These people know it is not worth their while applying for the type of low paid work which is available.  To suggest that some of these people are having a good life when I know that they would not have had a day out in memory is beyond comprehension. These people have to plan a confirmation three years ahead and Christmas is a time of desperate anxiety as they wonder how they will cope with the demands.  I have in mind one particular family with only one child&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Obviously he did not have a great deal of time to put his own stamp on this Social Welfare Bill.  I hope he will be willing to take up some of our suggestions and that we will see the system reformed rather more than was indicated in this Bill in the years ahead.</P>

      <P>First of all, I compliment <Col N="659" /> the Minister on his Social Welfare Bill and on the benefits he has been able to bring about despite the financial constraints of which we are all aware.  We are spending £10 million a day on social welfare.  This year there are realistic increases for those who depend on social welfare for their livelihood.  In the current year also the Minister has improved child benefit, as well as the family income supplement, which will be of great benefit to families, particularly larger families where the parent or parents are working.  Restoration of the conditions for eligibility pre-1991 for disability benefit is important and also the restoration of the conditions for optical and dental benefits.</P>
      <P>The social welfare system is a client orientated service and the manner in which the service is delivered is very important.  I compliment the Minister on the improvements that have taken place during the past number of years.  I compliment also the staff, particularly those in the constituency I represent, for their caring and concerned approach to the delivery of the service.  One area in which there has been substantial improvement in recent years is in the provision of buildings. I would like to see the work which has gone on over the years continued because it is important that there would be adequate buildings, as far as possible on the ground floor, for elderly and incapacitated persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Restoring the conditions for pre-1991 eligibility for disability benefit is, of course, of benefit in that it will reduce the demand for disabled person's maintenance allowance from the area health boards.  Nevertheless the disabled person's maintenance allowance should be transferred to the Department of Social Welfare.  It is not logical that we have unemployment benefit and unemployed assistance for those who are unemployed under the Department of Social Welfare. We have disability benefit but no disability assistance.  The disability assistance is transferred to the health board and paid by way of disabled person's maintenance allowance.  If somebody is <Col N="660" /> unfortunate enough when drawing unemployment assistance to suffer a serious illness there is no easy mechanism for transfer as there is from unemployment benefit to unemployment assistance. They are obliged to apply to the health board first for supplementary allowance and perhaps wait up to three months before they receive the disabled person's maintenance allowance.  The system could be streamlined, made more efficient and cost effective if disabled person's maintenance allowance were transferred to the Department of Social Welfare and became disability assistance.</P>
    <P>A new development which has taken place during the past number of years is that farmers &mdash; particularly farmers with small holdings who derive a small income from the land &mdash; who went out to work in local industry, because the farms were not sufficient to provide a livelihood for their families, paid into the social insurance fund.  Many of these people who suffer from cardiac illnesses, arthritis or serious skin disease are unable to work on the land.  I saw one man who had his disability benefit withdrawn on the basis that he had an income from his farm.  I would ask the Minister to examine this area to ensure that people who suffer serious illness and who are genuinely incapacitated medically would be considered for disability benefit having paid into the social insurance fund, particularly where they have a very small income from the land.</P>
    <P>The carer's allowance has been mentioned a number of times today.  Indeed, I have always complimented the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, on bringing forward the carer's allowance. It replaced a prescribed relative's allowance, which at the time it was abolished was £28 per week, but the number of people who qualified was extremely low.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash; when he was two years of age grew up in the household. His foster mother, now in her eighties, is crippled with arthritis and unable to leave the house.  He was unable to leave the house and did not qualify because he was a fostered child.  The Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, extended the range of eligibility to include these people and all carers and he also increased the rate to the present £59.  Of course, we would all like to see the carer's allowance paid to everybody who looks after an elderly person, but it is not practical.  I estimate it would cost approximately £300 million per year if it were to be given to every person in receipt of old age pension who is looked after by a relative or a friend.  I would like to see some support for people who are genuinely incapacitated as well as support for the carers who look after them and more flexibility in regard to the income of the household.</P>
      <P>The death grant is not payable to insured workers who were born before 1901.  There were very good reasons for that when the death grant was introduced in 1971 because it was payable only to people who were insured at that time. The time has come when it should be extended to all insured workers irrespective of their age because the number of people born before 1901 is extremely low and the cost involved would not be high.</P>
      <P>I welcome the arrangements for school leavers.  I believe there is dignity in work and the concept of giving young people an opportunity to work is welcome.  Since we first entered Government over 60 years ago Fianna Fáil has had a very caring tradition and has been responsible for many of the major developments in the social welfare area.  The Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, is a considerate, compassionate, concerned and caring Minister in that great tradition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse the points made by Deputy O'Hanlon about my constituency colleague.  Despite any differences of opinion we may have had, the Minister, during his years in the <Col N="662" /> Department of Social Welfare, has always demonstrated a very caring, concerned and sympathetic attitude to those most in need, those who are marginalised and those most at risk in our society.  I very heartily endorse the points made by Deputy O'Hanlon in this regard.  I will have much more to say about this during my contribution.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to welcome this Bill, which, from my experience as a politician, I believe identifies and provides for key areas of need in our society.  If I was asked to sum up my general feeling about the main thrust of the Bill, how it fundamentally approaches its clients and customers, I would have to describe it as a caring Bill.  That is how it appears to me.  Some speakers &mdash; and they have a legitimate right to do this &mdash; have criticised the Bill and have said it is a failure. While these speakers might put forward very laudable aspirations as to what the Minister and Government should be doing for those who are dependent on social welfare, there has been a distinct lack of realism in a number of the contributions I have heard.  Little or no account seems to have been taken of the fact that our dependency ratio is extremely high.  On most recent calculations approximately 1.5 million people, young and old, are dependent on social welfare; this is approximately half the population of the country.  These speakers also seem to have failed to grasp the fact that the cost to the taxpayer is in excess of £10 million per day.  To me, logic, reasoning and commonsense must dictate that every extra penny spent from a finite pool of resources is either at the expense of competing essential services or necessitates placing an even more intolerable burden on an already overburdened taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think all of us would acknowledge that our priority as a society must be to do everything possible for the aged, the unemployed, the poor and the marginalised in our society.  That is a most laudable aspiration; it is a principle which I think all of us would cherish and hold very dear.  Given its financial and economic background, the Bill faces up to <Col N="663" /> these responsibilities in a fair and caring manner.  For example, the decision to grant a 3.5 per cent general increase in weekly payments from July next will cover inflation.  The increase last year was 4 per cent &mdash; it was in excess of the rate of inflation for that year.  I know everyone would like the increase to be even better this year, that perhaps it could be double the increase proposed by the Minister. However, we have to be realistic and acknowledge the enormous constraints on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>One of the factors we have to take into account when measuring the effectiveness of the 3.5 per cent general increase is the increase in child benefit.  I am delighted to welcome the increase of 26.6 per cent from next September.  Some Opposition speakers have made international comparisons, but these are not always valid as other variables have to be taken into account when one makes such comparisons.  This increase, added to the general increase, will enable recipients with dependent children to keep well ahead of the rate of inflation.  It gives due recognition to the needs of the voiceless in our community, our young children, and will give a welcome bolster to the limited resources of needy families who find it difficult to make ends meet.</P>
    <P>I regard the increase, in child benefit as a firm statement by the Minister and the Government of their commitment to the family and to dependent children in our society.  In talking about this specific category of dependent families it is very important to ensure that the correct mechanism is used.  By giving the stronger bias in favour of child benefit it ensures that the mother in such families, generally the homemaker and budget manager, will have that much more control over the means &mdash; and in many cases these are very limited &mdash; at the disposal of the family.</P>
    <P>In recent years the lowest wage earning families in our society have been recognised as being genuinely in the poverty trap.  It has to be said in fairness that prior to the introduction of the family income supplement there was very little <Col N="664" /> monetary incentive or reward for those wage earners to continue in employment and stay off the dole queue.  The FIS, as it is referred to, has correctly and justifiably targeted this group.  The provision in this regard goes some of the way &mdash; it does not go all the way &mdash; towards addressing this dilemma for this category of wage earners.</P>
    <P>The decision to increase by £20 the weekly income limits below which families can qualify for the supplement is fair and reasonable.  We would all like the increase to be more.  For example, a family with four dependent children will be able to earn up to £235 per week and still qualify for the supplement.  By my calculations this represents an increase of approximately 10 per cent.  Even when annual wage increases are taken into account, it should still enable more families to qualify during the current year.  The news that all families in receipt of FIS will be £12 per week better off is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Some people have referred to the position of the self-employed in this context. I, too, would like to refer to this issue. There are a number of people involved in partnerships, working in unemployment black spots &mdash; I will refer to this issue in greater detail later &mdash; or striving to set up businesses for themselves.  These people need various forms of assistance.  I regard the FIS as one way in which they could be assisted.  I would encourage the Minister and the Government to target those people who are striving very hard to set up businesses for themselves on a very low margin at the end of the week, month or year.</P>
    <P>The supplementary welfare allowance system operated through the health boards as a form of supplement or assistance to families in genuine financial need is an issue which I am sure crops up frequently for all of us during the course of our work as politicians.  This allowance is intended, in principle, to empower community welfare officials when identifying this need to use their professional discretion as to how to respond caringly, based on the merits of each individual case.  I have to say that many complaints <Col N="665" /> have been brought to my attention during the past year, and in particular during the past six months, about the hardship, stress and, in some cases, exasperation people have felt in their dealings with community welfare officers.  I am not knocking community welfare officers. Despite all the clarifications which were made subsequently, some of the circulars which were issued causes some difficulties. I know that the measures introduced last year were a genuine attempt to halt or address the escalating cost of the provision of the supplementary welfare system.  As I said, I received a number of complaints and I found it very difficult to have them dealt with satisfactorily or successfully.</P>
    <P>The entire area of supplementary welfare is a very sensitive one.  The right balance must be struck between the effective use of disposal of scarce and very limited resources while at the same time ensuring that genuinely needy families do not go without.  The problems confronted in this respect by community welfare officers can often be extremely complex. There can be one or even many varied reasons why one family simply cannot get by while another in seemingly similar circumstances can.  We all know of families who are constantly in arrears in paying their rent, who receive threats of eviction from local housing authorities, whose electricity or gas supplies are frequently disconnected and who never seem to have sufficient money to clothe their children.  These circumstances can arise because of alcoholism, an ongoing disposition to avail of the services of loan sharks, downright carelessness or a simple inability on the part of the parents to manage the household budget.  There can also be a myriad of other reasons. Whatever the reason or reasons, I have always believed, both during my time as a teacher in the inner city of Dublin and as a politician, that simply throwing money alone at problems is not the solution.  In this context I welcome the decision of the Minister to withdraw the circulars issued last year.</P>
    <P>More importantly, I welcome the review currently in progress to draw up <Col N="666" /> a code of practice for dealing with fuel debts.  I am glad he envisages this as part of a budget plan, which would address this serious sensitive and complex area. By encouraging and giving an incentive to all applicants for supplementary welfare allowance to participate in this plan, I am convinced that the allowance scheme can be administered much more fairly, effectively and caringly.  Consultation with the ESB, Bord Gáis and the health boards in the development of this code is the wisest starting point.</P>
    <P>The Minister is providing an additional £12.5 million this year for the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  This clearly shows that new mechanisms which he envisages are not being used merely as a substitute for cash commitments. Other speakers have referred to the inadequacy of the cash commitments, but I believe this is a genuine and realistic allocation.</P>
    <P>The Minister has announced that he will give immediate effect to other regulations, for example, the decision to delete the condition that 13 PRSI contributions must be paid in a recent contribution year for eligibility for disability benefit, long term unemployment assistance and those on the pre-retirement allowance.  This is to be welcomed, as is the same decision in relation to eligibility for dental and optical benefit for the same categories of persons.  The restoration of dental and optical benefits to those earning under £30,000 per annum, as well as to pensioners without five year's paid contributions, is in the interest of fairness and justice.  If the constraints had remained, the PRSI system would have fallen into disrepute and its credibility would have suffered badly.</P>
    <P>When the carer's allowance was first introduced by the Minister I welcomed it as a starting point, a move towards making provision for people making a contribution to people in need.  People in urban and rural areas are prepared to give up work and social welfare payments and to make an enormous commitment in providing round the clock care for people <Col N="667" /> who need it.  Due recognition should be given to them.  I welcome the Minister's decision to bring the payment of this allowance into line with other payments. These provisions are another step towards giving due recognition to people who provide this essential service.</P>

      <P>The Department of Social Welfare has probably become the most improved Department in recent years.  Some of us will recall a time when it was impossible to get a reply from that Department and the Order Paper was festooned with questions in an effort to elicit information.  There has been an improvement but much progress has still to be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A substantial part of the £3 billion spent by the Department of Social Welfare is actually causing poverty.  As much as £500 million or £600 million is causing poverty rather than alleviating it.  Our whole system of social welfare is littered with poverty traps.  It is an indisputable fact that any married couple, with two or more children, on the average industrial wage will be worse off than on unemployment assistance, even though those in receipt of unemployment assistance are poorly off.  That is the classic poverty trap.  I highlighted this in an article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> in January 1988, the week of the budget, at which time the difference would have been £2.88 a week. In each budget since then the gap has widened.  There is no incentive to work. Even those badly off on social welfare cannot be expected to take up a job and be worse off.  This matter is well documented and I cannot understand why the Government has not got its act together. Ray MacSharry when Minister for Finance brought in two budgets which worsened the position.  Deputy Albert Reynolds when Minister for Finance brought in two budgets which worsened <Col N="668" /> the position.  The present Minister for Finance has introduced two budgets which have worsened the position.</P>
    <P>The problem seems to be that the Department of Social Welfare, which should be a prime mover in eliminating poverty traps, looks only at its departmental brief and does not look at the totality of the effect of Government and other relevant intervention in the work-place. For instance, the Department of Social Welfare will say that somebody on unemployment assistance who has two children will get, say, £120 per week, but they do not take account of the fact that if that person lives in local authority accommodation his differential rent will be substantially reduced as compared with the rent of somebody on the average industrial wage.  The difference could be as much as £15 or £17 per week.  The person on unemployment assistance will also get a medical card and may get some assistance with electricity bills, school uniform costs etc.</P>
    <P>The Consolidation Act specifically prohibits any assistance to a person in employment.  It does not matter if that person has eight children and is earning only £150 per week.  Is is true that in those circumstances that family would qualify for family income supplement, but they are treated for tax and rent purposes as if they have no children. Another anomaly is that a worker is assessed in every means test on gross rather than take home pay.  The fact that children of workers are disregarded in the tax code whereas the children of the unemployed on social welfare are rightly looked after is one anomaly.  The other anomaly is that workers are assessed on their gross wage, which they never see. These two factors contribute to the poverty trap.  They justify my comment that a lot of the money spent by the Department of Social Welfare is actually causing poverty.</P>
    <P>This is not the only item of expenditure by the Department which is causing poverty.  We have the ludicrous position that unemployed young people at home will forego unemployment assistance on their parents' means.  A father or a working <Col N="669" /> mother will often refuse to have a form filled in by the employer for their children.  They may not want their children to know what they are earning or they feel it is not relevant.  A young unemployed person in those circumstances will, if he leaves home, now qualify for full unemployment assistance, full rent subsidy of perhaps as much as £50 per week plus the medical card.  I know hundreds of young people in those circumstances.  This has the effect not only of putting people out of their family homes and pushing up the social welfare bill and the supplementary welfare bill but of increasing the housing bill.</P>
    <P>Not only are we paying rent subsidies to young people in these circumstances, we are also making it very difficult for married couples, to get a private flat because of the demand created by the young people seeking flats.  This, in turn, creates an extra demand for local authority housing.  The Government is spending millions of pounds breaking up families and creating poverty.  This has been highlighted by me, and other Members, many times over the past few years, yet the problem continues.  What surprises me is that when the previous Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy McCreevy, brought in his so-called dirty dozen cuts he did not seek to eliminate these obvious anomalies which are causing poverty and costing money.  Why is the Minister not addressing such problems?</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald rightly alluded to the problems caused last year by the circulars related to supplementary welfare assistance.  In general, although it has warts, the supplementary welfare system is working reasonably well and helping to forestall much potential anarchy in the streets.  That is not to say that it is the perfect system; it is not.  It is true that there are variations in the way it is applied in different areas and, indeed, in different parts of the same health board region.  Many of the problems which the Minister tried to address in circular 14/92 could have been dealt with if he accepted the principle of granting interest free loans in certain cases, something I proposed <Col N="670" /> as far back as 1988.  Such interest free loans could be repaid by deducting money each week at source.  This is not a very original suggestion.  It is a feature of the UK social security system and has been for several years.  It has had an amazing effect there.  It alleviates all the worst problems.  People do not have to go to moneylenders or have their electricity disconnected.  They do not get to the stage where they are likely to be evicted from their homes because they cannot find money.  It also has the advantage that it is a discipline against excessive claims because people can get an interest free loan to meet the emergency but it is repaid over a period by being stopped at source.</P>
    <P>Why have we not adopted this very sensible suggestion that I made as far back as 1988?  It arose from an initiative taken by a community welfare officer.  In a matter of a week he was faced with two horrendous moneylending problems and he made a deal with the moneylender who agreed to reduce the amount of money to be repaid to him.  A grant was to be given to the person concerned on the basis that it would be repaid weekly. However, when the suggestion went to the Department for retrospective approval it was refused.  I urge the Minister to go all the way on this.  He could redress the wrongs of circular 14/92 and at the same time address the issues it sought to address by giving the supplementary social welfare system the potential to give interest free loans in certain circumstances.  It would help a great deal with the worst and most urgent problems.</P>
    <P>I have many points to raise but, in fairness to my colleagues, Deputy Crawford, I will not go on at length.  I wish to make two other points.  We still have within the State system in the region of 17 different means tests.  We have means tests for supplementary welfare, unemployment assistance, differential rent, medical cards, civil legal aid, higher education grants and so on.  There is one test after another all taking up official time in different sections of different Departments and sometimes in different <Col N="671" /> sections of the same Department.  This causes a great amount of inconvenience to people who are very often in great difficulty because they may have to make eight or nine different applications.</P>
    <P>What happened to the inter-departmental committee on means testing which, I was told in a reply to a question five years ago, four years ago and again three years ago, proposed that there should be a single means test?  The proposal was that this single means test be carried out at local health centres and that the certificate of means should be acceptable within the period of the making of that assessment by the local authorities in respect of rent, the health board in respect of medical cards, the Department of Social Welfare in respect of unemployment assistance, the community welfare officer in respect of supplementary welfare assistance, the courts in respect of civil legal aid and by the Department of Education in respect of higher education grants.  Why is there all this duplication that is costing a fortune and taking up a great deal of official time in different Departments when we are so short of staff?  Why can we not have one official in each health centre responsible for a single means test which would then be valid in various areas for a given period?  This is not a new suggestion; I have been proposing it for several years in this House and I am amazed that nothing has been done about it.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to at least acknowledge that workers should not be disqualified from entitlements like medical cards or higher education grants on the basis of their gross pay, because they never see their gross pay.  The Government should accept the principle that all means-testing should be on the basis of take-home pay.  I would go further; it should be based on disposable income because out of a worker's take-home pay he has to deduct mortgage payments, the cost of transport to work and so on.  I would settle for means-testing being based on take-home pay as an improvement but it should be based on net disposable income.  This, as the Minister <Col N="672" /> knows, is already the case in the United Kingdom under their Social Security Act, 1984.</P>
    <P>My final point is about how we levy social insurance.  I accept that the way we levy social insurance is the way it is levied throughout the European Community and that the level of social security contribution is higher in some other EC countries.  However, no country has the acute unemployment problem that we have.  When our emigration figures are added to our unemployment figures we have an unemployment rate greatly in excess of twice the European average. This is an emergency.  It is a monster ready to explode unless we address the problem, yet under our social insurance system there is an effective 21 per cent tax on jobs &mdash; 12.5 per cent paid by employers, 7.5 per cent by employees plus the 1 per cent employment levy. Bearing in mind that PRSI is paid on all income up to the income limit, that represents an even higher percentage of taxable income.  When PRSI as currently levied is added to our penal income tax &mdash; our allowances are low and our bands are narrow &mdash; there is a real disincentive to employment, especially when combined with the means testing regime.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to find a way of levying social insurance other than by way of payroll.  I suggest that he again consider a suggestion I made some years ago that some of the social insurance should be levied on the turnover of high turnover companies rather than on the payroll of companies that have a high labour force.  At present there is the absurd position whereby a company such as CIE, employing 12,000 people and having a turnover of £400 million, can pay as much as £35 million in PRSI contribution for the privilege of employing those thousands of people, yet a company that has a bigger turnover and employs perhaps as few as 100 people can pay as little as £250,000 in PRSI contributions. I am not saying that the system could be changed immediately from one based on payroll to one based on turnover, but I do believe, given the disincentive effect of the present system on employment <Col N="673" /> creation, that we should try to find other sources for social insurance contributions from the business sector, and I suggest that turnover is one aspect that could be examined.  Our present unemployment problem makes that an urgent requirement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the small increase made in the area of social welfare. I agree with the comment made by Deputy Mitchell that the Department of Social Welfare tries to help people as quickly as possible, an attitude not shared by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Fisheries, which still has to pay out many headage payments applied for in June last.</P>
      <P>Since I was elected to the Dáil, only a short while ago, there has been much talk about equality.  One inequality I cannot understand is that although a widow who is left with a family is given some help, a widower who is left to look after a family is not given any help.  That issue has been raised with most of us as Dáil Deputies and it is an anomaly that should be remedied urgently.  A widower who is left with children has as much pain and as much suffering to endure as a widow.</P>
      <P>In relation to the carer's allowance, I heard my Monaghan colleague, Deputy O'Hanlon, say that there was not sufficient to give to everybody.  I accept that. The former Minister for Social Welfare, Minister McCreevy, made the point that while the payment is called the carer's allowance, it is a carer's allowance in theory only because there are so many reasons for excluding people from qualification for the allowance.  I wish to give the House one example of the difficulty people face in qualifying for payment of the carer's allowance.  I know of a couple who, because of the clawback system, found themselves just £3 better off when the wife received the carer's allowance than they were when they relied solely on the husband's income from a FÁS scheme.  The issue of small farmers was also raised by Deputy O'Hanlon.  Many small farmers are not being assisted in the way they should be.</P>

      <P>I welcome Minister Woods back to the social welfare portfolio.  I am pleased that he is joined by a colleague of mine as Minister of State and I am sure that they will work well together, as they have already done in the preparation of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I have crossed swords with the Minister in the past as an Opposition spokesman on social welfare.  I have always tried to be constructive in my comments because I recognise that social welfare touches the lives of a third of our population &mdash; almost one million people depend every week on the Minister for Social Welfare and his Department as their only means of livelihood.  Is it therefore essential that this legislation, which is reviewed, updated and consolidated regularly, should be user friendly.  It is important that those in need are able to turn to their social welfare officer in the knowledge that the officer is there to help.  That has not been the case in the past.  Social welfare officers have made it difficult and almost embarrassing for people to approach their local officer for assistance or advice in relation to their entitlements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an old saying that no news is good news, and the corollary to that is that at times good news is no news.  For a couple of days now I have listened to Opposition Deputies who have specifically targeted areas of concern but have forgotten the positive aspects of the Bill, and there are positive aspects of the Bill. It gives effect to the beginning of a Labour Party commitment to target families <Col N="675" /> at the point at which assistance is most needed.  The children's allowance has been increased to more than £20 in this, the Labour Party's first year in office, which represents a 26 per cent increase at that level.  For third and subsequent children the increase is to £22.90 and £23.  Those measures are part of a commitment that will build up at that level and will target families in need and in most need.</P>
    <P>Many families have previously been unable to benefit from receipt of the family income supplement because one spouse is on a social welfare scheme.  At times those families have been in need of bread and butter money.  The supplementary welfare allowance also has the odium of means testing connected to it.  It is recognised that people have had to bare their souls in public, without privacy, to supplementary welfare officers in order to receive payment for the basic necessities.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the Bill contains measures to remedy some of the anomalies created by the previous Minister for Social Welfare.  The former Minister prevented the long term unemployed from receiving the disability benefit when ill and I am glad that the Minister has made an important change in addressing that anomaly.  The Minister has also addressed the anomaly by which people could qualify for receipt of invalidity pension only after 12 months' receipt of disability benefit.  In the past I have experienced the heartbreak of asking the Department to give the additional money and benefits provided by the invalidity pension to people who were dying of cancer but, because those people had not been sick for 12 months, previous legislation precluded them from receipt of the invalidity pension.  The changes made may be small changes in the eyes of some people but to people in need, on the periphery of our society, they are fundamental changes.  Many of us feel that there are very few members elected to this Parliament who will really represent them.  Calls are made for all kinds of improvements.  In the area of social <Col N="676" /> welfare it is important to target those who are most vulnerable.</P>
    <P>People who have contributed through years of contributions should not be penalised.  We have a system under which the vast majority of old age pensioners are not those who contributed during their working lives but are people who divested themselves legally of everything they had, with the exception of their home, in order that they might qualify for the old age pension.  Those people are able to drive up in their new cars to collect their old age pension and their free fuel. However, the unfortunate people who worked for years and have run out of stamps are unable to receive the old age pension without going through the odium of means testing.</P>
    <P>I hope that the regulations which the Minister introduces in regard to changes in benefits and entitlements for students will address the anomaly whereby students who have completed their second level education, who do not intend going on to third level, have reached the age of majority, are genuinely seeking work, living at home and signing on for work are precluded from benefit during that time when it is important for low income families to have their children looked after.</P>

      <P>Deputies Burke, Sargent, Doyle and Crawford, among others, raised the question of introducing a widower's contributiory pension.  Needless to say, we would all like to see such <Col N="678" /> a pension.  As Deputies know, I brought in a widower's lone parent allowance to bring widowers into a means tested pension. This meant that for the first time widows, widowers, separated or divorced persons and anyone else who has to bring up a family on their own were covered by the lone parent's allowance scheme.</P>
      <P>However, there is not a widower's contributory pension scheme.  The first question that arises in relation to such a scheme is that it is a matter for the social insurance fund and contributions under it.  In general to bring in a scheme which would equate with that for widows and deserted wives would cost approximately £50 million per year.  That problem would have to be addressed and resources provided; obviously, it cannot be done overnight.</P>
      <P>The EC recognise the need for such a scheme and a number of years ago it set about providing for equality of treatment in areas not covered by the 1979 directive, including a widower's contributory pension.  Despite our efforts little progress has been made at European level on this issue, but it will have to be addressed in future and I recognise the points made by Deputies in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies O'Donnell, Moynihan, Cronin, Pattison, Bradford, Doyle and Broughan, among others, raised the question of carers.  For the first time the carer's scheme gave support to the person providing care for an elderly person in need of care.  That was a major advance. It was a social welfare provision on a means tested basis.  As Minister for Social Welfare, I introduced that provision.  It is a good scheme &mdash; 4,500 carers are in receipt of the allowance and the improvements we made this year in increasing the long term rate will of course bring further carers into the scheme.  I have undertaken to look at the means test to see if it can be made less restrictive, particularly in relation to carers with a working spouse.  I will also be consulting my colleague, the Minister for Health, in regard to provision which might be made more generally for carers.  I am directly responsible for carers, those on low incomes. Beyond that there is the question of <Col N="679" /> people on higher incomes and how they can be catered for, a matter which will involve the Department of Health and about which I will have discussions with my colleague, the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>I dealt with the question of supplementary welfare allowance in my introductory remarks.  There will be other opportunities to discuss that matter later.</P>
    <P>Several Members raised the question of the personal social services numbers. I should make it clear that in January 1991 it was decided that my Department would take over responsibility for the RSI number allocation with a view to its more widespread use for social welfare, tax and related services.  That was done in April 1991, so that now it is my Department which issues the relevant RSI number.  What we are doing is providing a personal social services number and the legislative background for their issue.  To date that has been done largely on an administrative basis.</P>
    <P>As part of our overall strategy young people are now allocated personal social services numbers at the age of 16 and retain that number for all social services thereafter.  As some Members suggested, there is scope for extending those numbers further to be used in areas outside the traditional ones in which we operate.  I might remind the House that that is something which would require separate provision.  Therefore I have separated that to be dealt with comprehensively and fully discussed should it arise.  As far as I am concerned, I am covering what we do at present and providing the legislative backing for those RSI numbers currently in use.</P>
    <P>Quite a few Members referred to consumer credit and moneylending and inquired about the Consumer Credit Bill. From the social welfare point of view I am very anxious to see that Bill published.  A Government decision on that Consumer Credit Bill in October 1992 gave the go-ahead for the drafting of the heads of that Bill.  That is being dealt with by the consumer credit division of the Department of Employment and Enterprise.  My Department has passed on a draft to the <Col N="680" /> parliamentary draftsman of the section with which we will be concerned, that is, that relating to moneylending and consumer credit in so far as it will affect our clients.  That Bill is due to be published in September 1993.  Among other consumer credit issues that Bill will deal with moneylending issues, the aspect in which we will be involved.  There are five moneylending projects funded by my Department.  A process of consultation on these is at present in progress with the national steering committee on pilot moneylending schemes so that our views will be fully incorporated in the Bill being prepared by the Department of Employment and Enterprise.</P>
    <P>We have been involved directly in activities to deal with moneylending since 1988, when we established an initial scheme administered by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  More recently we established five pilot projects in Limerick, Waterford, Cork, Dublin and west Clare.  Of course, these form the basis of some of the other issues mentioned by Members here this afternoon &mdash; for instance, targeting resources at families in particular need, introducing budgeting facilities, all of which can be amalgamated once those facilities have been put in place.  Therefore Members will appreciate that some facilities requested are in the pipeline.  Some of the requisite infrastructure &mdash; for example, the computer network, apart from other aspects of the infrastructure &mdash; is in place and more will be provided as we proceed.  For example, this year the Government has provided £500,000 for this activity, which will enable my Department to extend significantly our programme of moneylending in the months ahead.</P>

      <P>The headline today in the <i>Irish Independent states</i>&ldquo;Minister sanctions Castlebar third level courses&rdquo;, which is as misleading as the promises and rhetoric of the Labour Party before, during and after the general election.  The reality, of course, is that the Minister's commitment is so conditional that it is as meaningless, useless and hopeless as the promises given during the election campaign by the then Deputy, Mr. Pádraig Flynn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of courses in Castlebar as outlined by the Minister depends on adequate demand, the availability of adequate resources and suitable accommodation. It is surely amazing that the Department of Education has not as yet assessed Castlebar in relation to the criteria she has laid down.  The Minister's statement now confirms that no real assessment has been made by the present <Col N="685" /> Government or the previous Government of the suitability of Castlebar as a centre for a third level college.  As of now the Department does not know the demand for places in such a college, the resources available and if suitable accommodation is available.  Sadly, I can logically conclude that the demand for a third level centre in my own county in Thurles has been as equally disregarded as the demand for one in Castlebar.  It is also sad and disappointing that the Minister &mdash; new though she is &mdash; has resorted to the old and tired tricks of the trade: when nothing will be done call for a review of the entire system.</P>
    <P>As there is nothing else to welcome, I welcome the Minister's commitment to meet the representatives of an action group from Tipperary for the rural and business institute in Thurles.  I now forewarn the Minister of our determination in South Tipperary to succeed because of our firm belief in the substantial economic and social benefits which would result from such an institute.  The Minister stated last evening: &ldquo;The Government must give priority to projects which will generate sustainable employment and economic growth&rdquo;.  If this is the Minister's adjudication guideline, I can assure her that the proposal as present by the Tipperary action group will qualify 100 per cent.  We in Tipperary realise that it is not feasible to duplicate courses and that it is vital that future colleges should have a new emphasis to meet the emerging demands of the 21st century.  For this reason our project is geared to the development of a new concept which will link mainstream education in a dynamic way with active rural and business development.  Our focus is on the natural dominant force in the area, a rural based programme which is totally in tune with the needs of the area and which will enhance employment in and future development of the agricultural and food industries.  This is a unique concept and I believe the proposal must be given very serious consideration.</P>
    <P>The needs of people in business in rural areas suffers from wasteful neglect in the educational area.  A Tipperary rural and <Col N="686" /> business institute could provide a blueprint for the translation into reality of the EC document <i>The Future Of Rural Society</i>.  I am glad Fine Gael tabled the motion calling on the Minister to include the institute in Tipperary in her programme for Structural Funds.  I now ask the Minister not to wait for this motion to come before the House before assessing the worthiness of our case.  We are not looking for &ldquo;an ideal world&rdquo;, to use the Minister's words, but I can assure her that in any real world where commonsense prevails no effort would be spared by any Minister to make our dream of a third level institute in both Thurles and Castlebar a reality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Fine Gael Party I wish to support the case for a regional technical college in Castlebar. It was my privilege as Minister for Finance in 1986 to sanction the purchase of a site for this college.  I regret that so little progress has been made since then and that the present Minister has been unable to adhere to the very clear commitment given to the people of Mayo by the then Minister, Mr. Pádraig Flynn, before the last general election when he made it quite clear that a regional technical college would be provided.  He has now departed, but his party is still in Government and it would appear that it, in conjunction with the Minister, has been unable to fulfil the commitment given by the then Deputy Flynn.</P>
      <P>There is a great sense of disappointment in Mayo.  As Members will be aware, I am very closely connected on a family basis to the county and I am well aware of the sense of disappointment felt by people because the Government has been unable to fulfil this commitment. Let me stress that all the available statistics indicate there is an extremely large number of young people who will seek entry to third level education this year and in the years to come.  There will be no problem filling the places in a regional technical college in Castlebar, if it is built, as my party intends it will be built.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The establishment of a regional technical college in Castlebar would have <Col N="687" /> immense economic benefits.  Apart from spending by students and staff it would also provide a seed bed for various new local enterprises in the west.  The experience in other areas where there is a regional college, such as Dundalk, has been that they have been able to develop very good support for local businesses.</P>
    <P>One problem, if not the biggest in the west, is the lack of employment, particularly the lack of indigenously generated employment by local firms.  I believe that in addition to providing education, a regional technical college will provide technical back-up for local firms in Castlebar, Westport and right throughout the west to help them to develop employment in conjunction with education.  It will keep people in the west by virtue of autonomous self-generating employment that will be generated in conjunction with the college.  It is extremely important that this college be built as part of our commitment to the west.  I urge the Minister to be much more specific than she has been up to now in her commitment to this project.  The announcements she made last night are completely inadequate. During the debate last night the Progressive Democrats attempted to criticise the Fine Gael Party who took the decision to acquire the site.  I would remind members of the Progressive Democrats, in case they have forgotten, that they were in Government until quite recently and it is regrettable that they did not do something about this matter when they had the opportunity.  That is history, the position at present is that we must succeed &mdash; and I hope we will &mdash; in persuading the Minister and the Government to live up to the commitments that the principal party in that Government gave to the people of Mayo before the election, that they would build a regional technical college in Castlebar.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Long before I came to this House I supported the proposal for a regional technical college in Mayo.  I supported it as a member of Mayo County Council, as a member of the vocational education committee in Mayo and as chairman and member of Westport Urban District Council.</P>
      <P>A regional technical college for Mayo was promised during the general election of 1980 and that pledge has been renewed at each subsequent general election. Indeed, last November speakers from all political parties pledged their commitment and renewed their support for a third level facility for Mayo.  At one stage the acquisition of a site for the college was announced, though the detail of this was always unclear.  Agreement was reached on the courses to be provided and on the number of pupils to be catered for.</P>
      <P>While the building of Mayo regional technical college has been deferred, major expansion is taking place at most other regional technical colleges throughout the country although some people seem to believe that the idea of a regional technical college for Mayo should be forgotten. The arguments in its favour are now more compelling and urgent than ever, especially in view of the recent job losses and the present high rate of emigration.</P>
      <P>There are many compelling arguments &mdash; educational, industrial, economic, sporting and cultural &mdash; for locating a third level college in Mayo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the educational argument, one of the weakest arguments of all, it is appropriate to refer to the recent Clancy report on higher education which has shown clearly that Mayo has one of the highest levels of participation in third level education.  Mayo parents value education so much that they have made enormous sacrifices over the years to send their children to third level colleges outside Connacht.  Securing a regional technical college for Mayo would increase the chances of Mayo students getting courses that they want and their prospects of access to third level education would be greatly improved.  An <Col N="689" /> regional technical college would provide motivation for pupils still at school, an improved adult education service and educational back-up which, in turn, would attract new industry to the country.  The Clancy report shows clearly that when students live close to a third level college they attend it in preference to travelling to colleges outside the area.</P>
    <P>Industry is interested in locating close to a centre which will provide the proper qualified staff to help them to be profitable. Very often regional technical colleges design courses in conjunction with industry to cater for a particular demand. One has only to look at the growth of the neighbouring towns with regional technical colleges, Sligo, Galway and Athlone.  Despite the disadvantage of not having a regional technical college in Mayo, the county has been fortunate in attracting Allergan Pharmaceuticals, Hollaster International, Asahi and Baxter Laboratories in Castlebar.  The county would be much more successful with the ideal workforce available throughout the country if it had an regional technical college to support its claim for further industrial development.</P>
    <P>All regional technical colleges now offer assistance to local industry in the vital field of research and development. The lack of such assistance in Mayo is another disadvantage in attracting new industry to the county, but by providing a regional technical college in the county the prospects for Mayo students finding gainful employment in their home county would be greatly improved.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the strongest argument of all for a regional technical college in Mayo is the economic one.  At present, almost £2.5 million per annum is paid out by way of grants to students attending third level colleges and courses outside of Mayo. Can a poor county like Mayo afford to export such moneys to much wealthier counties?  It is estimated that the regional technical college in Tralee is worth a minimum of £7 million to the local economy annually.</P>
    <P>Much is said about the population imbalance in this country where almost a third of the population is in the greater <Col N="690" /> Dublin area and two-thirds in the rest of the country.  This lopsided population has posed as many problems for the east coast as the under population has posed for the west coast and I would submit that the location of a regional technical college in Mayo would be a valuable component in restoring the correct balance.  By restoring the balance of population equitably throughout the country we would solve many of the social and other problems that currently exist.</P>
    <P>The sporting and cultural argument has also been advanced.  One has merely to reflect on the presence of roughly 1,000 intelligent and vibrant young people plus their lecturers in a county like Mayo. They would provide a marvellous source of life and vibrancy in an area which is presently stripped of young people. Many of these young people returning daily to their communities is just what the county needs.  Sport, cultural activities, drama and the arts would all benefit from this.  The county would cease to be a county of the very old and very young.  It can be stated clearly and strongly that Mayo is a poor area within a disadvantaged area.</P>
    <P>Emigration is rampant in the county. It is almost as bad now as it was in famine times.  All the retail and service businesses are struggling and continuing emigration will result in more closures and redundancies.  Tourism is undoubtedly an important job-creating industry in the county but its seasonality is a major drawback for a county like Mayo.</P>
    <P>If Mayo is to survive it has to be decided by Government that it is worth saving and a provision of a regional technical college is one of the single most cost effective ways of revitalising the county.  The case for a regional technical college in Mayo has long since been proven.  The Government decided in the mid-eighties to proceed with the project and that decision has never been reversed.  If it had not been for enforced cutbacks in public spending during the period from 1987 to 1989 the Castlebar or Mayo regional technical college, as it is now more properly called, would be a reality.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="691" /> Over the years there has been much emphasis in every paper on education &mdash; be it green, white or whatever &mdash; on equality of educational opportunity. While this phrase is normally viewed in social terms it can equally apply in a geographical context and does so in the case of Mayo students.  There is no doubt that with the continued absence of a regional technical college in the county some of Mayo's youth will be unable to pursue third level education.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Education for a Changing World, 1992&rdquo; forecast that there would be an additional 30,000 places required in third level by the year 2001.  Facilitating a small fraction of these students in Mayo would greatly enhance the educational, economic, social and sporting life within the county.  It would be a catalyst for the creation of self-sustained economic growth and prevent the death of an entire county through constant loss of its people.</P>
    <P>In order to survive, an area like Mayo needs investment to fuel economic growth and job creation.  To a great extent economic growth depends on having a highly qualified workforce in the area.  Mayo regional technical college Action Group and Mayo Vocational Education Committee believe that a regional technical college would be the most cost-effective way of giving the county an urgently needed economic boost.</P>
    <P>Contrary to a view expressed from some quarters, there is no division of purpose between the Mayo regional technical college Action Group and Mayo Vocational Education Committee.  Both bodies work together in common cause to bring a third level facility to Mayo and in their efforts have the support of local authorities in the county, community councils, chambers of commerce and so on.</P>
    <P>The link between industrial development and the regional colleges is particularly obvious from an examination of any of the existing centres in which colleges are based.  The benefits to a region can be seen clearly in a town like Athlone <Col N="692" /> where half the plastics industry in Ireland is located as a result of the plastics faculty in Athlone regional technical college. The fact that these advantages do not extend into the region of Connacht are also obvious.  The point must be taken that industry follows the college.  The present uneven distribution of industry within the region can only be changed by the provision of a college within Mayo.</P>
    <P>Education is one of the areas targeted for assistance from EC Structural Funds. The cost of building and equipping the new regional technical college in Tallaght has been largely funded from this source. Mayo's regional technical college was included in the submission for such funds by the working groups for the region and the hope would be that our Mayo EC Commissioner for Social Affairs, Mr. Flynn, with considerable funding available to him, both through the EC Structural Funds and other sources would be prepared, willing and anxious to supply the necessary financial resources to have a third level college located in his native county, if the will of native Government is such as to permit it.</P>
    <P>The purpose of these funds is to develop in particular the peripheral regions of Europe.  Can anybody in this House say to me that there is any region in Europe more peripheral than County Mayo?  The people of Mayo are asking that a small fraction of Ireland's share be directed to the county for the development of a regional technical college. What could such a facility do?  As I have stated earlier, it could help to attract badly needed industry to the area.  It would contribute to the decentralisation of third level education.  It would attract a corps of highly trained people to the area who would contribute to the social, economic and cultural development of the county.  It would help reverse the impact of unemployment and would also help reverse the consequences of emigration and migration.  It would contribute to the reversal of the inequality that exists.  I do not have to spell that out here in any great detail.</P>
    <P>There are many social reasons why we need a regional technical college in <Col N="693" /> Mayo.  The county is in decline.  Demographic projections suggest that by the early decades of the next century the county will be further depleted of its population and that the age and structure of those remaining will ensure that the county continues in decline.  There is no doubt that demographics merely indicate trends and they must not be seen as an inevitable prediction of the future.  Energetic, positive action at this stage can reverse this trend and, in order to avoid significant marginalisation a transfer of resources must take place.  It is in this context that the case for a regional technical college must be seen.  A modern regional technical college can stimulate the economy of Mayo.  If the State decides to build a regional technical college to educate the children in our area then our county will survive because of the spin-off effects.</P>
    <P>Our argument is based on a vision of the future which sees tomorrow's Mayo as a place where the age structure is properly balanced, a place which is thriving, productive and self-generating.  People can raise families away from the destructive and degenerating urban sprawl so visible on many parts of the east coast and do so in a place where they belong. The argument is based on a rejection of the thoughts of those who accept the decay which will allow Mayo to turn into a demographic desert, peopled by lonely old people whose families have left, with holiday cottages of those who appreciate quaint dereliction of what was once bold and proud and strong.  It is a matter of social choice of the future that we choose whether it is to be jiving at the crossroads or handbag snatching at the traffic lights. This is not purely an emotive wish.</P>
    <P>A decision to locate a regional technical college in Mayo based on our needs and on our present participation rates is entirely justifiable.  The expansion must be catered for.  That this expansion is seen within the context of a social policy is vital.  The economic case cannot be over-stressed.  A region in order to survive needs investment, economic growth and job creation.  Economic growth depends to a great extent on having a <Col N="694" /> highly qualified workforce.  The predictions for the decline in Mayo's population are frightening.  If this scenario is allowed to develop two problems will result: Mayo will loose its youth to large towns and cities in the east and abroad and the flight from Mayo will add to the population of an already over-crowded Dublin as evidenced in the recent census report.</P>
    <P>A regional technical college in Mayo would be of direct benefit to the local economy through an injection from salaries, student spending and building projects. This would have a multiplier effect resulting in the survival and expansion of the retail and accommodation industries. The direct effects of a regional technical college for the county will be an increase in investment in the whole county.  The benefits to a region can be seen in Athlone where the plastics faculty in the local regional technical college has resulted in virtually the entire plastics industry in Ireland being located in the midlands.</P>
    <P>There is a great wish for this facility in Mayo and every development agency from the county council down, the three urban authorities, all community councils, chambers of commerce, tourism bodies and development agencies are four square behind the campaign to have a regional technical college situated in the county.  This is not a request we made today or yesterday.  It is in fact all of 15 years, some would say even 20 years, since the idea was first mooted.  It is high time that the many promises made at various general elections, most recently last November, were honoured.</P>
    <P>The former Minister for Justice, who gave a commitment on behalf of the then Government and who is now in Brussels in charge of major sources of funding, is no less committed today to the development of a regional technical college in his native county than he was.  The commitment given by the Tánaiste on behalf of his party last November to the development of a third level facility in the county is no less sincere now than it was then.  I have every confidence that the Minister for Education in our partnership <Col N="695" /> Government, Deputy Bhreathnach, will be anxious to ensure that the commitment given by Commissioner Flynn, and endorsed by our party leader, Deputy Spring, is honoured and that she will be to the fore in delivering a long overdue third-level facility to Mayo which needs it so badly and has campaigned for it for so long.  The time has now come for action.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to the Minister's speech last night in which she referred, in what I would describe as Civil Service speak, to the decisions on investment which must be made.  I suggest to her that Mayo regional technical college falls within each of the six categories she mentioned.  It should get precedence over some of the other centres, particularly from the point of view of tourism, marine development and regional development.  More important, the siting of a regional technical college in the county would ensure that the population does not decline.  I compliment Councillor Paddy McGuinness, and his committee, who campaigned for so long for a regional technical college.  I was pleased today to introduce Councillor McGuinness to the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>The Minister last night made a commitment to set up first year national certificate programmes on an outreach basis, but further clarification is necessary in that regard.  The commitment given in the last general election was for fully fledged diploma and certificate courses for two or three years.  First year courses are not sufficient.  I hope the Minister will consider this matter further and ensure that the promise made will be honoured. Otherwise we will be back here again making this request.  The campaign for a regional technical college in Mayo has gone on for 20 years and it will continue for another 20 years if necessary.</P>
    <P>In the last general election Commissioner Flynn committed his party to the provision of full-time courses in Mayo but not to a fully fledged regional technical college now and that made much sense.  In the first year the college could cater for 100, 200 or 300 students and <Col N="696" /> the following year the figure could be increased to 600.  In that way the town could gradually develop to accommodate these students.  If a fully fledged regional technical college was developed in Castlebar now it would do extreme damage to the town which does not have the sporting and recreational facilities that would be demanded by 1,000 energetic people.  The only facility available to them would be the pubs, and clearly the people of Mayo would not accept such an arrangement.  Let us build on solid foundations.</P>
    <P>The people of Mayo were asked to liaise with the Minister's officials in deciding on the type of courses needed. There should be six courses, two technical and four academic.  I suggest that in their deliberations, Mayo Vocational Education Committee consider matters such as industrial technology, marine and tourism.  Mayo is now being given a chance to build from small beginnings.  If we simply provide such courses as are available in other regional technical colleges we will not achieve our desired goal of a fully fledged regional technical college. We must provide courses which are geared towards the type of industry that will survive into the next century.  That is my advice to the committee that has done such trojan work.  I hope that committee survives until there is a fully fledged regional techical college in the county.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the way she approached the problem of third level institutions.  The TUI has identified the need for colleges in areas such as Castlebar, Thurles, Dún Laoghaire and Blanchardstown.  In her opening remarks on this motion the Minister acknowledged that it is her responsibility not just to make promises but to make choices based on the facts and figures available.  I am aware, as are my colleagues, Deputies Therese Ahearn and Michael Lowry, of the work being done in our constituency to identify our special needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all agree that third level institutions are needed in the areas identified, but the Minister is faced with a dilemma in that difficult choices have to be made <Col N="697" /> on the basis of the amount of Structural Funds available to us and the amount provided by the Exchequer for these services. I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald, on her argument in Brussels for this money.  All of us have a responsibility to the electorate who, during election campaigns identify their needs.</P>
    <P>A small regional technical college which would accommodate 800 or 900 students would cost about £15 million.  If we put that in the context of the calls of Deputy Higgins for a primary school building programme, the total budget for that is about £25 billion.  Let us look at it in the context of the continuing competing demands being made on the Minister, who has at least said that we will do this in a planned way.  Let us work together on this.  We do not need a resolution from the Opposition.  The Minister, who is a teacher, has a commitment to education.  The programme for Government specifies that we have a commitment to making third level education available to as many students as possible, not just in Castlebar or Thurles but in strategic parts of the country where there is a proven need.  If we balance what we are trying to do tonight we will remove this issue from the political coal-face of the by-election and we will be constructive in the way we want to run our business.  If not, we will exceed the spending limits which Fine Gael are so worried about in the context of the Maastricht Agreement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanBree" hpid="Mr. Bree Mr. Bree">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bree</NameTxt>
      <P>Last evening the Minister for Education told the House that total public expenditure on education in 1993 amounted to £1.8 billion, representing approximately 90 per cent by Government spending and about 6 per cent of GDP.  This represents an unprecedented increase in the allocation of available resources to education.  Of this expenditure, third level education accounts for about 22 per cent of the education budget.  Until 30 years ago third level education was dominated by the university sector, which as recently as 1969 accounted for 78 per cent of total higher <Col N="698" /> education enrolments.  By 1985 this percentage had declined to less than 50 per cent, due to the establishment in the seventies of nine regional technical colleges and the expansion of the existing technical colleges in Dublin and Limerick. The regional technical colleges were designed primarily with a strong vocational education emphasis and established under the umbrella of the vocational education system.  Indeed, we are building on the strengths of the vocational education system.</P>
      <P>During the 1980s the demand for access to higher education increased dramatically and the regional technical colleges responded by increasing student numbers from 6,500 in 1980 to over 22,000 today.  Many new programmes developed during this period were specifically designed to meet regional or national industrial skills shortages.  One of the reasons for the ongoing success of the regional technical colleges is that they are in a position to respond quickly to local, regional and national needs.</P>
      <P>The new Regional Technical Colleges Act, which came into force on 1 January this year, has been welcomed by many academics; but, like the great majority of people who participate in the vocational education system, I believe the new legislation, which by and large removes local democratic control, will in time damage the future development of the colleges.</P>
      <P>In its programme the partnership Government regards education as the key to our future prosperity, to equity and to equal opportunities for all our citizens.  It anticipates that under the new Structural Funds extra resources will be available to assist with the cost of third level education.  On that basis it is the Government's intention to ensure that these additional resources are used to widen access to third level education in the interests of social justice and equity. The promotion of social justice and equity will include continuing improvements to the higher education grants scheme to ensure that no student is deprived of access to third level education because of financial circumstances. This is a fundamental issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="699" /> The Government is to be commended for its commitment to investment in higher education in order to provide sufficient places for all to benefit and to ensure that additional resources are used to widen access to third level education in the interests of social justice and equity.</P>
    <P>All the studies of our higher education system to date indicate the continued existence of marked social inequities.  In the second national survey of participation in higher education, compiled by Mr. Patrick Clancy for the Higher Education Authority and published in 1988, it is pointed out that more than 55 per cent of new entrants to higher education come from five social groups &mdash; the higher professionals, lower professionals, employers and managers, salaried employees and intermediate non-manual workers &mdash; although these groups constitute only 30 per cent of the relevant target population.  Other non-manual, skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled manual workers were seriously under represented.  From the last figures available we can clearly identify the problems of access.  In 1986, when the children of higher professionals composed 4 per cent of the national population under 15, 12 per cent of new entrants to higher education were sons and daughters of higher professionals.  At the same time the children of unskilled manual workers composed 8.2 per cent of the national population under 15, yet only 1.3 per cent of new entrants to higher education were sons and daughters of unskilled manual workers.  This type of social inequality in participation levels was greatest at university level.  Students from the higher professional groups were most highly represented at university level while students from working class and PAYE backgrounds had the lowest representation in the sector.  The disparities between social groups were most pronounced within their professional faculties.</P>

      <P>For example, in 1986 of the total of 398 students entering medicine in our universities 115 were the children of higher professionals and only two came from the semi-skilled or unskilled manual worker background.  The figures are similar in dentistry, the law and so on.  The reality in higher education today, particularly in the university sector, is that the sons and daughters of medical practitioners, dental practitioners, engineers, surveyors, architects, chemists, accountants and surgeons have much more opportunity to succeed than have the sons and daughters of busdrivers, postmen, storekeepers, cooks, waiters and so on and indeed than those coming from an agricultural background and from the unemployed.</P>
      <P>The Partnership Government is pledged to bring about the fundamental changes required to end this type of social inequality and injustice by ensuring that scarce resources are used to ensure that students will not be deprived of access to third level education due to financial circumstances.  Access to higher education is a fundamental issue and whether the college is in Sligo, Galway, Dublin, Castlebar or elsewhere is a secondary issue if the system does not allow access to the children of the great majority of PAYE workers, small farmers and the unemployed.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Government pledge to remove the inequalities in the system and I welcome the Minister's announcement that she has asked her Department to begin the necessary work of arranging for the provision of the first year of a number of national certificate programmes on an outreach basis in Castlebar.  I welcome the news that the courses may commence this September, subject to availability of accommodation and agreement with interested parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a former member of the board of management of Sligo Regional Technical College, I am aware that Sligo regional technical college in 1989 offered to run the first year of a national certificate in mechanical engineering course in Castlebar. The course for 24 students would have cost approximately £30,000.  For <Col N="701" /> some unknown reason the offer was not taken up.  I place on record the fact that the management and staff of Sligo regional technical college are more than willing to assist in whatever way they can in providing necessary courses in Castlebar and Mayo.  Two hundred and seventy students from Mayo are at present studying in Sligo regional technical college. Indeed, the Sligo regional technical college always considered the area stretching from Westport to Castlebar, from Strokestown to Cavan, as part of its catchment area.  It has a special interest in the development of third level education in this region.  I welcome the Minister's announcement.</P>

      <P>When listening to the debate last night and earlier tonight I could not help feeling that it is a sorry sight to see the many Opposition Deputies who have stooped to a level where education is being used as a political football.  This is being done for short term gain.  Many of the Fine Gael Deputies have reached a new low in using this issue in a vain attempt to gain some political kudos when it would seem that what they are really interested in is whipping up a controversy in a run-up to a by-election. It is unfair and disingenuous of Fine Gael Members to call in such a blind fashion for a regional technical college in Castlebar.</P>

      <P>Deputy Molloy's contribution last night in cataloguing the letters from successive TDs in successive election campaigns is sufficient to prove the point that this issue has been turned into a political football.  We can do without that in this country at present.  The Labour Party in Government will ensure that a rational approach is taken to the development of education.</P>
      <P>If one looks at the amount of Government expenditure which is given to education, it speaks volumes for the commitment of this Government to education. This year alone total expenditure on education amounts to £1.8 billion. This represents almost one-fifth of Government expenditure and approximately 6 per cent of gross domestic product. It is estimated that a regional technical college in Castlebar would cost in the region of £15 million.  This constitutes a significant investment by any standards.  Such a decision cannot be taken willy-nilly, regardless of the strength of any particular pressure group.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister for Education could sanction the development of such a building there are a number of factors which must be taken into account.  First, it must be clear that <Col N="703" /> there is a definite need for a regional technical college on a regional basis.  At present a number of colleges, including University College Galway, Galway regional technical college, Sligo regional technical college and Letterkenny regional technical college provide third level education in this region.  The Minister is correct in saying that she must look at the viability of establishing new centres as against the expansion of existing institutions.</P>
      <P>The Minister intends to examine the needs of different regions, socio-economic groups and the overall needs of society with a view to developing an integrated plan in third level education generally and in the context of the White Paper on Education.  For my part, as a public representative and as a teacher, I fully support the Minister in her stated approach to her education brief.  It is a rational and fair approach based on priorities and it is the only acceptable approach given the serious funding restrictions which we now face.</P>

      <P>Democratic Left support this motion concerning the provision of a regional technical college for Castlebar. We do so bearing in mind that the promised regional technical college in Castlebar is one of four regional technical colleges which have been promised many times for Castlebar, Thurles, Dún Laoghaire and Blanchardstown.  Sites have been purchased in some cases and the plans go back a long time.  There is nothing new about this promise.  It did not come about as a result of a by-election. It has been promised for at least a dozen years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was alarmed by the Minister's contribution last night.  I will leave it to colleagues representing the Mayo and adjoining constituencies to evaluate the promise she made regarding the provision of national certificate courses on <Col N="704" /> an out-reach basis from next year.  When I hear that she intends to review third level provision generally before making any decision in relation to new institutions, I see red lights.  &ldquo;Review&rdquo; is a code for either changing policy or doing nothing.  There is no need for a review. If the officials in the Department of Education and the higher education authorities have to carry out any more reviews on the provision of higher education they will become dizzy, in view of the reviewing that has been carried out up to now and in the past.</P>
    <P>We have had all the reviews and reports that we want; the facts are there. The Minister's contribution has projected that 100,000 third level places will be needed here by the end of this decade. At present there are 70,000 places, in other words, there is a need for an additional 30,000 places and that only takes account of the second level students coming on-stream.  It takes no account of the need to provide places for second chance education or the possible impact, if any, of the extension of the higher education grants scheme to mature students and the possible increased demand there.  We will need 30,000 places by the end of this decade and in 1993, after a dozen or more years of promises of new institutions, the Minister is talking about a review of policy.  What exactly does that mean?  Does it mean the Government and the Minister are changing their minds in regard to the long-standing policy, not by any interest or pressure group but by the Department, to provide regional technical colleges in those four locations?  Is it now intended to renege on that?  Is there now a new plan and set of priorities in regard to the provision of new institutions?  We need to know if that is the case.</P>
    <P>The four locations, Dún Laoghaire, Thurles, Blanchardstown and Castlebar have all been promised regional colleges and the people in those areas need to know if they will be provided.  If 30,000 extra places are to be provided by the end of this decade, it is not a review of policy that is needed but action on behalf of the Government to provide those colleges. <Col N="705" /> The existing 70,000 places are clearly inadequate.  The present conditions in third level colleges in which students must work are inadequate.  For example, the ratio of students to library places in one of our most esteemed institutions, Trinity College, is nine students for every library place and 14 students for every computer terminal.  The ratio gets worse as one goes through the educational institutions the regional technical colleges and so on.  Students are squashed into confined spaces and classrooms, classes are held in inappropriate buildings and in rooms that were never intended to be classrooms.</P>
    <P>Fee paying students are getting bad value for money.  Since 1978 fees have increased by twice the rate of inflation and students are crowded into institutions which are not capable of providing the service they deserve.  The problem is reflected in the demand for places.  It was reported last week that the number of applicants for CAO places this year will be twice the number of available places.  That is now affecting the points system and has led to the crazy position that the points required to qualify for courses in third level education have exceeded the basic requirements for the course itself.  They are operating not as a system of matriculation, as they were probably intended to be, but as a system of rationing limited places.</P>
    <P>The Minister today received a report on curriculum change.  There is no point in talking generally about curriculum change at second level while there is inadequate provision at third level and the competition for places there is such that it is impacting severely and adversely on second level.  Unless additional spaces are provided at third level there will continue to be problems with regard to the curriculum and education at second level. The various objectives set by this Government in the education area cannot be met unless additional places are provided.  With regard to the much lauded objective of greater equity in education, how may we provide for greater equity in education when there are insufficient places in the existing <Col N="706" /> system in the first instance?  The Clancy report has been mentioned on a number of occasions.  One of the matters referred to in that report concerning who goes to college was that there is a direct correlation between participation in education and the existence of a third level institution in the county or the area where students live.  Consequently, if there are areas, or parts of Dublin, which do not have a third level institution the chances are that the level of participation will be greatly reduced.  The Dublin area, for example, has also been the subject of many reports.</P>
    <P>It is clear there is a serious under provision of third level places in the greater Dublin area and that is something many people outside Dublin find difficult to understand.  They point to UCD, Trinity College, the Colleges of Education but, of course, those colleges are serving more of a national than local need.  In my constituency there is the bizzare situation of young people having to travel to Waterford, Carlow, Athlone and so on to get into third level colleges.</P>
    <P>The Minister will agree that the promised regional technical college for Dún Laoghaire is long overdue.  I recall the Minister soldiering side by side with me when, following the closure of Carysfort College, we argued that the college, instead of being sold to private interests, should be used to provide the planned regional technical college for that area.  Unfortunately, that was not done but the need remains.  A site was purchased in 1980 for the provision of a regional technical college, coincidentally during the tenure of office of the last Deputy from the Dún Laoghaire constituency to hold the Education portfolio. I hope that in the tenure of this Minister we will see more than the site and that the college will be provided.</P>
    <P>The demand for the regional colleges in Dún Laoghaire, Thurles, Blanchardstown and Castlebar is not an expression of localism.  It is very wrong of people to suggest that; it is a plan which was not invented by the people from those areas but one that evolved from the Department of Education.  This <Col N="707" /> plan was based on reports during the seventies, projecting the needs for third level education.  Those plans should be implemented.  We do not need more promises from the Minister about further reviews concerning the third level education provision but rather action.  In particular, we need a commitment from the Minister this evening that she will clear up what is behind this review.  I hope this review will not mean a retreat from the long standing commitment to provide regional technical colleges in Castlebar, Thurles, Blanchardstown and Dún Laoghaire if the 30,000 extra places needed are to be provided by the end of this decade.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for sharing his time with me.  The Progressive Democrats fully support this motion and the campaign for the provision of a regional technical college in Castlebar. It is a matter of public record that the Progressive Democrats Leader, Deputy O'Malley, has given the project his full endorsement and support.  It is also a matter of public record that my party colleague, Deputy Molloy, has vigorously pursued the matter with successive Ministers for Education.  Ample evidence of his efforts were read into the record of this House in the course of his excellent contribution to the debate last evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the time available to me I seek to make two brief points.  The first is that the presence of a regional technical college in a given area is rapidly becoming the major engine for economic growth in that area.  This is a proven fact.  I suggest members look at the wave of energy and enterprise that has hit the town of Tralee since the establishment of a regional technical college in that town.  The facts are that that college is worth £7 million annually to the local economy directly and a great deal more indirectly.  In addition, we should consider what has happened in my own city of Cork.  There the growth of so many new industries in the harbour region is related directly to the proximity of the regional technical college.  The <Col N="708" /> pharmaceutical and health care industries have created 3,500 well paid permanent jobs in the past ten years.  The location of those industries in that region is due directly to the fact that there is a regional technical college in the area.  The direct links that have built up between those industries and the faculties of chemical engineering and related faculties in the regional technical college in Cork help both the industry and education to feed and foster one another in the most vibrant and productive way possible, underpinning not alone the educational development and needs of the area but also its economic well being.</P>
    <P>I have taken those two examples to prove a point, that the presence of a regional technical college in an area is a major catalyst for growth and development. This fact is further borne out by the findings of the IDA.  In their up-to-date findings the IDA state that when attracting job creating industries to an area what matters nowadays is the availability of a well educated and well motivated young workforce with facilities for further research and back-up in the immediate area.  The days of grants and subsidies as incentives to prospective investors are now gone and we have to face up to that.  What counts now is the availability of relevant technological skills, marketing skills, business planning and language skills.  They are the skills that derive from a regional technical college located in the area.  The Culliton report also bears this out.  I do not have time to quote from the Culliton report which is the blueprint for industrial development and job creation here for the remainder of this century.  The key provision of Cullition is that of more technological education here, in other words, more provision for the kind of education provided in regional technical colleges.</P>
    <P>If it is the intention of this Government to address regional development in its fullest sense then it can no longer refuse to locate a full regional technical college in Castlebar to serve the Mayo region. Those who seek to argue that the area is adequately served by regional technical <Col N="709" /> colleges in Galway or elsewhere miss the key point which is that Mayo is a region in its own right and has a right to develop to its full potential.  It has a right to make every effort to keep its young people at home working for their own people in their own county, fully exploring and exploiting the potential of their county and working for the local economy in a national context.  The Mayo regional technical college action committee rightly see the provision of a regional technical college as a central tool to enable that to happen.  Their efforts, and what they are trying to do, would be fully supported and endorsed by all up-to-date research.</P>
    <P>For too long they have seen their county bled by emigration, they have seen many of their brightest and best people work abroad, like the Wild Geese of old, fighting in everybody's battle except their own.  I met those people during the course of holidays working in New York, Boston, London, Manchester, Birmingham and Dublin building up the economies of other countries far flung around the world.  Is it any wonder that contemporary people in Mayo would want to halt this process of emigration and retain the next generation of young people to work at home for their own people, their own county, their own province and their own country?  They should be supported in their efforts.</P>
    <P>My second point relates to those who say there is sufficient provision in a centre such as Galway.  I found out today that at present 356 students from Mayo are studying in Galway Regional Technical College.  Provision ought to be made for these students at home.  The fact is that the colleges in Galway are already full, not to mention the growth in the demand for third level places clearly outlined here by Deputy Gilmore, another Galway man.</P>

      <P>The point I am making is that Galway is not in a position to respond to the demand.  Rather than providing <Col N="710" /> for an extension to the regional technical college in Galway, I appeal to the Minister to consider setting up a separate regional technical college in Mayo to cater for the existing and emerging needs of the area.  She could look to the Structural Funds for the capital funding for such a project.  By doing this she would not only be meeting the educational needs of the area but she would also be doing something of immensely greater value: she would be providing a tool for the revitalisation of that corner of the west of Ireland and all of the west in general.  She would also be doing what the Government said it would do when it was formed, that is, putting in place instruments of job creation which would enable our young people to work at home and build up their country.  I appeal to the Minister to go back to the drawing board, reconsider her decision and not put any stumbling blocks in the way of providing a regional college for Castlebar without any further delay.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity of supporting this Fine Gael motion which calls for the siting of a regional technical college in Castlebar. The case for such a college has been well researched, well documented and very well presented by my colleagues.  They have set out in detail the demographic, social and economic reasons an regional technical college should be located in Castlebar.  Most important of all, they have highlighted the educational necessity for such an establishment.  The case has been well made, logically, economically and educationally; the case stands on its merits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My reason for supporting the case for a regional technical college in Castlebar stems from much more than the simple expedient of supporting a motion put forward by my party.  My support is founded on a desire which I have voiced in this House on a number of occasions in the past and which has been the subject of much concern also in my constituency of North Tipperary.  That desire has been, and will continue to be, to see that the Government honours a commitment of <Col N="711" /> many years standing, a commitment which the Fine Gael Party worked extremely hard to fulfil while in office and brought to the very brink of fruition, only to have the hopes and expectations of all the people of Tipperary and Mayo dashed in the cruelest manner possible by a Fianna Fáil administration which left the educational needs of many regions of the country in tatters.</P>
    <P>I am not speaking of some airy-fairy notions built on hastily thought-out ideas or resulting from ill-conceived plans.  The needs of Mayo and Tipperary in this instance run parallel to each other.  Both counties have been isolated from mainstream third level education by reasons of neglect, a neglect based on reasons of penny-pinching and short-sighted Government policy which failed utterly to take cognisance of the trends taking place in latter day Ireland.  Promises wer made and broken and commitments were reneged on.  Senior Ministers from Tipperary and Mayo massaged, used and abused the electorate systematically at election times and then, when they were re-elected to Government, failed to exercise their ministerial clout in favour of the very people who had delivered to them the status of high office together with the attendant mercs and perks.</P>
    <P>For over a decade now I have pursued the ideal of a third level institution in Thurles on behalf of the people of Tipperary. When first mooted the idea had the universal support of all sections of the community &mdash; educational, commercial, industrial, administrative, cultural and social.  When the Fine Gael Party came into Government its faith in the concept and plans put forward at local level was such that approval was given for the preparation of plans and for the purchase of a site.  That purchase was duly completed and the project seemed set fair for a successful conclusion.  Just when hopes were at their highest, Fianna Fáil was returned to Government and in true blinkered fashion the cold store for plans and ambitions was reopened.  If this were a story by a seanachaí, this would be <Col N="712" /> the point where I would say &ldquo;and things rested so&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We have persevered in the face of adversity.  The people of Tipperary and Mayo are noted for their tenacity and refusal to accept defeat.  From those twin virtues there has sprung what I believe to be one of the most revolutionary ideas to be propounded on the Irish education scene in our lifetime.  I am speaking of the progression of the original plan in to the concept of the Tipperary Rural and Business Development Institute.  What this has done is to broaden and enlarge the regional college ethos into a development plan which caters not just for young students coming directly from the secondary school stream, but for those of all ages who wish to avail of the opportunity to broaden their academic and vocational skills, having been out of the education system for a period.</P>
    <P>The proposals contained in the Tipperary Rural and Business Development Institute project are innovative and imaginative, forward looking and progressive, but at the same time entirely conscious of the need to refurbish and strengthen our traditional core values among rural and community based groups.  There are, in summary, three basic elements contined in the plan.  The first and probably the principal element would be to provide access to third level education for those wishing to progress in this direction, in tandem with this would be certificate and diploma programmes for those wishing to improve their education levels, along with degree level programmes to be provided in co-operation with UCC and other degree-awarding institutions.  There would be specific training programmes for locally based service operators which would be provided on campus, in outcentres or inhouse. An adult and continuing education programme would be developed as a national model, while a technology centre would make courses available through distance learning.  A proportion of these programmes would be self-financing, consolidating the current Tipperary rural and business development programme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="713" /> The second basic element of the proposal envisages a research, programme development and strategic planning unit which would support and staff community-oriented work at local level in the catchment area.</P>
    <P>The third element in the proposal concerns the mainstream programmes, improving access to third level education in the catchment area, thereby according with the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and the programme for Government generally and in particular with the needs of the lower socio-economic group.  It would have a significant contribution to make towards relieving the national demands for third level places without putting any additional strains on the infrastructures already in place.</P>
    <P>There is an excellent case for the establishment of third level institutions in Tipperary and Mayo.  However, it is with a sense of profound regret and sadness that I say that this Government, like its predecessor, is not committed to providing colleges in either Thurles or Castlebar. The Minister in her contribution last night conveniently ignored the fact that the Labour Party gave a categoric assurance during the last general election that a third level college would be its priority for Tipperary and would be established as a matter of urgency.  I am therefore alarmed by her statement, and I quote: &ldquo;I believe that a review of the third level provision generally is required before any decisions could be made with regard to new institutions.&rdquo;  This statement effectively means that all previous commitments and promises count for nothing and have been dismissed.  We are now back to square one, back to the drawing board.  I see this review mechanism as a deliberate cynical ploy, a foot-dragging, stalling exercise.  It is an insult to our intelligence to propose a review committee after 15 years because of the exceptional volume of data, statistics and information already available to the Department of Education.  Tipperary and Mayo have absolutely no chance of third level institutions unless the projects are included for funding under the Structural <Col N="714" /> Funds.  The Government will finalise the detail of its submission for the 1994 round of structural aid in the coming months.  I am fearful that Thurles and Castlebar will not be included in this programme and that the Government will attempt to fob us off with the excuse that a further meaningless and futile review exercise was not completed in time to allow for their inclusion.</P>
    <P>I wish to say in conclusion that I was amazed at Deputy Shortall's intemperate and ill-considered outburst.  She has obviously not read Labour Party election literature for Tipperary.  I would advise her that the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, Deputy Ryan and Deputy Ferris made this college a political issue during the election, for short term gain.  They were adamant that we had a legitimate case and that there should be no further delay. They were adamant that after 15 years the project was researched to death. They were adamant that there would be no obstacles and that money would not be a problem.  Above all, they were adamant that with Labour in Government we would get our colleges in Thurles and Castlebar.  Now is the time to deliver.</P>

      <P>The saga of Mayo Regional Technical College is well documented and it was clearly articulated last night in this Chamber.  It is well chronicled outside this House.  I do not propose to hold up the proceedings of the House by giving a chronological history of the course of this saga.  For me this is a matter of principle.  Clearly a commitment had been given by all political parties in Government over the years.  I regret, therefore, that the Regional Technical College Action Group found it necessary to come here again to secure a new commitment in regard to a matter which they understood had already been officially <Col N="715" /> agreed.  Their journey should not have been necessary.</P>
      <P>I was pleased to hear the Minister state yesterday that courses can be put in train in Castlebar next September.  She appeared to be taking account of the situation in Castlebar, bearing in mind what had already been promised.  The Minister indicated that interested parties in Castlebar had been consulted regarding details of courses most appropriate to the location.  Such consultation is fine but I trust that the whole responsibility for establishing those courses will not be placed on local interests alone.  There is clear need to have the courses carefully vetted so that they can be developed and built upon while catering for the needs of the region.  The courses should not be in competition with those offered in other places.  The possibility must exist that these courses will lead to the development of a full third level institution at a later stage.  Experts in the Minister's office and in the Department have a part to play and they should be seen to be actively engaged in establishing this initiative.  The commitment given to Mayo Regional Technical College and to Castlebar should be honoured in full.</P>
      <P>Claims are made for regional technical colleges in other areas but very few can match the validity of the Mayo claim. Many promises have been made in regard to Mayo.  Sites were identified and some planning was done.  Costings were also made.  The size of the county justifies reference to it as a region.  Mayo has the third highest level of third level participation. No county of its size is without a third level institution.  There is the need to provide extra third level places in the years ahead.  There is also the need to respond to the clearly expressed wishes and demands of the business and industrial sectors in the county.  Other reasons have already been mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate Mr. McGuinness and the action group on their dedication and commitment to this project.  Reference has already been made to pressure groups, but I would not regard this action group as a pressure group in the real <Col N="716" /> sense, nor can it be claimed that granting their demand would be yielding to a pressure group rather than responding to need, with carefully researched and drawn up plans.  The regional technical college was promised long before the action group came into existence.</P>

The project had the goodwill of all political parties.  Judging by the debate on this motion, that still seems to be the case.  I would appeal to the Minister to honour the commitment given to Castlebar and to the regional technical college in Mayo and to bring the matter to a happy conclusion.</P>

      <P>Deputy Kenny and I are very grateful to all the Opposition Parties for their unstinting support.  I was somewhat amused listening to Deputy Hughes stating in a so-called &ldquo;rational&rdquo; defence of his erstwhile colleague, Mr. Flynn, that Castlebar would not be able to cope in regard to accommodation or recreation.  Were Letterkenny, Sligo, Tralee or Athlone able to cope?  Castlebar can more than cope.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am extremely disappointed with the <Col N="717" /> Minister's reply.  Deputy Kenny and I argued cogently for 40 minutes yesterday that Castlebar should have a regional technical college.  We dealt with the human aspects, the social aspects, the economic aspects and the education aspects.  We outlined the history of the proposals and showed the clear progress made up to 1987 by Fine Gael and Labour, by which time agreement had been reached in principle, a fine site had been chosen and the courses agreed.  It was all systems &ldquo;go&rdquo;.  From 1987 to 1992 all we had was promise after promise and commitment after commitment loudly heralded, particularly at election time but subsequently reneged on and smashed to smithereens by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>On 11 November 1992 we had a final promise and a clear commitment from Pádraig Flynn that six courses would start in Castlebar from September.  These were to be four academic courses and two technical courses.  Approximately 300 students were to be taken in and a college principal was to be appointed. Three weeks ago, the Minister for Education blew that proposal out of the water.  In the meantime Mr. Flynn had turned his back on the 9,000 people who gave him a first preference vote and settled himself neatly into the luxury of his Brussels portfolio.  Coincidentally, this portfolio involves total command and disbursement of European Social Fund grants.  Grants for regional technical colleges, polytechnics and all the colleges of technology in this country and every other country in the Community will come from the ESF funds controlled by Pádraig Flynn, yet there is not a solitary shilling for his native Castlebar or Mayo. I was amused at the so-called defence by Deputy Hughes and I can only conclude that he was speaking with tongue in cheek.</P>
    <P>Last night Deputy Kenny and I showed that Mayo is not a county but a region. We have lost 63,000 people since 1926. We have lost industry after industry, service infrastructure after service infrastructure, schools, post offices and small retail outlets.  We proved to the Minister that the existing colleges and universities <Col N="718" /> are bursting at the seams and that there will be campus chaos in September. Seven new colleagues at least are needed.</P>
    <P>I take grave exception to being lectured by Deputy Shortall about the waste of £15 million on a human resource in Mayo.  Four months ago the Labour Party were the great champions of ordinary people.  What would James Connolly say?  What we are saying is that we showed that Dublin has 12 publicly funded colleges and Mayo has none.  We do not begrudge an extra one for Dublin, but give us ours.  We showed that Limerick has four publicly funded colleges and Mayo has none.  We showed that Cork has three publicly funded colleges and Mayo has none.  There are regional technical colleges scattered around the provinces, and they are welcome to them, but Mayo has none.</P>
    <P>We illustrated conclusively that regions which do not have higher education colleges simply cannot compete with other regions in terms of attracting industry from the outside.  We have shown that if one wants to develop the regions and help them grow their own indigenous industries then there is a need to liaise with, feed off and interact with research and development facilities in technical colleges.  We pledged, on the basis of the supposed new emphasis on regional development, that central to such development in a region such as Mayo is a regional technical college. Last, but by no means least, we underpinned our case with the clear statistic that Mayo has the third highest participation rate in the country.</P>
    <P>We set out to make a case and we made our case.  However, despite the elaborate detail and argument we presented, not a single argument we made was addressed by the Minister.  Our motion was simply faced down by the vague, aspirational and bland amendment which will be voted on in this House in ten minutes' time.</P>
    <P>Instead of responding to the points, the arguments and the statistics advanced we heard from Minister Bhreathnach a ten page statement ranging across the general canvas of third level facilities.  It <Col N="719" /> was arid, bureaucratic and unfeeling.  It is only in page nine that we get to the nub of why we are here tonight and why the Gallery is packed tonight with Mayo people.  The Minister said: &ldquo;I have stated already that I believe that a review of the third level provision generally is required before any decision could be made with regard to new institutions&rdquo;.  Deputy Gilmore's suspicions are right &mdash; effectively, Castlebar and Thurles have disappeared from the league table.  Instead of a commitment to a precise number of third level courses all we get is a highly dubious, watery commitment to some out-reach courses &ldquo;subject to viability including demand, resource availability and of course agreement with interested parties&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>For a rapidly shrinking community of 110,000 people frantically clinging by their fingernails to survive, looking for hope, encouragement and support, this is simply not good enough.  We want our regional technical college in Mayo.  We are entitled to our regional technical college and we have been let down tonight. We have been turned down and we are angry.  The people of Mayo are watching tonight's proceedings in this House both in this Chamber and outside and tonight's vote will be watched with interest. Tonight will not be forgotten.</P>

      <P>This Fine Gael motion calling for the establishment of a regional technical college in Castlebar and for the commencement of courses in September 1993 has had the support of a number of parties in the House.  I want to thank each of the speakers who took the time and had the concern to come in here and offer their support both for this and for other projects.  As Deputies from Mayo, we are very grateful for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some points must be answered and some points have arisen that are of interest.  For instance, Deputy Bree pointed out that Sligo regional technical college were interested in having third level courses down as far as Castlebar and beyond.  He is correct when he states that an outreach course was approved for <Col N="720" /> Castlebar to be held in Davitt College, which is a large vocational school down there.  However, it was impossible to hold that course in that college because it already has 750 pupils in a building that was designed for 500 and the rooms there are required even on Saturdays.  Therefore, it is impossible to take up any offer made by Sligo regional technical college.</P>
    <P>I am saddened and disappointed that the old ways of politics seem to be gone in the context of a man's word being his bond.  Did the former Minister Flynn not meet with civil servants in Castlebar on 12 October, did he not meet with a member from the administration unit and from the planning unit and an other senior official and did he not subsequently formally announce to the regional technical college group that six courses would start in this year, that four of those would be academic, that two would be technological, that these would start with 200-250 students rising to 800 within three years and that this college would have a fulltime independent principal?  Did the Minister make that announcement or did he not?  Did he not go down on his two knees and ask the regional technical college action group to accept these proposals as Government proposals as distinct from merely proposals of a Deputy and a Minister from the county?</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that Minister Bhreathnach is going down to Mayo, and she will be royally and regally received. I would ask that she not alone visit Castlebar but take a trip down to the Céide Fields in north Mayo.  I would suggest that she go around though the barony of Erris, set the milometer on her Mercedes and see how far it is back to Dublin.  She should go down to any railway station or coach pick-up point any Sunday evening and look at the numbers that are exiting from our county on a daily and on a weekly basis.</P>
    <P>I am grateful for the support given by Deputy Quill of the Progressive Democrats. A potential candidate for that party has already committed the Progressive Democrats to granting a fullscale regional technical college in Castlebar in their first term back in Government.  I <Col N="721" /> want to answer the charge made in this House last night by Deputy Molloy, a long time Member of this House, who said that the Progressive Democrats had promoted and vigorously supported this concept.  Let me tell Deputy Molloy that I have received evidence in writing from the regional technical college action group which states quite clearly that the only support given by Deputy Molloy was in a hand written letter he wrote to them on 25 March 1989 in which he said he fully supported the campaign and was putting down some parliamentary questions for the next Dáil session to establish the up to date position and present Government commitment.  He followed that on 30 November 1989, when he was in Government, by confirming that he had taken the matter up with the Minister for Education and that immediately he had any news he would contact the regional technical college action group again.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy was a Minister at the same Cabinet table as Minister Flynn, but he was more interested in promoting his three local council candidates in the 1991 election than in promoting the regional technical college concept for Castlebar.  There is yet on record no statement from former Minister Molloy where he gave his full support and consent to this.  The Progressive Democrats were so bad that the regional technical college action group had to come to Dublin to meet personally with Deputy Mary Harney to explain to her the discrepancy between public statements by the Progressive Democrats and their statements on the record; that meeting took place in this House on 13 October. I would value Deputy Molloy's support rather than any vindictive backbiting, because what is required here is a cohesive and co-ordinated record.</P>

      <P>On 7 June 1985 the then Minister for Education, Deputy Gemma Hussey, said that the position was that she had authorised the commencement <Col N="722" /> of planning and design work for the proposed college and that her Department would be writing to the vocational education committee in relation to the procedures involved.  On 28 January 1987 the then Minister for Finance, Deputy John Bruton, said that he was also agreeable to the purchase of a site for the proposed Castlebar regional technical college and that as soon as an appropriate application was received his Department would sanction it.  An official letter on file on 2 February 1987 from the late county manager in County Mayo, Mr. Michael O'Malley, stated that a site was available located between Travenol Laboratories and Davitt House on the main Castlebar/Claremorris road, that the site was approximately 18 acres in area and had a frontage to the main road of 650 feet with full services.  Let me remind Minister Niamh Bhreathnach of the words of her Leader, the present Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, on 22 February 1990 when he said the Labour Party pledges its full support to the people of Mayo and considers the provision of proper third level facilities in Castlebar as the major priority.</P>
      <P>The Minister in her capacity as chairwoman of the Labour Party told a very large crowd in the National Concert Hall, with emotion in her voice: &ldquo;Our hour has come and we will look after our own.&rdquo; Enough has been written about looking after the Labour Party's own; it is now time to look after the other 80 per cent.</P>
      <P>I make a final plea to Deputies Morley, Moffat and Hughes, who were elected to the Dáil by the people of our county to represent the students, the parents, the industries and the businesses, to in this instance disregard the ruling made by any party Whip and vote with the Fine Gael Party and the other parties supporting this motion.  Those Deputies should stand by their county in its hours of need and vote with their heads as well as their hearts.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Attacks in France on Irish Trucks.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much welcome the opportunity in this House to condemn in the strongest possible terms the recent cowardly attacks by French fishermen on Irish trucks and to draw attention to the stress and strain caused to the drivers of these trucks containing fish being brought to the French market.</P>
      <P>The Minister is no doubt aware of the serious crisis in the fishing industry throughout Europe and the failure of the Community to resolve the difficulties, particularly in relation to third country imports which are not being controlled by existing Community regulations.  Furthermore, much more stringent health and hygiene procedures should apply to imported products as standards in these countries often fall far short of what the Community requires of its own industry.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that now is not the time to outline the importance of the fishing industry to this country and the real potential which exists for expansion in this industry in relation to increased exports, increased home consumption and the opportunity to promote new jobs which are so badly needed at this time.  I hope, however, the Minister will afford us the opportunity at an early stage to have a much wider debate on this very important matter.</P>
      <P>Even allowing for the frustration which exists among those engaged in the fishing industry throughout the European Community as a result of the current state of the industry, nobody can for one moment condone the behaviour of the French fishermen towards fellow citizens of the Community in the course of these attacks.  The French authorities must be reminded that the Single European Act is now in operation and that they have a responsibility to ensure the protection of European citizens going about their daily business from the excess of their fishermen and also of European Community products going to the French market or in transit through French territory.</P>
      <P>These incidents are in breach of fundamental Community principles with regard to free trade and under no circumstances should they be tolerated.  EC member states must insist that EC law is adequate to protect European Community workers and their produce from being attacked or destroyed in any of the member states.  Strong penalties must be imposed on both the member state and those who carry out these attacks to prevent a recurrence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most recent attack, which took place on 15 March, was carried out by a mob of about 150 to 200 people on two Irish lorry drivers who were forced to lie on the floors of their cabins while locks on the loads they were carrying were broken and the tyres of the tractor units were punctured.  Diesel oil was then sprayed over the fish.  The question I <Col N="729" /> would like to put to the Minister is: where were the French police in the port of Boulogne while this was taking place?</P>
    <P>It is my understanding that approximately £140,000 worth of damage has already been caused to Irish owned produce.  I ask the Minister to insist that the French authorities be made pay for the losses incurred to date and that adequate compensation be paid to both the owners of the trucks and the drivers for the pain and suffering endured by them.</P>
    <P>I would also like to know the present EC laws relating to these attacks and if there are penalties which can be imposed on member states found to be in breach of these laws.  If there are no such laws in place will the Minister assure the House that he will raise this matter at EC level and initiate a debate on the need for such laws?  It is clear from media reports that violent attacks have been carried out by French fishermen demonstrating against foreign imports for a number of weeks resulting in millions of pounds worth of damage to property and produce.  French fishermen must be reminded that exports from Ireland to other EC countries are not foreign imports under EC law.</P>
    <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I wish to share my time with my colleague, Deputy Sheehan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join in the protest by Deputy Barrett to the Minister and call on the Government to take immediate steps to, first and foremost, condemn these outrageous attacks by French fishermen on our lorry drivers while conveying fish to the French market.  This problem must be tackled immediately and the Minister for the Marine must ensure that these attacks cease.  French fishermen must realise that we are all Europeans and that all European Community citizens have the right of access to the respective markets of the European Community.  I ask the Minister to take the matter up immediately with the French authorities and secure compensation for the losses incurred by our lorry drivers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has been very active in seeking solutions to the problems which have developed recently on fish markets within the Community. We strongly supported the decision taken on 25 February last to introduce minimum prices on imports into the Community of cod, saithe, haddock, hake and monkfish.  These prices will apply for a four month period.</P>
      <P>At the Fisheries Council last week, my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, backed proposals to raise these minimum import prices and to enforce strict controls on imports from non-EC countries with a view to ensuring that Community rules are not breached by illegal imports.  The Council agreed that the Commission would consider extending the minimum price regime to other species and that it would make proposals for a better control of direct landings from third countries in Community ports.</P>
      <P>The Council has requested the Commission to propose better control of landings of third country fish and to enter into contacts with third countries to ensure control of imports and market stability. Landings that may be illegal in some way may be the action of private individual operators.  I would not like to name any non-EC country here in a way that might seem to attach blame to it without adequate evidence, or which in any case could be taken out of context.</P>

    <P>My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, Deputy O'Sullivan, also took the opportunity, on behalf of the Government, in the margins of the Fisheries Council, to protest to his French counterpart about the recent spate of attacks on Irish lorries carrying fish products and to demand immediate action by the French authorities to put a halt to these illegal and totally unacceptable incidents.  He pointed out that Irish fish exporters are operating within EC regulations and deserve full protection from the French authorities.  The French Minister accepted that Ireland has a valid complaint and gave assurances that Irish lorries would be afforded every <Col N="731" /> possible protection in France.  My Department is actively pursuing this matter through the embassy in Paris with a view to ensuring that these assurances are given concrete effect and that any recurrence of these attacks is prevented.</P>
    <P>The embassy will provide every assistance to any Irish citizens involved and arrangements are being put in train whereby Bord Iascaigh Mhara will inform the Department of the Marine, which in turn will inform our embassy in Paris, of the details of consignments, such as landing points and times, proposed itinerary to final destination, vehicle registration number, etc.  This information will be passed by the embassy to the French police authorities, who have undertaken to provide protection at the point of importation and endeavour to anticipate and avoid any potential trouble on the subsequent route.  I hope these measures will put an end to these incidents, which are unwarranted and from which our drivers and exporters should be protected.</P>

      <P>I thank you, Sir, for giving me the opportunity to raise this very important matter with the Minister for Social Welfare.  Approximately 650 people sign on at the employment exchange in Dunmanway.  The number is rising daily.  This is a very busy office as it serves those signing for unemployment benefit and assistance within a radius of approximately ten miles from Ballingeary in the north to Enniskean in the east, Drimoleague in the west to Rossmore in the south.  It is expected that by the end of the month there will be <Col N="732" /> over 700 applicants signing on at this exchange.</P>
      <P>The Dunmanway employment exchange is a well established office, being in operation since the Unemployment Assistance Act of 1934.  Down through the years the staff has been very co-operative to the people who need its services.  Dunmanway has suffered severe unemployment in recent times.  Ninety workers were made redundant from one of the main factories in the town last November and a further 35 from that same plant will lose their jobs.  I appeal to the Minister not to add to the dismal record by proceeding or threatening to close the employment exchange.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister state publicly tonight if it is his intention to close the employment exchanges in rural areas, because it has come to my notice that the files of smallholders drawing unemployment assistance were moved from the Skibbereen employment exchange sometime ago and transferred to the employment exchange in Hanover Street, Cork?</P>

      <P>I appreciate the co-operation of my constituency colleague, but together we are trying to retrieve a situation which is causing a lot of concern. Dunmanway is a town in the middle of our constituency which has suffered quite crushing blows with the loss of 184 jobs in the Molnlycke plant, which we debated some weeks ago.  This was a disaster of &ldquo;Digital&rdquo; proportions to the <Col N="733" /> town.  The problem was further compounded by the loss of 30 jobs in the Interhat factory and a further 25 were let go from a nearby timber company.  That is the background to the question of the retention of the employment exchange. The town is now being threatened with a further blow.  The manager of the employment exchange is to retire and a question has been raised as to the future of the office.  As mentioned by my colleague, approximately 650 sign on at the employment exchange and the number is rising by the day.  Unfortunately, there is no prospect of a reduction in the number and seasonal lay-offs increase the figure even more.</P>
      <P>The office has been in operation for approximately 50 years and the excellent staff is quite able and prepared to take over the running of the office.  It must be emphasised that the lady members of staff have given good and energetic service for years past and there is no difficulty from the point of view of somebody taking over the job.</P>
      <P>It would compound the problems in Dunmanway if this office were to close. The town is virtually on its knees. However, there is a voluntary community group fighting back, but it needs the support of the Government and State agencies.  What we need at this stage is a clear and unequivocal confirmation that the employment office will remain open. Fine Gael appeal to the Minister to ensure that occurs and we demand an assurance that this cloud of gloom which has gathered over the town be lifted. Finally, a Minister from Dublin may not understand the impact of such a closure on a rural town like Dunmanway.</P>

I urge the Minister to give us positive news on this tonight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <P>I appreciate the points made by the Deputies.  My Department is currently providing a service for the unemployed in the Dunmanway area through the agency of a branch employment office.  Offices of this kind are run by private individuals who are contracted by my Department to provide a limited range of services.</P>
      <P>The manager of the branch employment office in Dunmanway has advised me that she wishes to terminate her contract with my Department at the beginning of April 1993.  The retiring manager has provided an excellent service over the years.  She has worked as branch manager since March 1957.  I want to take this opportunity to thank her for her dedication and commitment and to wish her well in her retirement.</P>
      <P>There are at present 76 branch employment offices and 52 local offices staffed by employees of my Department.  The branch managers carry out their functions under the direction and control of the manager of the parent local office which, in the case of Dunmanway, is in Bantry.  Deciding officers, who make the decisions on claims for unemployment benefit and assistance, are based in the Bantry office and claims are dealt with speedily.</P>
      <P>Dunmanway branch office deals with approximately 660 clients each week. Over 400 of these clients sign on at local Garda stations and are paid through the network of post offices in the area.  The remainder sign on and are paid at the Dunmanway branch office on a weekly basis.  In addition to the branch office, there is an officer of my Department based in Dunmanway who is responsible for covering the full area serviced by the branch office.  His office is open on Tuesday of each week to deal with general inquiries from the public and also to deal with the examination and assessment of claims across a variety of schemes operated by the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="735" /> I am mindful also of the other clients of my Department in the area, such as old age pensioners, lone parents, those on disability and those in receipt of child benefit.  My ultimate aim in relation to the provision of services generally to the public is to ensure an up-to-date localised service across all the schemes operated by my Department.</P>
    <P>In my view there is a growing need today for an information service on all social welfare schemes.  In addition, many people want to be able to discuss their business in confidence with officials of my Department locally rather than have to write to Dublin, Sligo or Letterkenny. Recent advances in information technology have enabled my Department to extend the range of information which can be made available at local level.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the Deputies' concern about the continuation of a service for the people of Dunmanway and I wish to assure the Deputies that my plans are for an improved service to all my Department's customers in the area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment as this is not the first time I tabled this question.  I thank also the Minister for coming into the House to reply to an issue which will loom on the horizon over the next few years, not only in the Dundalk area but nationally &mdash; the difficulties experienced by parents in securing places for their children in second level schools.  I understand that because of a certain hump in the population graph there will be difficulties in getting pupils into second level schools not only in September 1993 but, <Col N="736" /> more particularly, in 1994 and in following years.  I understand that in the Dundalk area alone approximately 150 pupils will have extreme difficulty in securing places in second level schools.  This is already evident in the efforts of parents to secure places for their children.  Some parents have applied to all the schools in the Dundalk area and have been refused on the basis that there is not enough accommodation for the projected number of pupils.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to liaise with the principals of the major schools in the greater Dundalk area in an effort to resolve this problem. The principals are concerned about this and estimate that approximately 100 boys and 50 girls will have difficulty in securing places, particularly from 1994 onwards.</P>
      <P>I do not know the solution to this problem. Perhaps the Minister and her Department are aware of the difficulties that lie ahead.  Obviously, it would not be feasible to build massive extensions to existing schools if this problem is to last for only a number of years.  However, we must make plans for additional accommodation in the next few years to take into account the huge influx of pupils to schools right across the country.  It is not acceptable that pupils or parents should be told that they should enrol in schools in adjoining towns.  That is not feasible, particularly in a constituency such as Louth.  Again, I thank the Minister for coming into the House and I await her reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  It gives me the opportunity of outlining the present and future position on post-primary education in Dundalk.</P>
      <P>There are seven post-primary schools &mdash; six secondary and one vocational &mdash; in Dundalk.  These schools are: Coláiste Ris, St. Mary's College, De La Salle secondary school, St. Vincent's secondary school, St. Louis secondary school, Dundalk grammar school and the vocational school.  The current enrolment in the schools is 4,768 pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The output from all the primary <Col N="737" /> schools in the Dundalk post-primary catchment area shows a clear decline in the numbers coming on stream in the next seven years &mdash; down from 1,022 pupils in 1992 to 895 in 1999.  This represents a drop of 12 per cent in the numbers who will be seeking second-level education in this area in the coming years.  In addition, the decline in births for County Louth is one of the highest in the country &mdash; the most recent statistics available show that in the period 1980 to 1991 the percentage drop for the county was 38 per cent and for the Dundalk area itself around 20 per cent.  In these circumstances the provision of further additional permanent accommodation in Dundalk would not be warranted.</P>
    <P>The Department accepts, that in the short term the demand for places in some of the post-primary schools in Dundalk may exceed the number of places available. In the circumstances, any application for the provision of extra temporary accommodation at these schools will be given careful and sympathetic consideration.  To date, however, no such application has been received in the Department in respect of the coming school year.</P>
    <P>New/replacement accommodation has already been approved in recent times for a number of post-primary schools in Dundalk, which when provided will increase the capacity of the centre considerably. The schools in question are the vocational school, De La Salle secondary school and the grammar school.  As is the case with all major post-primary centres, the enrolment/accommodation situation in Dundalk will be kept under review in the Department in the light of the most up to date enrolment figures and other relevant factors, such as demographic trends, housing and birth statistics for the area.</P>

      <P>I thank you, Sir, for allowing me to raise this matter and I thank the Minister for coming into the House to reply.  The question of Dooard <Col N="738" /> bridge at Rossinver, County Leitrim, has been ongoing for approximately 20 years, since it was closed by means of cratering the road on the Northern side and by placing large boulders on the bridge itself.  In recent times numerous attempts have been made by the Minister and his precedessor to have this bridge reopened but it appears that the Northern authorities have not agreed to this.  This is a main link road between north Leitrim and west Fermanagh and its closure has caused major social upheaval in the area in the past number of years.  Many people from north and south of the Border in this region have inter-married and the closure of this road forces a 26 mile round trip for those with land on both sides of the Border.</P>
      <P>In view of the potential of Lough Melvin as a tourist attraction and the enormous amenties available in Kiltyclogher and Garrison, I ask the Minister to do his utmost to persuade the Northern authorities to agree to the reopening of Dooard bridge.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Ellis for raising the matter this evening.  I assure him that his comments have been carefully noted and will be taken fully into account in my consideration of this important issue.  As the Deputy may be aware, I received a deputation recently from the SDLP in regard to this bridge.</P>
      <P>I am conscious that the situation in Leitrim is particularly difficult due to the closure of all of the cross-border roads in the county.  I fully appreciate the frustration felt by the local communities on both sides of the Border arising from the situation at Dooard bridge, and the negative social and economic effects, including those on the development of the potentially important tourism sector, which the closure of the crossing has had in the area.  My colleague, Deputy Bree, has raised this matter with me on many occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the importance of this issue, I raised the problem of closed cross-Border roads at the first meeting of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference <Col N="739" /> which I attended on 3 February 1993 and I again discussed the matter with the Secretary of State at yesterday's meeting of the conference in Belfast.  I particularly emphasised the disruption to the economic and social life of the community caused by closed roads and stressed the Government's view that road closures should only be maintained where security considerations clearly outweigh the inconvenience to the local community. It has, of course, to be recognised that the continuing campaign of violence serves only to exacerbate problems in this regard and to impede the prospects for progress.</P>
    <P>Following these discussions it was agreed that both Governments would <Col N="740" /> keep the situation regarding road closures under close review, taking fully into account the wider economic and social effects, as well as the genuine security considerations involved.  In this context, I will continue to press the British authorities to re-examine the situation regarding the closure of the crossing at Dooard bridge.  I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to draw the attention of the British authorities to the particular problems experienced by the local communities affected in Counties Leitrim and Fermanagh and to their views on the closure of the crossing which the Deputy has represented this evening.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 25 March 1993.</P>

      <P>With your permission, Ceann Comhairle, I shall answer Questions Nos. 17, 22, 23, 27, 28, 31, 33, 35, 36, 37, 41, 46, 48, 51, 55, 62, 66, 70 and 71 together.  The partnership programme mangers are entitled to a salary equivalent to that received in their previous employment plus 10 per cent.  This arrangement is subject to the overriding constraint that no programme manager should receive a salary in excess of the maximum of the principal officer higher scale, approximately £40,000.  Appointment to these positions is on the nomination of the Minister in each Department and will cease when the Minister in question ceases to hold office.  The total cost of these arrangements to the Exchequer cannot exceed £600,000 per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The role and function of the new managers is quite distinct from that of departmental secretaries and senior line managers.  Senior civil servants will continue to have responsibility for the development of policy proposals, the overall management of schemes and programmes <Col N="569" /> and have charge of their Departments generally.  The programme managers, on the other hand, have been assigned the specific function of providing administrative support to Ministers in progressing the partnership programme for Government in the next few years.  The posts are designed to assist Ministers in managing and co-ordinating the achievement of the objectives of the Government's programme.  Part of the responsibilities will entail implementing new communications structures to provide access for people to information about Government policy.</P>

      <P>In 1992 expenditure on national lottery funded programmes was £100.149 million.  In the 1993 Abridged Estimates Volume the Government set out lottery allocations of £88 million.  Details of these expenditure proposals can be found under the relevant subheads of each Department's Vote in the Abridged Estimates Volume.  There is also a summary in Appendix I of the Volume setting out all lottery funded programmes.  There will be a small number of adjustments to these figures which will be reflected in the forthcoming Revised Estimates Volume.</P>
      <P>Spending Departments are responsible for the disbursement of their funds.  The sectoral allocation of lottery funds for 1992 and 1993 is as follows:</P>

    <P>The total income from the national lottery for 1992 comprised three elements &mdash; (1) the surplus generated by the National Lottery Company of £82 million, (2) interest earned by the national lottery fund from the Central Bank of £2.7 million and (3) a carryover of £20.4 million.</P>
    <P>Regarding 1993 it is not the practice to release forecast figures for the current year.  It is expected that sufficient funds will be available to meet the requirements for 1993 as set out in the Estimates Volume.</P>

      <P>I welcome this opportunity to correct some of the misconceptions at large in the community about the impact of the national lottery on charitable fundraising.</P>
      <P>A study carried out by economic consultants DKM on behalf of the National Lottery Company and published in April 1992 estimated that the income of charitable bodies rose from £90 million approximately in 1989 to a estimated £129 million in 1991.  In other words the revenue to charities from charitable fundraising had grown substantially in real terms contemporaneously with the growth of the National Lottery.  That survey also suggests that, for most of the leading charities their revenue from private fundraising had considerably outstripped inflation over the lifetime of the national lottery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="572" /> Charities and the voluntary sector generally have been significant beneficiaries by way of lottery-funded grants from the Exchequer.  For instance the health and welfare category of lottery-funded expenditure &mdash; much of which goes to charitable voluntary bodies, including some of the charitable organisations involved in the submission referred to by the Deputy &mdash; accounted for £105 million of lottery expenditure in the period 1987-1992. So, in the overall, charities have been significant beneficiaries from the proceeds of the lottery.</P>
    <P>I will be meeting with representatives of the charities shortly to discuss this matter with them.</P>

      <P>It is not clear from the Deputy's question what type of incentive he has in mind for the River Shannon.  There are already several incentive schemes available for tourism development, for example, the EC Structural Funds, the Business Expansion Scheme, the INTERREG Tourism Sub-Programme and the International Fund for Ireland.</P>
      <P>If, what the Deputy has in mind is the extention of tax incentives to the River Shannon area, I must point out that such a move would be contrary to Government tax reform policy which is aimed at broadening the tax base and reducing the burden of taxation on the lower paid. The introduction of new tax incentives would be inconsistent with this policy objective.</P>

Candidates for the posts are usually selected on the basis of their knowledge and expertise in one or more of the specialist areas of taxation, law and accountancy.  As the Deputy is no doubt aware, an account of the appointment of an Appeal Commissioner and the salary applicable has to be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas within 20 sitting days of such appointment.</P>

They primarily involve adjudication on areas of dispute between the taxpayer or his/her representatives and the Revenue Commissioners.  Such disputes may include highly complex technical arguments on specific points of tax legislation or interpretation.  To ensure that the appeal process is available to all taxpayers, the Appeal Commissioners are required to travel on circuit to locations throughout the country.</P>

      <P>Following the decision by Switzerland not to ratify the European Economic Area Agreement, the European Community and the other EFTA member states have recently concluded a Protocol to be annexed to the Agreement to enable its implementation without Switzerland's participation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will recall that the European Economic Area Agreement included a Financial Mechanism to provide <Col N="576" /> a total of 500 million ECUs in grants and interest subsidies of 3 per cent per annum on foot of loans totalling 1,500 million ECUs in favour of Ireland, Greece, Portugal and Spain, the four least developed member states of the European Community.  The Protocol includes a provision to adjust the Financial Mechanism to take account of the loss of the Swiss contribution.  The adjustment to the Financial Mechanism involves a reduction in the level of interest subsidy, from 3 per cent to 2 per cent on the loan element of the Financial Mechanism.  There is no change in the provisions for grants, or in the total amount of loans to be provided under the mechanism.  The value of the adjustment is approximately 75 million ECUs over five years or just over 10 per cent of the total resources originally envisaged for the Financial Mechanism.</P>
    <P>This adjustment represents a satisfactory compromise from Ireland's point of view, bearing in mind that Switzerland accounts for about 28 per cent of the GDP of the EFTA States concerned.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to identify precisely the impact of the adjustment on Ireland. However, on the basis of Ireland's current share of the EC Structural Funds, Ireland could expect to receive up to 50 million pounds in grants and 150 million pounds in subsidised loans from the Financial Mechanism over the next five years.</P>

      <P>The Office of Public Works has been working on the restoration of Cormac's Chapel at the Rock of Cashel for a number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The work involves conservation of the wall paintings, the cleaning, repairing <Col N="577" /> and conserving of masonry, some replacement of stonework, repairing the arch of the south door, fitting doors and windows, laying a floor to the croft, and the provision of appropriate heating and lighting.  The programme also includes a major archaeological excavation which will be undertaken later this year.</P>
    <P>The timescale for the completion of the works is determined to a great extent by the conservation work on the paintings. Experts engaged by the Office of Public Works have advised that in the interest of protecting the wall paintings, the work should be spread over a long period of years so as to alter the levels on a gradual basis.</P>
    <P>The time taken on any particular part of the paintings depends on the condition of that section, which only emerges as work proceeds.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, the current phase of conservation works at Cormac's Chapel will take at least four years to complete.  When the work has been completed a subsequent monitoring and maintenance programme will be set up.</P>
    <P>Once Cormac's Chapel has been restored, it is proposed to begin a major programme of conservation works to the cathedral, which will take a number of years.  The works here will include masonry and plasterwork conservation, and restoration of the roof of one of the chapels of the north transept to shelter the box tombs.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 85 together.  There are no proposals before Government to cap national lottery prizes.  The Government is anxious to ensure the ongoing viability of the national lottery so as to safeguard this important source of funding for the many socially desirable programmes which are now assisted by the national lottery.</P>
      <P>Occasionally large jackpots are popular with players.  They help to sustain public interest in the lotto and encourage additional players to participate.  They thus help to ensure its ongoing success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To put a cap or ceiling on the size of lotto jackpots would actually run the risk of undermining public interest in participation <Col N="579" /> and could well jeopardise the long term success of the game.

      <P>Substantial work has been done to date in preparing the National Development Plan for the next round of EC Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund.  There have been extensive consultations with interested parties.  I have received submissions from other Ministers, from the social partners at national level, from the seven sub-regional review committees and from a number of other groups.</P>
      <P>The central objective of the plan will be to create sustainable employment and growth and all proposals are being examined carefully in the light of this objective.  The total of demands substantially exceeds the likely allocation of funds to Ireland, and the drafting of the plan involves difficult decisions on the priority areas for investment.  My officials have had detailed discussion with officials of other relevant Departments in order to identify the way in which proposals in the various sectors would best meet our priority objectives.  In addition, consultants were employed to evaluate the operation of the current Community Support Framework (CSF) and make recommendations for the next CSF.</P>
      <P>Discussions are ongoing with the EC Commission on the strategic choices and priorities as perceived by them and on the strengthening of material in relation to evaluation and statistical indicators. Discussions are also ongoing with the Northern Ireland authorities with the objective of having a strong cross-Border element in both the plan for Ireland and the plan for Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Central Review Committee will <Col N="580" /> be consulted before the plan is finalised. The Programme for a Partnership Government provides that the new National Economic and Social Forum will be consulted in the preparation of the plan.</P>
    <P>While no specific deadline for the submission of the plan has been fixed as yet at EC level, I would hope that the plan will be ready for submission to the EC Commission by end May or early June. This should allow sufficient time for negotiation of the Community Support Framework and operational programmes in order that the new programmes will be in place at the start of 1994.</P>

Some are serving civil servants who have been transferred to their present positions while others have come from outside the Civil Service and are being appointed to temporary, unestablished positions in the Civil Service.  As such, they are all bound by the regulations concerning integrity and conflicts of interest which apply in the Civil Service generally, including a requirement to refrain from any outside business or activity which might conflict with their official positions and a requirement to disclose any interest which they may have in any matter connected with their official work.  In addition to these long-standing regulations, the Deputy is no doubt aware of the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government for the introduction of a scheme for the registration of interests of senior civil servants and senior State body executives, the detailed arrangements for which are under consideration at present.</P>

      <P>The increase in VAT on hotel accommodation and other tourism related products which I announced in the budget occurred in the context of a considerable simplification and consolidation of the entire VAT rating structure.  This involved, <i>inter alia,</i> the abolition of the 10 per cent rate and the moving of most of the goods and services, formerly at that rate, to the single reduced rate of 12.5 per cent.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to defer the change until January 1994.  I am aware that in some cases hoteliers and other operators would have entered into contracts at fixed rates for the 1993 season before the budget change was announced.  Accordingly, in order to minimise any disruption to trading interests, the Financial Resolutions passed by the House on budget night provide that the former 10 per cent will continue to apply to such contracts.</P>

      <P>The basic aim of the tax clearance procedures is to ensure that persons or groups benefiting from public contracts, in receipt of significant assistance from public funds, or being issued with State licences which allow them to conduct a business for profit, have discharged their tax liabilities.  They must first produce evidence that their tax affairs are in order.  This evidence normally comes in the form of a tax clearance certificate issued by the Revenue Commissioners. Tax clearance procedures have been in operation for public contracts and grants since June 1986 and March 1988 respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="585" /> In the 1992 budget I announced that the Finance Bill would contain provisions to enable me to extend tax clearance to licences such as those for pubs, dance halls, employment agencies, bookmakers and so on.  It was decided to concentrate initially on liquor licences issued by the Revenue Commissioners.  Accordingly, the Finance Act, 1992 provides for the presentation of a tax clearance certificate before an intoxicating liquor retailer's licence may be granted by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>In this year's budget, I announced that the tax clearance requirements will be extended to those licences issued by Revenue for bookmakers, auctioneers, petrol stations, liquor dealers and gaming operators.</P>
    <P>As these measures indicate, the scope of the tax clearance procedures as a means of ensuring that tax obligations are complied with is kept under active review.  I have no plans to extend tax clearance to public appointments, including those mentioned in the question.</P>

      <P>The only legal basis on which civil servants who resign may subsequently be reinstated to their former positions is contained in section 11 of the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1956 as amended by section 4 of the Civil Service (Employment of Married Women) Act, 1973. These provisions permit the reinstatement of a woman who has resigned from the service for the purpose of, on or following marriage, if she is a widow, if she did not marry or if she establishes to the satisfaction of the Minister for Finance that she is not being supported by her husband.  Accordingly, the law requires that a married applicant establish that she is not being supported by her husband.  I can assure the Deputy that no applicant has been turned down solely because her husband is working or in receipt of unemployment benefit. Where a husband is working, it entirely depends on his income and the general family circumstances.  Nor is an applicant automatically refused because her husband is unemployed and in receipt of social welfare payments as there may be special circumstances which would permit her reinstatement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to take Questions Nos. 69, 87 and 95 together.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the latest published figures were included in the 1991 annual report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts and showed the position regarding uncollected taxes at 31 May 1992 and the amount written off during the year 1991.</P>
      <P>The report showed a total of £2,538 million in outstanding taxes, of which £418 million was shown as likely to be collected and a total of £85.8 million written off in the year.</P>
      <P>I must emphasise that the Comptroller and Auditor General points out in his report that the Revenue Commissioners estimate that only £418 million of the £2,538 million is likely to be collected. The reason for the difference is that the figure of £2,538 million consists largely of estimates, which were made by tax inspectors in the absence of returns from taxpayers.  It also includes a sum in the region of £425 million relating to cases in liquidation or receivership, only about 10 per cent of which is likely to result in payments.  Therefore, to quote a figure of £2,538 million without putting that figure into its proper context gives a misleading impression.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has taken unprecedented action in the last few years to improve the administration of the taxation system.  Among the initiatives taken were: the amnesty in 1988, which raised £500 million; amnesties have also been introduced for capital acquisition tax and <Col N="589" /> stamp duty; the progressive development of the self-assessment system and accompanying audit programme for personal and company taxation, and also for capital acquisition tax; the introduction and extension of the withholding tax on professional fees; the extension of the construction industry tax deduction scheme to other sectors; the introduction of tax clearance requirements for public contracts, grants and certain licences issued by the Revenue Commissioners; the introduction of a new system of tax enforcement by sheriffs; the introduction of power to attach the assets of tax defaulters; the introduction of new general anti-avoidance provisions and the strengthening of the Revenue's powers to counter evasion and avoidance; and the collection initiatives by Revenue in 1991 and 1992, which facilitated, among other things, the rapid pursuit of interest due on late payments, the release of experienced staff for an increase in audits and an increase of staff numbers engaged in the collection of arrears.</P>
    <P>As to results, some of those measures have already contributed to better collection and enforcement of tax obligations as evidenced by the ongoing reduction in outstanding amounts shown in the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General for the past six years. The amount outstanding as of 31 May 1992 was some £1,634 million less than at 31 May 1987.</P>
    <P>An overall reduction of £180 million in the amount outstanding is noted for the most recent 12 month period reviewed by the Comptroller and Auditor General. It is also noted that this reduction occurred in a period during which over £7,300 million in additional charges fell due for collection.  In addition, the Revenue Commissioners have succeeded in collecting £255 million of entrenched pre-amnesty arrears since 1989.  This achievement is quite impressive when viewed against the figure of £418 million.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that personnel who have been employed by State and semi-State agencies and who availed of voluntary early retirement schemes, lump sums and enhanced pensions have been subsequently employed on a contract basis mainly by State and semi-State agencies; his views on this practice; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Specific provisions were included in the public sector early retirement schemes to cater for cases in which voluntary retirees subsequently obtain pensionable employment with the same organisation, or in the same area of the public sector. Under these provisions, any pension benefits in payment would immediately cease on re-employment, and any lump sum benefits received on foot of early retirement would be taken into account in determining the person's ultimate retirement benefits.</P>
      <P>The principle underlying these provisions is that a person who is awarded an early retirement pension should not, if re-engaged by his or her former employer or a closely associated employer, be allowed to draw both salary and pension at the same time.  In my direct area of responsibility, i.e. the Civil Service, I would not be prepared to sanction any arrangements which undermine this general principle.  If the Deputy has specific information on such arrangements in any other area of the public sector, I will, on receipt of that information, arrange for the matter to be investigated by the relevant Government Departments.</P>

      <P>The Deputy in his question refers to the submission on the next National Development Plan made by the Dublin sub-regional review committee in response to my invitation last year to all the sub-regional review committees to make submissions on the content and strategy of the National Development Plan which will form the basis for negotiations with the EC Commission on the Community Support Framework for the Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund from 1994 on.  I am very happy to have received detailed submissions from all the committees and these are being examined carefully both by my myself and by other Ministers and our officials as part of the process of preparing the National Development Plan.</P>
      <P>All operational programmes under the present community support framework are national sectoral programmes rather than regional programmes.  This is considered the most efficient and effective way of giving effect to the development measures provided for in the Community support framework having regard to our administrative and governmental arrangements.</P>
      <P>While there is no specific operational programme under the current community support framework directed solely at cities many of the programmes meet specific investment needs in relation to the urban environment, in water and sanitary services, transport, urban tourism and heritage, education and training and industrial development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is too early to give any indications on the content of the next National Development Plan and the structure of the next Community support framework and operational programmes.  The proposals made by Ministers, by the sub-regional committees, by the social partners, and by other groups would require substantially more Structural and Cohesion Funds assistance than is likely to be available to Ireland.  Difficult choices will have to be made by Government <Col N="593" /> in prioritising those proposals which best meet the priority objectives of creating sustainable employment and growth.  However, I can assure the Deputy that we will give careful examination to how the plan will address the needs of Dublin and of disadvantaged inner city areas.</P>

      <P>A major part of the work of Irish embassies is to advance <Col N="595" /> Ireland's economic interests abroad both at the Inter-State level and in support of Irish semi-State agencies and of Irish firms doing business abroad.  In particular, our embassies attach a very high priority to the promotion of all aspects of foreign earnings including exports, tourism and attraction of inward investment to Ireland.</P>
      <P>The precise nature of an embassy's role in these matters will depend on the nature and circumstances of the country in which it is located.  For example, in the developed market economies of the OECD, Irish business interests and Irish exporters find it relatively easy to gain access and need not rely on the embassy for this.  In many of these countries, too, there are local offices of Irish semi-State commercial and promotional agencies such as the Irish Trade Board, Bord Fáilte and the IDA.  In such cases the marketing and promotional work is generally done by the relevant semi-State agency.  The embassy will work in close co-operation with those agencies, and at their request, to achieve maximum impact in the promotion of Ireland's economic interests.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, in certain other countries where we have embassies there may be much greater Government direction of the economy and market forces may play a lesser role.  Furthermore, there may be no local office of any of the Irish semi-State promotional agencies and our embassy may well be the only agency of the Irish Government with a local presence in the country concerned. In such cases the role of the embassy will be much more in the area of practical and direct support for Irish business people seeking to develop the particular market in question.  This support may include contact on behalf of exporters with key governmental decision makers and officials, help in obtaining visas and arranging business itineraries, help in resolving payment disputes and liaison with local agents and customs officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More generally, our embassies lobby actively at both governmental and official level where this can be helpful to our <Col N="596" /> economic interests; and they help to resolve potential commercial problems which require intergovernmental contact and negotiation.  They also monitor economic and financial developments in the countries to which they are accredited &mdash; such as, for example, new legislation and regulations in areas such as taxation and animal health &mdash; and report regularly on such developments for the information of Government Departments and agencies whose work may be affected by such developments.</P>

      <P>Whenever possible in all of my contacts with other Foreign Ministers, businessmen and economic operators it is my normal practice to avail of every opportunity both to promote Ireland as an attractive location for investment from abroad and to resolve any difficulties which may arise for investors. Naturally all of our embassies also work in close co-operation with the IDA in the promotion of Ireland as an investment base.</P>
      <P>In all discussions at international and EC level which might have implications for the attractiveness of Ireland as an investment base within the EC, I take whatever action is necessary to protect our interests as a matter of course.</P>

      <P>It is not clear what report the Deputy is <Col N="598" /> referring to.  In referring to the lateral movement of companies into the centre, however, I assume he is referring to displacement of business which would otherwise take place in Ireland and be subject to tax at the standard 40 per cent rate rather than the 10 per cent rate.</P>
      <P>The vast bulk of business carried on by IFSC companies is business which would not otherwise be conducted in Ireland and the level of displacement is not therefore great.  Care is taken in assessing every new project at the centre to ensure that substantial new activity is being proposed and that any existing international financial business of the promoter represents only a minor element of the proposed IFSC operation.  The result is a net gain to Ireland.  The question of tax loss to the Irish Exchequer does not arise. In 1992 the corporation tax receipts from IFSC companies amounted to £77 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 24 May 1991 the Government announced that I had decided to introduce legislation to change and update the regulation and supervision of stockbrokers and the Irish Stock Exchange. This legislation is intended to replace existing legislation dating, in the main, from 1799 which is inadequate for supervisory purposes.</P>
      <P>It was necessary to update the supervisory arrangements for stockbrokers and the Irish Stock Exchange if the terms of the Investment Services Directive were to be observed.  This Directive has been in discussion for a number of years but it is likely to be finally adopted during the first half of this year and legislative measures to transpose the Directive must be in place by 1 July 1995.</P>
      <P>The Government decided that the Central Bank of Ireland should be appointed the competent authority in respect of stockbrokers and the Irish Stock Exchange.</P>
      <P>As I told the Stock Exchange Conference on the new regulatory environment which was held on March 10th for quoted companies and investors, I hope to be able to introduce legislation to give effect to this decision by the summer.</P>
      <P>The Irish Stock Exchange and the UK regional exchanges merged, in 1973, with the London Stock Exchange, to form what later became the International Stock Exchange of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland Ltd.  It is likely that this entity will divide into Irish and UK Exchanges, probably in 1994. Even after such a division, substantial commerical links will continue between the Irish and London exchanges, on terms currently being discussed by the exchange authorities.</P>
      <P>It is desirable that the new legislative arrangements for supervision be in place before the two organisations adopt separate legal structures.</P>

      <P>The present pay levels of the Civil Service grades referred to in the Deputy's question have been determined by reference to the outcome of independent reviews or arbitration, the main factor being the pay of comparable groups in other employments.  Discussions have been held, under the local bargaining clause of the Pay Agreement which forms part of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> with Civil Service unions, including the union representing clerical grades, on the pay and structure of Civil Service grades.  The operation of the local bargaining clause in the public service is among the items being discussed with representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions as a result of the invitation in my budget statement.  It would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this stage.</P>
      <P>I would make two additional points. Firstly, I would remind the Deputy of the extent to which special provision has been made in recent years for those on lower rates of pay, through the application of minimum increases under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and <i>Programme for Economic</i> and <i>Social</i><i>Progress</i> pay agreements.  Secondly, it must be borne in mind that the date from which the comparison is made can have a significant effect on the outcome of any comparison of the pay movements of various groups.</P>

      <P>The funding arrangements for ICAROM plc. &mdash; formally Insurance Company of Ireland &mdash; are set out in two agreements, <Col N="604" /> details of which have been made public in 1985 and 1992.</P>
      <P>Under the 1985 agreement the Minister for Finance advanced £100 million to the Administrator of ICI for a period of 15 years.  This advance was provided by way of a loan to the Minister by the Central Bank and was funded in turn by a special deposit of £70 million placed by AIB with the Central Bank, and £30 million of the Central Bank's own resources.  The interest rate on the total amount is subsidised by AIB and the other banks to the amount of £7 million per annum.  AIB pays £5.5 million of this annual subsidy.</P>
      <P>Under the 1992 agreement, AIB agreed to share the remaining liability of £267 million.  They are to pay a sum of £8.8 million per annum to the Administrator over 20 years.  As part of this agreement the Exchequer is to provide the Administrator with an interest free loan of £32 million in the course of 1993.  This loan is for 20 years, repayable in 2012 and is to be funded by the Central Bank.</P>
      <P>No money has been paid from public funds to date.  As earlier indicated the Minister for Finance has advanced a sum of £100 million in the manner described and a further, interest free, loan of £32 million to be made this year.</P>

      <P>Under the provisions of the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme a weekly supplement can be paid towards rent and mortgage interest payments. <Col N="605" /> Such supplements may be paid where the rent or mortgage interest exceeds £5 per week.  The amount of supplement is determined by the Health Board having regard to the circumstances of the case. The maximum supplement is the amount which, after payment of rent or mortgage interest, would leave the recipient with an income equal to the rate of Supplementary Welfare Allowance appropriate to his family in size, less £5.</P>
      <P>It is understood from the Eastern Health Board, which is responsible for the administration of the scheme in the Dublin area, that the people concerned were refused a mortgage supplement as their combined income, after payment of mortgage interest, exceeds the appropriate level.</P>
      <P>The total income of the household at present is £158.10.  If the wife were to cease her involvement in the Social Employment Scheme and revert to Unemployment Assistance the household income would be £117.40.  In that event the household would qualify for a mortgage supplement under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme.</P>

      <P>My Department's Health Services Personnel Census indicates that there were 3,248 persons employed at the end of December, 1991 in a job-sharing capacity in the health services.  A measure of the success of the job-sharing scheme, which was introduced in 1985, is the fact that there were a thousand more persons employed in a job-sharing capacity at the end of 1991 than at the end of 1989.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Job sharing allows for flexibility in working arrangements for both employees and employers.  The scheme, <Col N="614" /> however, necessarily provides that the granting of job sharing arrangements is a matter for the employing health agency concerned and is subject to the exigencies of the service.</P>

The centres and services are run by statutory and non-statutory organisations and provide a wide range of services, including in-patient, out-patient, after-care, counselling, self-help, advice and information.  The addictions dealt with include alcohol, drugs, smoking, eating disorders and gambling and the centres cater for both adults and adolescents. I have sent details of the centres to the Deputy but due to the very large number of centres involved, I regret that I do not have the attendance and age-profile information sought by him.  In this regard, I have also sent him a copy of a recent study by the Health Research Board regarding Treated Drug Misuse in the greater Dublin area which shows, <i>inter alia,</i> 95 per cent of persons who attended for treatment for drug misuse were aged between 15 and 39 years old and the mean age for treatment was 25 years.</P>
