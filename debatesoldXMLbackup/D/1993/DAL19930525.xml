      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to an invitation from the Federal Chancellor, Dr. Franz Vranitzky, I paid an official visit to the Austrian capital, Vienna, on Thursday, 13 May 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My programme included a private meeting with the Chancellor; a plenary meeting for official discussions between the Irish and Austrian delegations; a visit to Vienna City Hall, where I was received by the Mayor and Governor, Dr. Helmut Zilk; a visit to the Austrian Parliament where I was received by Dr. Robert Lichal, the second President of the Nationalrat (Lower House) and had discussions with a representative cross-party group of parliamentarians; and attendance at a reception for the Irish community <Col N="510" /> in Austria hosted by our Ambassador.  I also met, in the course of the day, the Vice-Chancellor, Dr. Erhard Busek, the Minister for Finance, Dr. Ferdinand Lacina, and the President of the Bundesrat, the Upper House of Parliament, Dr. Erik Holzinger.</P>
    <P>The visit was the first official visit to Austria by an Irish Head of Government. I am happy to take this opportunity to say how much I appreciated the warmth of the reception by Chancellor Vranitzky and by all I met in Vienna.</P>
    <P>The discussions covered the continuing negotiations on Austria's application to join the European Union; the prospects for ratification of the Treaty on European Union; the Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations; action to stimulate the European and international economies; the situation in Bosnia-Hercegovina, in the former Yugoslavia and in the Balkans generally; the summit meeting of the Council of Europe in Vienna on 8-9 October next; the position of Vienna as a European centre of United Nations activities; Northern Ireland; and cultural links between Ireland and Austria.</P>
    <P>In the course of the discussions in Vienna and in my public remarks at the luncheon, I recalled that successive Irish Governments have wholeheartedly supported the accession of Austria and believe strongly that an enlarged Community containing Austria is a prospect which carries obvious benefits not only for Austria but also for the present member states.  I said that in Ireland we look forward to having Austria as a partner, noted that we share many values in common and have a similar outlook on a range of international issues and affirmed that we value the prospect of working much more closely with Austria in the years ahead.  I have had the text of my remarks at the luncheon placed in the library.</P>
    <P>In regard to the current accession negotiations and to future co-operation within the European Union, the Chancellor and I agreed that there should be follow-up inter-departmental contacts between our administrations, similar to official level discussions that have already <Col N="511" /> taken place with Sweden and Finland earlier this year and recent ministerial discussions with Norway.</P>
    <P>On the issue of cultural links between Ireland and Austria, I indicated my support for a proposal of the recently appointed Austrian Ambassador to Ireland, Dr Michael Breisky, for an exhibition to celebrate the role of the Irish Wild Geese in the Austrian Empire.</P>

      <P>Clearly the Taoiseach had a very busy day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can say that again though I might add that for me every day is busy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach discuss the effects that Austrian membership of the European Community would have on agricultural supports?  I assume that Austria will have some claim on such supports when they join.  In relation to neutrality, what indication did the Taoiseach receive from Austria with regard to their attitude to the developing common security policy in Europe?  Did they feel that that would impinge on their form of neutrality?  Will the Taoiseach indicate what kind of co-operation he foresees Irish business and Austrian business undertaking in Eastern Europe, which I understand was also referred to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the questions in the reverse order.  In relation to the possibilities for joint ventures between Austrian and Irish companies, it is true that Austria will have a better knowledge on the ground and Ireland would be ideal partners with them for a whole range of opportunities in central and eastern European countries in relation to training, technical assistance and so on.  On the common security policy and the Austrian policy of neutrality, like the other EFTA countries Austria has declared that it can accept the Maastricht Treaty including the provision on a common foreign and security policy.  Like Ireland they recognise the dynamic character of the common foreign and security policy. <Col N="512" /> They are aware that the treaty involves a commitment to the eventual development of a common defence policy but that this issue does not arise until the inter-Governmental conference of 1996.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Taoiseach is aware that there are approximately 100,000 Bosnian refugees living in Austria. Did the Taoiseach get any view from the Chancellor as to the likelihood of circumstances arising in which these people might be able to return home as they wish?  Was any positive line of action agreed between the Taoiseach and the Chancellor on that matter?  Was there any support from the Austrian Chancellor for the proposal by the French Prime Minister for an all-European Conference on security?  What was the content of the discussion the Taoiseach had with regard to the Council of Europe Summit in October?  What does the Taoiseach and the Chancellor expect to emerge from that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The next question deals with that aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not speculate on what may come out of the Council of Europe in October.  It is an opportunity for a Summit for all the member states who are members of the Council of Europe.  We will be represented at the summit.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Bosnian refugees, the Chancellor confirmed that the refugees in Austria intend to return to their homeland at the earliest possible opportunity. Like everybody else, he is concerned at the lack of progress in reaching a settlement. They have their own views on what this might entail, for example, safe areas or havens.  This is in line with our own view.  Deputy De Rossa asked what is their view on the Common Agricultural Policy and other matters.  All the applicant countries, including Austria, will be net contributors.  This should be welcomed by us, given that we are net beneficiaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>While I take the <Col N="513" /> Taoiseach's point that all of the applicant countries, including Austria, would be net contributors, the Common Agricultural Policy budget is not to be increased.  Indeed, attempts are to be made to transfer some of this funding to other areas.  In view of this, does the Taoiseach not see that there will be pressure on Common Agricultural Policy funding when Austria joins the Community, given that it will have some claim on this fund?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>When Austria becomes a full member, like every other member, it will benefit under the various policies. I strees to the Deputy and to the House that our position has always been that there must be increased resources following enlargement.</P>

      <asker>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>the matters he intends to raise or propose at the Summit of EC Leaders in Copenhagen in June 1993; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the member state currently holding the EC Presidency, it is for Denmark in the first instance to propose the matters for discussion at the European Council on 21-22 June and the Danish Presidency has not yet finalised its proposals.</P>
      <P>When I met Prime Minister Rasmussen earlier this year I proposed to him that the issue of co-ordinated action to create more jobs and deal with unemployment &mdash;both at EC level and at the multilateral level between the Community and the other world trade blocs &mdash; should be on the agenda for the Copenhagen Summit. I am satisfied this will be the case.  For my part I will be doing everything I can to ensure that practical action to create much needed employment receives the fullest possible consideration in Copenhagen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach anticipated my interest in the jobs issue.  I am glad to note that the general question of <Col N="514" /> co-ordinated action to create jobs will probably be on the agenda.  Would the Taoiseach add to what he has said and let us know whether he intends to make any specific proposals on the co-ordinated action which could bring benefits to the Community and Ireland in particular which might be discussed at the summit? The second matter on which I would like to see the Taoiseach express a strong view is the question of Bosnia.  Would he accept that the inadequate response of the Community to the horrors of Bosnia needs to be discussed?  I suggest that the Taoiseach should make his views known on that issue and try to ensure that it is fully discussed at the summit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I can readily accept what the Deputy has said in relation to the Bosnian conflict.  Undoubtedly, this matter will be discussed at the summit. On the question of employment and providing a stimulus to generate economic activity I have been to the forefront in raising this issue with the other member states.  I raised it at Birmingham and again at Edinburgh, from which meeting a growth initiative emanated.  This has been discussed at a number of meetings of the economic and Finance Ministers since then.  As I am sure the Deputy is aware, the Presidency is doing all it can at the multilateral level to get the United States and Japan involved in an effort to provide a world economic stimulus to generate economic activity.  The way to create jobs is to secure growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that all this talk about jobs at EC summits has so far amounted to absolutely nothing, that there is nothing to show for it?  Would he also agree that the more European summits are seen to talk about jobs and do nothing the more the institution will be brought into disrepute? Would he agree that in Copenhagen we should see some evidence of action because so far all we have seen is a gradual diminution of confidence in economic prospects throughout the Continent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy <Col N="515" /> when he says that the question of employment was off the agenda for far too long and that it has now reached serious proportions. The Irish Commissioner is working on an employment policy to tackle this problem, given that 18 million people are unemployed in Europe.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We should leave that problem to the European Community. We have no need to concern ourselves with that issue.  President Delors is trying to co-ordinate the response to the jobs crisis, which is getting worse.  The unemployment rate in Spain, at 21.7 per cent, is greater than here.  I look forward to the summit in Copenhagen and hope that the Community will pursue policies to tackle this serious problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of his declared anxiety and hope that the summit will deal effectively with this issue does the Taoiseach intend to present any proposals to the summit?  Will he agree that a debate should be held in the Dail on this matter before the summit takes place in order to strengthen his hand? Does he intend to raise the question of the ERM given that the Minister for Finance failed in his efforts last weekend to have amendments made to the system? Will he agree that the criteria for European Monetary Union are driving all the economies of the European Community into recession and that none of them meets the criteria or is likely to meet them?  There is an urgent need to address that issue at the summit.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should get his facts right before he starts to misrepresent the position.  I am aware that the Belgian Foreign Minister and others have floated the idea that the criteria should be softened but I do not think there would be anything to be gained in doing that.  We have taken action and complied with the criteria and look to others to do likewise.  This may be an issue at the summit but I am not in a position to say so as I do not write the agenda.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has given a very impressive account of the breadth and range of his involvement in these issues.  Could he indicate what the summit might constitute as a &ldquo;world economic stimulus&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to think that the parties to the GATT negotiations will get their act together.  Now that the international financial markets have settled down the completion of the ratification process of the Maastricht Treaty would be another positive move.  If they follow a growth policy to provide a stimulus to generate economic growth, Governments can secure growth in the world economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>While Deputy Dukes's question anticipated mine, would the Taoiseach not agree that a resolute, united Community approach at the summit towards a resolution of the GATT talks would be the greatest single direct incentive to liberalising world trade, raising employment and freeing trade worldwide?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly I would agree and I made that point very strongly to President Clinton in March.  Indeed the Danish Presidency are pursuing that goal.  The greatest stimulus to the development of world trade would be an agreement on GATT.  We have vested interests in relation to it.  The talks were held back because of the French elections. There is a new French Government in place for a specific period of time. Let us hope that everybody will seriously address the matter of endeavouring to find a resolution of the GATT problems.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that there has been no substantial content to any of the initiatives taken by the Community in regard to employment emerging from the Birmingham and Edinburgh Summits, that there has been a lot of talk but nothing concrete?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not totally happy with the initiatives taken so far.  We want to strive to get more and more initiatives. For example, there was the growth initiative devised by the Finance Ministers at Edinburgh which has since been approved by the various member states. Quite clearly it is not enough; the more we want it resolved the more we will keep at it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to his comments on paid employment, would the Taoiseach, when he meets other Leaders in Copenhagen, say whether he would consider the highly developed renewable energy sector in Denmark with a view to introducing some of their schemes here since we have many under-utilised assets in that area, particularly in wave and wind power?  Following his statement on <Col N="518" /> the need for growth, would he agree that quite often growth can result in jobs being lost in that it leads to automation and rationalisation?  In that regard would he agree that perhaps some discussion on a redistribution of work would be a lot more productive in ensuring more people are employed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy is referring to the concept of job sharing and the like, certainly I agree with him.  I also agree with him in relation to the possibility of jobs emanating from renewable energy sources.  It is true that Denmark has been quite successful in the development of wind energy.  It is very difficult to understand why we have not been equally successful.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We know there is plenty of puffing of wind in this Chamber; we want to get more of it outside the Chamber.  In relation to what the Deputy asked, he can take it that this Government is totally committed to that objective, as reflected in our programme for Government.  We shall pursue all possibilities in relation to renewable energy and the contribution it can make to jobs and to low cost energy here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not accept that it is a fair criticism that he appears to be adopting an entirely passive role in relation to the crucial issue of jobs and a Community response thereto?  Would he accept that that is entirely inappropriate on the part of a Leader of a country competing for the top position in the unemployment league?  Will he tell us whether he will table even one specific proposal, or take any initiative whatever, on behalf of Ireland by way of trying to get a Community response to that appalling problem of unemployment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear what the Community asked everybody to do following the Edinburgh Summit, which was to avail of every possible opportunity <Col N="519" /> within their overall budgetary positions in relation to large investment, to promote more growth within the Community itself.  It is not true that I am adopting a passive approach to jobs or unemployment. I was the first Head of Government to raise the issue within the Community at the Birmingham Summit. After some time at Birmingham I eventually got it onto the agenda&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputies opposite did not do very much themselves.  Deputy Jim O'Keeffe can be assured that I followed it up at Edinburgh, when a growth initiative was taken.  It is not as great as we would like it to be but it is a contribution, and we are continuing to fight for that at every possible opportunity. When we have our national plan developed in relation to the usage of the Structural and Cohesion Funds, that will provide us with a further opportunity of creating jobs within this economy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 3, 4, 5, and 6 together.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Attorney General that immediately upon his being made aware on 7 May last, by the solicitor to the Beef Tribunal on behalf of the Chairman of the tribunal, that copies of certain papers, which had been made available to the tribunal by the then Department of Industry and Commerce, had come into the possession of persons not parties to the inquiry, he inquired into the matter.  The correspondence on the matter was initated on behalf of the Chairman on a private and confidential basis and was responded to by the Attorney General on the same basis.</P>
      <P>In the course of the Attorney General's inquiry, he directed the solicitor instructing the State's legal team, who is a member of his staff, to make certain inquiries on his behalf.</P>
      <P>The Attorney General informs me that it has not proved possible to ascertain the circumstances in which the papers came into the possession of the newspaper referred to.  I regret that this is so because I deplore the disclosure of official documents through any channels other than authorised ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In case there is any misunderstanding about the nature of these documents, I wish to make it clear to the House and to the public that, on the advice of the State's legal team, they had been cleared by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce to the tribunal for release by <Col N="521" /> it to all the parties to the inquiry should the tribunal see fit.</P>
    <P>The unauthorised publication, although very regrettable, did not prejudice any interest of the State.  Were the State to seek to prevent publication of the documents it would have had to show that its interest would be prejudiced by such publication.  This it could not do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that, on the face of it, these documents come within the rubric of the Official Secrets Act, that their disclosure by any newspaper would itself be an offence and contrary to our laws; likewise that the Attorney General, as soon as he was appraised of the position, had a duty to act to prevent their further circulation? Would he also indicate at what time the Attorney General notified him that these documents had got into the public domain and why, on the Friday of the week prior to their publication, the Taoiseach said that he had no evidence that they had been leaked, if the Attorney General had been appraised of that position some considerable number of days earlier?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must not have listened very attentively to my response when I said that this matter was initiated by the solicitor on behalf of the Chairman of the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Beef Processing Industry, who initiated the correspondence with the Attorney General on a private and confidential basis.  Consequently, the matter was treated as such by the Attorney General. He initiated his inquiries and responded to the solicitor on behalf of the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Beef Processing Industry in that particular vein.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The answer to the two first supplementary questions posed by Deputy Michael McDowell in relation to the Official Secrets Act is that of course it is contrary to the provisions of the Official Secrets Act.  The answer to this last question is that the Attorney General did not inform me but was quite entitled to take the view that the appropriate action for <Col N="522" /> him was to deal with this matter on a private and confidential basis with the tribunal.  It was only on Sunday evening, 16 May, when the matter had become public that the Attorney General informed me of the inquiry that was taking place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach indicate what kind of inquiry the Attorney General could have embarked on if he did not go to all the people at both political and legal level who had access to these documents to inquire of them whether they knew anything about the leak?  What kind of inquiry could it be if the Taoiseach himself was not asked whether he or anybody under his control had authorised their disclosure to the <i>Sunday Tribune</i>?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy did suggest that.  Would the Deputy please listen to my answer?  I have not seen these documents; I have not read these documents.  The Attorney General carried out his investigation by using the offices of the Chief State Solicitor in relation to part of his inquiries and dealt in the appropriate manner in relation to the others.  No matter what view the Deputy wants to take, it is a matter for the Attorney General to carry out his investigations.  If the Deputy is concerned about whether I had any access to, or read these documents, I can say I certainly did not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Hyland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 9 together.  It is not possible at this early stage to give details of the number of area aid applications received by my Department by Saturday 15 May 1993, or the number of farmers who submitted late applications.  Applications in respect of land which was tilled at anytime since 1 January 1987 can be accepted up to 3 June 1993.  However, in these cases aid will be reduced by 1 per cent for each working day that the application is late.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is it possible for sources outside the Department to say that some 2,000 applications that should have been submitted to the Department by Saturday last have not been returned? Will the Minister indicate the penalty that will apply to a farmer who submits his application by 3 June 1993?  Will a 1 per cent reduction apply for ever day from 15 May to 3 June, a total of 20 days, where a penalty of 1 per cent per day will result in a 20 per cent reduction in aid? Will the Minister apply that level of penalty?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I would have to be accurate in giving information to the House.  The reason the figure is not available is that the applications were handed in at all district veterinary offices throughout the country and they then have to be collated and filed before a final figure can be forwarded to the Department. It is not possible, therefore, to give accurate information.  Like Deputy Dukes I have seen figures on the possible number of late applications but I am not in a position to confirm that except to say that late applications will be dealt with on the basis of the details in my reply. The penalty for each working day the <Col N="526" /> application is late of 1 per cent was announced when the scheme was introduced and that is the position at present. However, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Walsh, is attending a meeting of the Council of Ministers today and certain operational matters arising from our experince with this scheme will be discussed with a view to streamlining it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give some indication of the number of completed applications received?  Is this figure in the region of 95-98 per cent? The Minister should be in a position to give a reasonable indication in percentage terms of the number of applications received.  Is the Minister of State stating categorically that the penalty of 1 per cent for each working day will apply &mdash; even though the Minister is in Brussels discussing the operational matters relating to the implementation of this scheme? This penalty will be very harsh on people who, for whatever reason, have been unable to submit their application forms on time.  The Minister would be in a position to decide the penalties if he knew the number of late applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am extremely anxious to be helpful to the Deputies on the far side of the House.  As I indicated already we are not in a position to establish clearly the number of late applications. However a sizeable number of applications were received in the qualifying period.  We do not anticipate a large number of late applications but I do not wish Members to read too much into that statement.  We are anxious to ascertain the number of late applications and then we will look at the situation in relation to them.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that 30,000 farmers could have applied in the tillage sector. It is not possible to put an exact number on those who could apply in the livestock sector because livestock farmers could have a certain percentage of their land in tillage and would be eligible in that sector.  I regret I cannot answer the questions on the exact numbers involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>On the basis of unpublished farm income data available from the 1991 Teagasc national farm survey, the percentage contribution of livestock headage payments, including sheep headage payments and ewe premia, in disadvantaged areas to family income in 1991 in the &ldquo;Teagasc West Region&rdquo;, which largely corresponds to the disadvantaged areas, was 40 per cent.  Comparable data for 1977 are not available. However, on the basis of tentative estimates based on departmental data and average farm income levels for 1977 derived from the Teagasc farm management survey, livestock headage payments contributed approximately 10 per cent to family farm income in 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a hitherto unpublished NESC report indicates that livestock premia and compensation payments account for 50 per cent of farm family income on cattle farms and for up to 85 per cent of family income on farms in the west?  Is the Minister aware that there are some 80,000 low income farms where there is no off farm income?  Will the Minister agree, in the <Col N="529" /> light of that and the information he has just given, that any limitation on headage payments, by reference to any other source of income, would constitute a major blow and threat to the income of these low income farmers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the views expressed by Deputy Dukes that an increasing level of farm income and farm profitability is now coming in direct income support from the European Community. Therefore, any minimising of the benefits from Community income support would obviously have serious consequences for individual farmers and families.  It would also have a very serious effect in terms of employment in rural areas.  We talk a lot about generating new employment but it is equally important to protect existing employment.  Farmers and farm families in rural areas are part of our overall national labour force and, therefore, their income must be protected.</P>

      <P>There are three Labour Court recommendations involved: payment of an allowance to two heads of centre; payment of an increased allowance to 29 heads of research departments and negotiation between Teagasc and unions to agree on appropriate number of promotions for the research staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These Labour Court recommendations can be implemented only with my consent and that of the Minister for Finance and would fall to be considered under the local bargaining clause of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  Discussions on the application of this clause and other issues related to the pay agreement are at present taking place between the Government and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in the context of the <Col N="531" /> statement on public service pay made by the Minister for Finance in his budget speech of 24 February 1993.  Pending the outcome of these discussions it is not possible to progress these matters further. The unions concerned with the Teagasc claim are parties to the terms of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> agreement as are all public service employees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 170 together.</P>
      <P>The set-aside element of Common Agricultural Policy Reform must be viewed in the context of the problem of increasing market imbalances between supply and demand which had developed in the cereals sector.</P>
      <P>The disposal of surplus stocks was placing an intolerable burden on the Community budget and threatened the future of the Common Agricultural Policy and farming.  Community intervention stocks of cereals stand at a record 32 million tonnes.</P>
      <P>Some corrective action was inevitable and the alternative to the measures agreed would have resulted in a sharp reduction in farm incomes without compensation. The impact which this would have on the rural community is obvious</P>
      <P>The use of land set aside as an effective means of curtailing production was unanimously agreed as part of the Common Agricultural Policy reform by all member states of the Community.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the concerns expressed by farmers and environmentalists about the effects of set-aside on the countryside. For this reason my Department has laid down management rules for set-aside land with a view to maintaining the land in good agricultural condition while at the same time respecting the environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the near future the Council of Agriculture Ministers will discuss an EC Commission reflection paper on possible developments in arable land set-aside. Among the proposals to be discussed is the possiblity of non-rotational set-aside as well as a 20 year set-aside scheme <Col N="534" /> which is aimed specifically at improving the rural environment.  These measures would have beneficial consequences for the environment.  I am of course, fully prepared to consider the views of interested groups in this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that the damage being done to the environment and the death of small birds will help Common Agricultural Policy reform is poor consolation to those concerned about wildlife.  Is the Minister aware that the EC regulations regarding set-aside land for tillage farmers has been described already by the Irish Wild Birds Conservancy as an environmental nightmare? Is the Minister going to deal with the regulations that are now in place which are creating environmental damage?  Farmers governed by the regulations have to mow, harrow or spray their set-aside land with paraquat or gramoxone. There is probably quite a number of farmers who do not like to be put in this position for a number of reasons, but I am concentrating on the environmental question at the moment. Is the Minister aware that this may be actually contravening the Wildlife Act? Although I appreciate that there will be deliberations on this whole issue, which is very commendable, what does the Minister intend to do to reverse those regulations that are damaging the environment? We are already too late for this spring but we have to get the matter sorted out before the cycle comes around again and the same sort of damage recurs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole concept of set-aside is alien to the ethos and the professionalism of farming.  There is no farmer in this country who voluntarily wants to be involved in set-aside.  The reality is that set-aside is part of the agreed reform of the common agricultural policy.  In the negotiations the Minister endeavoured to minimise the effects of set-aside on Irish agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share the Deputy's concern about the environment and about wildlife in particular.  So also do the farmers.  Certain <Col N="535" /> guidelines have been laid down in relation to the management of set-aside land, for example, provision of a green cover consisting either of a mixture of grasses or spontaneous growth, cutting of the green cover once before mid-May and once from mid-June onwards etc. There are also regulations in relation to the use of herbicides and sprays to which the Deputy has referred.  In addition to all of that, under the broader environmental agricultural measures we are negotiating post 1993 a scheme which will encourage farmers to farm in an environmentally friendly way and they will be compensated for so doing.</P>
    <P>We are endeavouring, to the best of our ability, to minimise the effects of the policy of set-aside in relation to agriculture, the environment and particularly wildlife that the Deputy is so rightly concerned about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>In the meantime what will happen if a farmer is found to be in breach of the Wildlife Act because he is complying with EC regulations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the question arises.  Farmers will be complying with the set-aside aspect of the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and they will be dealing with the set-aside land on the basis of the guidelines laid down by the Department which will not be in conflict with any of the regulations to which the Deputy has referred.</P>

    <P>The gross cost to the Exchequer in 1991 in relation to the operation of the intervention system for all products (beef, butter, skimmed milk powder and cereals) was IR£55.0 million.  This includes storage, handling, freezing and transport. Receipts from Brussels amounted to IR£39 million, leaving a net cost of IR£16 million to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Intervention stocks of dairy products decreased significantly during 1992 due to a combination of factors, notably reduced production of butter, a buoyant market for skimmed milk powder, and increased disposal opportunities by way of the implementation of sales measures by the EC.  The market outlook for skimmed milk powder remains positive despite some short term weakness. Although the decline in butter production and consumption continues to affect the market, there are indications that the position is beginning to stabilise.</P>
    <P>Beef intervention stocks remain high reflecting the heavy reliance of the beef sector on intervention as a market support. This is a consequence of the difficult situation on international markets.  Every effort is being made to remove obstacles <Col N="537" /> to Irish beef exports and generate sales outlets, with some considerable success.</P>
    <P>While there have been some export sales of intervention barley over the last year, intake has risen in recent months reflecting a certain dependence of the sector on intervention.</P>
    <P>In addition, intake of wheat into intervention has recommenced for the first time since 1986.  Despite the EC Commission's export policy to give priority to sales from the free market in order to reduce this dependence, cereal stocks have continued to rise throughout the Community.</P>
    <P>On intervention stocks overall, it is a matter for the EC Commission to determine sales disposal programmes for these products.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear from the Minister's reply that we have in intervention stocks to the value of one third of a billion pounds.  In the light of that I want to ask the Minister two questions. First, does he agree that it is an indictment of western society to have mountains of surplus meat and other stocks in intervention while millions starve in Africa and elsewhere?  Would the Minister consider that it was sensible for his Government to make substantial reductions in the moneys available for promotion and marketing of agricultural goods abroad in the light of the present huge intervention stocks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Before answering the Deputy's first question, it is important to state what intervention means to agriculture here.  It is an income support mechanism which has been used extensively by farmers as another avenue of getting rid of stocks.  It has provided an important source of income for our farmers and in that context, it should not be degraded.  However, in regard to whether it is moral or ethical that vast stocks of food should be in storage in the community while people starve in other parts of the world, obviously, there is only one answer to that question.  At the same time, it should be stated that, where practical, this Government has always supported <Col N="538" /> measures to supply food to areas of distress and continues to press that policy.  The obvious answer to the Deputy's question is that it is not moral or ethical in a global sense that food reserves remain in storage while people starve, but the Government's record in endeavouring to divert such stocks, where it is practical to do so, should be recognised.</P>
      <P>In regard to the promotion of Irish produce overseas, this is an ongoing process and a great deal of important and useful work is being done at present, with considerable success.  The expert group report on the food industry has given special attention to synchronising our efforts to promote our food.  I have dealt already with the difficulties that exist in the marketplace, but the bodies promoting Irish food are doing excellent work and should have our support in doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister agreed that it is neither moral nor ethical that intervention stocks continue while people starve, but surely he cannot feel comfortable when over one third of a billion pounds of food is being hoarded on this island while millions of people starve.  Does the Minister or his Government intend raising this awful situation with the European Community?  In regard to the question of disposal, will the Minister agree that it is highly unwise for his Government to reduce the amount of money available for marketing and promotion of our food abroad in the light, in particular, of the significant increases in the quantity of food now hoarded in intervention on this island?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I reiterate that in an ideal world the Deputy's point would be valid and I support him in that context.  In relation to the Government's plans in this regard, as I have said already, we have always pressed that food supplies be sent to areas of distress where practical, but we should sound a note of realism here. Sending food to countries in which people are starving is not always an effective mechanism because in some of those countries there will be transport problems <Col N="539" /> in terms of food distribution.  For example, in countries where armed conflicts are taking place it may be difficult to move food from one area to another but, in general, efforts continue to be made in that regard.</P>
      <P>In regard to the promotion of Irish food, I have been involved in that area for the past four months.  Successful work is being carried out in that regard.  It is important for all of us to &ldquo;talk up&rdquo; Irish food and to project the quality green image because as the Common Agricultural Policy reforms begin to bite more in terms of the mechanism about which we are talking &mdash; intervention &mdash; we must rapidly develop the value added sector of our processing industry and produce a much wider product range.  In general, I compliment the promotion agencies. They are carrying out effective work and I support them in that regard.  I do not agree that the work is not being carried out effectively at present.</P>

At present, that is affecting job creation opportunities.  Does he intend to deal with this problem now?  It is an extraordinary anomaly to have&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Arising from the earlier part of the Minister's lengthy reply, will the Government consider taking an initiative to plan a further winding up or beefing up &mdash; if I may use that metaphor &mdash; of the Community's food aid programme? For example, will the Minister agree that we now know that all of east Africa will require massive inputs of food from the rest of the world for at least the next five to seven years?  Will he not agree that even if peace were restored there tomorrow it would take at least that long for a commercial agricultural sector to emerge in that country?  Has the Government any intention of getting the European Community to embark on a properly planned programme over a period of at least five years so that some reasonable use is made of surplus stocks in the Community?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has referred to two issues.  First, under Common Agricultural Policy reform, the quantity of food going into intervention will diminish but I take the Deputy's point that in areas such as east Africa a planned approach is important.  In essence, the provision of food is a fire brigade action initially and there must be planning to sustain it. Obviously, the building up of the capabilities of such nations to supply their own food is the main objective.  The Government has taken a positive attitude in regard to such issues and the matters raised by the Deputy will be taken into consideration as the matter progresses in the European Community.</P>

      <P>The Minister stated that we must &ldquo;talk up&rdquo; the importance of Irish food in terms of its export potential.  That is probably all we are doing, we talk it up here and at every seminar around the country.  Would the Minister not agree that the resources in respect of promoting Irish food products in international markets are not being provided?  When one compares intervention stocks valued at £360 million approximately to the figure being spent promoting Irish food on the world market the figure is minuscule.  The imbalance is enormous between the two and it is time to put the resources behind this &ldquo;talking up&rdquo; effort.</P>
      <P>In regard to the fire brigade action in dealing with famine in Africa, would the Minister not agree that since we know what the requirements will be in the coming years we must plan in respect of dispersing and using stocks for the benefit of those people?  It is not fire brigade action but advance planning we need now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding Deputy Cullen's first question, the stocks in intervention tend to be of the commodity variety rather than the value-added type. In my first reply I dealt with the problems on the market.  The Irish food industry needs to develop its research and development programme to obtain a much wider range of product, including pre-cooked foods, vac-packed products, food ingredients etc.  During my period in office I have had the opportunity to examine what is happening in the industry. The Irish industry is excellent, as are the people working in it.  We must take a major step forward in respect of technology and identification of product. That will be achieved by research and development and it can be introduced into certain areas by technology transfer and so on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">

      <P>It would be a mistake to consider that commodities in intervention <Col N="542" /> are easily saleable.  It is the value added, the upmarket type product on which we must place emphasis.  CBF are doing great work in the sale and promotion of Irish beef, lamb and bacon. This promotion is ongoing and it is making good progress.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's second question related to a planned Community approach to tackling the problems of famine and deprivation in Third World areas.  I agree that an approach must be adopted by the Community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that the list he has read from is the normal list to which we have become accustomed? Those food fairs are useful but there is nothing very special about the list.  Is the Minister not aware that we are at the Royal Stoneleigh Show and the Royal Highland Show every year?  Would <Col N="543" /> he not agree that there is no indication of any new thinking there?  More importantly, is he aware that the grant-in-aid for CBF this year is cut by £198,000 and the administration grant-in-aid to BIM is cut by £170,000 compared to last year? If we take CBF, BIM and Bord Glas and the allocation for trade exhibitions and promotions in his Department's Estimate and that for the Department of the Marine we will find a cut this year of over £250,000 compared to last year.  Would he explain to the House how that represents an energetic approach to the marketing of Irish food?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Dukes is aware, a number of international shows are held throughout the world each year. Decisions must be made by the various promotion agencies in Ireland &mdash; CBF, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, An Bord Tráchtála or whoever &mdash; as to the shows which are most beneficial to our producers and processors.  It is difficult to find sufficient resources to attend all of these promotions. Obviously, we must look at a budget in terms of using it most costeffectively. Much promotion is done in the context of inviting groups of buyers from supermarkets in a particular country or region to attend, with CBF, ABT or others acting as facilitators for the companies to make contact with the supermarket buyers.  One aspect which struck me at the recent Kinsale International Food Forum was that in future supermarket chains, who control 50 to 60 per cent of the food business on the continent, wish to deal with fewer suppliers. That point was put quite forcibly to me.  Promotions which attract key buyers for the multiples are an effective way of promoting Irish goods.  To say that if we do not attend each and every international fair we will not be doing our job correctly is unfair.  There are limited resources in this area and the Exchequer will never be able to provide sufficient funds to attend all of these shows.  Deputy Dukes will agree that the agencies have been doing very well on behalf of Irish industry and he is aware also that the <Col N="544" /> larger players in the business do their own promotion work where they find it is beneficial to attend these shows.  This must be done on a cost-effective basis so that our economy obtains the best return for our processors in terms of our products.</P>
      <P>Since taking office I have been impressed by the quality of Irish promotion and marketing.  Part of that process is to promote our clean, green, quality image which must be done at every level.  The Deputy is nodding his head but I believe that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This question is very much related to the previous one concerning intervention.  When one compares the amount of money spent on actual promotion with that spent on the administration of the intervention system it raises the question as to why so much money is spent on promotion.  The Minister has agreed that stricter intervention criteria will be applied but why has he decided to cut the Livestock and Meat Board budget at a time when it should be doubled rather than decreased?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the food fairs abroad at which Irish food will be promoted this year.  Why is CBF going to the Royal Highland Show again this year? We are trying to build up our suckler herd.  Many farmers are experiencing difficulties in obtaining sucklers to build up their herds due to a shortage of those animals.  Ireland was renowned for the number of sucklers it used to send to Scotland but very few will be sent to the show this year.  Why are we promoting these animals at the Royal Highland Show?  It should be remembered that live animals &mdash; not meat &mdash; are being promoted at the show.  Will the Minister explain why the budget for CBF has been cut?  It should be better utilised at a time when the Minister suggested that a limitation will be put on carcase weight so that high quality cattle will no longer be put into intervention but will have to be <Col N="546" /> sold.  CBF will need a better budget if it is to sell Irish meat in the future.  We do not want to hear any more waffle.  During the period 1979-80&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I accept the CBF and the other State agencies are doing the best they can on their ridiculously limited budgets.

The State's role in this area is to ensure that we have a generic Irish product to sell.  At the end of the day selling the product is done by the companies and their people.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 73 and 90 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has drawn up a detailed five-year programme of forestry research.  The main objectives of this programme are: to improve the quality, yield, production efficiency and diversity of wood grown in Ireland; to maintain and safeguard the stability and health of the national forest estate; to study the inter-relationship between forestry and the environment &mdash; physical, social, cultural and economic &mdash; and to advance technology transfer in forestry.</P>
      <P>The research programme planned for 1993 has been prepared with these objectives in mind.  In particular, projects will be undertaken in 1993 focusing on: the diversification of species; the vulnerability and stability of plantations to windthrow; the planting of broadleaves; product design; the development of standards; water quality, afforestation and the environment; and socio-economic studies on forestry and rural development. These projects will be carried out on the Department's behalf, on an agency basis, by Eolas, Coillte Teoranta and certain universities.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister decipher all the jargon in his reply?  I am not sure what precisely he was talking about.  Will he agree that the resources provided for forestry research are totally inadequate? Developments in this area have been painstakingly slow and the programme needs to be moved ahead at a much faster rate.  When does the Minister envisage the type of research to which he referred being completed?  Is this a long term package or can it be brought into operation immediately in the planting programmes so that we can benefit from the type of timber we should be producing at present?</P>

Neither do I want to give a very lengthy and detailed description of the amount of research activity being undertaken by Eolas and, to a lesser extent, the universities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will circulate to the Deputies the result of all the research work being undertaken in relation to these headings.  On forestry development generally we are on the threshold of worthwhile development.  When Deputies have an opportunity to study the post-1993 operational programme for forestry they will see included many of the areas identified today in relation to research and so on.  I <Col N="551" /> am satisfied that considerable progress is being made in forestry development and there are even more significant plans for future development.</P>

      <P>The Minister has outlined various areas of concern in relation to research but he did not mention the question of employment.  Does he not agree that in forestry research and development job creation potential must be considered?  There must be an assessment of industrial development needed to create jobs, whether in woodpulp or whatever.  That should be a crucial element in research and development of forestry.  The Minister also mentioned technology in terms of the removal of timber.  Is he satisfied that technological advances will not affect current jobs in removing timber?</P>

There is no point in having a national forestry plan unless there is capacity to generate employment and create wealth, which is the whole purpose of the national forestry programme. I am optimistic that jobs will be created in forestry in the immediate years.  The Deputy mentioned improved technology.  Negotiations are advanced in relation to the provision of a mill to process the less commercial grades of timber which up to now have not been utilised to the greatest possible extent. We hope to bring to a successful conclusion negotiations in relation to that facility.  In addition, we hope to expand other aspects of the processing industry with a view to maximising the potential for job creation in forestry.  I take the Deputy's point and assure her that job creation in forestry is very high on my agenda.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 22, 42, 48, 75 and 82 together.</P>
      <P>Under the proposals for a retirement scheme which have been sent to the Commission, I have suggested a maximum pension level of £8,771 which is the current maximum figure which will be co-financed by the Community.  The relevant Council regulation does not make provision for indexation and consequently it was not possible for me to make any such provision in my detailed proposals.  As regards devaluation, the maximum amount is fixed in Irish pounds and is not therefore affected by devaluation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that devaluation properly applied would make the retirement scheme more attractive?  The income should in some way be related to sterling and to devaluation. Will the Minister agree that if devaluation is properly applied it would mean an additional £900 and the pension would become more attractive?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated that the pension is fixed in Irish pounds and that we have agreed to the maximum pension.  I understand what the Deputy is trying to achieve.  The Deputy's case is that if the pension was fixed in ECUs perhaps the result when applied to the Irish currency would be equivalent to indexation which would maximise the value of the pension. I am extremely anxious to maximise the possible benefit under this scheme.  This is a very attractive scheme.  There are marginal elements of the scheme which I would like to see modified but by and large the submission which has gone to Brussels represents the best that we can negotiate under the terms and regulations laid down by the Community.  The fact that we are negotiating the maximum pension allowable under the scheme is an indication of our desire to transfer the benefits of that EC scheme to Irish farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that the maximum pension of £8,771 was fixed in advance of devaluation of the Irish pound earlier this year, that it would have been entered into the Community budget plan on the basis of the then ECU exchange rate and that it would not matter if the Community continued to pay at that rate of ECUs which would now be worth £9,468 here?  Would the Minister bestir himself and make sure that can be done? Would the Minister not agree that there is no obstacle to the Irish Government if it wishes to index this and that the only result would be that the European Community would pay a slightly smaller proportion of the pension?  Would the Minister not agree that it would be a worthwhile move to index the scheme off our own bat?</P>

In the case of this retirement scheme, there will be snags and problems.  Surely this concession of attaching it to the ECU should be foremost in the Minister's mind.  Can the Minister give us a guarantee that this will be pursued in Brussels by the Minister?</P>

      <P>I admire the Deputy for his perseverance.  The Deputy can be assured that this is an aspect of the scheme which I will pursue in Brussels from the point of view of maximising this potential.  There are other areas of the scheme about which I am not entirely happy but which the Deputies have not identified.  We hope to get an early decision on our scheme and we are also in negotiation to streamline the scheme and maximise the benefits for farmers, not only in relation to the devaluation of our currency but in relation to some other aspects of it.</P>

      <P>Many farmers are very worried about when they will be able to apply.  They want to know the regulations. The Minister has quoted a Government statement made when the forms were released.  It is very unsatisfactory for farmers who complied with the regulations but who did not have suitable cows.  They want to know when they will be able to apply again.  It is almost June and if they are to apply this year they will need to know soon.  If they do not apply, how many millions in EC aid will be lost to this country if unused quota is not taken up?  We need to know exactly what is available and advise farmers so that they can organise themselves. Farmers cannot get suitable cows overnight. It is in the best interest of the country that farmers know where they stand as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's concern.  It is important to remember that this is a special suckler cow scheme for small milk producers.  We negotiated a special quota of 63,400 animals for Ireland.  I am conscious that many small milk producers did not have the type of animal which would qualify under the scheme.  I had many discussions with farming organisations about that.  It is for that reason that we have established the national reserve.  There will be no question of the full allocation not being taken <Col N="559" /> up because any reserve will be transferred to the national reserve.  In addition, eligible farmers will have two years to increase their herds with qualified animals.  It is in the interests of small milk producers that we retain this reserve for them specifically given that the country as a whole will not be deprived of the benefits associated with the quota.  I wish to reassure Deputies that there will be no losses in relation to the national quota.</P>

The revised network was discussed at local level and at the Labour Relations Commission.  As no agreement was reached the matter was referred to the Labour Court.  In its recommendation issued on 12 May, the court recommended that all elements of the network review, with one exception, be implemented from 17 May for one month during which time the parties would negotiate all the detailed points raised in respect of the changes.</P>
      <P>The craft workers dispute arises from productivity negotiations which have been ongoing for the past three years. The claim has been the subject of detailed discussions at the Labour Relations Commission from which two sets of proposals emerged but which were rejected by the workers concerned.  The dispute can be referred to the Labour Court but the unions do not wish to do so.</P>
      <P>I would ask the workers concerned to resume normal working immediately and seek to resolve their problems through negotiations with the assistance of the dispute settling agencies, if necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The lack of progress in implementing the code of practice on dispute procedures including procedure in essential services has been very disappointing.  The code was drawn up following detailed consultations with all interested parties and on that basis should enjoy a wide degree of acceptability and support. Since taking up office I have been encouraging employers and unions in essential services such as Dublin Bus to adopt a <Col N="561" /> more proactive approach in the implementation of the code.</P>
    <P>Dublin Bus is among the companies where the provisions of the code have not been implemented.  I would hope that lessons will be learned from these unnecessary disputes that will provide the impetus for the early implementation of the code.</P>
    <P>If the code of practice does not receice widespread acceptance and the public continue to suffer because of disputes in essential services, the voluntary appraoach in dealing with these issues will have to be reviewed.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that the largest union involved in this dispute, SIPTU, intends to ballot its members on a full scale strike on Thursday? Would she agree that the prospects, between now and Thursday, of negotiating a back to work formula and of avoiding total chaos in Dublin Bus services will disappear if there is a ballot on a full scale strike?  Would she use the powers available to her under section 38 of the Industrial Relations Act to require the Labour Relations Commission to involve itself in the negotiation of a back to work formula in order to provide a bus service for the people of Dublin and avoid further disruption of services in the event of a full scale strike?</P>

I wish to inform the House and the Deputies again that both the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court have been involved at various stages.  They will continue to make themselves available to the parties involved. The Department will also keep a close watch on the proceedings and will make itself available to lessen the discomfort caused for commuters and to prevent an escalation of the dispute.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that the SIPTU representative involved in the dispute at the Phibsboro bus depot is quoted as saying in today's newspapers that the dispute there could <Col N="562" /> be resolved in a matter of hours if Dublin Bus management was prepared to sit down and meet the unions without preconditions? Would the Minister of State accept that Dublin Bus management acted irresponsibility in refusing to agree to talks in view of the effect the dispute is having on many thousands of commuters? Given that the unions have called for third party mediation or intervention by the Labour Relations Commission, can the Minister of State assist or intervene directly to facilitate this? Will she give an assurance that she will not wait until the entire public transport system has ground to a halt before deciding that it is appropriate to intevene directly?</P>

      <P>The Deputy mentioned what is reported in a newspaper. One would not be prepared to say that what is reported in the newspapers is accurate until it is repeated in public.  As I have said, in both disputes in Dublin Bus the intervention process has been well utilised.  Both the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court have been involved and will continue to make themselves available to the parties involved.  The Deputy asked if I would intervene directly.  The Government has put structures in place.  One hopes that matters such as this can be resolved at management level but, if not, other machinery is available so that disputes and altercations can be resolved.  The Department and the Government are keeping a close watch on the matter.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister of State agree that disputes are occurring within the transport services, in particular Dublin Bus, with alarming regularity, particularly in the run up to holiday periods?  Would she accept that the principles underlying the code of practice governing disputes in essential services have been forgotten in this instance?  For example, would she agree that acceptance of the outcome at the final stage has not occurred in this case, in that none of the fall back positions envisaged in the code of practice has been <Col N="563" /> adopted, whereby it would be accepted pending an annual or a five-yearly review?</P>
      <P>Would the Minister of State indicate what she plans to do by way of intervention in this and in other possible disputes in essential services to protect the public and ensure continuity of service? Does she envisage a certain point at which alternative services will have to be provided for people affected?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy alleged a proliferation of trade disputes.  There has been a great diminution in the number of trade disputes in recent years, which we hope will continue.</P>
      <P>The Deputy talked about a code of practice.  We are disappointed at the non-implementation of the code of practice for essential services.  Of course, it is a voluntary code of practice.  One would have hoped that management, unions and workers would have sorted the matter out between themselves.  The code of practice was drawn up following detailed consultations with all the interested parties.  On that basis, one would assume that it would enjoy a great degree of acceptance.  We have been doing our very best to ensure that the code of practice is implemented.  One can go only so far with a voluntary code. One would always wish that the voluntary code of practice would be adhered to and implemented.  If it does not receive widespread acceptance and the public continue to suffer because of disputes in essential services, obviously the voluntary approach will have to be reviewed, but I remain convinced that the voluntary approach is the correct one. We will keep that matter under review because, as the Deputy rightly says, the public cannot always be allowed to suffer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the spectacle of an all-out strike in the delivery of public transport would be an unthinkable proposition, bearing in mind the damage being done already to the business community by difficulties people encounter simply <Col N="564" /> trying to get to work, apart altogether from personal discomfort?  This is something we can ill afford.  Because prevention is better than cure, would the Minister not consider, through whatever means she has at her disposal &mdash; and there are many &mdash; intervening in some way before a full ballot is undertaken on Thursday next?  Would she not accept that if an all-out strike occurs with massive disruption of public transport, the damage could have an effect throughout the remainder of this year?</P>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that one of the major contributory factors is that a monopoly exists in the delivery of public transport?  Is she aware that some 1,200 new European transport operator passenger licences have been issued whose criteria for qualification include the production of tax clearance certificates, which means that, effectively, there can be upwards of 1,000 private companies delivering public transport services here not recognised at all by the Government? Would she agree it is about time that competition obtained, particularly in Dublin, but nationwide, in the delivery of public transport?  If that were to happen, opportunities would not get seized within Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann to utilise their monopolistic power to hold the public up to ransom.  We have gone far beyond the stage of acceptance of such practices.  Would the Minister care to comment on that?</P>

      <P>Nobody in this House or outside it wants to see a dispute about public services.  The Deputy asked me to use the considerable powers for intervention available to me and to the Department.  As I said, that has already been gone through with the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court who remain available for consultation, if necessary, at immediate notice.</P>
      <P>The Deputy raised a third aspect, a monopoly in public transport.  I would reply that that is a separate question but realise that the Deputy is speaking from an interested background in that respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has questioned the accuracy of newspaper reports regarding the willingness of the unions to attend the Labour Relations Commission. As recently as two hours ago, it was confirmed to me by the union that they were willing to attend before the Labour Relations Commission on the issue of the suspensions and so on which has given rise to the disruption of the services, but that there appears to be some reluctance on the part of the Labour Relations Commission to facilitate such appearance.</P>
      <P>May I ask the Minister again whether she would use the powers available to her to direct the Labour Relations Commission to arrange for discussions between the parties before these disputes escalate and the entire bus service in Dublin grinds to a complete halt?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's words &mdash; that I question the accuracy of newspaper reports &mdash; are his, not mine.  I said Deputy Gregory spoke of reportage in papers of what somebody had said.  One is always careful about attributing the utmost veracity to such reports.  I take it, if the Deputy has spoken to somebody, he is relating facts.  I must repeat that the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court are available, at the ready, to consult, help and advise in an effort to obviate any further dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the availability agencies like the Labour Relations Commission will not necessarily bring about any intervention and that what is needed on her part is some clear direction to get the apparatus available directly involved since, as we have seen in the past, their simply being available has not resolved disputes which have tended to escalate. We are endeavouring to prevent a serious escalation and to put an end to the current dispute.  Would she not agree that something more than the mere expression <Col N="566" /> that various agencies are available is required?</P>
      <P>I should say, for the record, I am no longer involved in any private or public transport organisation.  I was up to 13 months ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously the Deputy would have been speaking from his background knowledge of the matter of monopolies and so on.</P>
      <P>The Deputy contended that the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court being available is not sufficient. Let me reiterate that they have been actively involved in the disputes, in particular in this one.  I might add that the Department and we in Government are in close contact, from hour to hour, with both the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court.  All Members can be assured that everything possible will be done to achieve a resolution of this dispute.</P>

      <P>At what point would the Minister envisage asking either the Army, or some alternative service, to be available to the people affected by this dispute?  If it becomes an all-out strike, we will have very serious circumstances prevailing.  While it is not the best industrial relations practice to have Labour Court recommendations re-opened by the Labour Relations Commission, in order to prevent the public being so severely discommoded, would she intervene personally to ensure that the Labour Relations Commission does hold a hearing on this matter at an early stage?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I object to the taking of item No. 3, which is a tax imposing resolution.  The rules of the Dáil make it clear that one cannot bring in an amendment to impose a charge on the people on Committee Stage unless a resolution approving the charge is approved in the Dáil itself before the Committee Stage begins.  I believe item No.3 arises from amendments tabled only yesterday by the Minister for Finance, part of a telephone book load of amendments to the Finance Bill changing tax law without proper time for examination.  Not only is this a Government of high taxation but it appears to be a Government that seeks to break the rules of this House in order to impose further charges.</P>
      <P>On a point of Order, Sir, I refer you to Standing Order 122 (2) which states clearly:</P>
      <P>The Committee Stage of a Bill which incidentally involves a charge upon the people shall not be taken unless a motion approving of the charge has been passed by the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thus, I submit, on a point of order, that this resolution and its associated amendment to the Finance Bill is out of order in that it is tabled too late for approval here after Committee Stage has begun.  I would refer you in particular to Standing Order 125 concerning Financial Resolutions <Col N="664" /> which makes it clear furthermore that a Financial Resolution must be taken before the Bills to which it refers are passed at Second Stage and may not be taken afterwards.</P>

This schedule, may I add, was drawn up by Deputy Bruton's own party and agreed to by the Government.  This is the reason it is being moved today; it is not being taken until tomorrow morning and Deputy Bruton knows that well.  I suggest to Deputy Bruton that it is a matter for the Chair to decide if this was done in accordance with Standing Order 122 (2) or not.

I believe there is a very specific case which has given rise to this and I can understand that in a particular case there may be good reason for it.

      <P>May I reply to Deputy Bruton and, indeed, to some of the remarks made by Deputy Rabbitte. It is a long established practice that a Financial Resolution may be taken during the course of Committee Stage of the Bill concerned, providing of course that the section or part of the Bill to which the resolution relates has not been entered into on the Committee Stage. Parliamentary procedure is not confined to Standing Orders alone but also involves long established practice.  If one accepted a literal interpretation of the relevant Standing Order, namely 122 (2), as contended by Deputy Bruton, as being the only source of procedure then our procedures would be very inflexible indeed, if not unworkable, and would have the effect that an amendment to a <Col N="666" /> Bill which would require a further Financial Resolution, could not be taken either on Committee or Report Stage. This would seriously disrupt the business of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Order.  The commencement of Committee Stage cannot be taken as a cut-off point for the taking of Financial Resolutions and there are many precedents for so doing.  I may add that Standing Order 105 clearly envisages that an amendment involving a charge may be moved during Report Stage on re-committal long after Committee Stage has commenced.  That is the position, Deputy, so far as the Chair is concerned. I would hope there will be no argument about it.</P>

      <P>The Dáil Éireann notes the report of the team which was established to investigate the Kilkenny incest case and endorses the action taken by the Minister for Health on the recommendations set out in that report.</P>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to make a statement to the House about the Kilkenny incest case and the recent report of the investigation team which I established to inquire into the role of health services in relation to that case.</P>
      <P>The entire nation was shocked and horrified as details of the dreadful abuse, both physical and sexual, suffered by the young woman at the hands of her father emerged following the court case on 1 March last and the subsequent interviews given by the victim herself.  It is hard to believe that such savagery exists in our society and it is almost impossible to appreciate the extent of the pain and suffering experienced by the woman involved.</P>
      <P>I share the widespread and genuine revulsion which our community as a whole feels about this case.  I know that all Members of this House will join with me in conveying our deep sympathy to the woman and in expressing our determination that such abuse will never again occur in our society.</P>
      <P>As details of the case unfolded questions began to be raised about the performance of the health services.  In particular, there was concern about how the abuse could have continued for such a period of time and not be brought to light earlier so that appropriate action could be taken to protect the woman concerned.  I was particularly concerned at suggestions that the results of the abuse had been seen by different health care professionals at various times but that no action had been taken to remedy the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of all these concerns, I instructed the chief executive officer of the South Eastern Board to set up a team <Col N="675" /> to carry out an immediate investigation of the case in so far as the health services were concerned, and to report back to me as a matter of urgency.  While this was my immediate concern, I was also anxious that we should learn from the lessons of this case and I also asked the team to make recommendations for the future investigation and management by the health services of cases of suspected child abuse.</P>
    <P>Given the depth of public concern about the case and the questions that had been raised about the role of the health services, I was particularly anxious that the team should have an eminent and independent chairperson.  We were indeed fortunate in securing the services of Ms Catherine McGuinness, Senior Counsel, who combines a distinguished career at the Bar with a long standing commitment to the whole area of child care.</P>
    <P>Ms Catherine McGuinness was ably assisted by Ms Brid Clarke, Head Social Worker, Eastern Health Board; Dr. Sheelah Ryan, Director of community care and medical officer of health, Midland Health Board and Mr. Martin Hynes, programme manager, South-Eastern Health Board.</P>
    <P>I would like to put on record my sincere thanks to the team for the willingness with which they undertook this difficult task despite the many other pressures they face in their own work.  I would also like to acknowledge the assistance which the team received from the South Eastern Health Board and from the many professionals and other people who came forward to provide information.  This was not a statutory inquiry and the willingness of a wide variety of people to lend their support helped to contribute to the full and timely completion of the task given to the team.</P>
    <P>I know that there is widespread admiration for the thoroughness and speed with which the team performed their work and for the excellent report which they presented to me on Friday, 14 May. It was particuarly helpful that the report was drafted to avoid identifying publicly <Col N="676" /> the woman, her family or the various professionals.  This enabled me to publish the report in its entirety on Tuesday, 18 May and to have it circulated to Deputies, Senators and to other interested parties immediately.</P>
    <P>The report is in two main parts.  The first part deals with the Kilkenny case itself.  It sets out the context in which the case must be viewed in terms of the organisation of the health care system, the legal framework within which it operates and the level of awareness of child abuse in the early eighties.  The second part sets out the team's recommendations in relation to child care, child abuse and domestic violence generally.</P>
    <P>I want to deal, first of all, with what the team had to say about the Kilkenny case.  The report sets out in minute detail the various contacts which the young woman had with the health services over the years.  It is clear that the woman and, indeed, her family sought and received services and assistance from various elements of the health services over a long period of time.</P>
    <P>In all, there were over 100 contacts between the woman and the health services, many for routine medical ailments but some directly related to the abuse she was suffering.  While the health care personnel responded to the presenting symptoms it is most regrettable that the true reality of what was happening in the family was not fully addressed until 1992. On the basis of their investigation, the reasons put forward by the team to explain why this happened include: the fact that each aspect of the health services dealt with the individual manifestations of the abuse and the various illnesses entirely separately and without inter-disciplinary communication and co-operation; each injury was treated separately and the plausible explanations for the injuries which were given by the woman and her family were accepted; the prevalence and the tell tale signs of physical or sexual abuse were not as well understood at the time either by professionals or the public at large; and there were certain weaknesses in the management of the community care services in relation to <Col N="677" /> the investigation of suspected cases of child abuse.</P>
    <P>While allowing for these factors, it is still a cause of very great concern and regret to me and to this House that this unfortunate woman should have been subjected to brutal and degrading treatment over such a long period while the services which could have been expected to help her were so close at hand and yet failed fully to grasp and act on the abuse that was taking place.</P>
    <P>In their analysis, the investigation team reviewed the response of the health services to the victim and her family in the light of the legal situation and professional practices which pertained at the time in question and their report should be read in that context.  At that time the procedures which are now in place for the detection and investigation of sexual abuse had not been developed.  The whole concept of child sexual abuse was only beginning to be acknowledged and accepted as relevant to the health services.</P>
    <P>However, during those long years of suffering a significant change was taking place in society's awareness of sexual abuse and there was a growth in understanding among health professionals of their role in tackling it.  It is encouraging, therefore, to note that in early 1992 when the girl was finally persuaded by a friend as well as her GP and hospital staff to make a formal complaint to the gardaí, all services responded swiftly.  It is also heartening to read that the investigation team concludes that today an early diagnosis of such abuse would be much more likely.</P>
    <P>This, of course, is of little comfort to the young woman.  We all deeply regret the suffering she endured.  We must learn from this tragic case.  It is for this reason that I asked the team to let me have recommendations on the future management of suspected child abuse by the health services.  There are over twenty major recommendations in the report. In putting forward its recommendations, the investigation team indicated that it was aware that some of its recommendations would require further consideration <Col N="678" /> and elaboration, that additional resources would be required and that changes in policy, attitude and approach would be necessary.  It also asked that its recommendations receive early and wide circulation so as to stimulate debate and bring about the change necessary to improve the protection of children.</P>
    <P>It is for this reason that the Government considered and released the report within five days of my receiving it.  The speed of my response is an indication of the concern and urgency with which I and the Government view the whole question of child care and child abuse.  I welcome the opportunity for the House to reflect on this most harrowing report and to hear the views of the Opposition Deputies in relation to it.</P>
    <P>I now want to outline the preliminary response which I and the Government have decided to make to this report.  The team states that they cannot recommend too strongly the urgent need to provide the necessary resources to implement the remaining sections of the Child Care Act, 1991, and in particular those parts of the Act which deal with the taking of children into care and which strengthen the powers of health boards, the gardaí and the courts in relation to children at risk.</P>
    <P>The effect of those parts would be to increase from 16 to 18 years of age up to which health boards may intervene to protect children at risk.  Health boards and the courts would have available a greater range of options, including supervision orders which would authorise health staff to visit and monitor children at risk in their own homes.</P>
    <P>The full implementation of the Child Care Act is the single biggest contribution which we can make towards promoting the welfare of children and protecting those who are at risk.  Nothing less than this would be an adequate response to the terrible suffering experienced in the Kilkenny case and to the report of the investigation team.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to announce that the Government has agreed to my proposals to implement all the remaining sections of the Child Care Act over a three year <Col N="679" /> period, commencing with those provisions that relate to the protection of children from abuse and neglect.</P>

As an indication of its determination in the matter, the Government has decided that in 1993 an <Col N="680" /> additional £5 million will be provided for the child care services, amounting to £10 million in a full year.  An investment of the same scale will be made in each of the next three years to resource this Act. I am informed that that is as expeditious as possible, if it is to be undertaken effectively. I sincerely hope that the full implementation of this Act will help to ensure that no other child and no family will ever again have to endure such suffering.</P>

      <P>The decision to proceed rapidly with the implementation of the Act represents a milestone in social reform and is a mark of the concern of the entire community and, hopefully, all sides of this House, regarding the protection of children and the promotion of their welfare.</P>
      <P>The new legislation will not be fully effective until the necessary procedures are put in place to underpin it and to ensure that it is fully operational.  In this regard the team's recommendations in relation to child care guidelines, written Protocols, child abuse registers, the conduct of case conferences and record keeping will require careful consideration by my Department, the statutory agencies and relevant professionals.  My Department is already in discussion with the Garda Síochána in relation to the strengthening of the child abuse guidelines. I will be taking immediate steps to ensure that the recommendations of the investigation team are evaluated and implemented to the maximum extent possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having reviewed the legal framework, the investigation team are of the view that the very high emphasis on the rights of the family in the Constitution may consciously or unconsciously be interpreted as giving a higher value to the rights of parents than to the rights of children.  They believe that the Constitution <Col N="682" /> should contain a specific and overt declaration of the rights of children and have recommended that the Constitution be amended accordingly.  This is a complex and far-reaching recommendation which will require detailed consideration by the Government in consultation with the Attorney General and I intend that this process be initiated as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>A central recommendation of the investigation team is that there should be mandatory reporting of all forms of child abuse by designated professionals.  The team heard evidence and received submissions both for and against the introduction of a mandatory reporting law. On balance, I am in favour of mandatory reporting.  However, I realise that some professional groups may have difficulties with regard to client confidentiality that would need to be resolved before this could be introduced.  I am anxious to ensure that we achieve as much common ground and consensus as possible on this before proceeding with legislation. Therefore, I will be initiating broad ranging consultations with all the relevant interest groups with a view to securing the widest possible agreement on the question of mandatory reporting.</P>
    <P>The report makes a series of recommendations in relation to the improvement of services for families and children. These relate to prevention and education, family support, treatment and staff training.  These measures will be carefully considered as services are expanded and strengthened to implement the provisions of the Child Care Act.  I will be instructing health boards and other agencies to incorporate these recommendations in their implementation plans.</P>
    <P>As a significant part of the abuse in the Kilkenny case occurred after the woman had attained adulthood, the team with my agreement extended their remit somewhat to include adult abuse and domestic violence generally.  Their report includes a series of recommendations in relation to domestic violence.  They have called for the provision of more refuge places for victims of family violence, for <Col N="683" /> support services for those victims, for training for health care staff in identifying cases of family violence and the introduction of approprite referral procedures to the Garda.  The team have also recommended changes in the legislation governing barring orders to make these orders available in all cases of domestic violence and not just, as at present, in cases of violence against spouses.</P>
    <P>I intend to address the question of having adequate refuge spaces available in the context of the additional funding now being made available to me by Government.  I see such refuges as a key component of the network of child care and family support services needed to be put in place to underpin the Child Care Act.  I have instructed my Department to urgently examine the other recommendations that relate to my area of responsibility.  I intend to discuss the recommendations in relation to barring orders with my colleague, the Minister for Justice, who has responsibility for the current legislation in this area.  I have done this already on a preliminary basis and will do so more formally in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>The need for very close co-operation and co-ordination between all the various agencies dealing with children is obvious form this report.  The team has some telling recommendations in relation to the role of gardaí, teachers and other professionals dealing with children at risk.  I have already had preliminary consultations with my ministerial colleagues with a view to finding effective and efficient mechanism to give expression to these particular recommendations.</P>
    <P>The report also makes recommendations in relation to specific measures to be taken by the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Department of Justice and the medical council.  These agencies have already been contacted with a view to having the team's recommendations examined as a matter of urgency.  In response to a further recommendations by the investigation team, I have asked the health promotion unit of my Department to develop a campaign <Col N="684" /> to promote the welfare of children and to educate the public so that they can play a more effective role in this whole area.</P>
    <P>I have also been considering how I and my Department should respond to the growing incidence of child abuse. Because of the very much increased workload in this area I have decided to create a child care policy unit within my Department.  This unit will play a key role in the implementation of the Child Care Act nationally, in considering and implementing the recommendations in this report and in developing policy in the whole area of child care and family support services.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to echo a point made in the report that violence and sexual abuse, whether against children or adults, must not be seen solely as the responsibility of the health services.  Other agencies, both statutory and voluntary, also have responsibility in this area as indeed has the community as a whole.  The elimination of such abuse and violence must be a shared responsibility and must be supported by society at large.</P>

      <P>The Government should order the business of the House in a more satisfactory manner.  At the outset I wish to pay a sincere tribute on behalf of the Fine Gael Party to former Senator, Catherine McGuinness, and the team that produced this fine report in so short a time.  It is an indication of the expertise available to the committee which included as its members Dr. Sheelah Ryan, Ms Brid Clarke, Mr. Martin Hynes along with Catherine McGuinness.  I hope we can act on this report at the first available opportunity.</P>
      <P>The committee made 23 recommendations which have great relevance for all cases of child neglect and abuse. It is disappointing to hear the Minister's reaction on the implementation of the Child Care Act.  He has admitted to the House openly and unashamedly that the best he can hope for in terms of a timescale is three years from now.  This is simply not good enough.  The Minister must readily accept that if it was not for the emergence of the facts of this Kilkenny savagery implementation of this Act would have remained firmly on the back burner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been in office for only four months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a dreadful reflection on our society that there are people in our community who will inflict such injuries on members of their own family. Unfortunately, this is not an isolated case.  The ISPCC reckons that at least six children have died as a result of severe physical and sexual abuse within the past 12 months.  The help line set up by that group receives calls at a rate of 1,000 per week.  Successive Fianna Fáil Administrations must take the blame for not providing appropriate resources to implement the Act.  It strikes me as being somewhat disingenuous of the Minister to call legislation which we have had on our Statute Book for over two years new legislation.  Successive Administrations must take the blame for this lack of resources which directly allows so many abused children to fall through the safety <Col N="686" /> net and continue their suffering undetected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This State has not prioritised the needs of children within society.  There is little co-ordination of services, and communication is sadly lacking.  The Minister's response this afternoon was weak and unimpressive.  How long more must we wait for the Government to recognise that the protection of children is fundamental and of considerably more importance to the social health of the community than many other schemes and proposals which cost much more money. It is absolutely incredible and shameful in the extreme that we are dealing with child care legislation enacted 85 years ago, legislation which was substantially amended in Westminster during the twenties.  I participated in the closing stages of the Committee Stage deliberations and the Child Care Act in this House and the sense of achievement among Deputies on all sides of the House was palpable.  There was agreement that this was good, reforming legislation which would be of considerable benefit to our society.  Plaudits were exchanged at the end of the debate and the Minister of the day felt great.  However, the reality is that legislation is only as good as the resources available to implement it.  The success and application of any legislation depends on resources.  Resources mean numbers and numbers mean social workers, psychologists, care centres, homes and the availability of foster parents. Staff, care facilities and referral centres are the kernal to solving the problem. The Government must accept that child care cannot be confined to an eight hour day or a five day week.  Over the past three years there has been no commitment to follow up and implement the legislation.  Only 14 of the 79 sections of the Act have been given statutory force. Having regard to the huge increase in suspected child abuse and neglect cases the type of action proposed must be concrete and radical.  We need an independent national children's council which will be independent of he Department of Health, thereby ensuring full accountability for child care services in the State. <Col N="687" /> Such a council was recommended 23 years ago.  It is now time to inaugurate this council as a matter of some urgency.</P>
    <P>The McGuinness report makes a recommendation on the constitutional amendment of Articles 41 and 42 which would include a statement of clarification on the constitutional rights of our children, something we do not have at present.  This is the type of protection we need if we are to tilt the balance in favour of the child, which is what is required by society at present.  A constitutional amendment to enshrine the rights of children must be set in the context of the type of protection we have given to the unborn in recent years.  While respecting the rights of the unborn, nobody can argue against the need to guarantee the rights of the born, with particular reference to the vulnerability of a defenceless child.  The balance of rights as expressed in our Constitution has given rise to a confused situation.  I hope the Minister and the Attorney General are in a position to introduce the appropriate framework for change in this House at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the investigation which caused me some concern was the matter of the Garda authorities.  I am surprised that there was little in the Minister's speech in terms of forging direct links with the Minister for Justice on the matter of changing the law in the justice area.  Unfortunately, there is a reluctance on the part of many members of the Garda Síochána to become involved in family disputes.  That attitude must change.  The reason for this reluctance is a lack of training.  It is of fundamental importance that a child care officer be appointed in each Garda division.  The officer could have functions similar to those of the crime prevention officer or the juvenile liaison officer.  If Part III of this Act was implemented and properly enforced any delay in coming to the rescue of a child who has been abused and neglected would be minimised.  In this regard, we need a charter for victims of crime.  It is extraordinary that the Minister <Col N="688" /> for Justice has remained so silent on the publication of the report.</P>
    <P>The concept of third party barring orders must be considered.  There is need to have a mechanism available to remove the offender from the house and leave the child in the home.  As we have seen too often in the past, the removal of the child from the home seems to be the priority rather than the removal of the offender.  In this regard it is regrettable that neither the Ministers for Justice nor Equality and Law Reform have addressed the matter of the amendment of the 1981 Family Law Act.  The present law is clearly inadequate.  The argument in favour of allowing an abused party, be they brother, sister, son, daughter or parent, apply to the local District Court for a protection order or barring order to let the court decide the case in the normal course is overwhelming.  Similarly many injured parties are too fearful to take an action in their own name.  The powers of the health boards must be considerably strengthened in this respect.</P>
    <P>Another area which has been debated in this House on many occasions, and deliberated upon at length in the Law Reform Commission Report on Child Sexual Abuse, is the matter of the mandatory reporting of cases.  The points made by the Minister this afternoon are insufficient as regards a concrete proposal in this area.  I hoped the Minister might at least have set a process in train by way of his programme managers to ensure that a Cabinet sub-committee would be set up between the Departments of Equality and Law Reform, Health and Justice to deal with this matter.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the chronic feature of the report is the serious drawbacks within the entire area of communication.  The fact that the girl in question made contact on 100 occasions with official personnel is proof that the system of communication is seriously deficient.  Many of the recommendations in this report have already been made in other reports on other occasions, particularly the 1980 Task Force Report on Child Care and the Law Reform Report on Child Sexual Abuse.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="689" /> Cases of an appalling nature will continue to emerge in Kilkenny, Mayo and elsewhere unless the Government acts positively.  These are not isolated cases. Tragedies will occur unabated unless the Government are seen to take charge of the situation.  Money must be made available now.  It is not sufficient for this House to react in a knee-jerk manner after successive tragedies are unearthed or a court decision is handed down. Thousands of children on this island are suffering neglect and abuse and our children need the protection of the law.</P>
    <P>Successive Fianna Fáil led Administrations have failed to tackle the problem of child sexual abuse. Comprehensive changes recommended in 1991 have not been acted upon and guidelines on child sexual abuse circulated in 1987 are now out of date as the official reported number of incidents of child abuse is just under 4,000 per year. Some areas of the country have shown a dramatic rise in the number of cases reported to health boards.  We need a system of public policy aimed at protecting our children and rehabilitating the victims by way of an education programme. Perhaps, most importantly society as well as statutory instruments need to change if we are to afford a sufficient scheme of welfare and safety for our young people.</P>
    <P>I regret having to bring my remarks to a conclusion.  On behalf of Fine Gael I wish to say to the Minister and the Government that they will have our full co-operation and assistance in enacting the positive recommendations in this report.  However, if the Minister or his colleagues fail to react we will, as we have done in the past, introduce Private Members' legislation and lead the Government screaming into the House, as Deputy Shatter has done on three occasion during the past two years.</P>

      <P>The tragic victim in the Kilkenny incest case and the many professionals with whom she came into contact are the victims of governmental neglect, ministerial incompetence and self-delusion, health board management <Col N="690" /> failures and political posing, some of which we have witnessed again this evening.</P>
      <P>The Kilkenny case should not be viewed in isolation but should be seen in the context of similar and related cases over the past decade and in the context of the failure by successive Ministers for Health in a variety of different Governments to take the action necessary to ensure the best protection possible is available to children at risk.</P>
      <P>This case should not be seen solely as a case of incest and sexual abuse.  That was merely one part of the horror that the victim had to live with.  It is also a case of brutal, physical violence inflicted by a parent on a child which resulted in the victim sustaining a large number of serious physical injuries including almost losing an eye.  It is, to use social work jargon, not only a case of sexual abuse but also a case of non-accidental injury.</P>
      <P>In January 1980 the Department of Health first published guidelines on the identification and management of non-accidental injury to children.  In 1982, two children died as a result of non-accidental injury.  One-year-old Patrick O'Brien of Clondalkin died in April 1981 and his father was sentenced to five years penal servitude.  Three-year-old Sandra Sutton died in December 1981 and her parents were imprisoned for manslaughter. Both children and their families had been brought to the attention of the Eastern Health Board and a report into their deaths to the then Minister for Health, Deputy Michael Woods, acknowledged that the professionals involved in the Eastern Health Board community care team did not initially work cohesively as a team with full communication of facts and co-ordination of efforts, and that &ldquo;the complex problems of the O'Brien family and its previous history should have demanded&rdquo; that they co-ordinated their approach earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report into the Sutton case exonerated the professionals involved but failed to refer to the fact that two months prior to the death of Sandra Sutton her parents were convicted of child neglect at Kilmainham District Court.  In his <Col N="691" /> response published in July of 1982, the Minister, Deputy Woods stated: &ldquo;It is vital that all professional staff dealing with the welfare of children should accept that they have a responsibility in this area and that they should develop a greater awareness of child abuse and of the family circumstances and personalities of the parents with whom they may be dealing&rdquo;. He also stated that it was his intention to provide greater protection for children at risk in a new Children Bill. He acknowledged the need for new guidelines relating to child abuse, which were ultimately published in February 1983.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods was replaced as Minister for Health by Deputy Barry Desmond who in 1985 introduced the long promised Children Bill.  This Bill was so ill-prepared and badly drafted that after a lengthy Second Stage debate it had to be withdrawn, never again to see the light day.</P>
    <P>In July 1987, the child abuse guidelines were updated.  Announcing their publication, the then Minister for Health, Deputy Rory O'Hanlon, stated that they were designed &ldquo;to ensure a systematic and sensitive approach to caring for the victims of abuse&rdquo; and that their &ldquo;main emphasis is on the exchange of information and co-ordination between the various professions and agencies working on individual cases to ensure a balanced, effective and consistent response from the statutory support services&rdquo;.  The Minister requested the health boards to review urgently their present procedures and services in dealing with child abuse in the light of the new guidelines and again promised the publication of a new Children Bill.  The Child Care Bill was finally published in 1988 and only completed its passage through the Oireachtas on 2 July 1991.</P>
    <P>The 1987 guidelines, like their predecessors, were grossly deficient in prescribing the legal measures available that could be used by health boards and social workers to obtain protection for a child at risk.  Whereas the protections provided by the Children Act of 1908 only <Col N="692" /> extended to children under the age of 16 years, additional protections were, and still are, available by way of legal intervention for children up to the age of 18 years by use of the Wards of Court jurisdiction of the Circuit and High Court where a child of 16 or 17 years was or is a victim of violence or sexual abuse.  No mention of this was made in the guidelines.</P>
    <P>This deficiency in the guidelines was drawn to the attention of Deputy Michael Woods, the then Minister for Health, by me in the Dáil on 4 May 1982.  By correspondence, in August 1987 this deficiency was also drawn to the attention of Deputy Rory O'Hanlon following publication by him as Minister for Health of the revised guidelines.  Despite this, at no time have the guidelines been corrected so as to ensure health boards and social workers can make similar use of this legal mechanism as was made of it by many English local authorities for many years to extend protection to children in circumstances where no such protection was provided for under their Children Acts.</P>
    <P>Why is any of this of relevance to the Kilkenny case?  It is of relevance because if the guidelines had been better drafted and if the professional personnel had better training and were made fully aware of all the legal mechanisms available to them, the abuse of the tragic victim in Kilkenny would have ceased earlier.</P>
    <P>Part of the remit of the McGuinness inquiry was to establish &ldquo;why action to halt the abuse was not taken earlier&rdquo;. One reason is, of course, that a majority of those who dealt with the victim were not in a position to know that she was being abused due to the explanations given by her and family members for injuries suffered by her.  That is, however, only part of the story.  Another reason was the extraordinary lack of co-ordination at health board level between the different professionals and their failure to act in accordance with the then departmental guidelines.  It seems from the report, however, that this failure is more the fault of the former Minister for Health, Deputy Woods, and the management of the South Eastern Health <Col N="693" /> Board than that of individual health board personnel.  Such failure does not only attach to Deputy Woods when Minister but also to each of his successors. This is clear from the report which acknowledges that &ldquo;even today, many professionals have little or no training in recognising the signs and symptoms of child abuse and that on the evidence they heard &ldquo;many of the professionals involved in [the Kilkenny victim's] care are even now unfamiliar with the 1987 Guidelines&rdquo;.  Some were unaware of their existence or had never seen them.  From this part of the report, it is clear that when the victim was still a child many of the professionals dealing with her were unaware of the departmental guidelines on child abuse despite contrary ministerial assurances given in this House in 1982.  Even more frightening it appears that in 1993 professionals working in this area are still unfamiliar with the revised 1987 guidelines.</P>
    <P>The report also documents that &ldquo;the social work services of the South Eastern Health Board have the care and protection of children under 16 as their absolute priority&rdquo; and in this context children over 16 were not seen as a priority. This is explained on the basis &ldquo;in part because the service was under resourced and overstretched, and in part, because social workers were aware they had statutory powers to protect children under 16 which were entirely lacking in the case of abused persons over 16 years of age.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The report confirms that in late 1982 early 1983 when the tragic victim had just attained her 17th birthday, she admitted to a social worker that her father was the father of her child and that she was a victim of incest.  It is clear from the report that the social worker at that stage was of the view that as she was over 16 years of age no social work intervention could take place and that despite assurances given in the Dáil on 4 May 1982 by the then Minister for Health, Deputy Woods, that he would ensure all persons dealing with children at risk were made aware of the possibility they could use the Wards of Court procedures to provide for protection for children, nothing was done <Col N="694" /> in this regard.  Clearly. if the Minister's Department had communicated this to health boards following the exchanges in the Dáil there would have been a very real possibility that the senior social worker to whom the Kilkenny victim in late 1982 early 1983 communicated that she was a victim of incest and violence would have invoked the Ward of Court jurisdiction to provide protection for her some ten years prior to the date of Garda intervention by Garda Reddy who was previously praised by members of this House.</P>
    <P>Catherine McGuinness S.C. deserves the congratulations of all of us in this House for the speed with which she and her team have completed their deliberations and published their report.  I fully support the recommendations contained in the report, most of which are not new, such as the proposal that the Constitution should be changed to fully and properly protect the rights of children. Ironically, the need for such a referendum was stated by me in the debate on the Bill introduced by Barry Desmond in June 1985.  My only quibble with the report is in its failure to make clear that until such times as the Minister brings into force the relevant sections of the Child Care Act, 1991, the Wards of Court jurisdiction is available to be used by all health boards to provide protection to children between the ages of 16 to 18 years.</P>
    <P>It is the Minister's response to this report that I find both extraordinary and appalling.  It is almost two years since the Child Care Bill was enacted by the Oireachtas and it is now five years since the Bill was first published.  From newspaper reports of last week's press conference and from the Minister's speech today one would think that immediate changes were being introduced.  In fact, what the Minister promised is that in a period of three and a half years he hopes to bring into operation the Child Care Act, and much play has been made by him of the expense involved.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Act provides new legislative measures to extend protection to children in emergencies.  It in effect <Col N="695" /> updates provisions already contained in the Children Act of 1908 and fills in some of the gaps left by that legislation.  Part IV of the Act details the circumstances in which a child can be taken into care or placed with foster parents or supervised in the home.  It also updates provisions already contained in the Children's Act of 1908 and fills in the gaps which can at present be filled by use of the Wards of Court jurisdiction.  Part V of the Act deals with the court jurisdiction and procedures applicable in child care cases. There is absolutely no reason whatsoever why all of the provisions of Parts III, IV and V of the Children's Act could not be immediately brought into operation.</P>
    <P>The Minister's successful public relations exercise last week in which he appeared to convince the media that something dramatic was happening was, in effect, a statement saying that if you are 16 or 17 years of age and being battered or sexually abused this Government is going to do nothing to protect you for another two or three years.  The Minister effectively said last week that if you are three, four, five, ten or 16 years of age and you are believed to be at risk in your family home of sexual or physical abuse this Government will wait for two or three years before putting in place a scheme to allow for a supervision order to be made.  You will be left in a position where you might be taken into care if you are sexually abused or assaulted, but no pre-emptive action will be taken.</P>

      <P>Moreover, by ignoring the wards of court power the Minister is ensuring that health boards will not utilise this jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's response in this House is little short of abysmal.  As someone who has addressed these issues here for over ten years and who brought to the notice of this House what was stated in the O'Brien and Sutton cases, when I read this report it filled me with outrage. <Col N="696" /> How many more children must be physically or sexually abused before essential training is provided to health board personnel and legislation already enacted brought into force?  How many more children will have to wait?  How many more times are we to suffer Ministers coming into this House expressing empty, meaningless words of regret and concern, but in reality doing nothing of substance to ensure that children are truly protected by our laws and social services?  How many more hollow words will we hear from this Minister when he is inevitably required to order another inquiry into yet another tragedy sometime in the not too distant future?</P>

      <P>We ought to have had more time to discuss this.  If we take the report of the Kilkenny incest investigation and put it beside the report of the Commission on the Status of Women with its 201 recommendations, it is an indictment of a value system which has informed decisions and policy in this country.</P>
      <P>The impact of this case on so many people has forced the issue of sexual abuse and violence within the home to the top of the national agenda.  This is welcome, as is the overall tenor of the report in highlighting the problems faced by the various individuals and groups dealing with this case.  There is a perception that in some ways this case is unusual, isolated in its severity and in the continuation of the abuse over a long period.  It is not.  Sadly, social workers, doctors, gardaí, health visitors and teachers regularly come in contact with cases equally as shocking as this case in their own way.  It is vital that we acknowledge and deal with the aftermath of the Kilkenny case and this report in a way which determines that shortfalls in services are dealt with and that resources are put in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not an isolated case and we cannot hide behind the silence of many women. The message has been clear for years as women have campaigned for rape crisis centres, refuges and better laws to deal with violence and access to support.  It <Col N="697" /> must be asked whether this case would have continued if there has been a nationwide support service in place ten years ago.  I believe not.  How many more cases are occurring behind closed doors while we cannot find the funds to establish such a system?  It is vital for the Minister to detail when the resources will be made available.</P>
    <P>We should learn from the experience of many commentators in the UK where there have been 40 child abuse inquiries over 18 years.  The commentators there take the view that the kinds of reactions embodied in those reports have had a very negative effect on professional morale and have created a climate in which defensive practice has become the norm rather than protecting the interests of children and parents.  We do not want to have dawn raids here taking children into care.  Neither do we need non-intervention. We must get a balance.  This report is not about identifying a few bad apples in a system that otherwise works well.  The whole system needs to be analysed.  This is a balanced report that puts it up to us to answer about our priorities and our value system.  It is clear that we need a Department of Health and Social Services and a system that supports professionals and others in doing their job effectively in the area of child protection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I pay tribute to the Minister for commissioning this report and to the former Senator McGuinness for producing the report so quickly.  The Kilkenny incest investigation report is horrific and chilling.  Anyone who has read it has been horrified by it.  It has many fine, worthy recommendations. The speed with which the Minister for Health and the Government as a whole have indicated a willingness to act on its findings and to provide over £30 million for their implementation is heartening and encouraging, but we cannot let the promise of future improvements in the health and welfare services and their capacity for effective intervention in child abuse cases could our judgment on the appalling failures of the existing public <Col N="698" /> services as revealed in this report, particularly since the same practices still exist.</P>
      <P>I have to conclude that this report unveils a scandalous level of incompetence bordering on negligence in the public services, notably by the South Eastern Health Board, and apparent inaction by the local gardaí, who on one occasion actually assisted the victim's violent father in tracking her down in a refuge in Dublin.  This report cries out for greater explanation than has been offered either in the text of the report or by the Minister here today or by any of the officials, including the chief executive officer of that health board.  There is an indecent haste for us to move on to the general and away from the specific.  We are being urged, for instance, to almost see this case as a learning point through which we can improve our laws and our capacity to deal with child abuse in the future.  The Minister has called it a milestone of social reform.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that he does not want to make a scapegoat of anybody. Neither do I; but this report, for all its fine, compassionate recommendations is a whitewash and a further betrayal of the unfortunate victim, whom we call Mary in the report.  It is not good enough in this day and age, in the wake of this legacy of incompetence and neglect by various South Eastern Health Board personnel and the local gardaí in the ten year period from 1982 to 1992, that nobody is being held accountable.  There is a failure to catch anyone's eye in the report, a similar evasion to that experienced by Mary over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why do we as a community invest all of our resources in the provision of such vital services as gardaí, social workers and public health nurses?  We do so to prevent the criminal and sustained abuse of children like Mary, or at least to ensure when they come to light that there is effective intervention to end it.  Yet we learn from this report that although Mary told social workers at the end of 1982 that there was violence and incest in her home, that her father was the father of her six month old baby, that he beat her, her mother and her younger sister and <Col N="699" /> that all of this was confirmed then and there by her mother, it was to be almost ten years before effective action was taken by the authorities to tackle her nightmare.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the fanfare of publicity with which the Minister announced the good news about future investment in childcare services last week &mdash; and that is all very welcome &mdash; has resulted, whether intentionally or otherwise, in the full brutal truth of the Kilkenny incest investigation not getting across to the general public.  I have no doubt that there are people who believe that here was a case of appalling child abuse that slipped through the net because the victim did not tell anybody or perhaps because the social services were so stretched that they could not reach her.  Neither supposition is correct.  Mary was disclosing her orderal whenever she had an opportunity over the ten year period.  She told social workers, public health nurses and doctors and nobody cried stop.  Probably busy, well intentioned professionals wrote up their case notes, although there were serious omissions in the recording of those notes.  They sought advice here and there, but nobody cried stop.  On page 64 of the report it says that on September 4, 1985, at a meeting of no fewer than five professionals &mdash; the local public health nurse, a senior public health nurse, an area social worker, an acting senior social worker and a senior area medical officer &mdash; discussed &ldquo;Mary's&rdquo; case.  What was their conclusion?  Surely we could have had effective action after that, but we only had more worthy aspirations.  The report tell us that these five professionals concluded:</P>
    <P>It is necessary to find truth of Mary's allegations against her father.  Get Garda to keep a watch if necessary and see for ourselves if someone is being battered.</P>
    <P>Inherent in this conclusion was an obvious disbelief of Mary and lethargy to act.  As far back as 1982 Mary had revealed that she was the victim of incestuous violence.  In all, as we now know, Mary <Col N="700" /> had no fewer than 115 contacts with the health services throughout the long nightmare of her life of violent abuse by her father.  Yet, over six years elapsed before effective action by Garda Agnes Reddy and her detective colleague brought effective intervention to help Mary and bring the physical aspects of the abuse to an end.</P>
    <P>I am driven to the conclusion, having read the report carefully, that for all its good recommendations it is no less a scandal than the decade of official incompetence and neglect which it reveals in the South Eastern Health Board.  The Minister says we must not seek scapegoats. What does he mean?  It is simply unreal and bizarre if nobody is held accountable for this extraordinary and appalling litany of official failure.</P>
    <P>Cian O Tiarnaigh of the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children is right in saying that claims that the report exonerates the professionals involved in this case are &ldquo;sick-making&rdquo;.  Dr. Joseph Robins, a former assistant secretary at the Department of Health is also right when he says it is &ldquo;clear that the misery suffered by this young woman, for so long, arises less from the lack of legal provisions and health board resources than from what appears to be gross indifference by far too many people in authority at the brutalisation of women and children&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Even today we see reports that measures to allow children who have been sexually abused to give evidence by video link are being challenged on the grounds that the rights of the accused might possibly be compromised.  Our jurisprudence as to the rights of children is undeveloped and pitched against children's rights is a mountain of jurisprudence to protect the accused.</P>
    <P>Dr. Robins also points out, for instance, that child abuse guidelines have been in existence for the health boards since 1977 and have been revised and updated occasionally.  The South Eastern Health Board, therefore, can hardly have been unaware of public policy in this area.</P>
    <P>The report is also deficient because of <Col N="701" /> the inexplicable decision not to interview the two banghardaí who eventually took effective action in this case.  Indeed, the only two people who took action were not invited to give evidence.  The report lamely tells us on page 79 that &ldquo;the investigation team were not given the opportunity to hear evidence from the gardaí actually involved in the case&rdquo;.  Why not? This is a disgraceful omission from the report, we are presented with bureaucratic packaging and expected to settle for Garda evidence from a deputy commissioner on general matters of principle and policy but not the specifics of the handling of this case.  I hope Garda Reddy is in the gallery today.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference of the inquiry team were twofold: to carry out an investigation, in so far as the health services are concerned, of the circumstances surrounding the case and, in particular, to establish why action to halt the abuse was not taken earlier and, second, to make recommendations.  The second part of the report has been delivered in sterling fashion while I welcome the recommendations which have been made which go beyond the provisions of the Child Care Act.</P>
    <P>As to the investigation, the report presents us with a disjointed audit of professional incompetence and inaction which borders on negligence.  Presented as they are, dispassionately, they still manage to paint a pattern of abuse and horror which is barely credible.  The Minister has asked us to be reasonable, to look forward and not back but I cannot be reasonable when I am furious.  Is it any wonder that the victim in this case said she is unhappy with the report?  She has every reason to be because her case seems to be impervious to justice.  Piled on the physical and sexual abuse by her father rests the incompetence of those who had statutory and professional responsibility for her safety.  This report exonerates all, offers the victim nothing.</P>
    <P>The Minister's plea for reason and for us to look forward constructively denies us the right to be furious.  Anger should be expressed about the shortcomings of those involved in the South-Eastern <Col N="702" /> Health Board.  It is unacceptable that she could have slipped through every net in the system.</P>
    <P>These bad practices, such as the failure to record properly conversations with her or to follow up on broken appointments and &mdash; worst of all &mdash; the failure to be pro-active in intervening when she had disclosed violent incest have been collectively excused as being understandable or the norm for that time in the context of &ldquo;prevailing community attitudes&rdquo; but the reality is that the same practices still apply in health boards right around the country.  This will not change today or tomorrow even with a promise to provide £30 million.</P>
    <P>I do not know how the Minister can be content with phasing in the new procedures as no amount of money will change bad professional practices if there is a denial, as there is in this report, that bad professional practices exist.  The Minister is being over-protective of the professionals involved and compromising his own position in the interests of maintaining harmonious industrial relations. Anger must be expressed at the fact that our professional health workers let us down.  It would be far better if we faced up to the fact that everybody concerned blew it.  Then at least we could start afresh and I would be glad to look towards the future.</P>
    <P>It has been mentioned that this report should provide us with a monumental precedent and a learning point, in terms of developing our child care policies in the future but up until tonight there was not even an apology to the woman involved.  I note that the Minister was contrite tonight, which is welcome, because the report moved from the individual to deal with the general issue.  This was unacceptable.  I do not know if the reluctance to accept responsibility masks a fear of litigation but I hope she will bring a case because we owe her a lot and she should be compensated for a great injustice.</P>
    <P>This report is not a serious analysis of bad practice which had a bottom line and a conclusion but rather a series of justifications, excuses and cover ups of <Col N="703" /> individuals which seek to exonerate the professionals instead of finding out why nobody acted.  We are talking about professional people trained in the field of child care protection.  As I said, guidelines have been in place since 1977 but these were not adhered to.  At every juncture there was slippage and the South-Eastern Health Board can hardly have been unaware of public policy in this area.  In 1985, the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Women's Rights presented a comprehensive report to the Government on this issue and I do not accept that in 1982 nobody knew about sexual abuse.</P>
    <P>It would be different if Mary has been taciturn and refused to talk.  As I said, she disclosed information over the place and time after time, in an unbelievable fashion, nobody took any action.  She disclosed information to general practitioners, a consultant and a public nurse. Garda Agnes Reddy and her detective colleagues were the first to take action and to take her claims seriously.</P>
    <P>Much play has been made of the fact in the report, in terms of exonerating the health services, that by the time the health board had formal disclosure of the incest and violence Mary was over 16 and, therefore, out of the ambit of the 1908 Act but this is not sustainable.  Following that vital disclosure in 1982 a social worker had a general discussion with the Garda but did not formally disclose the fact that incest had taken place. No case conference was held and no serious attempt was made to help either Mary or her 14 year old sister and her six month old baby who was on the &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; register and who could have been taken under the 1908 Act.  They failed to act in relation to the 14 year old child and the six month old baby and at all times Mary and her child could have been made wards of court.</P>
    <P>The involvement of the Garda in this case deserves another report.  The inquiry team points out that it was not within the sphere of their terms of reference to look into matters other than the health services but the inactivity of the Garda in <Col N="704" /> this case is remarkable.  On two occasions, as I said, they actively colluded with the father in bringing her back from where she had sought refuge from her violent father.</P>
    <P>The Garda has a long history of reluctance to become involved in domestic violence.  It has become masters of the blind eye.  This has to change.  I note that the Minister for Justice has committed herself to enhancing the responses of the Garda to incidents of domestic violence, particularly against women and children.  That is not before its time.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to examine the statistics, comparing the cases of alleged sexual abuse reported, the ultimate low level of cases taken by the Director of Public Prosecutions, and the even lower number of those who managed to bring a successful prosecution.  This aspect of the law must be examined immediately by the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>The McKeown report is referred to in the report of this investigation in relation to prosecutions taken within the Eastern Health Board area in 1988.  We note that the total number of cases reported to the relevant health board was 990; those referred by the health board to the Garda numbered 507; the number referred by the Garda to the Director of Public Prosecutions was 162 &mdash; one will note the numbers diminishing all the time &mdash; the number of decisions taken to prosecute was 55 and the number of cases in which the defendent was found guilty was 38. Only 38 defendants were found guilty out of the total of 990 cases reported to the Eastern Health Board.  There appears to be a culture among the Garda that there is little point in initiating prosecutions because they are difficult to prove, so they take a non-interventionist approach. I think the Minister for Justice has accepted that we need greater numbers of women in our Garda force.  Violence against women must be looked at within the broader context of women being victims in a patriarchal society.  There has been much comment on that.</P>
    <P>I agree with the emphasis in the report on the need for more refugees around the country.  The refuges in Dublin, at <Col N="705" /> first and second stage, are constantly full. Of course, there is a latent need obtaining for refuges which is not even articulated; in other words for women who would leave violent homes if they had a place to go.  The overall question of violence against women and incest is only beginning to be articulated by women. Women's secrets in this overall area must be told if we are to put in place protections for them and endeavour to change the cycle of family violence. There are many women who remain silent.  Here I might refer to women within the travelling community.  I believe they have not told their story at all to date.  We must be prepared not only to listen to their story but facilitate its telling.</P>
    <P>The report contains an excellent recommendation that we should move on to consider a constitutional amendment to enshrine the individual rights of children which will take precedence over the conflicting rights of the family, stipulated in the Constitution to be antecedent to all positive law.  Much of the reluctance to intervene in family violence over the years has been linked to a distinct discomfort on the part of Irish people to intervene in the integrity of the family based on marriage.  Such reluctance has allowed circumstances to arise in which violent males have inflicted torture and abuse on their wives and children over many years during which nobody saw fit to intervene.  Irish society, the Church and the State has had an obsessive interest in the rights of children so long as they are unborn but, once born, they take a hands-off approach, leaving the style, content and substance of the child's life, in the main, to the vagaries of the family unit.</P>
    <P>This subject is of particular relevance to the travelling community.  We are all in favour of recognising the rights of minorities, including the travelling community, their right to a folk way of life that is not part of the settled community. We must provide mobile support services immediately to supervise the health and care of infants and children of travellers. <Col N="706" /> Their ill health is well documented and demands a specific targeted response.</P>
    <P>It is my belief that teachers also are in the front line when it comes to the early detection of sexual abuse against children. They too must be protected if they are to assume a wider welfare role since for a part of the day they are <i>in loco parentis</i> and are ideally placed to note early signs.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister is aware of a case in the midlands where a teacher was proactive in reporting her suspicion of physical abuse of a pre-school child in her care.  For her efforts that teacher was intimidated by the child's father who arranged a boycott of the school, which was ultimately closed for lack of numbers. In that instance, other children of the same family were already in care. Despite that <i>prima facie</i> justification of her suspicions, the teacher was isolated and a prejudicial report was submitted to the Department of Education which cast aspersions on her professional integrity as a teacher.  As recently as the twelfth of this month the Minister said he was quite satisfied that that teacher's experience was properly handled by the relevant health board.  The Minister is getting into the habit of being quite satisfied with the activities of health boards. For example, in the Kelly Fitzgerald case the Minister was reluctant to apportion accountability.  In the Kilkenny case, depite the publication of a report which he himself commissioned to investigate why action was not taken earlier by the health board he is adopting a similar over-protective stance of the personnel involved.  Why is the Minister allowing his ministerial interest in industrial relations to compromise the need for justice in the case of this woman, who has become known to all of us as Mary?</P>
    <P>I would be the first to commend the Minister and the Government on agreeing to make the necessary resources available for the implementation of the provisions of the Child Care Act, 1991. Would the Minister issue guidelines immediately for the improved practice of our professionals nationwide within the <Col N="707" /> various health boards?  It is not sufficient to put it on the long finger.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister whether the Government has any plans to compensate this woman for the terrible tragedy that befell her, for the fact that, no matter what she did, our system of justice did not respond to her plight.  She was abused by her father and the authorities did not respond to her needs.  She was then meted out injustice at the hands of the court, her father having received a light sentence which cannot be appealed. We learn that the provisions of the legislation cannot be applied retrospectively to that case.</P>
    <P>The report exonerates everyone.  This is not good enough.  The woman concerned is left asking what has gone wrong, as though she were impervious to justice.  This State owes that woman a lot. She should be compensated and should not have to plough a furrow through the courts to gain justice, as many others have had to do when they have been gravely wronged.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister, in replying, will give the House some indication of his intentions to make good the injustice meted out to her and to help her.  I believe she is living in poverty.  It is unacceptable that this woman, who has been a victim of injustice all her life, ultimately a victim of our inadequate resources, could not be offerred a new life in same way, with a decent place to live.  I hope the Minister will respond and confirm that she will be offered at least that.</P>

      <P>This report is indeed a welcome document.  For those of us who have worked for many years to combat abuse and violence it has been a long wait.  The report is also a terrible indictment of our services, in that a young girl was brutalised and abused for 16 years while professional people were aware of <Col N="708" /> the incest of which she was the subject. The local community must have been aware of the violence that was being meted out to her.  Yet for many years, indeed until her life was threatened, nobody intervened to put an end to her agony.</P>
      <P>Before rushing to judgment let us remember that they are not the social workers, doctors or Garda who are on trial here.  Rather they are the politicians, in particular those who participated in Government over the years, people who had the power to do something and yet did nothing despite the clear warnings on the part of many professional and voluntary bodies who pointed out repeatedly that the legal framework was wrong, that the necessary supports were not in place, that the services simply could not cope.  Our warnings fell on deaf ears. Those politicians &mdash; in particular I might mention the Progressive Democrats who have an ideological commitment to cutbacks in public services &mdash; would do well to examine their own consciences before shooting off their mouths.  During the lifetime of the Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrat Coalition Government, in particular, no attempt was made to face up to the needs of the abused despite the enormous increase in demand.  That period was characterised by a systematic downgrading of social services and an abject failure to recognise, let alone tackle, the problems of abuse and violence. I would take a lot more seriously protestations from the Progressive Democrats were it not for their record.</P>
      <P>I was elected and entered this House after many years of working with battered women.  My experience of setting up a refuge in County Wicklow taught me a great deal about male violence and abuse.  All women are entitled to the fundamental civil right of being safe in their homes, not a right we have yet secured.  The reality of abuse and violence is only now being recognised although thousands of Irish women and children have lived with it for generations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conspiracy of silence surrounding it derives from society's attitude to the <Col N="709" /> family, an archaic attitude underpinned by an archaic Constitution.  It also comes from a tradition which made women and children subservient to men.  I have no doubt that even today if it had not been for the Kilkenny case there would have been no real effort to confront the problem. Unlike Freud we, as a society, recognise that abuse exists but, equally, we have not confronted it.  I can give a simple example: last night as I sat writing this speech there was a knock on the door, a woman who is abused and battered by a very violent man of whom she is terrified calls on me.  The system does not allow her to escape from this situation or even to get relief from it.  I know every detail of her story.  Because I cannot help her does that mean I am guilty of neglect? I resent that idea.  The type of violence she is experiencing is not unique to Kilkenny, it is in every parish, townland and suburb and we should face up to it. It is not a question of dealing with one case but with every case.</P>
    <P>If the judge had handed down a heavier sentence in the Kilkenny case it would have received nothing more than a few headlines.  The critical factor was that the victim spoke out, which created an overwhelming public demand for action. This report is an appropriate response to the anger and anguish which people expressed.  It sets the parameters for change and puts the onus on the Government to tackle violence and abuse once and for all.  If the Government proves up to the job many women and children will have cause to be grateful to the victim of the Kilkenny case.</P>
    <P>I have criticisms of the report and the way it is being handled, nevertheless it is a significant document.  It defines a strategy which rightly encompasses three Departments, Health, Education and Justice. I regret that only one of the relevant Ministers is here &mdash; the Minister for Education and Justice are not &mdash; to underline the importance of what we are discussing, violence, abuse and brutality against women and children.  Only one Minister of the three is present, yet it is not solely within the remit of the Minister for Health to deal with this problem.  The <Col N="710" /> Department of Justice has a vital role in relation to changes in the law and in the Constitution.  The Minister's only response so far has been to increase the penalties for incest and indeed that item was not referred to in the report. She certainly showed a great deal of interest in the case at the time, before she went to Australia and I would like to see her dealing with all the factors relating to law reform and the Constitution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has already taken enough of my time.</P>
      <P>The first priority must be the implementation of the Child Care Act and we all agree that we are far too slow in implementing its provisions.  The task force was set up in 1974 and it is now time that we implemented its recommendations quickly.  I am not happy with the idea that it has taken almost four years to implement this Act.  Women come to me daily looking for help and I am not able to provide it.  I run a women's refuge which is packed to the doors.  It is not a very pleasant place in which to be but a queue of people are trying to get into it to be safe.  If a market development fund of £50 million can be made available overnight we should be able to find £40 million to deal with this problem. However, the will is not there to provide it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should consider taking a different approach to the implementation of the Child Care Act.  I suggest a simple and logical approach that cuts through the complexities, indeed this view is being expressed by a growing body of opinion. The perpetrator, not the victim, should be removed from the home where there is suspected abuse.  Why should the victim suffer because of a crime committed against him or her?  If there are grounds for reasonable suspicion of incest or violence it would be much less traumatic for the victim and much more human to remove the suspect, the grown man rather than the child.  Even in the best managed arrangements, removing the <Col N="711" /> victim from the home means that the victim is either punished or feels punished by that experience, and loses the right to be at home.  It is certainly preferable for women and children to come to a refuge rather than remaining at home in a climate of violence, but it is not the best option.  It is very hard to move into a refuge.  It is an unpleasant place filled with other people who are equally traumatised by their experiences. Very often it is under-staffed and overcrowded.  I do not believe it is necessary any longer to think in terms of providing women's refuges, instead we should provide refuges for the men and allow the family unit to stay at home in control of their own lives.</P>
    <P>What is missing from the debate is a lack of understanding of what happens in a violent home, we are punishing the innocent by ensuring that the man is not taken from the home.  We should devise ways of taking him out.  I am sure there is a risk and people will always jump up and ask about the innocent man.  Even with the best will in the world I accept mistakes will be made but this would happen very rarely.  Let us remember that the child is always innocent and that the man is often guilty of the most appalling brutality. If we keep that as a marker we may bring common-sense to bear on this debate.  It is a matter of getting away from being adult centred and becoming genuinely child centred.  At present barring orders fail as many families as they assist.  They apply only to married couples.  Presumably the Minister for Justice has it in her power to deal with the problem quickly.  Many family units comprise a cohabitating couple and this should be addressed.  We should also consider the case of the mother who is battered by her son &mdash; indeed we have not even considered this phenomenon &mdash; or grandmothers who may be attacked by grandchildren.  Every form of violence exists in the traditional Irish family and we should not ignore any of it when dealing with the question of incest and violence.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice has also another <Col N="712" /> area of responsibility &mdash; I wish she was here to answer &mdash; the treatment of offenders.  Why is there no treatment for those found guilty of incest?  Increasingly &mdash; because more offenders are going to jail &mdash; the perpetrator is not being put in the position of confronting his crime and he may well come out as bad as when he went in.  When we discussed the Incest Bill I raised a point with the Minister of State about ensuring there is some type of protection order for a victim when the offender comes out of jail.  The Minister of State did not seem to grasp what I was talking about or to envisage the possibility that the offender would harass his victim.  Since that debate an offender in prison has been able to terrorise his daughter.  The Minister for Justice has a very strong case to answer on her attitude to this problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education should also be present and I am sorry she is not.  She has a crucial role to play.  The Minister for Health said that the community has a responsibility to deal with this issue and I agree with him.  Where is the Government? Where are the Members who can bring about the badly needed changes? The &ldquo;stay safe programme&rdquo; was not instituted by the Department of Education but was brought in because private individuals understood how important it was.  The Department of Education has never faced up to the question of sex education in schools or to protecting children from abuse.  Frequently I address school children on the areas of violence, although I have no expertise in teaching. Teachers are so conscious of making children alert to the dangers that they are willing to take that responsibility but guidance from the Department is missing.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education has a direct responsibility.  She should never forget that the victim in the Kilkenny case did not know or understand the simple biological functions of her own body until a nurse in the hospital told her, after she had her first child.  This was a girl who had gone through our national school system and into second level and she still did not know the basic facts of life, even <Col N="713" /> though at that stage she had been abused for six years.</P>
    <P>I commend the team for having produced this document so quickly.  They did a good job and their recommendations are important.  It deals with the structural failings in the system and it does not take the easy option.  The easy option would have been to go for a scapegoat saying, &ldquo;We will box this in, this is an individual case, we will get at the professionals&rdquo;.  I have no doubt the professionals were not able to cope with the problem &mdash; they are not super human.  The Tory approach would have been to screw the professionals and ignore the reality of the huge numbers who are getting no support, no help, no protection from the system.  The Minister has a tremendously heavy responsibility in this regard.  If he does not live up to the challenge of this report, he too will be indicted for it.</P>
    <P>The record is atrocious.  The girl in question had 100 contacts with various parts of the health services who were not able to respond to the signals she was giving.  Sometimes the professionals were not even aware of the guidelines that had been issued.  The medical services were all over the place.  The people who were aware were probably hamstrung by legal inadequacies or else were overcome with the question of the taboo in relation to incest.  This is a genuine thing.  It is very easy for us to talk about incest now because it has been brought into the light. How many people were brave enough to speak about it in the days when nobody did so?  It is so easy to judge.  It is much harder to tackle this problem in a way that is fair and just.</P>
    <P>It would have been fair to bring Garda Reddy into the team to hear her story. She has a story to tell and we need to know it.  I want an answer as to why she was not there.  She had a right to be there. There was no problem in bringing her in when the Garda needed her expertise and her particular way of extracting information in order to make the case stick. Why then did they abandon her?  We certainly need to know what her position was.</P>
    <P>The recommendations suggest the provisions <Col N="714" /> of video cameras and play therapists for the health boards.  In my health board region a person in south Wicklow who has been abused and needs treatment will find the nearest point of contact is Crumlin Hospital, which is in a different county and a considerable distance away.  There is no bus service from Tinahely, Shillelagh and south Wicklow generally. Even if you get a taxi or a lift you can be waiting months to get treatment. We are a long way off the play therapists. If the waiting list could be reduced the people who need treatment would be grateful.</P>
    <P>The health centre in my own area, the eighth biggest town in Ireland, does not have an interview room, it barely has chairs for people to sit on, it does not have a receptionist two days a week and the answering machine is broken.  How does a victim of abuse cope with that system?  Most people would be happy enough without the play therapist if we had a facility to meet a social worker, who does not have to jump up every ten minutes to answer the phone which a receptionist should answer.  That is simple and it would be a start.  The first thing the Minister for Health should tackle is the deplorable state of many of our health centres.</P>
    <P>Another grave omission is that the report failed to see the victim as part of the jigsaw in solving the problem &mdash; I do not mean this particular victim but the victim as opposed to the professional. In the North many of the refuges have battered women on their management boards.  That is a very sound principle. The danger about this report is that it is seen continually through the perspective of the professional &mdash; the doctor, the social worker, the administrator.  It is a very old-fashioned Fabian approach.  We need to ensure that the people who have been abused participate in finding the resolution to this problem.  They have something to offer that we should recognise. If we are assessing progress we should include them.  The more we enable victims of abuse to speak, the better chance we have of ensuring that more victims will speak.  Having read the <Col N="715" /> book on this victim it is clear that in many instances she was not able to speak or she said things in such a way that she was unable to make herself clear.  That was enforced silence because of terror, shame and conflicting emotions.  We should not underestimate the complexity of the emotions that often ensure that a victim will not speak.  One way to overcome that is to include the victim as part of the team so that progress can be made.</P>
    <P>This report demands a response from the Minister for Health.  We have heard some of the commitments.  The Minister must face up to certain key points.  The first is the fact that children will be punished unless the man is taken out of the house rather than the victims of the man's abuse.  The Minister must deal with providing resources for statutory bodies and voluntary groups.  He must bring in an effective legal framework.  He must introduce training &mdash; this is critical &mdash; particularly for the gardaí but also for medics and nurses and he must also ensure that the rights of children can be established under the Irish Constitution.  Finally, he must give a voice to those who have been terrified into silence.  If he fails to do all these things he too will be indicted.  He has made a promise and I will make another one.  I am committed to full reform and nothing else will satisfy me.  It will not satify me and it will not satisfy the abused who have been betrayed over the years.  As a member of the Opposition I promise the Minister and his Cabinet that I will hound and harry them until there is full reform.</P>

      <P>I welcome this report on behalf of the Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, and particularly on behalf of the equality group and the women's group in the party who are dealing all too often with cases such as the Kilkenny incest case.  It is a specific case but it would be an injustice to the work of the team and the victim if we did not deal with its general implications and learn from the mistakes of the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are dealing with a general social illness, not just incest, where the weak <Col N="716" /> and those who are unable to defend themselves are open to exploitation.  To date in this State the family has enjoy a hallowed position, and rightly so. However, it is certainly not infallible and that has been recognised in this report. There is a need for more safeguards and resources to counteract the negative attitude and the exploitation in society which is destroying family life.</P>
    <P>In the short time available to me I would like to deal with expenditure and resources as they relate to incest.  The Minister has said that funding will be made available to deal with this problem. Is he prepared to give a commitment as to where the money will be spent?  Some of the shortcomings in funding are indeed appalling.  For example, Women's Aid has received no funding for the past two years and they are dealing with problems like this all the time, whereas, the Catholic Marriage Advisory Council has received £40,000.  Here is an example of Government quite rightly encouraging good marriages but not recognising the problems that can arise.  Women's Aid, without help, have set up a training programme with one of the city hospitals to recognise signs of abuse and how to deal with it.</P>
    <P>There are associated aspects.  For instance, will money be made available for research into violence against the mothers of incest victims?  In 45 per cent of cases of incest there will be violence against the mother as well.  If women are protected, children will be protected.</P>
    <P>There has been a failure so far to recognise the effects on children who have witnessed abuse in the home and there is an urgent need to deal with this indirect abuse, given that we are now learning increasingly that abuse breeds abuse and violence creates violence.</P>
    <P>Will money be made available for a training programme for professionals in general to enable them to recognise abuse at an early stage?  The finger is being pointed at authorities here all the time, and blame is warranted, but it is certainly not enough.  There has been a failure by successive Governments to recognise rape and abuse in the home.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="717" /> Although there has been some recognition of rape outside the home, within it it is being largely ignored.  Unless action is taken in all of this area, we are wasting our time here.  Children should be made aware that nobody, even a family member, has a right to do to them anything that could come under the heading of sexual abuse.  I have worked as a teacher and I welcome the stay safe programme. It is a hopeful sign, but it will be no good if merely left on the shelf. Teachers do need that kind of backup.  I would reiterate what Deputy McManus said, that it is a pity the Minister for Education is not here to answer some of those points.  Society has a responsibility to protect its members.</P>
    <P>Let me conclude by reiterating what I said before because it is basic to what we are discussing: the Minister says funding will be made available to deal with the problem, but can he make a commitment here as to where that money will be spent?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to comment on some aspects of the debate. First I welcome the recommendation in the report for the extension of barring orders to all cases of domestic violence. This is a critical recommendation for many women and for many families. Second, I hope that following that recommendation there will be proposals which will essentially allow the victims to stay at home.  That will have two effects &mdash; it will decrease the number of women who need to resort to refuges and will give women in particular far more confidence in coming forward and highlighting abuse.  Those proposals are under active consideration on an interdepartmental basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to matters of education, the Department of Social Welfare, as I am sure Deputies are aware, has a very broad scheme of funding for locally based women's groups and I am pleased to say that at the Department I am actively encouraging such locally based women's groups to include in their programmes of personal development and education the <Col N="718" /> areas of sexuality, violence and abuse. What we need is a climate created right throughout the community where there is a confidence about reporting cases of sexual abuse or violence.  As many Deputies here will know there still exists fear among neighbours about the consequences of reporting such cases.  It is not just education at school level which is required through the formal education system.  A great deal of work and education can be done through women's groups and women's organisations because they can deal with this in a sensitive manner.</P>

      <P>First I want to thank all Deputies who contributed to this debate.  I have taken careful note of all the points made.  I am disappointed at some of the criticisms which have been levelled both at the report and at the response to the report that I have outlined to the House on behalf of the Government.</P>
      <P>The first thing I want to say is in relation to the timescale for implementing the Child Care Act and the criticisms levelled particularly from the Fine Gael benches in relation to that.  It must be said that because of the scale and complexity of the Act it was already recognised that it would be implemented on a phased basis.  I was a member of the special committee which processed this Bill through the House.  It was an excellent committee and all members understood that this particular legislation would require substantial increases in spending and would be implemented on a piece by piece basis.  That was debated and understood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I came into office as Minister for Health, just four months ago, I found that the process of implementing the Act had come to a standstill due to lack of funding for the necessary developments <Col N="719" /> and the lack of staff within the Department to prepare the necessary regulations, guidelines etc.  There are some Deputies on the opposite benches who share the responsibility for that.</P>
    <P>I have tackled both of those problems and cleared the way for the implementation of the Child Care Act to be resumed and accelerated.  The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> contained a commitment to implement the Act by 1997 and that was accepted and voted on by many parties in this House.  I now intend to accelerate the processing of the Act&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>They voted against it for different reasons.  The Act will be implemented by the end of 1996.  The new provisions in relation to child abuse will be fully implemented by 1995, about 18 months from now, and not the three years mentioned by Deputy Shatter.  I have accepted the best advice available to me that the necessary staff, services and facilities cannot be put in place at an earlier date.</P>
      <P>There is a number of reasons this leadin time is necessary.  The first is that all current child care services are under resourced and it is essential that they be built up and expanded in line with additional duties and responsibilities placed on them.  It would be irresponsible to devolve new duties and responsibilities on them without putting the necessary resources in place.  The implementation of the Act will require the recruitment of several hundred additional staff, many of them highly qualified and specialised. Recruitment of such staff will take time. There is a need, too, to build, equip and maintain new residential facilities.  Again that will take time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much emphasis has been placed on training, and there is a need to train the staff to resource implementation of the Act.  That will take place but cannot be rushed.  For all those reasons the time frame I have outlined is the quickest possible <Col N="720" /> and that is accepted by many people I have spoken to, people who are professionals in the area and who have been concerned about this problem for some time.</P>
    <P>In the one minute I have left I want to deal with the other major contention coming from the Opposition side and that relates to why, in her report, the finger has not been pointed at anyone. My approach in establishing this committee was to examine what happened in this case with a view to seeing what lessons could be learned and what improvements could be put in place.  If the team had been asked to find a scapegoat within the health services it would have been necessary to establish a very different type of investigation, probably a statutory tribunal along the lines of the beef tribunal which could have crossed-examined under oath, which could have called every witness, every health board worker with their union representative, with senior counsel and so on and which would probably take years to arrive at the facts of the case.  I do not believe we would have got as comprehensive an analysis of what happened or as clear a set of recommendations if we had waited another year for that type of approach.  I am delighted with the work done by the committee of inquiry.  On behalf of the Government I have accepted its recommendations and I will proceed at full speed to implement them.  I thank my Government colleagues for giving me the resources to do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity of moving this motion on behalf of Fine Gael in the hope that those in our community with mental handicap are given the proper political focus they deserve.  It is some time since the House debated the services available for the mentally handicapped, a group that has been almost forgotten by successive Governments during the past seven years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that these people are little better than totally abandoned is underlined by the confusion relating to numbers of persons within the State suffering from a mental handicap.  We as a society are not even sure of the numbers of people in our community suffering from mental handicap.  The last census of <Col N="722" /> people with mental handicap was carried out in 1981 and indicated a population of 23,000.  The Department now reckons this figure to be in excess of 25,000.  There seems to be a difficulty in evaluating and qualifying the numbers involved and it is impossible for any problem to be tackled in a comprehensive manner while we do not even know the numbers of people with whom we are dealing.  In this regard it is of extreme importance that an information system be set in place which will co-ordinate and liaise between the Department of Health and the many voluntary and statutory agencies, which provide a service for people with a mental handicap so that up to date knowledge and information is at the ready at all times.</P>
    <P>It is estimated at present that of those 25,000 people, there may be up to 3,000 without a proper level of service.  This figure I understand was recently queried by the Department of Health which officially estimates the figure to be half of this.  It must be acknowledged, however, that the numbers are increasing by virtue of the fact that people with intellectual disability are now living longer than was heretofore the case.  For example, a moderately intellectually impaired Down's Syndrome sufferer 20 years ago would live on average up to the age of approximately 25 years.  Such people are now living well into their fifties.</P>
    <P>There are a number of serious emergencies that need the immediate attention of the Minister for Health if he is to engage in any serious effort to tackle the problem.  To date, we have heard little more than lip service from the Minister and his statement of an extra cash allocation following this year's budget needs to be examined in some detail.  During the past number of weeks the Minister, accompanied by a heavily powered public relations team of advisers and minders, has succeeded in creating an impression that the extra funding made available would ease the crisis in the mental handicap area.  Sadly, the reality is far from this and the Minister is either insincere or unaware of the facts.  It is my contention &mdash; I will give him the benefit of <Col N="723" /> the doubt &mdash; that he is totally unaware of the extent of the urgency of the problem.</P>
    <P>We need to accept not only the need for a five year plan, but that there exist throughout the country emergencies that need immediate attention.  Is the Minister aware of the total absence of child community services in some areas?  Is he aware of the ineffectiveness of expert assessment teams that can quantify the extent of suffering of people with mental handicap?  Is he aware of the fact that in many hospitals, adults are blocking child beds, leaving children with no residential services?</P>
    <P>In short there are three strands to the problem that must be addressed by the Minister.  The first relates to those with a mental handicap living in psychiatric hospitals.  Some 1,550 people fall into this category, many of whom are there because there is no alternative source of care available to them.  As a society we appear to have confused people with mental handicap needing psychiatric treatment and those who do not.  It is estimated that many of those 1,550 should be transferred to the community-based service.  This transfer can only take place if facilitated by expanding considerably the community-based mental handicap services.</P>
    <P>We all accept the need to switch from institutions to community care, but the question must be answered as to what will happen to the 400 full time clients of, say Portrane, an institution recently under the spotlight for all the wrong reasons.  A detailed inquiry, while failing to establish proof of certain allegations of a very serious nature, nevertheless pointed to a series of general abuses of patients which must not be taken lightly. Morale among the staff of St. Ita's is at an all time low and the problem for them is one of lack of resources and the need to increase funding and improve the general physical structure of the hospital.  While I agree that it is inappropriate to admit persons with mental handicap to psychiatric hospitals unless psychiatric treatment must be administered, the stark reality remains that many of the mentally <Col N="724" /> handicapped in our institutions are deeply disturbed requiring treatment in a secure, closed environment where they will receive appropriate care, which I doubt is the case at present.  The incoherent and unco-ordinated manner of reporting by the inspectorate of mental hospitals leaves much to be desired and is a matter to which the Minister must turn his attention very soon.</P>
    <P>In the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> in 1991, considerable emphasis was placed on the development of community-based health services.  This made specific reference to those with mental handicap, but, unfortunately, both the letter and spirit of what was contained in the programme has been totally abandoned by the Minister and his predecessor.  It should be pointed out that his Fianna Fáil predecessors since the signing of the programme fared no better.</P>
    <P>A second category of mentally handicapped people who need attention are those living with elderly parents.  Such parents quite rightly fear for the future of their children as they are no longer able to provide the level of physical care and attention of earlier years.  In many cases parents of people with a mental handicap have become extremely distressed and depressed as they wonder about the future of their children without them.  The absence of a national programme to address the accommodation needs of people with mental handicap has produced an ever increasing number of people in severe difficulties.  An agreed number of places must be provided for each region to lessen the burden of care on ageing parents in the community.</P>
    <P>The third matter mentioned in the motion relates to ongoing training and work opportunities.  This area has been seriously hit by changes in the funding under the European Social Fund.  We have had no response from any Minister on the change in funding that will place people caring for those with mental handicap at a disadvantage.  Many people with mental handicap had an opportunity of attending training programmes of some substance linked to European funds.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="725" /> However, programmes which received funds from the European social funds have a fixed training period and trainees on completing the programme have very little in terms of opportunity for work, sheltered or otherwise.</P>
    <P>There is a need for long term training and employment placements of a type we have not seen to date.  Such is the trauma and anxiety of carers, parents and guardians of those with a mental handicap that specific case summaries must be provided. Of the large list of case summaries available I will select five to illustrate the need for the Government to take this matter seriously.</P>
    <P>The first is a 23 year old mildly mentally handicapped, manic depressive man, with gross obsessional traits.  His 74 year old mother lives in constant fear as her son refuses to attend any service and has assaulted her on a number of occasions. As a result of one assault at Christmas the son was remanded to the Central Mental Hospital, Dundrum, and is now in St. Ita's on a temporary order.  He needs a secure ongoing residential placement.</P>
    <P>The second case relates to an eight year old moderately mildly handicapped boy. He was dismissed from Scoil Eoin in November 1992 and is being looked after by his 61 year old father as his mother has left the home.  He presents behavioural problems and, combined with his father's inability to cope, is in urgent need of placement.  He has been refused a place in Stewart's, St. Augustine's, St Raphael's and St. Mary's due to his unsuitability for these services.</P>
    <P>The third case relates to a severely handicapped 11 year old boy with epilepsy and physical handicap who is unable to feed or take care of himself. He is currently in Madonna House and in need of urgent placement.</P>
    <P>The fourth case relates to a nine year old boy functioning in low mild mental handicap range who comes from an unstructured family setting.  He is out of school and has appeared before the courts. Several school placements have been sought but none has materialised.  This boy needs a structured setting and an urgent school placement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="726" /> The fifth case relates to 23 year old twin girls with mild mental handicap and speech defects.  Their mother is unwell with diabetes.  The girls have assaulted the mother and other family members. They are at risk sexually from a local man and the gardaí are in regular contact with the Eastern Health Board <i>vis-à-vis</i> this serious issue.  There is no residential place available for these girls.</P>
    <P>The position is so serious that I could spend the entire debate referring to case studies submitted to the various health boards.</P>
    <P>There is a crisis in the residential services available in the Eastern Health Board area with over 1,000 people on a waiting list for residential and day care service.  In the mid-western area there are almost 400 people without a service as the latest estimate for numbers of places in both day care and residential centres amounts to almost 3,000.  It is estimated that an extra £22 million is needed in the Eastern Health Board region alone to meet the needs of that area.  The Minister will acknowledge that he provided an extra £8 million in the budget to cover the entire country.</P>
    <P>There exists, however, a certain amount of confusion and uncertainty as to the manner in which these funds are allocated.  The Minister provided £8 million on top of the £6 million making a total of £14 million.</P>
    <P>The widely respected &ldquo;Needs and Ability&rdquo; report of 1990 presented a frank and stark picture of the type of funding necessary to provide a reasonable level of service for those intellectually impaired.  It sought funds to the order of £50 million over a five year period or £10 million per year.  This was extended and agreed in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> where the figure was revised, extending the period from five to seven years with an average of £7 million to be spent per year.</P>
    <P>The reality is somewhat different.  In fact the allocation was shameful when compared to the express promise in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, signed by all the social partners as a blueprint for Government action and <Col N="727" /> hailed as the consensus document of the decade.  What happened bears noting.  In 1990 the total of £1 million was allocated, in 1991 this was doubled to £2 million and in 1992 £6 million was allocated.  This total was £9 million where £21 million was promised which is less than 50 per cent of the express commitment given. This year the allocation after four years will exceed £22 million total, while the agreement provides for £30 million at this year's stage.  Is this a commitment of which we can feel proud?  Speaking of promises and making specific reference to broken promises.  I would like to take this opportunity of quoting for the benefit of the House, a document in my possession entitled &ldquo;Trust into Politics &mdash; The Labour Party,&rdquo; with which I am sure Deputy Ferris is familiar and he may have contributed to it.  This is a rather lengthy document and for the purposes of the debate I will be brief.  It states:</P>
    <P>Trust has been shattered in the last few years in different ways.  The era of scandals has led to a demand for better and more open Government.  The era of broken promises has opened up a mandate for more honest Government. And the era of run-down essential services has created a crying need for more effective, and more socially just Government.</P>
    <P>This document is aimed at addressing those needs....</P>
    <P>We believe that responsibility goes hand in hand with partnership &mdash; and that this is the reason the politics of partnership can bring a new energy to our community and a new level of trust to our politics.</P>
    <P>This document is signed by Dick Spring, Leader of the Labour Party and now Tánaiste.</P>
    <P>The first page of the document states:</P>
    <P>That Labour's proposals include the provision of £25 million next year and &ldquo;catching up&rdquo; on the &ldquo;Needs and Abilities&rdquo; Report prepared by the last Government and effectively shelved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no date on it but it was produced in November 1992, not that long ago.  We had no budget at that time.  The amount allocated by the Minister is, as he will readily admit, considerably short of this sum and financing is now substantially behind the £50 million target for the four-year period 1990-94. The Labour Party stands accused of outright cynicism and political manipulation of a disadvantaged group on this matter.  The thousands of carers for those in the community with a mentally handicap have been cynically abused by the Labour Party who is guilty of a monumental breach of trust in this instance.</P>
      <P>Recently in the course of a Seanad debate, the Minister stated that from the information currently available within the various health boards, there is a need for about 1,300 residential places and 1,400 day places for about 2,200 people in need of such treatment.  In addition, he spoke on the need to expand an early intervention service to develop the potential of every child, to improve services for those with mental handicap still resident in psychiatric hospitals and to provide for the special needs of disturbed patients.  The increased allocation for this year will allow a mere 70 residential places to be provided and only 200 day places are covered out of a total of 1,400. This has had the effect of casting a very poor reflection on the performance of the Minister for Health, whose commitment to date appears to be little beyond the window dressing of lavish press announcements.</P>
      <P>One thing is clear arising from all the difficulties encountered by carers and those suffering in the mentally handicap area that there is a tremendous contribution by those in voluntary organisations throughout the country.  No tribute or words can express the extraordinary dedication and absolute commitment of people to caring for an impaired relative, friend or neighbour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="729" /> The absence or any respite care for many families puts the whole matter in perspective. Recently the services were referred to by an expert in the area as the Cinderella sector of the health services. On the basis that Cinderella had at least one night out and a fairy godmother, it is an exaggeration to refer to it as the Cinderella sector.</P>
    <P>The recommendations of the 1990 &ldquo;Needs and Abilities&rdquo; report must be used as a framework for action and an appropriate five year target plan for the implementation of the recommendations is essential.</P>
    <P>The Department should formulate a scheme of arrangement with appropriate public agencies for providing self-supporting employment for people with a learning difficulty or intellectual disability. Greater emphasis should be placed on the recruitment, training and management of voluntary personnel and immediate attention should be given to the serious shortage of physiotherapists and speech therapists.  The health board co-ordinating committees should report at regular intervals in relation to plans in the health board area.  The Minister for Equality and Law Reform along with his colleague the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, must take upon themselves a role in training and generating employment for mentally handicapped persons capable of and suitable for employment within the community.  In this regard, perhaps the Minister for Health might commit himself to setting up a Cabinet sub-committee to look at the matter. Indeed it might be a useful endeavour for the programme managers to undertake the setting up of a co-ordinated group to work between the Departments of Education, Health and Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>The review group heavily emphasised the need for short term breaks for those looking after mentally handicapped persons living at home.  It recognised that many agencies developed a range of options including breakaway schemes, shared care schemes and planned crisis intervention services to assist these families. All these services are somewhat <Col N="730" /> unco-ordinated and need to be expanded to areas of the country where they are not in existence at all.</P>
    <P>I commend this motion to the House in order to put back on the rails a goal contained in the Green Paper on services for disabled people published 13 years ago which states that the ultimate objective is to help disabled people to realise their full potential to participate to the greatest extent possible in the life of the community.</P>
    <P>The actions of the Minister for Health on this matter since assuming power have fallen considerably short of this objective and the behaviour of the Labour Party and its Leader, in particular, in the context of commitments and promises of funding in respect of the intellectually impaired has registered a new low in Irish political life.</P>
    <P>I say to my 165 colleagues, that this position can be changed tomorrow night by supporting this motion in the name of Fine Gael and calling on the Government to raise the plight of the mentally handicapped on the political agenda.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick-East):</i> I support this motion so ably proposed by our health spokesperson, Deputy Charles Flanagan.  I am glad to see the Minister is back in the House.  He has had a long afternoon here and I appreciate the fact that he is attending this debate.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party did very well in the last election.  They won 33 seats, and the Parliamentary Labour Party has now its highest ever representation.  The decision by the Labour Party to join Fianna Fáil in Government was unexpected.  Many Members of the House, and in particular Members at this side of the House, would claim they had no mandate to do so. They fought their election campaign on a general platform of being the agents of change and many of us find their partnership with Fianna Fáil inconsistent with this objective.  Be that as it may, to argue along these lines now is water under the bridge.  Labour is in Government with Fianna Fáil and it occupies very powerful Government Departments, including the Department of Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="731" /> Our debate tonight has a narrower focus than the factors that contributed to the formation of the last Government, but issues of principle relating to the behaviour of politicians at election time and subsequent to elections are relevant.</P>
    <P>A Labour Party policy document to which my colleague has already referred, published in the course of the last election campaign entitled &ldquo;Trust into Politics&rdquo;, commenced with a letter from the Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Dick Spring, now Tánaiste, in the course of which he stated:</P>
    <P>Because of the scarcity of resources, it is not possible for any responsible party to lay out a list of financial promises and commitments.  To attempt to do so would not be credible and would be irresponsible.</P>
    <P>Of course, we all support those sentiments. Deputy Spring went on to state:</P>
    <P>For that reason we have decided to concentrate most of the limited resources we have already provided in our budget on two principal areas both crying out for trust and justice.</P>
    <P>Our priorities are children and people with a disability.  We intend to spend additional resources on these areas next year, and we are not apologising to anyone for the commitments we are making.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party national director of elections, Mr. Barry Desmond, MEP, amplified this commitment in a letter to Mr. Gerry Ryan, General Secretary, NAMHI.  The last paragraph of this letter reads as follows:</P>
    <P>In the area of mental handicap there is a recognised crisis for the 25,000 with such a handicap.  That crisis may relate to education, training, employment or residential care depending on family and individual circumstances.  Among the detailed proposals in Labour's programme is the provision of £25 million next year to catch up on the &ldquo;Needs and Abilities&rdquo; report prepared by the <Col N="732" /> last Administration and effectively shelved.</P>
    <P>This commitment was repeated throughout the country by Labour Party candidates. The parents, friends, carers and service providers of the mentally handicapped had no doubt but that the Labour Party in Government would provide £25 million to fund the programme outlined in the &ldquo;Needs and Abilities&rdquo; report and that they would do so in 1993.  Labour has reneged on this promise and by doing so has walked away from the most vulnerable group in society.</P>
    <P>This has brought the politics of promise to a new low.  The emotions of those closest to mentally handicapped persons were engaged by this commitment, their support was sought in the election, this support was given to the Labour Party, quite frequently across party lines, and Labour reneged when the day came to fulfil its promise.</P>
    <P>Excuses that Labour is the minority party in Government will not wash.  The Minister for Health is a Labour Minister. The Minister for Health was a Labour negotiator when the Programme for Government was drawn up.  During the period of those negotiations the Taoiseach was the most vulnerable politician in this country and only the Labour lifebelt saved him.  If Labour had asked for this money they would have got it immediately from the unfortunate Deputy Reynolds.  They did not.  They broke their promise and let down 25,000 persons who suffer from mental handicap.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan has dealt with the scope of the problem nationally.  I am a member of the Mid-Western Health Board and I am familiar with the needs of persons with mental handicap in that area.</P>
    <P>The Mid-Western Health Board produced a major report in November of 1992, the very month of the general election into the needs of the mentally handicapped in the region.  Deputies have their own perspectives on this issue, but I would suggest that in terms of research, and in terms of the establishment of a <Col N="733" /> database which clearly illustrates the breadth of the problem, the Mid-Western Health Board is more advanced than other health board regions.  We know how many people suffer from mental handicap in the mid-west region and we know precisely the requirements.  Unfortunately, the allocation made by the Minister to our health board recently is totally inadequate.</P>
    <P>The report to which I refer is no doubt familiar to the Minister and is quite detailed.  I do not intend making more than passing references to it tonight.  I will, however, draw the attention of the House to a preliminary report, Report No. 9/92, put before the Mid-Western Health Board by the relevant programme manager, Mr. Martin Duffy.  This was developed into the fuller and more general report subsequently.</P>
    <P>There are 499 persons recorded as not being in receipt of either a day or residential service in the Mid-Western Health Board region.  This represents 29 per cent of the base population who suffer from mental handicap.  The majority are persons with a moderate mental handicap but of the total, 183 were considered as in immediate need of services and of these, 137 were in need of residential care.</P>
    <P>The persons who require residential care comprise a number of groups.  The first is persons who are currently in residential care and require an alternative placement e.g. children in adult centres or other persons considered to be in inappropriate locations.  The second category are adults, and there are many of them, who are occupying children's places. There is another category of persons in day services who require residential care either because of their own circumstance or because of particular family circumstances. Finally there is a category of persons who are in receipt of no service and require residential care.</P>
    <P>Some of these persons may be in crisis while others may have a similar need but could be wait-listed for a short period. Others may be in immediate need though there may be no crisis need.  Where adults are occupying children's places, immediate <Col N="734" /> placement into an adult location would free up places for children.</P>
    <P>There are 219 persons identified as requiring a residential placement as the next service requirement.  Of those, 134 are in residential care, 53 are in a day service, and 32 are not in receipt of any designated service.</P>
    <P>At St. Vincent's, Lisnagry, 77 adults occupy children's places.  In St. Anne's in Roscrea, 20 adults occupy children's places.  In the Brothers of Charity at Fota in Cork 16 adults from the Mid-Western Health Board region occupy children's places.</P>
    <P>We are in a crisis and I would stress again to the Minister that what Deputy Flanagan has said is correct: the state of the services for the mentally handicapped is such that we do not know how many people require care or what type.  In one health board where research was carried out the figures surprised even the researchers and the people on the committee whose task it is to care and provide services for the mentally handicapped. The figures were much higher than expected or suspected.  I suggest that the figure suggested in the report &ldquo;Needs and Abilities&rdquo; is out of line if the data produced by the Mid-Western Health board is representative of the position in the country as a whole, and I have no reason to believe it is not.</P>
    <P>Many Members of this House are members of health boards and know the amount of money required to implement the main recommendations of the report to which I referred.  I would be happy if this money was made available on a systematic basis over five years.  In the meantime it must be recognised that there are existing problems in the service which need to be addressed as a matter of urgency, for example, adults blocking children's beds and the absence of children's community services.  The experience of the service providers has identified a range of needs for adults and children which must be addressed because of their urgency.  If they are not the orderly development and provision of services will grind to a halt.</P>
    <P>The programme drawn up by the committee <Col N="735" /> which examined the needs of the handicapped in the Mid-Western Health Board region is very extensive.  At the end of the programme the service providers identified what is required immediately in terms of emergency action to provide the service required in 1993.  The total cost of these measures, in terms of current and capital expenditure, is £6.295 million.  That is the emergency provision required for one health board region. The figures are not exaggerated.  Some weeks ago the Minister notified the health boards of their allocation from the extra amount provided in the budget.  My health boards gets some allocation on the capital side and the allocation on the current side is £458,000.  According to the accompanying letter from a civil servant in the Minister's Department the allocation of £458,000 is the full year provision. The health board will be in a position to use these resources from 1 July.  This reduces the sum of £458,000 to half.  The Minister is shaking his head at me.  If he thinks what I am saying is not correct he should contact the chief executive officer of my health board who told me at the last health board meeting that £230,000 on the current side was all that was available to him.  This is against an emergency requirement in excess of £6 million.</P>
    <P>A disastrous situation is emerging.  In short the provision in the budget is only sufficient to cover the emergency needs of one health board.  The population of the Mid-Western Health Board region is less than 10 per cent of the population of the country.  Under normal circumstances we would expect approximately 10 per cent of any allocation for health purposes.  When the requirements of one health board, which caters for 10 per cent of the population and which has carried out research into the problem of mental handicap to establish the data base, the incidence and the main needs, comes up with a figure in excess of £6.5 million, is it any wonder that members of the Opposition make the case for more resources for the mentally handicapped? Is it any wonder that this motion is before <Col N="736" /> the House and that the parents, friends, carers and service providers who know this problem so intimately are fully behind us in this proposal?</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to reconsider the funding for this area.  What the Labour Party did was shabby.  We are all in politics and we know that promises can be broken.</P>

      <P>It is reasonable to expect a general improvement in the services provided by the Government as no area is more deserving in this respect than the special hospital services for the mentally handicapped.  It is laudable that care of the mentally handicapped should have been made an issue at the last general election.  It was desirable and reasonable to expect that this would become an issue of that time.  Those of us who are members of health boards have seen at first hand the deplorable conditions provided for the care of the mentally handicapped and the treatment meted out to that vulnerable group by virtue of the fact that sufficient funds, staff and buildings <Col N="737" /> were not available.  When the buildings became obsolete we did not have the wherewithall to provide alternative community care facilities.</P>
      <P>It is reasonable for any party going before the electorate to seek to improve its electoral chances to the best of its ability.  It is equally reasonable that promises should be made to certain groups in society.  However, it is equally important that these promises are kept. In case there is any doubt in the minds of those Deputies on the Government benches about their responsibilities in this area, I wish to remind them that they will have to look into the eyes of the parents of the mentally handicapped and ask themselves whether they were honest at the time and whether they intend to deliver on their promises.  The Government has spent much of its first few months in office cutting £25 million here and £10 million there.  All these cuts pale into insignificance in terms of the needs of the handicapped.</P>

      <P>That issue has been with us for far too long and it cannot be dealt with by simply hoping and wishing it will go away.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Carlow-Kilkenny</i>): I very much regret that I am not in a position in the time available to pay sufficient tribute to the people who care for people with a mental handicap.  It has been my privilege for a number of years to have been chairman of the Delta Centre in Carlow, a training centre for people with a mental handicap.  My involvement in <Col N="738" /> this centre has given me an insight to the ill-treatment, so to speak, of people suffering from a mental handicap by official sources.</P>
      <P>I wish to pay tribute to the parents and friends of people with a mental handicap. I am sure that the position in Carlow is the same throughout the country.  These parents have been handicapped in their own way by having a child with a mental handicap.  They must raise the funds for these schools and pay the capitation.  If an extension is needed, they must provide the money as distinct from parish schools where the money is provided by the parish.  St. Lazarian's special school in Carlow had to rise £7,790 in 1990, £8,656 in 1991 and £13,608 in 1992.  These people never get a break.  There is often a reference to our obligation to cherish all the children of the nation equally.  This sounds very well but it does very little to help those who need assistance.  Schools are not getting the backing they need. There is a lack of care workers and very often care is necessary on a one to one basis for people with mental and physical handicap.  The number of care workers is insufficient.  A full-time trained nurse is required in schools.  I ask the Minister to deal realistically with this problem.  As a former teacher he must know the needs in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity provided by this motion as it enables me to put on record my commitment and that of the Government to provide in accordance with the Programme for a Partnership Government the highest possible level of service for persons with a mental handicap and to create an environment in which all persons with a disability of whatever kind can freely exercise their full rights as citizens in our society.</P>
      <P>We intend to make the equality of people with disabilities a reality by ensuring that the services they need are theirs as of right.  We will ensure that people with a disability and their families have as much choice as possible in the use of services and that they are consulted about policy and service issues.  We will encourage the integration of services with those for the community as a whole so that persons with a disability will regard themselves as an integral part of that community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Services for people with a mental handicap have changed radically for the better over the past 20 years.  High standards of service provision have been achieved notwithstanding the fact that our country's economic resources are <Col N="740" /> lower than those of most of our European partners with whom we tend to compare our services.  This is in itself an achievement and is due to the sustained efforts of the voluntary and statutory sectors. We have established an international reputation in the field of mental handicap services.</P>
    <P>The key contribution of voluntary agencies was simple but radical.  These sisters, brothers and committed lay people believed in the dignity of the person with mental handicap.  They believed that these children could develop their personalities and skills far beyond the bounds of what many thought possible.  The role these agencies have played in developing services for people with mental handicap is well known. Initially, they received little support from the State for their efforts.  Today however, the State provides almost the entire funding for services.  The voluntary sector continues to play a leading role in pioneering new services and new approaches to service delivery.</P>
    <P>A substantial amount of money is being spent on a range of services to people with mental handicap.  In 1993 approximately £209 million will be spent on these services.  This expenditure includes the funding provided by my Department to the direct funded agencies, services provided for people with mental handicap in psychiatric hospitals, in health board centres and by voluntary agencies funded through section 65 of the Health Act, 1953, and other grants by the health boards.  It also includes expenditure on disabled persons maintenance allowances and domiciliary care allowances.</P>
    <P>Before outlining the challenges which face the Government and service providers in meeting the changing needs of people with mental handicap and their families, I would like to take a look at what is available at present.  By any standards, the services which have been developed in this country for people with mental handicap are of a high standard. However, I recognise that we have much to do if we are to meet fully the needs of <Col N="741" /> all persons with a mental handicap who are on a waiting list.</P>
    <P>As a public representative I have been conscious for many years of the problems faced by people with mental handicap and their families in endeavouring to obtain services of the different stages of their development.  The fundamental problem is that the number of people with a mental handicap has been growing faster than the capacity of services to meet their needs.  The growth in the numbers is a result of increased longevity of people with mental handicap rather than a rise in the incidence of mental handicap. We must ensure that this increase in life expectancy is matched by a corresponding increase in the quality of life of persons with a handicap and their carers.  Now that we have added years to life we must now make sure that we add life to the years.</P>
    <P>I would like to put on record my appreciation of the enthusiastic and wholehearted response to the needs of people with a mental handicap which has been given down the years by the staff working in the agencies.  Their dedication, at times over and above the call of duty, has enriched the lives of many, breaking down barriers which in the past prevented people with mental handicap from achieving their full potential.</P>
    <P>It is understandable that most families who have a son or daughter with mental handicap would wish to keep them at home as long as possible.  In order to do so, however, they need access to appropriate support services.  In particular they need access to respite care on a planned basis and the assistance from the home support services either on an occasional or, in some case, an ongoing basis to alleviate the heavy physical and mental burden which caring for a family member with mental handicap can place on them.</P>
    <P>As the population with mental handicap still being cared for at home grows progressively older, so too do their carers.  It is not uncommon to find parents in their seventies caring for a son or daughter in his or her forties.  I understand those parents' concern about the future welfare of their son or daughter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="742" /> They made great sacrifices to keep their children at home.  They need the reassurance that the person will continue to be cared for when they can no longer care. I have met dozens of such carers up and down the country in the past four months.</P>
    <P>The kernel of the challenge facing the Government, service providers and the families of those with mental handicap is to develop services in a way which matches the needs and promotes the abilities and integration of people with mental handicap.  The Government has outlined its commitment to the development of services for people with a mental handicap in the Programme for a Partnership Government which I helped negotiate. It is my task as Minister for Health to implement this commitment and to translate it into reality.</P>
    <P>The report of the review group on mental handicap services &mdash; Needs and Abilities &mdash; outlines the principles which should underlie the provision of services. It endorses the direction in which our services have developed.  Throughout the report, the review group emphasises the importance of supporting the family and providing services locally.</P>
    <P>In the Programme for a Partnership Government, the Government has reaffirmed its commitment to developing comprehensive community-based services for people with mental handicap. The Government has also committed itself to provide sufficient additional funding to accelerate the implementation of the recommendations contained in the review group's report.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to improving and strengthening the health services to people with a disability, in particular those with mental handicap. In the budget this year the Government made available an additional £6.5 million to develop services for people with mental handicap.  In addition I have made available a sum of £2 million from within my own Department to strengthen the funding base of some direct-funded mental handicap agencies and to meet some essential service needs.  That was done at great expense to other agencies because my Department and the Government <Col N="743" /> recognise the crucial importance of mental handicap services.  A sum of £2 million was taken from agencies across the board to augment the £6.5 million additional allocation provided in the budget by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Four million pounds has been allocated to the health board regions and this money will be used to provide a very broad range of additional services along the following lines: Ninety residential places for the provision of on-going care and for emergency and respite care; 200 day care places for a wide variety of community-based services; the improvement of the home support programme which was initiated last year, the continuation of the transfer of persons with a mental handicap from psychiatric hospitals to more appropriate hostel accommodation in the community; the creation of further early intervention and child education and development services; the improvement of services in St. Ita's Hospital in Portrane, specifically recognised and funded; and the commissioning of new bungalow accommodation at the Daughters of Charity on the Navan Road in Dublin.  They are an indication of the things that can be provided with the additional resources allocation provided this year.</P>
    <P>The precise services to be provided in each region will be agreed by the local mental handicap co-ordinating committees within the guidelines issued by my Department and will be approved by me.  It is important that the spending of the money should be agreed by those who are providing and monitoring the services at local level.  I did not allocate the money on a regional basis.  I allocated it to where the greatest need was, and some areas did better than others because they had greater numbers of people seeking services. I make no apology for doing that. These allocations were determined on the basis of the waiting lists for services and on the current level of service provision in each area.</P>
    <P>Provision has also been made for the capital investment necessary to support the initiatives which will be put in place <Col N="744" /> this year.  The allocation of the £2.5 million capital funding made available in the budget will be directly related to the service developments agreed by the regional mental handicap co-ordinating committees and approved by the Department of Health.  This is by far, the largest single allocation ever made for services to persons with a mental handicap and is a mark of the determination of the Government to give a very high priority to the development of these services.</P>
    <P>I have outlined the challenges which face us in meeting the growing demands for services to persons with a mental handicap.  I have outlined our response to these challenges and mentioned the fact that this year we are spending about £209 million on such services.  This is a considerable level of expenditure and while I accept that more needs to be provided &mdash; I battled for more and will continue to battle for more &mdash; I am anxious that every person with a mental handicap should get some measure of service from this level of expenditure. That is a very reasonable aspiration.</P>
    <P>When I announced the 1993 initiative I set down three key objectives in relation to persons who are on a waiting list for a service or a change of service.  These are: every person on a waiting list for residential care would get at least one planned respite break a year; every person on a waiting list would get some measure of support from the home scheme and every co-ordinating committee should ensure that arrangements are in place so that all genuine emergencies can be responded to.  All co-ordinating committees have been asked to pay particular attention to these objectives.  I hope that they will give reassurance to families who have a member on a waiting list.</P>
    <P>I recognise how important it is that we do everything possible to prevent the occurrence of handicap.  Accordingly, I find the present situation in relation to the provision of genetic counselling unsatisfactory.  Genetic counselling is available to a limited extent within our paediatric hospitals and units and in obstetric hospitals and units throughout the country.  In addition, genetic screening <Col N="745" /> and testing facilities are available in the major university hospitals.  However, integrated medical genetic services do not exist in this country at the moment, and this is the reason many people travel to Belfast or overseas to obtain advice and counselling.</P>
    <P>A sum of £250,000 was allocated towards the establishment of an integrated genetic conselling service in 1992. I have provided an additional £410,000 in the 1993 revenue allocation to Our Lady's Hospital in Crumlin for the development of a national medical genetics counselling service.  That is something that will be welcomed by parents across the country.  The service will provide non-directive counselling, that is, decisions will be made by the patient in consultation with the consellor having regard to the facts and treatment options available.  This new service will be backed up by a medical genetic laboratory which will be able to test for all medical genetic conditions.  As soon as the detailed arrangements for the national centre have been finalised, I will be considering how best the service might be organised on a regional basis.</P>
    <P>One of the most significant developments ever to take place regarding persons who are disadvantaged was the appointment of a Minister by this Government whose special task is to look after the interests of the disadvantaged and to ensure that the objective of eliminating inequality for all groups becomes a reality.  In the negotiations for a Partnership Government, it became very clear that while individual Ministers and Departments had responsibility for various aspects of services to persons with a disability, there was a lack of an effective co-ordinating role and of a voice whose primary function was to promote the interests of the disadvantaged.  The appointment of my colleague, Deputy Mervyn Taylor, as Minister for Equality and Law Reform is a concrete expression of this Government's intention to ensure that the promotion of the rights of persons <Col N="746" /> with a disability become a reality and is not seen as some catch-phrase, which it has been for too long.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear from what we have achieved in just four months that our bona fides in this regard are above reproach.  I agree with Deputies that more should have been done for persons with a mental handicap over the years &mdash; and in particular in the eighties when the numbers increased through increased longevity as a result of advances in medical science.  I do not need Deputy Flanagan or anybody else to remind me of this since I have made this very point on numerous occasions over the past few years.  Unfortunately, I was not Minister for Health at that time but since I became Minister, I am proud to say that I have secured the largest ever increase in funding for the services to persons with a mental handicap.  This is a fact of which I am immensely proud and I know from contacts all over the country who are <Col N="747" /> interested in persons with a mental handicap that this has been much appreciated.</P>
      <P>I would be the first to accept that much more needs to be done and it is my intention to ensure that the services are expanded and strengthened in line with the recommendations of &ldquo;Needs and Abilities&rdquo;.  I will not be found wanting in relation to demands in this area.</P>
      <P>One point which deserves an answer is the fact that a promise of an additional £25 million for persons with a mental handicap was made in our election manifesto. That is true.  I drew up that election manifesto.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for sharing his time and giving me the opportunity to speak on this subject.  Like the Deputies opposite, I deal with handicapped people daily.  This matter affects many families and it is an area to which I, the Minister and the Labour Party have paid much attention over the years.</P>
      <P>When in Opposition the Minister and I were my party's spokespersons on health and were members of an allparty <i>ad hoc</i> committee which included parents of children with a handicap.  I would remind Deputy Noonan that we reminded the health boards that they needed to submit documentation so that those of us in Parliament could highlight, in addition to the policy document &ldquo;Needs and Abilities&rdquo;, the needs identified by the professionals in this area.  In Government, the Labour Party is committed to eliminating inequality for all groups in society.  It is our ambition to root out all forms of discrimination and in so doing we will undoubtedly improve the lives of many people affected directly and indirectly.</P>
      <P>In Opposition I published a Private Members' Bill which would have given people with a mental handicap statutory rights.  I am glad that its provisions have been incorporated in the Programme for Government and will be introduced by my colleague, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor.  The Minister referred to this legislation tonight.  I am sure it will be a significant milestone in the fight against inequality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need for substantial investment in services for people with a mental handicap.

      <P>As Deputy Flanagan is aware &mdash; he was his party's spokesperson on health for a while &mdash; an additional £8.5 million was provided in the budget to improve and strengthen the services for those with a disability, in particular those with a mental handicap.  In addition, the Minister for Health has made an additional sum of £2 million available from the Estimate for his Department to make sure that funding is provided for agencies providing services for people with a handicap.  We are all indebted to these agencies for their work. Deputy Flanagan is correct when he says that it is a long time since we debated this issue.  On the last occasion people collected money outside in the rain.  They also collected money during the period of the Tallaght strategy.</P>

      <P>In his speech tonight the Minister for Health recognised the role <Col N="752" /> of parents and families.  He believes, correctly, that they have a central role in planning these services.  One cannot throw money at something without first putting structures in place.  The people who deliver a service on a voluntary basis decide in consultation with the Minister, how some of the additional money should be spent.  It is essential to avail of their knowledge and expertise if we are to provide proper services for the families of persons with a mental handicap.  It is possible for the Government and these families to work together to ensure that people with a disability can participate fully in society.  I have the utmost confidence in the Minister that he will succeed in integrating the services so that those with a disability will consider themselves an integral part of the community.</P>
      <P>Opportunities are available for persons with a mental handicap.  I am pleased to be associated with industrialists who want to provide workshops for the handicapped. The Minister is aware of these proposals.  Why should they have the same opportunities as everybody else and treated in the same way?  Fine Gael should not use emotive language for political reasons in this House and make complaints at the special committee that too much money is being spent on the health services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful that the Minister was given an opportunity tonight to outline his excellent plans to improve the facilities available for the mentally handicapped.  I know there is something of a conflict of responsibility between the Minister for Health and Equality and Law Reform at present in relation to the care of and provision of services for mentally handicapped people.  I know that discussions are continuing between both Government Departments with regard to their respective responsibilities.</P>
      <P>It was useful that the Minister gave us a commitment that his Department is assuming a leadership role in the provision of the services promised.  I welcomed the £8.5 million increase in funds provided in this year's budget for the development of services for people with a mental handicap, which the Minister said brings the total allocation of resources to £209 million.  We really must give credit where it is due.  This is the first time it has been given.  We could continue to moan forever that the amount should be more but a start has been made and there has been a change in balance effected.  Choices have been made.  I commend the Minister on having convinced his Cabinet colleagues that such choices had to be made in favour of people with a mental handicap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, all the funding in the world will have no lasting effect without a comprehensive support programme developed in this field.  In this respect I want to refer specifically to the role of carers who care for people with a mental handicap at home.  This could be described as a woman's issue since over the years the task of caring for children and adults with a mental handicap was borne predominantly by mothers working <Col N="754" /> in the home.  For too many years that work was taken for granted by society and by successive Governments.  An army of unpaid workers within the voluntary sectors has been bearing that burden.  It is about time that voluntary support was buffered by greater resources, as it has been this year.</P>
    <P>It is my belief that most mentally handicapped people should not be institutionalised. There is growing acceptance that they should be able to take their place, in so far as possible, within the community.  In order that that may happen we must provide increased support for carers, those people who work in their homes, endeavouring to balance their obligations to their other children. It is in the interests of everybody in society that help be given to parents looking after mentally handicapped children in the home.  If the other ablebodied children in the home are not to be neglected, there is an obligation on the State to ensure that they are given support.</P>
    <P>In providing mentally handicapped people with the best quality of life we must remember that the carer's quality of life must not be destroyed.  That has been the case over the years, when marriages have broken down, women having become slaves to their handicapped children, which is no longer acceptable. There has been support forthcoming from voluntary organisations who do a great job, but they cannot provide adequate respite care for the many families who need a break occasionally.  They are in need of lots of breaks.  We should not work to the minimum, but rather towards ensuring that these people have many breaks throughout the year because we must always remember that one week looking after a mentally handicapped person is the equivalent of six months in an ordinary person's working life, the work being so intense.  It is somewhat like the intensive demands looking after an infant makes on an individual.</P>
    <P>There always has been the commitment <Col N="755" /> stipulated in our Constitution to cherish all children equally but unfortunately that has not been the case to date.  It would be my hope that we are moving towards remedying that position.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's commitment to the provision of 200 day care places and the improvement of the home support programme initiated last year.  It is also important that people who are inappropriately housed in psychiatric homes nationwide should be transferred to smaller, more intimate hostel accommodation.</P>
    <P>With medical developments mentally handicapped people are living longer. This means that many elderly parents live in fear of what may happen their adult mentally retarded children once they have died.  This is a burden that should be removed so that all those people who have given their lives to looking after their mentally handicapped children can die in peace knowing that the State will take over their responsibilities.  With the increase in the occurrence of Alzheimer's disease, many more elderly people will be needing the care of professionals trained in the field of mental illness.</P>
    <P>The Minister this evening referred to the forthcoming, long overdue initiation of the genetic counselling service to be shared by Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children and Temple Street Hospital which could have a major impact on the incidence of children born with serious congenital abnormalities.  It is estimated that almost half of all families at risk could be helped by such genetic counselling. I understand that three-quarters of all mental handicap has a genetic component. It will clearly be seen that this is a very important development, one that had been placed on the back burner because of moral objections and the huge amount of public debate that surrounded anything to do with reproductive technology. This is a most welcome development. We should not be afraid of saying so lest we be considered to be insensitive <Col N="756" /> to the parents of children with a mental handicap.  I am sure all such parents would have been delighted to have availed of the service had they been able to avoid bringing people with a mental handicap into the world.  A committed policy for the introduction of an integrated national service of genetic counselling is the way forward.</P>
    <P>We must also have a committed policy to overcoming inequalities, discrimination, all of those tasks with which the Minister for Equality and Law Reform is charged.  I inderstand that the cost of the State of a mentally handicapped person from birth to death is £750,000.  We must ensure that the increased resources the Minister has secured will be spent in the most caring, productive and efficient manner ensuring maximum benefit for the mentally handicapped.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the education of mentally handicapped people.  There has been a debate always on whether it is desirable to have mentally handicapped people integrated into the mainstream of our education system.  At the earliest possible age an attempt should be made to offer choice to individual parents.  Many parents know exactly what their child is capable of.  Fundamental to the rights of such parents is the ability to make choices for their mentally ill child or children.  Places and facilities can be made available in our national and secondary schools for people with a mental handicap in so far as such is practicable within individual schools.  In some cases it might not prove to be appropriate but if we provide good special schooling and care we will have travelled a long way towards meeting their rights as individuals.  Choice is the key and it is parents who must make those choices.  They should be afforded every facility in helping their child or children.</P>
    <P>Part of the Labour Party policy before the last general election was to appoint a Minister for Disability, about which I had reservations.  Many people consider it <Col N="757" /> wrong to segregate responsibility for people with a disability into a separate Ministery, contending that a more integerated approach is appropriate, all the State's services being geared to deal with the needs of people with special disabilities.  I am willing to wait and see how it transpires.  In this respect I am sure the Minister for Equality and Law Reform will provide leadership.  I believe there is good co-operation between his Department and that of the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>There were some worries expressed about disclosures in regard to Saint Ita's. I am sure that was not a unique case, that nationwide our services for people with a mental handicap have developed in a type of <i>ad hoc</i> manner.  I understand that too much restraint was used in dealing with some cases.  That points to the need for a greater balance between the psychiatric and psychological services nationwide. I know that throughout our health services psychological services have tended to take a back seat, that we have been under-resourced in introducing psychological health services throughout our system.  Training and work opportunities for people with a mental handicap is most important.  In this respect I note the Minister's commitment to some further enhancement of the vocational training opportunities for people in that field.</P>
    <P>This has been the largest single allocation to date and is to be welcomed.  We can only hope that it will bring the best out of the Department's expertise.  The Minister has given us a commitment, this motion having provided him with an opportunity to outline in detail what that commitment means.</P>
    <P>The Minister should give further consideration to people with a mental handicap which may have arisen out of the whooping cough vaccine, as was the decision in the Kenneth Best case, where negligence was proved.  The Department of Health identified other cases in the late 1980s, where it has been accepted that <Col N="758" /> the whooping cough vaccine may have caused brain damage to a small number of individuals.  I hope the Minister will consider setting up a fund for families whose children have been brain damaged by that vaccine.  I would like to hear the Minister's response to this point.  Perhaps the issue may be raised at another time but it is relevant to this debate.  A small number of families are affected, they are not eligible for legal aid to take a case individually and cannot afford to do so. They do not have sufficient support from the State in caring for their children.</P>

      <P>Like my colleague, Deputy O'Donnell I compliment the Minister.  I am more encouraged now about the future of the mentally handicapped than I was three years ago.  Long before I went into politics I spent a great deal of time doing voluntary work with a group for the handicapped in Cork and I was acutely aware of the lack of services, especially those which were tailor made to fit individual situations.  Now we have the basis of a much better system and the money with which to fuel it.  We have developed an awareness and learned lessons that will enable us to ensure the system is more responsive to individual needs, more flexible in responding to individual <Col N="759" /> families and that there is a more organic interaction between the voluntary and State services and the families with a mentally handicapped member.  That is a major step in the right direction.  It would be a great pity to fail to acknowledge this and it would add to the worries of parents about their mentally handicapped children. Apart from anything else, we need to reassure families that more is now being done &mdash; and planned &mdash; for those with a mental handicap.  That in itself helps to ease the very heavy burden which families with a mentally handicapped person have to bear.  There can be few more devastating blows for a young mother than the growing realisation that the child she has borne with love and anticipation is mentally handicapped. That must be one of the most difficult and bitter blows for young mothers to come to grips with, but they have come to grips with this situation with an extraordinary heroism that has never been fully acknowledged.  Imagine the psychological difficulty of having spent months on months looking forward to a healthy, happy, laughing child and then to find, through no fault of your own or anyone else, that your child is different.  The psychological switch that it takes to come to terms with this in the first instance, as so many mothers have done in a spirit of courage and generosity and then having to cope with it on an ongoing basis over many years, is a burden on women, fathers and other family members. Unquestionably, women have borne the brunt and I am very glad there is a growing realisation of that fact in the Minister's speech.  Not alone must we be setting down a system that responds effectively to the needs of the handicapped, we must put in place a system that responds equally effectively to the needs of the carer.  When we care for the carer we are also caring for the handicapped person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to see very careful monitoring to ensure that we respond <Col N="760" /> adequately and sentitively to the needs of such families.  One such area is respite care.  Mothers who have kept the young or growing child at home have done so with great generosity involving hard work, need a rest at times.  Indeed, they need more than one respite per year. There needs to be greater flexibility so that when there is an unexpected happening in the family, for example, an outbreak of illness or when the mother becomes ill, the services should be able to respond and come up with some kind of support mechanism, whether in bringing in outside help or taking the handicapped person from the home for respite care.  If that was the case, it would mean a great improvement for mothers and families of handicapped persons.</P>
    <P>In parts of the country we have a very good day care service for mildly mentally handicapped persons which very often has been put in place by voluntary groups, to whom great credit is due.  We must build on that.  Indeed, we have much more information on psychology and psychiatry at our fingertips than we had even five years ago which enables us to provide services in a better and more advanced way which respond to the potential of those with a mild mental handicap.  Much more can be done in the years ahead in terms of a workshop-day-care service, with a blend of learning.  I do not use the word &ldquo;education&rdquo; because sometimes people have had a bad experience of education, perhaps because people like me spent too long in classrooms.  I like the word &ldquo;learning&rdquo; because few are so handicapped that they cannot participate in a progressive degree of learning.  There is room for great improvement in the area of learning and training.</P>
    <P>Indeed, I am certain there is scope for improvement in relation to services for the profoundly mentally handicapped. Essentially I am seeking greater flexibility in the delivery of support services. No matter what part of the country one lives in, there should be access to the <Col N="761" /> best available day-care services.  It often happens that there is good provision in cities whereas in rural areas there is not the same degree of availability.  A mentally handicapped child in a rural area has the same rights and the same right of access to services as a child in an urban area.  We must ensure that there is an equality of access for the handicapped, children and adults, whether they live in rural or urban areas.  That is very important.</P>
    <P>The needs of handicapped persons change and develop as the person grows older.  Indeed, at the same time, the needs of the carer also change.  As the carer grows older there is loss of energy and we have to tailor our services to the changing circumstances, what is adequate for a mentally handicapped person today may not necessarily be the right recipe in five years' time.</P>
    <P>We have here the basis of a better and more responsible service and I hope we can build on it.  Perhaps the Minister would come into the House on an annual basis and give a report on how the services are working, what changes have been brought about as a result of the increased allocation, what new research has been carried out and how it has been harnessed to practical measures on the ground.  I would ask the Minister to do that on an annual basis.  There is great scope for giving greater reassurance, through that mechanism, to parents who for too long have been neglected.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Wexford Harbour Special Protection Area Designation.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me a few minutes on the Adjournment this evening to raise an issue which is a cause of major concern to a large number of groups in Wexford, that is the designation <Col N="762" /> of Wexford Harbour as a special protection area under the Birds Directive. Wexford Harbour is an area of international importance for wild birds and, indeed, designation of SPAs is an obligation under the EC Birds Directive.  I recognise both those points and the beauty of the environment and the habitat referred to as Wexford Harbour.  It is an area that extends from the South Slob Wall to the North Slob Wall and from Wexford town to the Burrow and Raven Point.</P>
      <P>The present users of Wexford Harbour area are up in arms &mdash; to put it mildly &mdash; over the proposal to designate the area an SPA.  They fear that their present use and access will be curtailed.  I do not share their degree of fear and I support the general thrust of the designation of an SPA.  The Office of Public Works must stand chastised in terms of their PR ability and their communication skills with the public generally.  As one who generally supports the preservation of our environment and these types of designation, I would urge the Minister to get expertise on his team, to enable skills to be developed and to bring the public with him as we go down this road.  Over the years I hope more areas will be so designated and that we will be able to preserve the habitats and the environment for future generations to enjoy as we and our forbears have enjoyed.</P>
      <P>The Minister replied to a parliamentary question from me last week in which he insisted that the relevant bodies were notified &mdash; harbour authorities, water sports and shellfish people, regional game councils, wild bird conservancy, BIM and the ESB.  The main users knew nothing about it and received no notification.  The Minister may have notified these organisations at national level but the information did not filter to the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am representing to the Minister tonight the fears of Wexford Harbour Board, Wexford County Council, Wexford Corporation, Lett &amp; Co., Shellfish <Col N="763" /> Processors, Wexford Musselmen's Association, Wexford Fishermen's Association, Wexford Regional Game Council, Wexford Harbour Wildfowlers Association, Burrow GPA, Wexford Sea Angling Association, Wexford &amp; District Sea Angling Association, Wexford &amp; District Sea Angling Association, Wexford Harbour Boat Club, Wexford Action Group, Kilmuckridge Sea Angling Association, Wexford Cot Sailing Association, Wexford Sub Aqua Club, New Ross &amp; District Sea Angling Club, River Slaney GPA, Wexford Coastal Action Group, the people of Rosslare, landowners of Hopeland and Burrow, Castlebridge Wildflowers, Wexford Boat owners and Boat charters, and Wexford Power Boat Association.  The list is endless. He never notified the public representatives, the county councillors or the Oireachtas Members of this development. I would urge the Minister to help us to bring the people with him when it comes to protecting the environment rather than cause the confrontation which has ensued in this instance. Despite efforts at reassuring people, I have received letters from the Wexford Regional Game Council stating that the mussel fishermen in Wexford have been in contact with their Dutch colleagues who have informed them that they have had mussel fishing banned in SPAs where eider ducks are feeding.  There are other cases in Germany and Holland where clasification of SPAs has had a detrimental effect on public usage and access.  We do not want to hear words such as &ldquo;may&rdquo;, &ldquo;shall be&rdquo; or &ldquo;might be&rdquo; but rather absolute guarantees that present usage of the harbour for the mussel fishermen, the ring net fishermen, recreation, wild fowling, fishing, boating, walking and diving can continue.  Can the Minister give assurances that aquaculture, fishing, boating and board-sailing can continue?  Will he put in place a process of appeal allowing for a two way communication system so that the people <Col N="764" /> of Wexford will know the Minister's intentions and their fears can be assuaged?</P>

      <P>I am surprised she thinks people were not informed.  The list of organisations she read out is exactly the same as the list of people I have informed.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;who are also very interested in this issue.</P>
      <P>Under EC Directive 79/409/EC, generally known as the Birds Directive, it is mandatory on all member states to set up a network of special protection areas for migratory species and for threatened or vulnerable species.</P>
      <P>Up to 1991, 20 areas have been classified in Ireland and we are under severe pressure from the European Commission to designate further areas.  The Directive provides that within special protection areas, member states will take appropriate steps to avoid pollution or deterioration of habitats or significant disturbances affecting the birds.</P>
      <P>The area of Wexford Harbour has been identified as an important area for birds as it exists and in the context of the current levels of activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite satisfied to give every assurance that this designation will not interfere with current usage of the harbour.  I would appreciate it if Deputy Doyle <Col N="765" /> would convey this to the people of Wexford.</P>
    <P>There are already five special protection areas in the Wexford area &mdash; Wexford Wildfowl Reserve, Saltee Islands, Lady's Island Lake, Ballyteigue Harbour and the Raven.  I am not aware of any problems arising in these areas from this designation.</P>
    <P>In relation to future development, it is Government policy to resist any developments in any area which would significantly damage the environment.  The effect of this designation in these areas is that planning authorities and other development agencies will be asked to look very carefully at proposals to ensure that no significant detrimental effects will arise.  I stress that the concern is with significant detrimental effects &mdash; this does not necessarily become a no-development area.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the concerns expressed by various groups and I note that most of the groups are those for whom a healthy environment is essential for their activities to continue.  I believe that objections are based on a misconception of the effects of the special protection area designation. That is the reason I am pleased with the opportunity to clarify it and I hope the Deputy will convey this to all the groups concerned.  I will be happy to arrange further discussions and explanations by my officials with the groups concerned if they so desire.</P>
    <P>Finally I repeat my assurance that current levels of activities are acceptable in the context of this designation.</P>

Eight days ago on the shores of Lough Derravaragh, County Westmeath, at about 9.30 p.m. a group of subversives set up a firing range and, using Kalashnikov rifles, expended up to 1,000 rounds of ammunition and may also have exploded blast bombs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="766" /> A search of the area the next day by the Garda and the Army led to two arrests but these men were subsequently released.  Of course this area, with a few known subversive activists, has been the nerve centre of a crime ring in recent years.  It can be no coincidence that the car used in the shooting of three RUC constables some time ago was stolen in this area.  It can also be no coincidence that the lorry used in ramming a British Army Border checkpoint was stolen in this area.  A tractor stolen in the area recently was recovered in County Monaghan, believed to be destined for more destruction and death.</P>
    <P>This small group are also known to be involved in illegal eel netting and this has brought them into regular conflict with fishery protection officers and gardaí. There were attacks on two vehicles belonging to the ESB who have responsibility for these lakes, also on the home of a fishery officer, and there were many threatening telephone calls to his house. All this culminated with the officer and his family having to sell their house and leave the area while the criminals continued to net eels at will.</P>
    <P>The private cars belonging to two gardaí were damaged, I believe by these same subversives.  They subsequently attempted to burn out two squad cars and succeeded in setting one of them alight. In a recent search of the area, radio equipment and parts of rockets were discovered. It is believed that an anti-aircraft gun is in the locality and that it was fired in this area last year.  A trail from a post office robbery in Edgeworthstown led to this area.  The bank robbery at Kinnegad bore the imprint of this group.</P>
    <P>This group does not have the support of the local community of law abiding citizens, which is the case all over the country.  They are ashamed of these wrongdoers and the blot on their tranquil, picturesque village.</P>
    <P>The gardaí are doing their best with limited resources.  They have often risked life and limb in pursuit of justice but in <Col N="767" /> this case, so far, without success.  There is only one detective in the Garda district which covers this whole area.  The former sergeant in the village has not been replaced.  There is no Garda vehicle to help the two gardaí there to respond to calls or information.  These evil people must be brought to justice.  They can be brought to justice, but the Minister must give the Garda resources to put them behind bars.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister is here to respond to this debate.  If she is serious about fighting crime, she can demonstrate it.  These people must be put under surveillance on an around-the-clock basis which was successfully done in the Dublin area some time ago.  The Minister will be doing a service to the people of north Westmeath, indeed, to the people North and South if she enables the Garda to successfully prosecute these people and put them behind bars.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>): The incident which Deputy McGrath raised this evening is the subject of an ongoing Garda investigation. For the information of the House I can confirm that on 17 May 1993 the gardaí at Multyfarnham station received a report that gunfire had been heard on the shore of Lough Derravaragh in the Mornington area.  This area was cordoned off without delay by the Garda and the Army and a major search operation was undertaken. The Garda authorities informed me that a quantity of spent ammunition rounds was recovered in the course of the search and that these are currently undergoing forensic examination.  I understand that the ammunition is of a high calibre which is normally associated with subversive rather than criminal groups.  It has never been the practice for Ministers for Justice to report to the House on the progress of specific Garda investigations, and I do not intend to depart from that practice. All I will say is that the incident in question and other incidents are under continuing <Col N="768" /> and urgent Garda investigation in an effort to apprehend the persons involved.</P>
      <P>In my contribution to the recent debate on Northern Ireland in this House I reaffirmed the Government's commitment to providing the Garda Síochána with the resources they required to deal effectively with subversive groups such as the Provisional IRA.  I also outlined the successes achieved against such groups in terms of criminal convictions and arms recovered.  I know that Deputies will wish to join me in congratulating the Garda Commissioner on a further very significant Garda find last night of so called barrackbuster mortars, mortar components and equipment used to make them at Manorcunningham, County Donegal.  The barrackbuster has been used in a number of IRA operations this year which resulted in loss of life and considerable damage to property.  I am satisfied that this find, together with recent finds at Kilcock and other centres will represent a significant logistical setback to bombmakers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): There has been a series of reports in the media and I would like the Minister, if he can, to clarify some points.  I presume that in the normal way he will have a prepared script but if my questions are not answered in the script, perhaps the Minister will answer them on an impromptu basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Were there meetings, formal or informal, between Lord Grey and the Taoiseach? Were there meetings between officials of the Minister's Departments and their counterparts in the United Kingdom or meetings between his officials and people employed with Cable and Wireless?  Were there meetings between Telecom employees and employees of Cable and Wireless?  If any such meeting took place, will the Minister outline the agenda and the nature of the relationship, putative or otherwise, <Col N="769" /> explored between the parties?  Will the Minister tell us why there was no reference to such contacts in the debate last week on the motion in the name of Deputy O'Malley when the Minister took the opportunity to give what we thought was a very full and open account of his attitude towards Telecom Éireann?</P>
    <P>What is the Minister's view on the relationship between Telecom Éireann and a telecommunications company in the United Kingdom or in another EC member state?  Does he favour a joint venture, an exchange of technology or some kind of partnership relationship in the medium to long term, taking into account that while Telecom Éireann is a very large company in this country, it is not a very big international player in terms of communications compared with the major private and state companies in other EC countries?</P>
    <P>On the question of ownership, is there substance to the report that part of the discussion at whatever level dealt with the possibility of Cable and Wireless purchasing 25 per cent of Telecom Éireann? Will the Minister comment on the question of the ownership of Telecom Éireann?  Does he think that Telecom Éireann should remain in State ownership? Is his definition of State ownership that the total shareholding should be held by the Government or would he envisage that, for reasons of capitalisation, for the payment of debt or for any other good or valid commercial reason, a minority stakeholding could be acquired by a company such as Cable and Wireless?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I announced yesterday, arising out of an approach from Cable and Wireless with a view to establishing mutually beneficial links with Telecom.  I decided in the first place to obtain the views of Telecom before giving detailed consideration to any proposals that might be made.  Arising from this I am aware that talks have taken place between Telecom Éireann <Col N="770" /> management and Cable and Wireless on the possibility of a joint venture or some other form of strategic alliance without any commitment by either side or by me.</P>
      <P>The basis of these discussions are within the framework of the Programme for a Partnership Government.  The programme states:</P>
      <P>We will implement the principles regarding State enterprise set out in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, and guarantee that the main strategic utilities and enterprises remain in the ownership of the Irish people, while having the freedom to enter joint ventures with the private and co-operative sectors.  We intend to ensure that strong public companies will also provide value for money to the consumer.  And we are also committed to the principle that there must be adequate rewards for achievement coupled with penalties for failure.</P>
      <P>The programme also states that the Government in seeking to provide a first class telecommunications service in Ireland will &ldquo;encourage and support Telecom Éireann in developing their overseas business, with a view to enabling Telecom become a significant international Telecom organisation&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>To achieve these strategic objectives it is necessary for Telecom Éireann in the normal course of its operations to seek out business opportunities with other international telecommunication organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that context, and on that understanding, preliminary discussion were entered into by Telecom with Cable and Wireless.  The discussions which have taken place so far are preliminary and have not focused on any specific proposals. There is no question of an offer in regard to 25 per cent and at the State Sponsored Bodies Committee today, the chief executive of Telecom Éireann categorically denied that Cable and Wireless made any proposals about buying out part of the company.  The idea was not <Col N="771" /> even discussed.  Negotiations have not taken place in relation to any aspect of Telecom's business.</P>
    <P>It would be premature to speculate on the outcome of the discussions between Cable and Wireless and Telecom Éireann at this stage.  As the preliminary discussions come to a conclusion both sides will review the position to determine if advantageous opportunities exist.  As a result of those discussions the matter may not be taken further.  I will await the view of the board of Telecom Éireann on that matter.  They will be properly briefed at that stage and I will then report the matter to the Government.  The meetings will be of a technical or operational nature to determine whether compatibilities or synergies exist between the two companies.  That will be checked out with other Telecom organisations which Telecom regard as of potential benefit to it.  No meetings have taken place between officials of my Department and Cable and Wireless.  Representations to my Department were immediately passed to Telecom so that the board could be informed of any developments and it could form a view and report back to me. A chain of command exists in that regard.</P>
    <P>In relation to commercial semi-State companies, the management consider operational matters and a clear undestanding of the framework within which they operate is stated in the Programme for Government.  That framework has not been breached in any form and management, when it concludes its discussions, will bring the matter to the board's attention, the board will form a view and then contact me.  It would be premature at this stage to speculate on the outcome of those discussions.  When the discussions are concluded I will gladly deal with the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that neither the Minister nor the Minister of State at the Department of Education are present to reply to this debate.  This matter was raised in the House last Thursday by my colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, but since then the difficulties at Saggart school have escalated.  Essentially, the problem revolves around the fact that on 30 September last Saggart school had 92 pupils which, apparently, qualified it for a principal and two assistant teachers but within a day of the applicable date, on 1 October, the school had 94 pupils which entitles it to a principal and three assistants.  I am asking the Minister as I have done by way of parliamentary question and through contacts with her office and her officials not to allow bureaucratic nonsense to intervene, not to allow a teacher to be removed from the school and placed on the panel.</P>
      <P>Saggart is a small village.  The school has 95 pupils at present and the parents are very reasonable people.  However, they are so annoyed that bureaucracy and red tape that do not make sense are depriving them of a teacher, thus reducing their school to a three teacher school, that with effect from yesterday, they have withdrawn all the pupils from the school.  That is a serious matter in a small, close-knit community.  Unfortunately, the Minister for Education is not present, but I would ask her to meet the parents tomorrow as a matter of urgency to discuss the position and to agree to allow the school retain its principal and three assistant teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few months ago the State spent £70,000 on refurbishing the school to maintain it as a four-classroom school.  It is crazy and a waste of public money a few months later to remove one teacher <Col N="773" /> and, consequently, the necessity for an additional classroom.  The school will not be viable as a three teacher school.  Many parents have told me that if it is reduced to a three teacher school they will send their children to a larger school because they do not believe the children would receive an appropriate standard of education in such a small school, the whole ethos of the school would change.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister for Education, through her colleague, Deputy Cowen, to meet the parents tomorrow and to put a stay on Mr. King, who is a popular teacher, being placed on the panel.  Saggart is a small but developing area.  Ballymore Homes have recently started a housing development of 600 houses there.  The Minister stated last Thursday that if it were a school in a developing area, exceptions could be made.  Saggart is a developing area.  Those 600 houses will obviously bring a large influx of new students to the school.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to retain the extra teacher and avoid the unpleasantness which will arise otherwise in the community between the school authorities and the parents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Harney for allowing me to share her time. As she stated, I raised this matter last Thursday.  I tried then to convey the depth of feeling among the parents in the relatively small community of Saggart in regard to this issue.  The Minister deputised the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry to reply to the debate and that was acceptable.  However, it is not acceptable that the Minister is not present tonight especially having regard to the unfortunate dispute that was provoked by her intransigence in this matter.  She is not the type of politician who would miss a photo opportunity and there is an inviting one for her now on the picket line with the parents involved.  This matter deserves the attention of the Minister personally. She is a Dublin Minister and could have <Col N="774" /> come in here this evening to answer for her portfolio.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Harney said, parents in Saggart are reasonable people.  It is regrettable in the extreme that this dispute has been provoked.  It is a somewhat odd dispute in its genesis in that there was more than the complement of children required for the retention of the fourth teacher.  That may require some probing but, in any event, there is a compelling case for the retention of that fourth teacher.  I am aware that the Minister exercised such flexibility in a school in Marlborough Street.</P>
      <P>Saggart is a growing area with major expansion planned.  Much money has been spent on the school and it is desirable that it should not be reduced to a three teacher school.  I plead with the Minister to intervene because this is a case of bureaucracy gone mad.  There is a compelling argument to resolve this problem without any more ado.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>): I wish to apologise on behalf of the Minister who is unable to attend this Adjournment debate.</P>
      <P>I understand that parents of pupils in St. Mary's national school, Saggart have withdrawn their children from school because the post of the fourth teacher in the school will be discontinued as from the beginning of the next school year next September.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies will appreciate, it is possible to administer staffing arrangements for national schools in an orderly way only on the basis of rule.  Any other arrangement would be unworkable in a system of over 3,000 schools.  The basic features of the relevant rules are, first, that the staffing is determined by reference to the number of pupils on roll on 30 September of the preceding year. Second, there is a prescribed number of pupils required for each teaching post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of St. Mary's national school, there were 92 pupils enrolled in the school on 30 September 1992.  This <Col N="775" /> enrolment warrants a staff of principal plus two assistant teachers for the year 1993-94 school year.  An enrolment of at least 94 pupils was required on that date in order to retain the post of third assistant. Incidentally, the enrolment in the school in the preceding year, 30 September 1991, was 105 and the year before that again 110.</P>
    <P>I should also mention that the school has, additionally, the services of a remedial teacher on a shared basis.</P>
    <P>The only exceptions that can be made from the general staffing arrangements are in the case of developing schools or where the Department's guidelines on maximum class sizes are being breached. The Department would be prepared to examine the school's position in September next in the context of maximum class size or developing school status. However, the information available to the Department would not indicate that <Col N="776" /> either of these conditions is likely to be met.</P>
    <P>The Minister very much much regrets that the parents have decided to picket the school and to withdraw their children from classes as from yesterday, 24 May. Such action can achieve nothing and it is their own children who will suffer most. As I have indicated, it is not possible to depart from the general arrangements in the case of individual schools.  The Minister appeals to parents to lift their pickets so that their children can resume their education.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the loss of a teaching post is always a matter of concern to a school and to parents and the Minister is willing therefore to arrange for a senior official of her Department to meet the parents if they wish to discuss the matter further.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.05 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 26 May 1993.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 31 and 33 together.</P>
      <P>The Common Agricultural Policy reform arrangements decide by the EC Council of Ministers last June provide that suckler cow premium payments shall be subject to a quota applied at individual producer level.  The individual quotas are based on the number of suckler cows in respect of which premium payments were made in 1992.  Consequently farmers who so wished have had an opportunity to increase their herds to maximise their quotas.  As part of the Common Agricultural Policy reform arrangements the rates of premium will also be increased substantially in three annual stages over 1992 rates.  The overall effect of the new arrangements, therefore, will be a considerable increase in premium payments to farmers.</P>

My view and, indeed, the view of the EC Council of Ministers, is that <Col N="570" /> these payments make a valuable contribution to the maintenance of populations in rural areas and as such will continue to be funded by the EC Community under the FEOGA guidance element for the Structural Funds.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26, 39, 44, 46, 63 and 79 together.</P>
      <P>The increase in the differential between the rate of grant for conifers and broadleaved planting introduced for the private sector in 1992 has lead to more broadleaved planting.  A mere 3 per cent private planting in 1991 was of broadleaved species.  In 1992 this percentage increased to 10 per cent.  While this is a welcome development I am still not satisfied with the level of broadleaved planting and it is my intention to promote further increases in the planting of broadleaved species in future years.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28, 35, 37, 59, 76, 88 and 140 together.  The report of the expert group on the food industry was received by me on 21 April.  As I indicated at that time I regard the report as a milestone in the development of the Irish food industry and I believe that it will mark the beginning of a new and potentially very significant growth phase in the sector.</P>
      <P>I have just completed a full examination of the detailed recommendations contained in the report, including those in the minority report submitted by one member of the expert group, and I will shortly submit my proposals on them to the Government.  As Deputies will appreciate until this has been done it would be quite inappropriate for me to provide details of the specific actions which I am proposing in relation to all or any of the recommendations.</P>
      <P>However I can say in relation to the recommendation for a Single Operational Programme for the Food Industry in the next round of Structural Funds that on the basis of the commitment given in this regard in the Programme for a Partnership Government my Department has already commenced work on the preparation of such a programme.</P>
      <P>The Capital costs relating to decentralisation are a matter for the Office of Public Works.  My Department is responsible for costs relating to furnishings, telecommunications etc., which were as follows in the case of the decentralisation to Cavan:</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to implement a coherent four year bovine TB eradication programme with the support of Community funding and subject to the conditions attaching to those funds. Agreement was reached with the EC Commission in regard to the relevant conditions in October 1992 which included testing under contract by private practitioners and changed arrangements and stricter interpretation in respect of pre-movement testing.  However, because of budgetary limits on the EC veterinary fund delays have arisen in having the programme approved for Community funding.  I am pressing for an immediate increase in the level of the EC veterinary fund to enable appropriate support to be made available.  The draw down of EC funding will facilitate the <Col N="578" /> introduction of a number of additional elements to the programme and a reduction in disease levies.  Meanwhile, I have recently introduced a reduction of some £2 million in disease levies paid by farmers.</P>
    <P>A sum of £43.5 million has been allocated in the Book of Estimates to cover the running costs of the programme for 1993.  The exact format of the programme including grant structure of this year's scheme will bw determined by the timing of the availability of EC funding. However, the intention is to have a full round of testing in 1993 and this is proceeding smoothly.  Where reactors are identified and removed, the reactor grant system bridges the gap between salvage price of the reactor and the replacement cost of the animal.  Reactor grants are adjusted periodically in line with changes in market prices.</P>
    <P>Most of our EC partners have progressed their eradication programme to an advanced stage.  The broad format of our eradication scheme is similar to those operative in other EC countries and is more than sufficient to protect our trading position.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34, 53 and 65 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Virtually every specification issued by <Col N="580" /> the Farm Development Service of my Department gives details of low fire-risk construction for farm buildings, specifying concrete floors, tanks, slats and walls together with structural steel frames and roofs of cement-fibre sheets or metal cladding.  Many of these specifications give low-risk construction as the only grant-aidable option.  However for other buildings, including many types of animal house, timber construction is also an option for those who wish to choose it. The buidings use mature Irish timber, and its right that farmers can choose this option.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that the building control regulations are concerned only with the safety of people within buildings and not the preservation of the buildings themselves.  Because of very low occupancy, low fire-risk construction and easy escape routes, the risk to life from fire in farm buildings is exceptionally low.</P>
    <P>It is precisely because of this very low risk that my Department has been in consultation with the Department of the Environment for some months to seek modifications to the building control regulations as they apply to farm buildings. Our mutual aim is to ensure the continuance of high building standards combined with the minimum necessary control and regulation.</P>

    <P>It is not possible to establish any corelationship between job losses in the food industry and food imports.  Neither it is possible to calculate with any degree of accuracy how much of these imports could have been produced here.  However, it should be noted that the overall increased freedom of international trade in food which now exists, in particular within the EC, has enabled us to increase our exports of food products very significantly.</P>

      <P>I have no plans to restrict the importation of tropical hardwoods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I share the concerns of many people throughout the world at loss of tropical forest, it is important to appreciate that the issue is a complex <Col N="584" /> one and is not amenable to simple solutions. It is estimated, for example, that international demand for and trade in tropical hardwoods accounts for only 20 per cent of felling.  Land clearance for farming is the major contributory factor to the felling of this trees.  It is also vital to have regard to the particular social and economic circumstances of the peoples who live in tropical forest areas in addressing the issue of tropical deforestation.</P>
    <P>The best prospect for achieving progress in this area lies in international co-operation, where Irerland, in concert with other consuming countries and with the producers of tropical hardwoods, can play its part in finding workable approaches to the problem.  This already occurs within the framework of the EC and UN-related organisations such as the International Tropical Timber Organisation &mdash; ITTO.  Ireland can much more usefully contribute towards a solution to this problem by involvement in such multilateral approaches which reflect the reality and dimensions of the issue itself, than by taking unilateral actions which would have little or no practical effect.</P>

      <P>My Department has responsibility for the FEOGA Guidance measures under the Community Support Framework for Ireland covering the period 1989-1993.  The measures are divided into two areas&mdash; (a)  Regional Operational Programmes <Col N="585" /> specific to Ireland of which there are four: Control of Farmyard Pollution; Rural Development which includes schemes for animal production, alternative enterprises; agri-tourism, horticulture, research, development and marketing in the food industry, small and community enterprises, forestry, human resources and rural infrastructure; Forestry; Western Package. (b)  Horizontal schemes applicable on a Community-wide basis mainly: Disadvantaged Areas' Compensatory Payments; Farm Improvement Programme and Marketing and Processing schemes related to Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
      <P>Total public funding for these measures over the five year period amounts to £1,085 million with £640 million being provided by the EC Structural Funds and the balance of £445 million coming from the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>In addition, activities under my Department also benefit from a number of Community Initiatives &mdash; in particular LEADER under which EC funding of approximately £21 million has been allocated to Ireland in the 1991-1993 period.</P>
      <P>Other Community initiatives impacting on my Department include INTER-REG and STRIDE under which EC funding of £5.5 million and £0.5 million respectively has been allocated in the 1991-1993 period.</P>
      <P>Operational programmes under the control of other Departments also benefit the agriculture and food areas and details of these are contained in the Community Support Framework for Ireland which was published by the European Commission in 1989.</P>
      <P>I expect that most of these measures, but excluding the now terminated Western Package, will be included in the programmes to be operated under the next round of Structural Funds.  The level of funding for the individual areas I have outlined will have to await developments on the global allocation to my Department.</P>

I expect that the allocation for my Department will reflect the importance of agriculture, food, forestry and the rural economy generally in Irish life.</P>

      <P>The recent reform of the Common Agricultural Policy makes provision for land to be set aside in the arable sector.  Subject to certain conditions this land may be used to grow tillage crops provided that they are used for non-food purposes. Such uses would include the manufacture of bio-diesel or ethanol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The <i>Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-1997</i> indicated that the use of appropriate alternative energy sources will be promoted.  In that regard, I am anxious to see some developments in this country in bio-fuel production which may afford growers an outlet for crops grown on set-aside land.  Research is being undertaken by Teagasc on the possibilities of utilising tillage crops in the manufacture of transport bio-fuels.  The Department of Transport, Energy and Communications has a function in relation to alternative fuels.  The Minister of State <Col N="588" /> at that Department, Deputy Noel Treacy, with the support of the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Liam Hyland, has recently set up a committee which will consider the potential for energy use of biomass including bio-fuels.

While it is as yet too early to say, I am hopeful that these contacts may enable a formula to be found which will resolve this issue to the satisfaction of all concerned. I think it would be unhelpful if I were to comment further at this stage. In the meantime, none of the trees in the wood has been felled and the conditions attaching to the relevant authorisations granted by the local authority and my own Department would preclude <Col N="591" /> any such felling before November next.</P>

      <P>The bovine TB eradication programme has to be considered in the context that 97 per cent of herds are free of the disease and the incidence of infection in animals has been reduced to less than 1 per cent.  On the basis that improvements can be made in the technological aspects, further <Col N="593" /> reductions can be anticipated in this residual disease incidence.</P>
      <P>In evaluating the expenditure on bovine TB eradication account must be taken of the essential role which the scheme plays in preserving export outlets for livestock and livestock products.  In this regard, the eradication programme is both necessary and value for money. An independent study undertaken by Professor Seamus Sheehy confirmed the view that the eradication scheme has been extremely cost beneficial.</P>

      <Quest>if he has written to the Polish authorities to express the Government's concerns at the absence of any law to prevent the trafficking in radioactive substances, following the arrest of three smugglers of uranium and other radioactive materials in the city of Rzeszow in April 1993.</Quest>

      <P>While I am not aware of the details of the case referred to by the Deputy, the Government would be concerned at any developments that might lead to proliferation of materials, such as uranium, which might be used in the manufacture of nuclear weapons.  If the Deputy can provide further details, I will undertake to make additional inquiries.</P>
      <P>There is a responsibility on all governments which are parties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to be particularly vigilant in ensuring that their territories are not used as conduits for illegal trading in nuclear materials.  Poland is a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.  It, like Ireland, is also a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group, an informal group of like-minded States which co-operates in controlling exports of nuclear materials and technology.  The Nuclear Suppliers Group provides a framework in which efforts to combat the evasion of national export controls can be co-ordinated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the current legal position in Poland concerning trade in nuclear and related materials, I understand that, under the provisions of a special law <Col N="601" /> adopted in 1986, all fissionable material can only enter or leave Poland, or be moved anywhere within the country, under licence.  This 1986 law is additional to legislation which is part of the general customs law, prohibiting trade in nuclear materials without a special licence.  Comprehensive draft legislation is now before the Polish Parliament, and will be considered at Committee Stage later this week, setting out in a unified law the requirements to control trade in nuclearrelated goods, including chemical and bacteriological materials as well as missile technology and other technologies provided for in international agreements to which Poland is a party.</P>

      <P>Ireland signed the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child on 29 September 1990 and ratified it on 28 September 1992.  In accordance with Article 49, the Convention entered into force in Ireland on 28 October 1992.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of Article 44 of the Convention, each State Party undertakes to submit to the Committee on the Rights of the Child established by the Convention reports on the measures adopted to give effect to the rights contained in the Convention and on progess made on the enjoyment of those rights.  The initial report is to be submitted within two years of the entry into force of the Convention and further reports every five years thereafter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first national report by Ireland is, <Col N="602" /> therefore, due on 28 October 1994.  Work on its preparation is in hand.</P>

      <P>It is the established international practice that on the occasion of an official or State visit gifts are exchanged between host and guest.  I can confirm to the Deputy that in conformity with this longstanding practice, I have exchanged gifts of a modest kind with my hosts in the course of the various official visits I have made abroad since taking up office last January.</P>
      <P>It is also the practice &mdash; which I believe is largely out of courtesy to the other parties involved &mdash; not to give details of such gifts.  I propose to adhere to this practice.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy however, that I have received no gifts which breach the standing Government Procedure Instructions in this matter.  I would also recall that the Programme for a Partnership Government undertakes to incorporate into the Ethics in Government Bill, which is in the course of preparation, the provisions of the Government Procedure Instructions in so far as they relate to the registration of gifts to office holders.</P>

      <P>Section 83 of the Finance Bill, 1993, will give rise to a cash flow gain to the Exchequer in 1993 which is estimated at £145 million.  This amount will be credited in total against the November/ December VAT liability of the traders concerned.  The bulk of the advance payments will be dealt with in accordance with the mechanism established by section 83 (a) of the Bill, with only a small amount under the section 84 mechanism.  Due to the change in the VAT payments pattern as a result of the abolition of payment of VAT at the point of entry for intra-Community imports it is difficult to make a breakdown between the two.  However, it is estimated that not more than £5 million will be refunded through section 84 of the Bill.</P>

      <P>The Pensions Act (No. 25 of 1990) which I introduced in 1990 provides for a wide range of measures to protect members of occupational pension schemes.  The Act sets out the duties and responsibilities of trustees who are charged with the responsibility of looking after members' interests.  Trustees of funded pension schemes are required to properly invest the resources of the scheme to secure member's pension rights.</P>
      <P>The funding standard set out in the Pensions Act is designed to protect members' interests ensuring that, at a minimum, the scheme has sufficient funds to secure the pension rights members have built up.  Trustees must demonstrate the level of a scheme's funding to the Pensions Board through the submission of an actuarial funding certificate, signed by an actuary, at least every three and a half years.</P>
      <P>The legislation requires that investment of the scheme's assets in the employer's business, or in any one shareholding or property, which exceeds 20 per cent, cannot be taken into account for the purpose of meeting the standard.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, trustees are required to disclose to members of schemes any such investment which exceeds 5 per cent of the scheme's assets.</P>
      <P>The Pensions Board which I set up to supervise the implementation of the Act monitors the situation in relation to the investment powers of trustees and keeps them under review in the light of developments in pensions investment generally. The Board also advises me where change is necessary.</P>
      <P>Arising from the Budget Statement of the Minister for Finance, discussions are taking place with representatives of Irish Pension Funds with a view to investment by funds in job-creating projects in Ireland.  The Irish Association of Pension Funds have accepted in principle the Minister for Finance's proposals and discussions are continuing.</P>

      <P>Class D rate of Social Insurance provides cover for Widow's Contributory Pension, Orphan's Contributory Allowance, Deserted Wife's Benefit and Occupational Injuries Benefits and is payable by certain permanent and pensionable employees in the public service.</P>
      <P>I made provision in the 1989 Social Welfare Act to extend the Widow's (Non-Contributory) Pension Scheme to cover widowers with dependent children. Prior to that there had been no specific schemes for widowers.  This was expanded in the 1990 Social Welfare Act by the introduction of the Lone Parent's Allowance which made provision for the various categories of lone parents including both widowers and separated fathers.</P>
      <P>The issue of extending social insurance cover to widowers generally arises for consideration in the context of draft proposals published by the EC Commission for the adoption of a further directive to extend the principle of equal treatment for men and women to the remaining areas of social security including pensions. The EC is continuing its examiination of these proposals.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the cost of extending to widowers the present social insurance arrangements would be around £25 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>The question of social insurance cover for widowers is also being examined by the National Pensions Board in the context of its proposals for a new national pensions system.

This pass entitles certain cetegories of incapacitated people who are unfit to travel alone, and any other person over age 16 who accompanies them, to free travel. The main categories of people to whom a companion travel pass is issued are those in receipt of a blind pension from my Department or a disabled person's maintenance allowance from a health board, and who satisfy certain qualifying conditions.  Such free travel passes are not issued to travelling companions in their own right.</P>
      <P>I have recently extended the free travel scheme further to enable persons who are in receipt of an invalidity pension and who are wheelchair bound to qualify for the companion pass, with effect from 1 June 1993.  This extension is intended to overcome the special difficulties that invalidity pensioners in wheel-chairs have in travelling alone on public transport.</P>

    <P>Figures for 1992 are not yet available.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that there is no evidence to suggest that the incidence of drug abuse in Athlone differs significantly from that in other provincial towns of similar size.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the House that the drugs situation continues to receive priority attention from a law enforcement point of view.  In Athlone town a crime prevention unit consisting of four gardaí has been set-up who are employed on a regular basis on drug related duties.  Of course all members of the Garda Síochána deal with law enforcement aspects of <Col N="612" /> drug misuse within their operational area and there are gardaí specifically trained in this area in every Garda division.  In this respect I am informed by the Garda authorities that a number of gardaí from the Athlone Garda District have received specialised training in drug law enforcment.</P>
    <P>The allocation of manpower and other resources to specialist units such as drug enforcement is a matter for the Garda authorities and they have informed me that they are satisfied that the resources and manpower available at present are adequate to deal with any drug problems in the Athlone Area.  The Garda authorities will however, continue to monitor the situation in the area and will take whatever further measures that may be necessary to deal with the problem.</P>

      <P>My recent remarks in relation to absenteeism in the Garda Síochána in an interview for the magazine <i>Garda Review</i> attracted considerable media attention. They were also misrepresented.  The purpose of my remarks was not to exaggerate the extent of the problem, as has been suggested.  Rather if was to highlight the complementary roles of Garda Management <Col N="613" /> and the Employee Assistance scheme in dealing with the causes of absenteeism and to stress the effects that certain causes of absenteeism have on the families of those affected.</P>
      <P>I did not set out to compare the level of absenteeism in the Garda Síochána with that in other areas of the public or private sector, I was simply making the point that the level of absenteeism struck me, as sombody coming afresh to the situation, as significant: that there were certain contributory factors and that it is an issue which certainly deserves attention. To put this into context, the average level of absenteeism in 1991 was approximately 10.84 days per member of the Force.  While comparable figures for 1982 and 1972 are not available, I understand from the Garda authorities that preliminary figures for 1992 indicate a reduction on the total level of absenteeism. This may show that measures introduced to deal with the matter are having positive results.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that as Minister for Justice, I should be concerned about the negative impact which absenteeism has on policing.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that while there has been a slight increase in drug abuse in Finglas South a number of measures have been taken to counteract the drug problem in the area.  In addition, there is close liaison between local gardaí, the Divisional Task Force based at Santry and the Central Drug Unit in Harcourt Square which ensures an effective and co-ordinated response to any drugs problems in the area.  This has resulted in a number of detections of drug related offences in the Garda Division that includes Finglas.</P>

      <P>I can confirm that the Government is aware of the problems which face employers, including those operating in manufacturing industry, in terms of the price and availability of employers liability insurance.  The Government is committed to doing what it can to improve matters.  In particular, I am concerned about the level of personal injury compensation in Ireland, the cost of which compensation has a significant impact on the cost of insurance for business and private citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may be aware that the Liability Standing Committee of the Irish Insurance Federation examines cases where there is difficulty in obtaining <Col N="619" /> employers liability cover on the strict understanding that it cannot guarantee that cover will be provided.</P>
    <P>Before any case can be submitted to the Federation for consideration it is necessary that at least half the market (approximately 12 companies including Lloyds) be approached without success. Evidence of these approaches (e.g. a letter from a broker) together with a brief synopsis of the risk should be forwarded to the Irish Insurance Federation, Russell House, St. Stephen's Green, Dublin 2.  I must emphasise that, while this arrangement is reasonably successful, no guarantee can be given that cover will be forthcoming in each individual case.</P>

      <P>Dublin Corporation have sought funding under the remedial works scheme in respect of 13 of their housing estates, including Swansnest Court, in respect of which application was made in October 1990. The ten estates to which they have given the highest priority have been designated for funding under the scheme, two of them recently on the basis of priority given to them by the Corporation in April 1993.  Due to the financial commitments outstanding on approved corporation projects, and the high level of demand for <Col N="621" /> assistance under the scheme from other authorities, it is not possible, at this stage, to designate further corporation projects.</P>

      <P>A full progress report on action already taken or in train to implement the conclusions of UNCED will be given in the second review of the Environment Action Programme, which I intend to publish in the near future.</P>
      <P>Relevant measures developed by the Government in the past year include:</P>
      <P>&mdash;a renewed commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to Protection and enhancement of the environment, and in particular, to building on and speeding up implementation of the national environment action programme;</P>
      <P>&mdash;related to this, a two thirds increase in 1993 in the allocation for water and sanitary services, which is the largest and most urgent financial requirement of the environment action programme;</P>
      <P>&mdash;progress on establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency which is designed to improve the organisation of environmental regulation and monitoring in Ireland;</P>
      <P>&mdash;continued development of regulatory controls, including new regulations on water pollution, vehicle emissions and emissions from large combustion plants;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;continued improvement of information on the environment, including <Col N="625" /> new regulations on access to information;</P>
    <P>&mdash;completion of a preliminary national strategy, which I will publish shortly, for abatement of Irish CO2 emissions; and</P>
    <P>&mdash;establishment of an Environment Policy Research Centre within ESRI to address economic aspects of environment policy.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Programme for a Partnership Government provides that environment considerations will be integrated into the key sectoral areas identified in the EC Fifth Environment Action Programme: industry, transport, energy, tourism and agriculture.  Following publication of the report of the Green 2000 Advisory Committee, which will assist in this process, the Taoiseach has asked me to establish an agenda for advancing environmental integration with other Ministers concerned and to report to Government later this year.</P>
    <P>Finally, Ireland is supporting ongoing action within the European Community, particularly through the EC Fifth Environment Action Programme, to respond to those commitments of UNCED requiring international co-ordination.</P>

His entire 1992 cattle headage grant is being off-set against an overpayment of 1990 suckler cow (the balance of which overpayment will be recovered from 1993 grants).</P>
      <P>His 1992 special beef premium is being validated by computer at present and if found in order payment will be made as soon as possible.  He applied in the November/December application period for the 1992 suckler cow premium scheme and his application will be processed in due course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 167, 176 and 189 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Livestock producers who are not applying for arable sector aid in 1993 need not submit maps with their area aid applications and should not accordingly have any problems with maps &mdash; over 75 per cent of such livestock producers are used to declaring forage areas under the <Col N="635" /> disadvantaged areas schemes and the requirement for them to declare the areas of their plots and blocks of land on the area aid applications this year should not, therefore, cause them any problems either.</P>
    <P>Livestock producers who are applying for arable sector aid in 1993 have to supply maps, of course, but I have arranged for an extension of the time within which they must submit those maps from 15 May to 31 May 1993.</P>
    <P>As for the simplified area aid application form, it will be posted out towards the end of this week and throughout next week to all cattle producers.  It will require each farmer to state only the numbers of any plots or blocks of land on his/her holding, the townland, district electoral division and county in which each plot or block is located, the total area of any commonage in which he/she owns a share, the share of that commonage which he/she owns and the area in acres of each plot or block of land on the holding actually used for forage area together with a total of that acreage and that total converted into hectares.  References that were in the original area aid application form to Ordnance Survey Sheet numbers of maps, to areas actually sown or set aside etc, to dates sowing ended, to whether each plot or block was farmed in 1991 and 1992, to crops sown in 1992 and to any years between 1987 and 1991 when each plot or block was tilled have all been dropped from the simplified form.</P>
    <P>Livestock farmers who have submitted the original area aid applications need not withdraw them, of course, when they receive the simplified forms.  As for the question of the slowing down of submission of applications because of the issue of the simplified forms I would make two points viz.</P>
    <P>1.  Livestock farmers will have until 1 July 1993 to submit these Applications.</P>
    <P>2.  My Department is sending Teagasc 25,000 simplified forms tomorrow so that any farmers who come to <Col N="636" /> them for assistance in filling up the simplified forms can be helped to do so pending receipt in the post by the livestock farmers of their simplified area aid applications.</P>
    <P>Given these arrangements, I do not believe the issue of the simplified forms will hinder any livestock farmers in submitting their applications but believe instead that it will help all such farmers to complete those applications accurately within the EC deadline.</P>

      <P>The deadline for receipt of area aid applications is laid down in an EC Council regulation.  In the case of those applying for arable sector aid or livestock farmers with land that had been ploughed at any time since 1 January 1987, the closing date for submission of applications was 15 May 1993. Applications can be accepted up to 3 June 1993 with a reduction in aid of 1 per cent for each working day that they are late. In the case of livestock producers with permanent pasture only, I secured an extension of the deadline in order to allow them to submit their area aid applications with the first livestock applications up to 1 July 1993.</P>

      <Quest>the Government's policy concerning proposals by the International Atomic Energy Agency to take 40kg. of irradiated enriched uranium from Iraqi research reactors to Chelyabinsk-65 in the Confederation of Independent States for reprocessing in view of the fact that at least three major leaks of radiation from Chelyabinsk-65 have occurred since 1950, making the nearby Techa lake the most radioactively contaminated lake in the world.</Quest>

      <P>I understand that the uranium in question is the property of the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, who are extremely anxious to remove this material from Iraq, in accordance with Resolution 687 of the Security Council of the United Nations, to ensure that it is not diverted to non-peaceful uses.  Most of the uranium involved is of Russian origin and the IAEA have been seeking a reprocessing plant willing to take it for the past two years.  I am aware that the transfer of the enriched uranium to Chelyabinsk-65 reprocessing plant is presently being considered as a solution to the problem but no final contract has yet been signed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="646" /> The IAEA, of which Ireland is a member, is very concerned with the advancement of nuclear safety as well as the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and I am satisfied that, whatever decision is taken with regard to the final destination of the uranium in question, the appropriate safety standards will be applied.  I understand that it would not represent a material change in the volume of material handled at the Chelyabinsk plant.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In the particular case referred to by <Col N="654" /> Deputy Shortall, that of Fiona Peel, a student who is repeating the Leaving Certificate Examination this year, the position is that an application for special consideration on the grounds of dyslexia was made to my Department on 11/11/92, by her school.  Samples of the candidate's written work and a report from the psychologist attached to the Association for Children and Adults with Learning Disabilities accompanied the application.</P>
    <P>The application was referred to my Department's Psychological Service for consideration.  The psychological report, dated 9/11/92, and the samples of the written work were carefully considered. Following this consideration my Department's psychologists expressed the opinion that, in all the circumstances, special consideration was not warranted.</P>

      <P>As I indicated to the House on 23 February, 1993, the educational needs of children with specific learning disability, sometimes referred to as dyslexia, are generally met within the ordinary school system, employing a variety of approches to suit individual needs, with the help, where appropriate, or remedial teachers.</P>
      <P>At present there are 945 remedial teacher posts assigned to national schools and 70 per cent of pupils in the country have the services of a remedial teacher.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to say that an additional 83 remedial posts are being allocated with effect from September of this year and these appointments will provide a significant extension to this service.  These posts form part of a broader commitment under the Programme for a Partnership Government to appoint 500 additional remedial teachers by September, 1996.</P>
      <P>The needs of children with a more acute specific learning disability are met by three special schools, two in Dublin and one in Cork.</P>

It is envisaged that the work will take about a week and the building will be reopened when its safety has been established.</P>
      <P>Arrangements are being made to ensure that examinations will not be disrupted.</P>
      <P>Asbestos panels were also removed during the summer of 1992 from Community schools at Ballyhaunis, Cabinteely, Tullow, Ramsgrange and from Ballymun Comprehensive school, and the buildings were certified as clear.  As a precautionary measure my Department has asked for an urgent report on the position in these schools.</P>

      <P>My Department is aware of the case mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The position is that the Health Authorities have specific responsibility for assessment of children and their referral for educational placement.  No referral has been made to date in this particular case.</P>
      <P>However, my Department has been in contact with the assessment agency involved with a view to determining the appropriate educational placement for the child.  When this is to hand, the question of enrolment in an appropriate school will be pursued.</P>

      <P>An additional 83 remedial teachers are being appointed with effect from September 1993.  Decisions have now been taken on the allocation of these new posts and the schools selected will be notified shortly.</P>
      <P>These appointments are being made, on the basis of priority of need, following the collection of data from schools by my Department's Primary Inspectorate.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the schools mentioned by the Deputy have not been selected for receipt of one of these 83 new posts. However, their needs may prove capable of being met through a sharing arrangement involving other schools in their areas which are receiving the service. This possibility will be examined as part of an ongoing review of the operation of the service nationwide.</P>
      <P>I should point out that three of the new posts are being allocated to County Wexford, resulting in a further seven schools receiving the service.  As a result of this allocation 64 per cent of pupils in County Wexford will have access to a remedial service.</P>
      <P>I will be keeping the question of further need in this area under review as part of a broader commitment to appoint 500 additional remedial teachers by September 1996.  The needs of all schools, will be considered in this context.</P>
