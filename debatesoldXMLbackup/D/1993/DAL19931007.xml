      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we commence the Order of Business proper I think the House would wish to express sympathy with the family of the late Cyril Cusack. It is fair to say he has brought great lustre to this country throughout his distinguished acting career both on the stage and as one of the Irish pioneers in the international film industry, an industry which is of increasing importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with everyone throughout the country in paying tribute to the late Cyril Cusack.  He certainly gained a worldwide reputation.  He was very prominent in the Irish film industry and in the whole arts area.  I knew him many years ago when I was involved differently in life.  He was a good personal <Col N="422" /> friend of mine.  I would like to express on behalf of the House deepest sympathy to his relatives.</P>

      <P>I, too, would like to associate myself with the expressions of regret and sorrow at the death of Cyril Cusack.  It is appropriate that this Dáil should concern itself with Irish people who serve this country in spheres other than politics.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats, I would like to be associated with the tributes paid to Cyril Cusack.  There is no doubt that for almost half a century Cyril Cusack epitomised all that was good in Irish theatre, Irish art and Irish life.  He had a unique Irish dimension to a very talented and great artistic gift.  He will be sorely missed by the theatre and Irish people in general. He has left to us a very rich legacy because he certainly extended the barriers of art and acting during his lifetime. He has left behind a fine body of good memories, high standards for a future generation of actors and a very talented family.  He has left all these gifts to the Irish nation and for all of that we would like to pay him tribute.</P>

      <P>I too would like on behalf of my Labour colleagues to be associated with the expressions of sympathy on the death of Cyril Cusack.  He was a fine actor and a fine performer in the best of Irish traditions.  As Deputy Quill has said, his legacy will live on because he has left behind a family of fine talent as I witnessed in the Gate Theatre as late as last Tuesday evening. On behalf of my colleagues I extend our sympathy to his family.</P>

      <P>There are two questions I would like to raise.  I note that the Government has again included the confiscation of criminal proceeds as part of its programme of Bills to be published some time this session.  May I ask the Taoiseach if he remembers that this was actually included in the Joint Programme for Government with the Progressive Democrats and has been promised on virtually every occasion in the Dáil when the Government's legislative programme has come up, yet has not been delivered? Is there any urgency in the Government's programme against crime in light of its failure to enact this legislation?</P>

      <P>Yesterday I asked the Taoiseach about the Ethics Bill but he did not tell me when it will be introduced.  I would appreciate if he could tell me now when it will be introduced.  Where do I find the voluntary register which the Taoiseach informed me yesterday was in place?  I have searched for it but have been unable to find it.

On the question of the register of Members' interests I said, on the first day I took over this job, that I voluntarily signed the register, but I did not see Deputy De Rossa or others rushing in madly behind me to declare their interests.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges has had a voluntary scheme in operation for quite some time and as soon as it decides on its future, it can be put into operation.</P>

    <Title>Criminal Procedure Bill, 1993: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn) Máire Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose that there will be filtering of applications to the Court of Criminal Appeal as happens, for example, in the neighbouring jurisdiction where the Home Secretary decides whether a case should be referred back <Col N="428" /> to the Court of Appeal.  I do not propose to place any restrictions or obstacles in the way of such applications.  Any convicted person who, after an ordinary appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal, stands convicted of an offence and who comes across fresh evidence will be able to apply direct to that court for a reexamination of the conviction or sentence, as appropriate.  I do not believe that this open access will prove unwieldly, but in any event the court is being given the power of summary disposal of frivolous or vexatious applications.</P>
      <P>The Martin Committee was of the view that in those rare cases in which matters come to light, casting substantial doubt on the correctness of a conviction, further recourse to the court system would be likely to prove inappropriate.  That is the one significant recommendation of the Martin Committee with which I cannot fully agree.  I am of the view that where it is alleged that a new or newly discovered fact shows that there has been a miscarriage of justice in relation to a conviction, it is appropriate to return to the courts on appeal to have the conviction quashed.  Only a court of appeal can overturn a conviction imposed by a court.  I am satisfied that the first choice of any person who has been convicted of an offence by the courts, and who has unsuccessfully appealed against the conviction would be, if a new fact comes to light, to appeal again to the Court of Criminal Appeal so that he or she could be vindicated by the criminal justice system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, in considering cases where a miscarriage of justice is alleged, it must be anticipated that not all fresh evidence might be admissible in a criminal court. I agree with the Martin Committee that in those cases there must be an alternative to the courts.  I am, therefore, providing a new statutory procedure for the consideration of applications for a pardon in such cases.  I expect that any necessary inquiries into the circumstances of such applications would usually be relatively straightforward, but I have made provision for the appointment <Col N="429" /> of a committee with full powers to deal with any difficult or complex cases.</P>
    <P>For the first time, and in line with the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government, there will be a statutory right to compensation where a miscarriage of justice is found, on the basis of new evidence, to have occurred. Of course the State can pay and indeed has paid compensation in the past in these exceptionally rare cases, but I think the House will agree that it is better to express this entitlement as a statutory right.  It will also comply fully with the requirement for such a statutory right contained in article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Ireland is a party, and will enable the Government to withdraw its reservation to article 14 which has, up to now, been necessary because of our system of <i>ex-gratia</i> compensation.</P>
    <P>I am also taking the opportunity presented by this Bill to consolidate and to a certain extent clarify the powers of the Court of Criminal Appeal.  These are at present contained in statutes of 1924 and 1928 and in Rules of Court and would, I believe, benefit from a degree of codification.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, a Cheann Comhairle, I might now turn briefly to the provisions of the Bill.  Section 2 provides for a second or subsequent application to the Court of Criminal Appeal where it is alleged that a new or newly discovered fact shows that there has been a miscarriage of justice in relation to the conviction or that the sentence is excessive.  Heretofore, as I already said, a person has had one chance to appeal based on the appeal provisions currently in existence and, if the appeal was lost, that was the end of the line.  No matter what facts he or she was able to produce later that cast a genuine and substantial doubt on the conviction, a further referral to the courts was not possible.</P>
    <P>The definition of newly discovered fact is a broad one and includes a fact known to the appellant at his or her trial or appeal, but the significance of which was not appreciated at the time.  The intention is not to permit appellants to reopen <Col N="430" /> arguments already put before the court. My concern is to ensure that our criminal appeal system has the flexibility to deal with the difficulties which can arise in appeals and the capacity to ensure that justice is done in every case.  That is why, in addition, I am providing that there will be no limit to the number of subsequent applications which can be made to the Court of Criminal Appeal, provided each application is supported by a new or newly discovered fact.</P>
    <P>The scope of an application is not being restricted to an allegation of a miscarriage of justice in relation to the conviction. Under section 2 an application may also be made to review a sentence on the basis of a new or newly discovered fact, while not contesting the conviction itself.  For example, a person convicted of an offence may be able to produce to the court a new fact that would tend to show that his or her part in the crime for which he or she was convicted was not as major as seemed likely during the trial. A reduction in the sentence might be appropriate, but as the conviction itself is not in doubt, simply the severity of sentence, the question of a miscarriage of justice does not arise.</P>
    <P>Section 3 consolidates the powers of the Court of Criminal Appeal currently contained in section 34 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, section 5 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1928, and in Order 86 of the Rules of the Superior Courts.  Those statutory provisions are being repealed by this Bill and the Rules of Court will need to be amended to take account of the new provisions.  Generally the section puts in simple modern terminology the jurisdiction of the Court of Criminal Appeal in relation to appeals but it does give the court some new powers.</P>
    <P>For example, in a significant departure from the existing powers of the Court of Criminal Appel, power is being given to the court in section 3 (3) to direct the Garda Commissioner, where an appeal is based on new or additional evidence, to carry out inquiries in order to see if further evidence ought to be adduced. The court's role will of course be to <Col N="431" /> adjudicate on the evidence presented to it and not to carry out an inquiry itself.</P>
    <P>Section 4 re-enacts in a modern format, with some additions, the provisions of the Courts of Justice Act, 1928, concerning retrial.  Where the Court of Criminal appeal orders a retrial the person concerned can be reindicted, retried and, if found guilty, sentenced for the offence for which he was retried.</P>
    <P>Section 5 deals with summary determination of appeals.  It has always been recognised that there must be some simple, straightforward system for dealing with frivolous or vexatious appeals. The existing Rules of the Superior Courts enable suspected frivolous or vexatious appeals to be scheduled for hearing without the transcript of the trial having been obtained.  Section 5 is a development of this, and provides a statutory procedure for dealing with clearly unmeritorious appeals.  Special provision is, of course, made to protect the rights of appellants. The procedure for summary determination will be invoked only where the registrar of the Court of Criminal Appeal believes that there is no substantial ground of appeal or, in the case of an application under the new procedure in section 2, that there is no <i>prima facie</i> evidence of a miscarriage of justice or an excessive sentence.  Of course the decision on the matter will be made by the court itself or by a judge of the court. In the latter case the appellant will be able to appeal to the full court.</P>
    <P>Section 6 applies the relevant provisions of this Bill to courts-martial including the right to reapply to the Courts-Martial Appeals Court on the basis of new evidence.</P>
    <P>I come now to section 7.  I have said already I considered that the courts system was the most appropriate forum for deciding whether there has been a miscarriage of justice.  However, we have to cater for the rare case where referral back to the court might not be possible. Section 7 deals with that situation.  One obvious example of where the pardon provisions would be the appropriate way in which an alleged miscarriage of justice <Col N="432" /> could be dealt with is where the new evidence was inadmissible in a court of law.</P>
    <P>To deal with such cases, section 7 provides a procedure whereby a convicted person who alleges that a new or newly-discovered fact shows that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, can petition the Minister for Justice with a view to the Government advising the President to grant a pardon under Article 13.6 of the Constitution.  There are two circumstances in which the procedure can be availed of.  First, as I just said, where persons who might otherwise return to the Court of Criminal Appeal under the new procedures introduced in this Bill find that their fresh evidence is inadmissible in a court of law and, second, where persons have been convicted and sentenced in the District Court.  It would not be practical to enable such persons to return to the relevant court of appeal, the Circuit Court, as no record is kept of proceedings in the District Court and appeals are by way of a complete rehearing.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice will have several options on receipt of a petition for a Presidential pardon.  These are, after making the necessary inquiries, first, inform the petitioner that the matters dealt with in the petition could appropriately be dealt with by means of an application to the Court of Criminal Appeal &mdash; as I said earlier, a return to the Court of Criminal Appeal should be the first choice where this is possible; second, inform the petitioner that no case has been made that a miscarriage of justice has occurred &mdash; this would be the option where the petition is clearly frivolous; third, recommend to the Government that it should advise the President to grant a pardon in respect of the relevant offence &mdash; this option would be relevant where an examination by the Minister, or a suitably qualified person commissioned by the Minister, shows that a miscarriage of justice has occurred; or fourth, recommend to the Government that it should appoint a committee to inquire into the case.</P>
    <P>Section 8 deals with the establishment <Col N="433" /> by the Government of the committee to inquire into an allegation that a miscarriage of justice has occurred.  In considering a petition for a pardon under section 7 the Minister for Justice can, as I just said, as one of her options, make her own inquiries or employ someone else such as a barrister or solicitor to make the inquiries necessary before arriving at a decision provided for in that section.  However, the Minister also has the option of appointing a committee to examine a petition for the grant of a pardon by the President and to report whether, in its opinion, the President should be advised to grant the pardon. Whether or not the President is so advised will remain, as it must under Article 13.6 of the Constitution, entirely a matter for the Government.</P>
    <P>I envisage that the appointment of a committee would be necessary only in particularly difficult cases and, therefor, rather than have a standing committee one will be appointed as necessary to inquire into an individual case.  This also gives flexibility in providing special expertise in a committee appropriate to a particular case.  The committee will be a tribunal within the meaning of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts, 1921 and 1979, and will, therefore, have all the powers of a tribunal set up under those Acts.</P>
    <P>Any person who has been the victim of a miscarriage of justice will have suffered a grievous wrong.  Nothing can fully compensate a person who has spent years in prison through no fault of his own, for his loss of freedom, loss of family life, and the effects of the imprisonment on his career and life generally.  They are lost years.  That said, the State can at least make some restitution through the award of monetary compensation to any person who can show beyond reasonable doubt that a new or newly discovered fact shows that there has been a miscarriage of justice in relation to his conviction. Section 9 gives a statutory right of compensation in those circumstances.  If the criteria are met compensation can be awarded either where the court of criminal appeal quashes a conviction or where <Col N="434" /> a pardon has been received as a result of a petition under section 7.</P>
    <P>The amount of compensation will be determined in each case by the Minister for Justice.  There is provision for an appeal to the High Court where there is dissatisfaction with the amount awarded by the Minister.  This will enable an independent and impartial assessment to be made in cases of dispute.</P>
    <P>When the Martin Committee was appointed, its terms of reference excluded it examining whether an uncorroborated inculpatory admission made by an accused to the Garda Síochána could be sufficient evidence to ground a conviction.  However, the Programme for a Partnership Government contains a commitment to examine the feasibility of prohibiting criminal convictions on the basis of uncorroborated confession evidence. The conclusions reached in that examination is that convictions can, in appropriate cases, safely be based on the evidence of a confession but that it is right there should be an additional safeguard. Accordingly, section 10 provides that where a confession of the accused is the sole evidence, this fact will be specifically brought to the attention of the jurors who will be required by the judge to have due regard to it in determining their verdict.</P>
    <P>Society had every reason to be outraged when a miscarriage of justice results in an innocent person serving a prison sentence. If it happened widely, public confidence in the criminal justice system would be seriously undermined, perhaps irreparably.  That is why this Bill is so important in that it will allow any alleged miscarriage of justice to be dealt with.  However, that is not the full story.  I venture the view that very little demoralises public opinion more than to see clearly guilty persons getting off, maybe on a technicality.  What I am saying is that we must be very careful not to put the type of obstacles in the way of the crime detecting and prosecuting agencies that could, through a series of well publicised cases, cause great public anger and a disrespect for the law generally, <Col N="435" /> resulting possibly in persons exacting retribution by taking the law into their own hands.  I mention these things by way of explaining the reason for section 10. The fact is that uncorroborated confessions can be good confessions and the possibility of their being used in evidence should not be excluded.</P>
    <P>I should remind the House that while a person is in custody there are very stringent regulations &mdash; embodied in the Treatment of Persons in Custody Regulations, 1987 &mdash; which must be complied with.  The member in charge of the station is given specific responsibility to see that these regulations are adhered to in order to ensure that the person in custody is not ill-treated and that a detailed record of the procedures followed is kept.  It is difficult to envisage oppressive treatment leading to false confessions taking place in the face of these regulations.</P>
    <P>In addition, when the recording of statements in Garda stations comes on stream, and eventually becomes widespread, any lingering doubt there might be over Garda questioning &mdash; and there should be no such doubt in the light of the regulations I have mentioned &mdash; can be put to rest.  Section 10 takes the sensible approach to the question of uncorroborated confession evidence by providing for the judge to advise the jury to have due regard to th absence of corroboration. No particular form of words has to be used by the judge &mdash; the judge can decide for himself or herself in the circumstances of each case.  The Martin Committee made a tentative suggestion as to the form of wording but I am satisfied that, because of the infinite variety of cases that can come before the courts, the precise terms of the advice should be left to the judge.</P>
    <P>Finally, I will say a few words about section 11.  In 1982 in the case of the <i>People (DPP) v. O'Shea,</i> the Supreme Court gave a literal interpretation to the provision of Article 34.4.3 of the Constitution which says that &ldquo;all&rdquo; decisions of the High Court may be appealed to the Supreme Court.  This not only gave persons convicted in the Central Criminal <Col N="436" /> Court a right of appeal direct to the Supreme Court, as an alternative to appealing to the Court of Criminal Appeal, but for the first time it gave the prosecution the right of appeal to the Supreme Court against convictions in the Central Criminal Court.  However, the terms of Article 34.4.3 provide that legislation may exclude decisions of the High Court from the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and that is what this section does in relation to the criminal jurisdiction of the High Court.  A saver is included to protect the prosecution's statutory right of appeal without prejudice to a verdict in favour of the accused.</P>
    <P>In effect, section 11 restores the right of appeal from the Central Criminal Court to what it was thought to be before the O'Shea case.  Persons convicted in the Central Criminal Court will continue to have a right of appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal, which is the court specially designed for that purpose, with the possibility of a subsequent reference to the Supreme Court on a point of law of exceptional public importance.  The prosecution will continue to have a right of appeal direct to the Supreme Court, without prejudice to the verdict in favour of the accused, on a point of law of exceptional public importance.</P>
    <P>This Bill is an important development in our criminal justice system.  It faces up to the difficult issue of allegations of miscarriage of justice.  It gives our courts the powers to deal with such allegations. It provides an alternative mechanism for cases which could not return to the courts.  It provides for compensation where a miscarriage of justice actually occurs.  It puts in place a new safeguard in the consideration of uncorroborated confessions.  Last but not least, it consolidates and updates the main powers and the role of the Court of Criminal Appeal.  This Bill will enhance public confidence in the criminal justice system and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill does not provide for all the recommendations of the Martin report, the report of the committee established to inquire into certain <Col N="437" /> aspects of criminal procedure, published in March 1990.  In so far as it does deal with certain provisions of that report it does not follow those provisions precisely.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference of the committee were first to examine whether there is need for a procedure whereby persons who have exhausted the normal appeals procedures can have their cases further reviewed and, if so, to make recommendations as to what procedure should be provided and in what circumstances it should apply.  Second, given that uncorroborated inculpatory admissions made by an accused to the Garda Síochána can be sufficient evidence to ground a conviction, the committee was to examine whether additional safeguards are needed to ensure that such admissions are properly obtained and recorded and to make recommendations accordingly.</P>
      <P>This Bill addresses the first part of the terms of reference but not the second part.  The Martin Committee made detailed recommendations in relation to safeguards for persons in custody and those recommendations should have been incorporated in this Bill.  I would ask the Minister to confirm that she will bring forward a further Bill dealing with the second part of the recommendations made by the Martin Committee without delay.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Martin Committee on producing a lucid and learned report which is easily readable and is of enormous assistance to those charged with the responsibility to legislate.  I might gently take the committee to task for stating that the submissions made to it led them to believe that the conviction in our courts and imprisonment of innocent persons in circumstances similar to those which have recently come to light in another jurisdiction is &ldquo;entirely unlikely&rdquo;. Human nature being what it is, this cannot be said with infallibility.  I have no other constructive criticism to make of the report and I am very impressed with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take this opportunity to praise the Judiciary for the way they have served <Col N="438" /> the country down through the years. Nonetheless, they have been and remain a group which is aloof from everyday life and are far removed from the realities of life as it affects most people.</P>
    <P>For example, judges generally are drawn from one social class.  They do not have to go through an interview process before appointment, as is the case in other jurisdictions.  The use of wigs in court sets them further apart from those on whom they sit in judgment.  The lack of judicial reform here is quite extraordinary given that the lead for reform in Britain is coming from the head of the judiciary, the Lord Chancellor.  Whereas I welcome the recent joint submission by the Bar Council and the Incorporated Law Society on the reform of the administration of the courts, and I published a Private Members Bill in 1986, the Reform of the Courts (Administration) Bill 1986 on this matter, I believe it is time for our leading judges to give example and leadership in reforming the courts and modernising them to deal with the realities of the needs of the justice system.  The only criticism of which I am aware of the joint submission by the Bar Council and the Incorporated Law Society has been made by the President of the High Court, if his comments were reported accurately.  The Judiciary has a role like ours as legislators.  The Judiciary is separate from the Executive and has a role to give leadership in reforming the administration of justice.  Since the courts, under the Constitution, are separated from the Executive and the Legislature a certain element of &ldquo;physician heal thyself&rdquo; must be involved in court administration reform.</P>
    <P>As a Deputy who supports extradition and the bringing to justice of terrorists and criminals generally it is undesirable to create an air of emergency around a specific court case.  This can have the effect of finding a person guilty before the trial.  In the neighbouring jurisdiction steps should be taken to try to redress this question of excited hearings.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the sections of the Bill there is one further point I would like to raise.  Under this Bill we are giving <Col N="439" /> persons convicted of a crime the right to appeal in certain circumstances.  Sadly, there are also circumstances where, say, the parents of a deceased child feel aggrieved because persons charged with the murder, unlawful killing or manslaughter of their child have been set free by the courts.  This has happened in circumstances which can give rise to concern that an injustice has been done. In these circumstances the parents should be empowered to petition the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Attorney General, the Minister, the courts of some independent tribunal, to have the case re-examined.  It is not clear whether such provision exists already and I would ask the Minister to address this point in her reply to the debate.</P>
    <P>There are some fundamental differences between the Bill and the recommendations of the Martin Committee but before coming to these I would like to make three points.  First, the right to seek to have a matter referred back to the Court of Criminal Appeal is confined to persons who have been convicted on indictment, or who have pleaded guilty and the sentence is imposed by one of the higher courts.  The vast bulk of cases in which a miscarriage might be alleged will come within that definition involving all serious crime, but it is not impossible to allege a miscarriage of justice in respect of a summary trial in the District Court.  In effect, the District Court can now impose a sentence of up to two years by way of two consecutive sentences of one year each were a person is found guilty of two or more offences.  A person sentenced to a two year jail sentence might have a legitimate grievance in respect of which some form of redress should be allowed.  While in the ordinary way appeals from cases which are tried in the District Court do not come to the Court of Criminal Appeal, there is no reason that court should not have jurisdiction to deal with miscarriage of justice cases even though it would not have had the right to deal with an appeal in the first place.  An alleged miscarriage of justice is an important matter which should be <Col N="440" /> dealt with by the higher courts.  The Bill should be amended to address this shortcoming.</P>
    <P>It is possible for a miscarriage of justice to occur in the District Court.  For example a person might be convicted of child abuse in the District Court and the opprobrium that will attach to a person convicted of such an offence might be as difficult to bear as a sentence.  If that conviction represented a miscarriage of justice, this Bill does not give any power to seek the intervention of the courts to review the case, simply because the case was dealt with in the District Court, or in the Circuit Court on appeal.  That shortcoming should be addressed.</P>
    <P>The Bill could be improved in relation to newly discovered facts.  Under the Bill any person wishing to rely on its terms must satisfy either the courts, or where a pardon is petitioned for, the Minister or the Government, that a newly discovered fact has come to light.  &ldquo;Newly discovered fact&rdquo; is defined in various places in the Bill but in practice it is confined to two circumstances, one being that the fact was not known at the time of the court hearings and the second that its significance was not appreciated at the time. A third category should be allowed, as it could give rise to a miscarriage of justice, and that is the circumstances where a party knows of the fact and of its importance but declines to produce it to the court for a good reason.  For example, a person who is innocent and knows the identity of the guilty party might not bring that fact before the court for fear of reprisals or other intimidation.  If the fear passed the person might want to air a legitimate grievance but he could not have it remedied.  The circumstances in which jurisdiction could be exercised should be extended to include such cases.</P>
    <P>We should consider the provisions in respect of compensation.  It is reasonable to provide that persons who have been the subject of miscarriages of justice should be compensated and that the State should pay that compensation, but there is no apparent reason for the State not having the right to seek to recover compensation paid, together with costs <Col N="441" /> incurred by the State, where it can be shown that a person or persons caused or contributed to the miscarriage of justice. If a wealthy person framed an accused, if the Garda were genuinely taken in and the accused was ultimately convicted it would be unjust if the State could not recover the compensation and legal costs incurred from the guilty party.  This procedure might prove difficult to operate but it is not a reason the legislation should not provide for the State or the courts to have the power to make such a recovery order.  There would be a genuine public outcry if the public purse had to bear the ultimate cost of compensating a person who had suffered a miscarriage of justice, where it was abundantly clear that the person who caused it would go scot-free although he could afford to pay full compensation or contribute to the legal costs. Will the Minister consider that point for Committee Stage of the Bill?</P>
    <P>Page 10 of the Martin report recommends the establishment of a statutory inquiry body under the Tribunal of Inquiries Act and recommends against a reference or an appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  The Martin report says: &ldquo;we doubt however, whether references to the Courts system would necessarily prove effective in establishing the truth.&rdquo;  Yet, section 2 proposes that such reviews shall be requested by way of an application to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  The Martin Committee gave reasons for considering this matter outside the courts system and referred to the rules of evidence, the Scottish Evidence Act, to the fact that hearsay is not ruled out in every case and that similar rules could apply to a body of inquiry which was not a court.  The Department of Justice second guessed the contribution of this independent judicial committee of inquiry and have gone against the Martin Committee recommendations.  That is hard to understand and perhaps the Minister could tell us what expertise is in her Department which would go against that fundamental recommendation which was not available to the Martin Committee. Many people made voluntary contributions to the Martin Committee.  The <Col N="442" /> Minister referred to them yesterday and I join her in thanking them for doing so. It shows a good public spirited attitude.</P>
    <P>A person convicted by the Supreme Court, the Central Criminal Court or the Circuit Court can appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal and on a point of law, to the Supreme Court.  The Minister proposes a new appeal avenue to the Court of Criminal Appeal even though a case may have already gone on a point of law to the Supreme Court, before the new evidence or relevant fact was discovered. This goes against the Martin recommendation which says that the case should go on to an inquiry which could deal with evidence which could not be considered in a court of law because of the rules of evidence.  This is a fundamental difference between the Bill and the recommendations of the Martin Committee and nothing the Minister said in her Second Stage speech explains why she has departed from such a fundamental recommendation.  The Court of Criminal Appeal upheld the Nicky Kelly conviction and a number of other convictions. The Minister should explain why she is departing from the Martin Committee recommendations in this matter.</P>
    <P>Section 3 (1) (b) could be interpreted by some people as an attack on the jury system.  The jury in the original case may have convicted a person of one crime and the Court of Criminal Appeal having read the transcripts can now substitute another crime.  For instance, handling stolen goods could be substituted for larceny. Essential to this procedure is that the Court of Criminal Appeal would decide those facts of which the jury must have been satisfied.  This is a peculiar departure; I am not suggesting that this is an attack on the jury system but it could be interpreted as such.  Perhaps the Minister would indicate her thinking in this regard.</P>
    <P>Section 3 (3) (a) refers to the hearing of an appeal by the Court of Criminal Appeal where the court is considering an appeal based on new evidence.  The court may direct the Garda Commissioner to make further inquiries.  This is a useful <Col N="443" /> power but I argue that the Garda Commissioner is the wrong person; it should be given to the Attorney General.  Let me outline the reasons I suggest this.</P>
    <P>It could be, for example, that the conduct of the Garda in the prosecution of the offence which is the point at dispute. It is possible that the Garda Commissioner of the day, because time will have passed by, could have been the chief superintendent in charge of the division where the original inquiry took place or could have been peripherally involved in overseeing the original prosecution.  If inquiries were to be focused on the conduct of the Garda it would still pass through the office of the Garda Commissioner but he should be responsible to one of the senior law officers and I suggest that it is the Attorney General who should oversee inquiries of this kind.</P>
    <P>The reason I suggest this is that the second leg of the conduct of the trial and prosecution could be the decisions and judgment of the Director of Public Prosecutions. This could be the subject of an inquiry into an alleged miscarriage of justice.  It would therefore be inappropriate for the Director of Public Prosecutions to be the law officer who would oversee the Garda Commissioner. Taking all this into account, I suggest that the correct person is the Attorney General.  Under Article 30.3 of Bunreacht na hEireann it is the Attorney General who is responsible for prosecuting all crimes in the name of the people, at the suit of the Attorney General or some person authorised by law.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that the appeal court should not have the right to make these inquiries; it should and if they relate to the conduct of the Garda they should be made through the senior law officer, the Attorney General, simply because the Garda Commissioner and the Director of Public Prosecutions, in certain circumstances, would be faced with a conflict of interests.  Since the Attorney General is not involved in the day-to-day administration of the criminal justice prosecution system he is the appropriate person.  I therefore ask the Minister to <Col N="444" /> consider amending the Bill to ensure that the court refers such matters to the Attorney General for examination to be carried out by the Garda or some other agency of the State and not to the Garda Commissioner.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides for cautioning by the trial judge of the jury about convicting on a confession without collaboration. The Martin Committee recommended this at page 39 of its report but said that the judges should be consulted about this matter.  Would the Minister please tell the House &mdash; she referred to this matter in her speech &mdash; if the judges were consulted as recommended by the Martin Committee?</P>
    <P>Section 11 abolishes appeals from the Central Criminal Court, that is the criminal division of the High Court, to the Supreme Court.  The Minister referred to this matter in her speech.  As I understand it, the present route is from the Central Criminal Court appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal and onto the Supreme Court, if necessary.  Alternatively, the Central Criminal Court decision can be appealed to the Supreme Court directly. I understand that the appeal from the Court of Criminal Appeal to the Supreme Court requires the consent of the court or the Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The Bill proposes that every conviction by the Central Criminal Court shall be appealable only to the Court of Criminal Appeal.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to Article 34.4.3º of Bunreacht na hEireann which provides that the Supreme Court may have appellate jurisdiction subject to such exceptions as may be provided by law.  This is reasonable but the words &ldquo;in exceptions&rdquo; are not used in the Bill.  This will apply in all criminal convictions with minor exceptions, that is, other than section 34 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967 &mdash; reference of a question of law to the Supreme Court.  Where a court acquits an accused on a point of law the Attorney General may appeal without prejudicing the decision of the court to free the accused.  This provision may be unconstitutional because provision is not being made for exceptions; rather it will <Col N="445" /> apply in all cases.  I ask the Minister to address this question before Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, it is suggested on page 14 of the Martin report that a provision similar to the Civil Evidence (Scotland) Act, 1989, should be introduced. This dealt with evidence being considered by the inquiry body &mdash; not a court as provided for in the Bill &mdash; and suggested that &ldquo;evidence shall not be excluded solely on the ground that it is hearsay&rdquo;.  This is another fundamental reason, that is, the gathering of evidence, why a court should not be used and an inquiry body should be established as recommended by the Martin Committee. It is extraordinary that judges and lawyers should say that an inquiry body, established under the Tribunal of Inquiries Act or other similar Act, rather than the courts, would be the appropriate body.  Having taken advice and produced a Bill the Minister has said the exact opposite.  It is rare for the courts to seek to give away powers or authority that they may have but in this report, which has been well researched, the committee of inquiry which was chaired by a judge makes a specific recommendation on good grounds.  As I said, it referred to the Civil Evidence (Scotland) Act under which hearsay evidence may be allowed in certain circumstances and outlined the reasons a body of inquiry rather than a court would be the appropriate body. Yet the Minister has rejected this central recommendation of the Martin Committee.</P>
    <P>The problem centres on the use of the word &ldquo;evidence&rdquo; and what is admissible in evidence before the court.  Having taken evidence from a large number of people, including leading members of the Bar and the legal profession, the committee of inquiry has said in regard to the appeal procedure that the courts are not the most appropriate body to deal with it. This independent committee of inquiry states specifically in its report that hearsay evidence should not be ruled out in every case.  Yet under the Judges Rules and court procedures, the courts cannot accept hearsay evidence.  That is the <Col N="446" /> reason it has recommended a body of inquiry should be used rather than a court.  They specifically came down against a further court of appeal, including suggesting the provisions in the Scottish Act.  I cannot understand why the Department of Justice should decide against their recommendations.  Some of these points may seem technical, but they are central and fundamental to a procedure which, presumably, will be in place for many years.  What is the point of setting up a learned committee to report into the aspects of criminal procedure in relation to an appeal and then largely ignoring its main recommendations?</P>
    <P>I will not be opposing the Bill on Second Stage but the Minister owes this House an explanation of how she arrived at her conclusions when, in many cases, they run counter to the proposals of an independent judicial inquiry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill raises fundamental issues on which this House must decide.  I hope the Minister will not take what I have to say in too negative a way.  It is not intended to be personal because I am happy with the despatch with which this report has received a response.  It is better than the vast majority of reports in terms of producing a legislative response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, this Bill is wrong in principle. It is fundamentally flawed and flies in the face of the expert advice given to the State by a committee established by the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Burke, when in office.  That committee, which was chaired by a judge of the Circuit Court, consisted of a senior representative of the Minister's Department, Mr. Terry; a representative of the Attorney General's office, a senior Garda officer and a practising lawyer, among others.  It took a long, hard, cold and dispassionate view of the problem, revealed by the outcome of the Birminghan Six case, and inquired into precisely what the Irish response should be to such circumstances.  As Deputy Mitchell said, it came to the radical conclusion, which this Bill fundamentally rejects, that hoping that the courts will <Col N="447" /> prove the vehicle of first recourse to secure the reversal of miscarriages of justice is entirely misconceived and wrong. I will explain to the House why I think it is wrong.</P>
    <P>The courts have to operate on the basis of evidence.  They cannot operate on the basis of hunch.  They cannot operate on the basis of hearsay and they cannot draw inferences from circumstances which are not proven in evidence.  Moreover, the courts, by definition, have a vested interest in upholding their dignity and in upholding their previous decisions.  I need not remind the Minister of the fate of the Birmingham Six case where the Court of Appeal in England disgraced itself &mdash; and I use these words carefully &mdash; by the manner in which it dealt with the original appeals of those men.  Two people gave evidence in the Birmingham Six case of assaults on the prisoners while in custody.  One was an individual whose evidence the court rejected on the grounds that he had not made this case before and that he has been dismissed from the police for larceny.  The second was a policewoman, a Miss Joyce Lynass who also gave evidence that she saw the prisoners being abused, and her evidence was thrown out by the Court of Appeal in England on the basis that she had changed her evidence.  The court said it could not accept that her subsequent evidence was of value and rejected it in its entirety as unreliable.</P>
    <P>We know now, and the Minister had better face up to this fact, that those men were abused.  We know now that there were policemen who saw them being abused, and we know now that those men were forced to make confessions in circumstances of great terror, physical abuse and degradation.  We know now that there were plenty of witnesses to those acts of abuse.  However, the Court of Appeal, following very much the procedure the Minister is laying down here, heard evidence from two members of the police force at that time that that had happened.  What was its response?  It was to dismiss their evidence as unreliable perjury.  Why did it do that?  There was <Col N="448" /> a very simple reason: it had a vested interest in not undoing those convictions.</P>
    <P>Whatever else the Minister may think, it is a sad fact that judge-alone-courts are no real safeguard of ordinary individuals' rights and liberties in the long run.  Judge-alone-courts have proven over the centuries to be inferior to jury courts, and a judge-alone-court, when confronted with evidence of two policemen, decided to reject their evidence as perjury.  That was done because the courts are a quite inadequate and wrong instrument to use to remedy injustices in circumstances such as that.  The great scandal was that the Birmingham Six were sent back to their prison cells, even though police officers had had the courage and truthfulness to come before the courts and say there had been a massive cover-up of physical abuse and torture of those prisoners. What was it, in the end, that tipped the scales?  It was not the evidence of one Police Constable Lynass or Police Constable Clarke, the people who were disbelieved. It was technical evidence in relation to the production of documents and the like which exposed the conspiracy.</P>
    <P>Relying on the Judiciary to determine that an individual has had his rights massively infringed, as those men had, is a fundamental mistake.  The courts are not the appropriate forum in which to vindicate errors of that kind.  Deputy Mitchell referred to the Nicky Kelly case.  I do not want to become too controversial, but all I can say in relation to that case is that again the courts approached the matter entirely predictably in dealing with a verdict of the court system where there is a natural inclination on the part of the Judiciary not to upset in circumstances of public controversy.</P>
    <P>That is what we are dealing with and there is no point in codding ourselves that we are dealing with something else.  We are dealing with a committee chaired by a judge which asks what are the lessons to be learned from the case of the Birmingham Six, which asks if the Court of Appeal in England or the Court of Criminal Appeal in Ireland are the right fora in which to seek to reopen an alleged <Col N="449" /> miscarriage of justice and if it should be the vehicle of first resort.  The committee came to the conclusion that it should not; it said it would be inappropriate and defined very good reasons.</P>
    <P>It is notable, as Deputy Mitchell pointed out, that the Minister comes before this House with no explanation of why that primary finding, that the principle of this Bill is wrong, has been rejected by her Department or the Government.  It may well be that the Judiciary were consulted about this.  I would be surprised if they were not.  Frankly, it is not the Judiciary we need to consult in this matter.  They are people who are, in my view, least in a position to be of assistance on this fundamental principle of how to undo miscarriages of justice.  The Judiciary are, in a sense, part of the problem where there has been a miscarriage of justice and are not necessarily part of the solution.</P>
    <P>As the Martin Committee report exposed, there were cases in the 1930s and 1940s where the Government was so dissatisfied with criminal convictions which had occurred and on which, presumably, the appeal procedure had been exhausted, that they asked a judge of the District Court to investigate one case. From a quite private inquiry he produced such material to the satisfaction of the then Government that it decided to give the man, effectively if not technically, a full pardon and compensation, and there was a similar decision in another case. Where there is an alleged miscarriage of justice the appropriate mechanism for dealing with that is to have an informal inquisitorial committee decide whether or not something is to be done and not to do what is being done here, saying that the primary means of redress is to go back to the court system.  The courts are not apt or suited to this purpose.  The Court of Criminal Appeal is not apt or suited to determine questions of fact. There is no hint in this Bill as to how it is to deal with new evidence that comes before it.  Is it to do what the Court of Appeal in England did and say to Joyce Lynass, or her Irish equivalent, that it rejects her evidence?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="450" /> Will it act as a mini-jury to assess and give weight to this new evidence?  Will it be the case that witnesses like Lynass and Clarke in the first Birmingham Six appeal will be discredited and have their evidence rejected as perjury by these judges?  As we now know the evidence given by Lynass and Clarke was true. What consideration of the issues involved led the Department of Justice to tender this Bill to the House?  There has been a complete abandonment of the rationale of the Martin Committee's thinking and the Bill is a fundamental mistake.</P>
    <P>The Minister said there will not be any filtering process and that the Bill which she commended to the House will enhance public confidence in the criminal justice system.  I strongly believe &mdash; this may not be a fashionable view &mdash; in the idea of having finality in criminal cases. Every prisoner who is put away for seven to ten years will spend three-five of those years thinking up a scheme whereby he can get someone to say he saw him somewhere else at the time the crime was committed.  Prisoners in Portlaoise, Mountjoy or prisons in Cork or Limerick will have the greatest possible incentive to think of ways to have their convictions reversed.  They will undoubtedly produce perjured evidence to the Court of Appeal.  If there is no filtering system the Court of Appeal will need a leathery exterior if it says: &ldquo;We have heard Mr. McDowell's evidence that he saw the accused in a place five miles away from the scene of the crime at the time the crime was committed but we reject it. Why did you not come before us previously? Why did you not give this evidence earlier?&rdquo;  There will be more and more scandals of more and more judges rejecting evidence in the Court of Appeal where only one judgment is given.  It should be noted that there will not be three judgments and that there will be no assessment.</P>
    <P>We will have the same problems as in the Birmingham Six case where three or four witnesses will say they saw the accused ten miles away from the scene of the crime, that he could not have committed it and that they only realised when <Col N="451" /> the case was over and the appeal dealt with that their evidence was relevant. Seemingly plausible evidence will be given to the Court of Appeal which it will have to assess.  It should be remembered that it will be as clear as day in such cases that if the evidence is true the accused could not have committed the crime and that if it is false the witnesses are perjurers. Day in, day out prisoners will be thinking up ways of getting their cases back to the Court of Appeal.  There will be no mechanism to stop this apart from the one the Minister proposes to put in place, that is, if it is frivolous or vexatious evidence.  If somebody says that the accused was not at the scene of the crime, that he was ten miles away, that evidence cannot be found to be frivolous or vexatious. If a witness says he heard another man confess to the crime, as Deputy Mitchell said, that evidence will be inadmissible as it is heresay evidence and it cannot be heard in the Court of Appeal.</P>
    <P>Nobody who has examined this problem carefully and heard, as the Martin Committee did, the evidence on the likely possibility of going over to the English system of referring cases back to the Court of Appeal can have any confidence that this Bill will improve the situation.  Rather, it will create more trouble for the Irish courts and Irish legal system than any other proposed measure. It will mean that every jury verdict will not be the end of the road; rather, it will be the start of a long battle where people will be furiously trying to establish their innocence by producing new evidence and explaining why they could not produce it before.  The Irish Court of Criminal Appeal will be brought into disrepute because it will find itself in the position of either accepting plausible perjury and ordering a retrial or assessing the truthfulness of that evidence, in which case it will substitute itself for the jury.  There will be no mechanism to stop anyone who has a plausible case, however contrived or untrue, from bringing that case before the courts.  It will take days to deal with such cases.</P>
    <P>Under the scheme envisaged by this <Col N="452" /> Bill the Court of Criminal Appeal will be able to direct the Garda to investigate the truth of the evidence in question.  As Deputy Mitchell said, the notion that the Garda and the DPP should be the primary investigating agencies of miscarriages of justice is deeply unsatisfactory.  Unlike England, we do not live in a large society and we do not have the luxury of being able to bring in one police force to investigate another police force.  We live in a small society with a small cohesive police force to which I wish to pay tribute &mdash; we have an excellent police force.  The idea that all the heavy gang allegations should be investigated by the Garda at the time is a bit rich.  I do not believe the proposal in the Bill will remedy the situation.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the courts will be happy to reverse their decisions as there will already have been appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal in many of the serious cases and it will have considered some of the evidence and deemed one or two witnesses as new evidence witnesses. If two further witnesses appear two years later will it say: &ldquo;Sorry, we now have a reasonable doubt about the evidence we rejected as perjury two years ago; we will go back to that evidence and reverse our decision&rdquo;?  That is the stuff of pantomime; it is the stuff that made the English Court of Appeal judges look so foolish in the long run.  As I said, Joyce Lynass and Police Constable Clarke were branded in public as perjurers even though they told the truth.  Three judges like something in &ldquo;Jurassic Park&rdquo;&mdash; they were later referred to as dinosaurs &mdash; condemned Lynass and Clarke as perjurers even though they told the truth. The scandal of believing them was more than the British court system could bear. That is precisely what it is proposed to bring in here.</P>

      <P>It is a mistake.  I cannot understand why a Department of State would advise a Minister to reject an expert report and not to come into <Col N="453" /> this House and explain the rational basis for rejecting it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell referred to hearsay evidence.  While this may sound technical to some people, it is very real to others. If, say, Deputy Mitchell stood convicted of a crime and Deputy Gilmore heard me say that I committed the crime that would be hearsay evidence.</P>

      <P>If he came forward to the Court of Appeal his evidence would not be tenderable or receivable as evidence even though it might be the most cogent evidence of all, for example, it might prove that a prosecution was sustained by a forged confession, etc. That kind of evidence is inadmissible in many cases.  Judge Martin's committee was correct in pointing out that what is needed in all these cases is a flexible, inquiring and inquisitorial mechanism which will determine the truth.  We do not need a system where, like the grotesque farce in the English Court of Appeal, truthful witnesses are rejected as perjurers because it is inconvenient to believe them.  That is what will happen in Ireland if the Bill is passed in its present form as it is mosconceived.</P>
      <P>This is not a new problem.  In 1879 the Westminster Parliament set about codifying its criminal law, something they have only come back to this year.  A famous jurist, James Fitzjames Stephen, was put in charge of the codification process. He addressed the question of what happens in cases of miscarriages of justice. He said:</P>
      <P>Cases in which, under some peculiar state of facts, a miscarriage of justice takes place, may sometimes though rarely occur; but when they do occur it is under circumstances for which fixed rules or procedures cannot provide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is very true.  What is appropriate for one inquiry &mdash; the Nicky Kelly inquiry &mdash; might be wholly inappropriate for another <Col N="454" /> inquiry, for instance, a fingerprint inquiry case.  He continued:</P>
    <P>Experience has shown that the Secretary of State (in England) is a better judge of the existence of such circumstances than a Court of Justice can be.  He has every facility for inquiring into the special circumstances; he can and does, if necessary, avail himself of the assistance of the judge who tried the case and of the law officers ....  He is fettered by no rule, and his decision does not form a precedent for subsequent cases.  We do not see how a better means could be provided for inquiry into the circumstances of the exceptional cases in question.</P>
    <P>I believe from my experience of criminal law that in 99 per cent of cases the verdict of a jury is accepted by virtually everybody in court but most particularly it is accepted by the public at large.  A jury in Ireland takes its task seriously, each member swears on oath to afford to the accused the benefits of the doubt.  It holds the scales, we hope, evenly between the prosecutor and the accused, between the Garda and lay witnesses and when Irish juries have convicted, the vast majority of their convictions have been proper and warranted.  Of course, it is true that Irish juries have let guilty men go but this is because they respect the valuable rule of law that only convictions beyond reasonable doubt will suffice in criminal cases.</P>
    <P>This measure and the first set of provisions to allow persons who are sentenced to jail to go to the Court of Criminal Appeal alleging that there is new evidence to assert their innocence will do massive damage to the jury system of trial and to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  It will do much more damage to the judicial system than the deplorable absence of any mechanism at the moment.  The Minister would be well advised to abandon this line completely, to rely on the inquiry mechanism and to take the Martin report's analysis and conclusion on board.  It is no slight to the Judiciary that they should not be involved in the matter but it will be a huge slur on the Judiciary if three members of our <Col N="455" /> present Court of Appeal, are seen &mdash; as in the Birmingham Six case &mdash; to have rejected as perjury evidence which was later proven to be true.  That destroys their credibility as a court thereafter and it destroys their capacity to function.  Any politician would then be able to stand up and say that the Court of Criminal Appeal rejected as facile perjury evidence which was later proven to be true and blew a witness out of court who was telling the truth.  That is precisely what is wrong with this measure.  It will bring the Judiciary into disrepute and it will clog up the system with a predictable wave of applications to the courts on which the Judiciary, bending over backwards to deal with such applications, will make errors on occasion.  In those circumstances I do not know how the interests of justice will be advanced.</P>
    <P>I agree with one or two provisions of this Bill.  I agree with the idea of giving any committee established by the Government powers under the Tribunal and Inquiry Evidence Acts of 1921 and 1979.  As Judge Martin pointed out, that is necessary because if the Government ask somebody to inquire into an alleged miscarriage of justice and say, for instance, &mdash; and I do not say this with any prejudice &mdash; the Garda refused to co-operate, that would make a farce of the inquiry.</P>
    <P>There are portions of this Bill which I find difficult to understand.  One of those, for instance, is the proposal in relation to compensation.  Why is it that the standard of proof in relation to compensation is proof beyond reasonable doubt?  How is it that somebody cannot prove beyond reasonable doubt that he is innocent while, on the other hand, a jury on a civil standard of proof would say he is probably innocent?  They may hold the view that perhaps the policeman is not telling the truth and they may believe that the accused man is innocent.  They will not condemn the policeman out of hand but on balance they may believe that the accused man was innocent.  How can a person who has spent five years in jail, whom everybody thinks is probably <Col N="456" /> innocent but who cannot prove it beyond reasonable doubt, be excluded from compensation? That is a foolish provision to put into a Bill.  It will be a very unfair system that there will be a distinction between pardons in that some will carry compensation because they are given on the basis that the Minister is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt and others are probability standard cases.  That is unfair and will pose difficulties for the Minister and her successors as time goes by.  It will embroil her in controversy because people will not want that type of pardon. It does not say a person is innocent and if it did say &ldquo;innocent beyond reasonable doubt&rdquo; the person would be entitled to compensation.</P>
    <P>I realise the Minister does not wish to be in the position of compensating people simply because there is a doubt about their conviction.  That is what the Minister is trying to avoid but to tell somebody who has spent ten years in jail that he is not entitled to any compensation because there remains a doubt as to his guilt &mdash; even though it is felt that he was probably not guilty &mdash; is an absurdity.  That will cause the media to question the kind of provisions we are putting into our laws if we can say a person is probably innocent but because there is a doubt about it we will not give him a halfpenny for wrongly keeping him in Portlaoise Prison for the past ten years.  How can somebody stand over that and say that it is a justifiable distinction to make in law?  I can see what the Minister is trying to do but I suggest to the Minister that this is yet another symptom of the fundamental error in this Bill.</P>
    <P>We must start off from the premise that we want finality in our criminal law and that the vast majority of jury decisions, and not Special Criminal Court decisions, have evinced no query later as to their correctness.  In the Special Criminal Court there are particular reasons, of course, because there is a whole group of people who have a vested interest in discrediting that court.  Nonetheless it suffers from the defect that it not 12 men and women who are sworn to be objective deciding on those cases.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="457" /> Three members of the Judiciary decide and that is always a problem in the criminal law.  If we start from the proposition that there is satisfaction with the great majority of jury verdicts and that in a tiny minority of cases juries can get it wrong, then the answer is to do what the Martin Committee suggested, that is to go through a special process to satisfy oneself whether the jury got it right, to use the method of Presidential pardon and decide, on an entirely discretionary basis, without creating a precedent and without having to state publicly the basis of the decision, whether the person receives compensation.  However, in this provision if the Minister arranges that any individual should receive a Presidential pardon, she is taking on board the duty of saying that she still has a doubt in the matter and, therefore, no payment will be made.  That will bring the Minister and her successors into disrepute and controversy where none is required.</P>
    <P>This whole issue was debated at length by the Martin Committee.  They said that it was better to leave the Court of Criminal Appeal as it is, a once off appeal process which decides on the case and when that process has been exhausted that is the end of the matter.</P>
    <P>In the tiny minority of cases where there remains a doubt, or where some new evidence has come to light to merit an inquiry, the Martin Committee recommended that it be dealt with completely out of the courts.  It is notable that in England, in the wake of the Birmingham Six case, the legal establishment there said it would be much better if this kind of procedure was not dealt with in the courts.  Looking to the likes of those three Appeal Court judges to reverse their previous judgments, or to reverse the judgments of their predecessors sitting in the same chairs; to say that they got it wrong, to say that when Clarke and Lynass were flung out as perjurors, totally wrongly, that that was not a mistake, is almost asking the impossible.  Certainly it is asking them to engage in an uphill task.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="458" /> We want a system which is flexible.  In the last sentence of the Minister's introductory remarks she said her purpose in all of this was to enhance public confidence in the criminal justice system and it was on that basis she commended the Bill to the House.  I warn the Minister that these measures, if implemented, will deflate and destroy confidence in the minds of the public in relation to the administration of justice.  I warn the Minister it will cause untold mayhem, with people flooding the courts with new facts.  We must remember that people in jail have nothing else to do for long periods except to think of some way to get out of jail.  If they can produce the alibi witness who was away on holiday during their trial and never heard of the case, what will the Court of Appeal do? Will it interrogate him?  Will it subject him to an unsympathetic, searching cross-examination?  Will that be seen as bias on the part of the judges as they really put the man through his paces to ascertain whether he is telling the truth.  It is not obviously the case that the Minister will bring the Court of Criminal Appeal itself into disrepute.  I am of the view that the approach of the Martin Committee was right.  Because I am of the view that this Bill, in principle, is introducing the Martin route as well as the court, we will not oppose it on Second Reading. Because I do not want to force the Minister into a position today to take a stance on the principle of bringing these matters back to the courts, likewise I shall not call a division.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to consult widely on this issue.  If the Minister asks the Bar Council, the Irish Association of Criminal Lawyers, the Irish Association of Civil Liberties and a number of other groups their views on the arguments I have been advancing &mdash; whether it will enhance people's sense of confidence in justice &mdash; I guarantee her that their response will be that, if the Bill is passed in its present form it will prove to have been a very bad day's work for this House and for respect of the law in Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>In opening this debate <Col N="459" /> the Minister said she believed that the provisions of this Bill would be widely welcomed.  I contend it is more likely that its provisions will be widely criticised. There are some things that can be said for this Bill.  As Len Murray, who was a fairly moderate trade union leader, used to say &ldquo;little fish are sweet&rdquo; and, on the principle that something is better than nothing, probably there is something to be said for some of the provisions of this Bill.</P>
      <P>I contend this Bill has been introduced too late.  The Martin Committee was established in 1989, reported early in 1990 and, notwithstanding Deputy Michael McDowell's perhaps more realistic expectations of the enthusiasm of Government Departments to put into legislation recommendations of committees, I contend that three and a half years after the Martin Committee reported, at a time when there was considerable public concern here about the Birmingham Six, Guildford Four, the Maguire cases, the Nicky Kelly case and so on, was too long an interval.  Nevertheless, the Bill is now before us.</P>
      <P>Second, I contend the Bill is inadequate in that it deals only with the first part of the report of the Martin Committee. Later in my contribution I want to deal with some aspects of the second part of the Martin Committee recommendations. Worst of all, the Bill flies straight in the face of the principal recommendation of the Martin Committee, referred to already by Deputies Gay Mitchell and Michael McDowell, that the mechanism which should be used for dealing with people who claim there has been a miscarriage of justice should be by way of a statutory inquiry body rather than back through the Court of Criminal Appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears to me the debate on this Bill on which we now embark will become a pitched battle in this House for the implementation of the recommendations of the Martin report.  It may well be that, after the Martin Committee report appeared, members of the Judiciary went behind doors &mdash; as perhaps they may be <Col N="460" /> entitled to do &mdash; to disabuse the Minister and her Department from implementing its recommendations.  It may well be that they expressed a view that the implementation of the recommendations of the Martin Committee report would give rise to an Irish version of the appalling vista &mdash; that the stature, status, independence and so on of the courts and Judiciary, would be undermined in some way, that the prospect of a body, outside the Judiciary as perhaps they might see it, in some way supervising the work of the Judiciary in relation to miscarriages of justice was more than they could take. That may well have been the case. Indeed, there is much rumour about that and that is what has caused the Minister and the Government to introduce a Bill in the House whose provisions flatly contradict the key recommendations of the Martin Committee report.  If that is the case, then the debate in this House will be one seeking the implementation of the recommendations of the Martin Committee.  I predict that what the Minister is now facing into is a pitched battle for the implementation of the recommendations of the Martin Committee.</P>
    <P>We must remember that the Martin Committee was not composed solely of wild-eyed civil libertarians.  It is perhaps worth putting on the record the members of the Martin Committee.  Here I join in the words of appreciation expressed by the Minister and other Members of their work and for the speed with which they carried it out.  The Martin Committee was comprised of Judge Frank Martin himself, Mr. Henry Abbott, barrister-at-law; Mr. Edwin Alkin, barrister-at-law from the Office of the Attorney General; Mr. Hugh Sreenan, Assistant Commissioner of the Garda Síochána; Mr. Patrick Terry, of the Department of Justice and Mr. Frank Ward, solicitor, hardly a body of people from whom one would expect a recommendation that would be overturned so decisively and firmly by the Government in the introduction of legislation.</P>
    <P>Of course, it was the highly publicised cases in Britain involving the Birmingham Six and Guildford Four which <Col N="461" /> demonstrated the dreadful damage that can be done to the lives of innocent people by miscarriages of justice, innocent people taken away from their families, locked up under the harshest of conditions for almost 20 years for crimes they did not commit.  No amount of money could adequately compensate for lives destroyed in that way.  While many people in this country were very quick to condemn the British judicial system for the failings highlighted by these cases, it was a fact that there was a facility for reopening those cases when new evidence came to light and ultimately, that led to the vindication and the ultimate release of the Birmingham Six and Guildford Four.</P>
    <P>Those cases focused attention also on the absence of any similar facility for the reopening of cases in this country when all the normal judicial procedures had been exhausted.  There was a facility for the Government to advise the President to issue a pardon but this was used on two occasions only in the 1940s.  We, too, have had our miscarriages of justice.  The State has accepted that Nicky Kelly was wrongly convicted, a Presidential pardon was issued belatedly and compensation paid to him.  Substantial compensation was paid also to others convicted of the Sallins mail train robbery for the ill treatment received while in custody.  There is a very strong body of opinion that believes also a serious miscarriage of justice was done in the case known as the Tallaght Two.</P>
    <P>Most reasonable people will accept that even with the best legal system in the world miscarriages of justice can take place; new evidence can come to light, new scientific techniques can be developed which can cast doubt on forensic tests believed previously to have been reliable; new witnesses can come forward; witnesses can commit perjury and later have a change of heart.  It is impossible to provide total protection against miscarriages of justice.  Therefore, it is essential to have procedures for reopening cases whenever new evidence emerges to cast doubt on the validity of convictions.  What is needed are procedures <Col N="462" /> for dealing not just with the high profile cases, often the subject of public campaigns or political lobbying, but also for responding to those cases which receive less public attention, where sentences may be shorter but the damage done by the miscarriage of justice great.  Interestingly enough, the events about which we know &mdash; the Birmingham Six, Guildford Four, the Maguire case, the Nicky Kelly case &mdash; all were cases in which, happily, the people who were the victims of those miscarriages of justice had the capacity or connections to have campaigns outside prison carried out on their behalf.  It was the persistence of those campaigns, perhaps many of the people participating had an added political motivation to carry on the campaign, which ultimately led to their release and to the exposure of the miscarriages of justice.  What about those victims of a miscarriage of justice, where the offence does not have any political overtone, where they are simply left to languish in jail and have no means to have a campaign conducted outside prison on their behalf?  Are they not also entitled to have their cases heard and processed?</P>
    <P>As Members of the House a regular feature of our work is that we receive correspondence, often accompanied by very weighty documentation, from people in prison arguing that they are the victims of a miscarriage of justice and asking us, as Members of the House, to initiate or to participate in a campaign on their behalf.  For obvious reasons, it is very difficult for a Member to assess whether there has been a miscarriage of justice.  One side of one's brain is thinking that this is a prisoner who, aware of the amount of public concern there has been about miscarriages of justice, is trying his hand but the other side of one's brain is saying that when the Birmingham Six and Guildford Four cases began many people thought they were guilty and that the campaign to have them released and vindicated was politically motivated.  We now know the fallacy of that position.</P>
    <P>There is a need for the kind of statutory body which was recommended in the Martin report to filter those applications.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="463" /> The mechanisms provided for in this Bill, that a case can be dismissed for vexatious or frivolous reasons or, if not dismissed for those reasons, that it is heard by the Court of Criminal Appeal, do not appear to be an adequate way of dealing with that issue.  Deputy McDowell outlined the types of cases which can bring that whole process into disrepute.</P>
    <P>Against the background of the Guildford Four and Birmingham Six cases the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Burke, established the Martin Committee in 1989.  The committee concluded its business expeditiously in March 1990.  Rather than simply applaud the committee for the work they have done it would be much better if we took the recommendations they made more seriously and implemented them by way of legislation.</P>
    <P>The history of what has happened since the publication of the Martin report requires some examination.  The Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat Government announced in March 1990 that it had accepted the recommendations in principle. Nevertheless it has taken three and a half years for firm legislative proposals to be brought forward.  While the Bill represents an advance over the present situation in that it provides some facility for reopening cases where none existed previously, it is not an adequate reponse to the problem.  It does not implement the recommendations of the Martin report.  It ignores key recommendations made by Martin and the procedure to be adopted for reopening cases is directly in conflict with the advice offered by the Martin report.</P>
    <P>The key recommendation of the Martin report was the establishment of an independent body with statutory powers of inquiry to investigate cases where substantial doubts arise as to the propriety of a conviction.  It was recommended that this would be a permanent body with powers of inquiry similar to those provided for in the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, for example, the Kerry babies case, the Stardust case, etc. <Col N="464" /> Cases would have to be referred to the tribunal by the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>The Martin Committee specifically advised against referring such cases back to the courts and said:</P>
    <P>We feel that any further recourse to the court system is likely to prove inappropriate, as must recourse to any system other than one which is essentially <i>inquisitorial</i> in nature &mdash; which our Courts are not.</P>
    <P>The Martin Committee further argued that because of the restrictive nature of the rules of evidence, the courts were not the most suitable forum in which to pursue what must essentially be a matter of inquiry.  This Bill goes totally against that advice by providing that the usual procedure to be adopted where an alleged miscarriage of justice has occurred is that the aggrieved person can apply again to the Court of Criminal Appeal to have the conviction quashed.</P>
    <P>In addition, while the Martin Committee recommended that the power to refer cases should be given to the Attorney General, under the Bill an aggrieved person will have to apply to and satisfy the courts that there are substantial grounds for reopening an earlier decision of the courts.  Under this Bill it is only where there is a petition for the grant of a pardon that the Government may establish an <i>ad hoc</i> committee, with limited powers, to deal with each individual case.</P>
    <P>I have yet to hear a satisfactory explanation as to why the Government rejected the Martin approach.  There were rumours at the time that the Martin recommendations did not go down very well with some of his colleagues on the Bench.  It was suggested that some senior judical figures considered that the proposed statutory inquiry body would undermine the dignity and sanctity of their judgments.  If this was indeed the case, them some member of the Judiciary clearly regarded the dignity and sanctity of their judgments to be more important than putting in place the best possible procedures for dealing with miscarriages of justice.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="465" /> The Minister in her contribution &mdash; I have reread the passage a couple of times to see whether I could find any indication as to what exactly was the Government's reason for rejecting this key Martin recommendation &mdash; simply states that this is the one significant recommendation of the Martin Committee with which she cannot fully agree.  She said it was more appropriate that somebody should return to the Court of Criminal Appeal with their case.  She makes the point that only the Court of Criminal Appeal can overturn the earlier decision and that most people pursuing a miscarriage of justice case would want to return to the Court of Criminal Appeal to have their case overturned.  As I understand it, that is the logic of the Minister's explantion.  That presumes that the person against whom there has been a miscarriage of justice can get back to the Court of Criminal Appeal in the first place, and there is considerable doubt about that.  Indeed, the Martin Committee anticipated this line of logic which the Minister has now given.  I should like to quote a passage from the Martin Committee report in relation to the statutory inquiry body, which refutes the Minister's argument.  It states:</P>
    <P>We have given this aspect of the matter the fullest consideration and have taken into account the many submissions received.  As a result we are of the view that in the circumstances envisaged, where substantial doubt may arise as to the propriety of a conviction, the setting up of an independent body with powers of inquiry is by far the most effective manner of dealing with the situation.</P>
    <P>It considered a hypothetical case in which, say, five years following a conviction a prosecution witness, as a result of whose testimony the accused was convicted, developed qualms of conscience and is prepared to admit that it was his perjury which brought about the conviction and his forgery of the vital documents supporting such perjury which resulted in the miscarriage of justice.  The reality of the siuation is that such a <Col N="466" /> person, despite his remorse, may be entirely unwilling to testify in court proceedings unless given immunity from prosecution for perjury and forgery, a course which the Director of Public Prosecutions, in the proper exercise of his functions, may well refuse to take, thus effectively precluding any remedy for the miscarriage of justice within the court structure.</P>
    <P>The report goes on to argue why the most appropriate way of dealing with this is by a statutory inquiry body.  It flatly turns down the option of return to the court.  A number of recommendations of the Martin report is being taken on board, for example, the introduction of statutory procedures for the payment of compensation and the need to warn juries of the dangers of convicting on the basis of uncorroborated evidence.  However, other key recommendations of the Martin report have been ignored.</P>
    <P>A two-pronged approach is needed to solve the problem of miscarriages of justice: we need a procedure whereby cases involving miscarriages of justice can be reopened and, we need to ensure that every step is taken to prevent the miscarriage of justice in the first place.</P>
    <P>In this Bill the Government has completely ignored the recommendations of the Martin Committee in that regard.  For example, the Martin Committee recommended that all interviews of suspects by gardaí in Garda stations should be electronically recorded, but there is no reference to that in the Bill.  The only reference was made by the Minister when she said she accepted the recommendation in principle, that she proposes to set up a working party to consider how it might operate and that it will be carried out on a pilot basis in a number of Garda stations.</P>
    <P>I am curious about that provision because the Martin Committee should not have had to draw our attention to the need for electronic equipment to record interviews in Garda stations.  There is no necessity for the Minister to accept that recommendation in principle because that is covered in section 27 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, which states that <Col N="467" /> the Minister for Justice may, by regulation, provide for the recording by electronic or other similar means the questioning of persons by members of the Garda Síochána.  Although the matter was legislated for almost ten years ago the regulations permitting such recording have not been put in place and, consequently, there is no electronic recording in Garda stations.  Almost ten years after this House legislated for the electronic recording of interviews in Garda stations all we hear from the Minister is that she accepts the Martin Committee report in principle that she proposes to set up a working group to examine the matter and that this procedure will be carried out on a pilot basis in a number of Garda stations.</P>
    <P>I do not understand what a working group has to do with this matter.  The technology and means for carrying out either audio or visual electronic recordings is readily available in most large retail stores and is relatively inexpensive. Since electronic recording is a common method of recording I fail to understand why a working group needs to be set up to examine how such recording might operate in Garda stations ten years after being legislated for in this House.  In my view this is an excuse to put the implementation of this proposal on the long finger.  I cannot understand why this proposal should be introduced on a pilot basis.  Does that mean that a few Garda stations in every district will have electronic equipment in place and that if a member of the Garda wants to interview a suspect without the availability of such equipment, he can take the suspect to another station?  That would make a nonsense of the matter.</P>
    <P>I fail to understand why the provisions for installing such equipment have not been put in place.  In all the famous cases &mdash; the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four, the Nicky Kelly and Maguire cases &mdash; the miscarriages of justice arose from what happened in police stations, and by putting in place this mechanism as soon as possible we would be dealing with the problem at source.  In that way we could <Col N="468" /> ensure that suspects are not mistreated in the interview rooms of Garda stations and that the interview is carried out in a proper manner.  It would also assist the gardaí by providing a playback facility and, perhaps, lead to further questioning at a later stage.  Apart from providing protection for the suspect the electronic recording would assist the gardaí carrying out the interview.</P>
    <P>The Bill falls far short of what was recommended; it is very disappointing and will have to be amended.  I do not intend to oppose it on Second Stage because on Committee or Report Stages the Minister might be prevailed upon to amend some of the key sections to give effect to the recommendations in the report.  However, if the Minister persists in deviating from the recommendations of the Martin report, as is obvious in this Bill, I will reserve judgment about supporting it at that stage.  I will table the appropriate, Committee Stage amendments to give effect to the recommendations in the Martin Committee and I hope the Minister will respond positively. Regardless of the behind the scenes representations made to the Minister and her Department to depart from the recommendations in the Martin report, those of us representing the public will argue strongly that to ensure public confidence in our criminal justice system it is necessary that those recommendations as presented be implemented.  In that way miscarriages of justice could be prevented.  The Martin Committee acknowledges that miscarriages of justice will occur from time to time; nobody can state with certainty that there will never be another miscarriages of justice but if these recommendations are adopted an effective mechanism would be in place thus ensuring that victims have recourse to a mechanism through which all the circumstances of their case would be considered and they would not be restricted to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  At the same time it would filter out the less vexatious cases which clog up the system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which <Col N="469" /> attempts to deal with what has been a serious deficiency in our criminal justice system for some time.  We can benefit from the experience in other jurisdictions &mdash; the Birmingham Six, Guildford Four and Maguire cases in Great Britain.  The debate has been worth-while and I am sure the Committee Stage will accommodate a number of the viewpoints made during this debate, in particular the fundamental issue whether the courts procedure represents the best instrument for processing appeals of this nature or an alternative mechanism should be put in place.</P>
      <P>One can be very subjective in these cases.  I have always maintained that it was a source of embarrassment for this country to lobby the British Government continually about the Birmingham Six and other such cases when we did not have proper court procedures to deal with similar cases.  There is an urgent need to remedy our system in that regard. There was a procedure in Britain to deal with these cases, albeit in a most unsatisfactory manner but the system was in place and we can benefit from their experience.</P>
      <P>I was particularly interested in Deputy McDowell's, a practitioner in the field, enlightening contribution.  I believe that much of what he had to say is valid and could be examined by the Minister.  In that context suitable amendments could be brought forward on Committee Stage. However, let me sound a word of caution on the filtering process.  Deputy McDowell referred to the lack of a filtering process but we have to establish who will decide whether a case is frivolous or if the person is chancing his arm.  That is a great difficulty.  Hindsight is a virtue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure there are many people in Britain who were convinced that the Birmingham Six and the Maguires must have been involved in something illegal and were chancing their arm when they appealed.  It presents a great difficulty to ascertain who is telling the truth and we have to establish parameters for a court or a committee of inquiry to ascertain the truth, particularly when new witnesses come forward.  It is easier to adjudicate <Col N="470" /> on forensic or technical issues where clear cut scientific facts emerge than to adjudicate on what has been said by new witnesses or witnesses changing their original evidence.</P>
    <P>This Bill attempts to remedy a deficiency in the system and I hope we will improve on it during its passage through the House.  The Nicky Kelly example is a case in point.  It was unedifying to witness his slow progress in clearing his name and the way the issue of compensation was dragged out.  This Bill effectively puts to bed the whole issue of compensation and establishes it on a proper basis.  It gives a clear cut right to proper compensation to be determined quickly for anyone who has been wrongly convicted.  It also allows redress to the courts for anyone who is dissatisfied with the level of compensation on offer. Perhaps the alternatives to the court system which the Minister puts forward in the Bill &mdash; that is, the establishment of a committee of inquiry which would have the powers of a tribunal of inquiry &mdash; could be developed in parallel with the courts system.  I think there is a certain elasticity in the Bill to deal with that point.  Indeed a straightforward petition to the Minister for a pardon could be developed as well.  I believe the views that have been expressed could be accommodated in that context.</P>
    <P>On the question of the court asking the Garda Síochána to seek further evidence in a particular case, I take on board Deputy McDowell's point that one would not ask members of the alleged &ldquo;heavy gang&rdquo; to investigate themselves and tell us what happened.  However, it must be acknowledged that the Garda Síochána have effective internal investigation units and they are not unused to investigating themselves.  In fact, the Garda Síochána is one of the most successful models of the formation of a civilian police force in any country, particularly in a post-colonial administration emerging from a civil war.  It is one of the great monuments to the establishment of a democracy in this country.</P>
    <P>I would be cautious of ruling out the Garda in this situation.  It should be <Col N="471" /> within our competence to create a special investigative unit or to allocate certain personnel in the Force to this function, in other words, to have a body of personnel within the Garda Síochána to assist the Court of Criminal Appeal in producing extra evidence or re-examining certain cases.  We are a small country where people know more about each other than in larger jurisdictions but I would not ridicule the provision in the Bill that the Garda carry out further inquiries, which they have the power, experience and track record to do.  That option should not be ruled out.</P>
    <P>I accept the Minister's sincerity &mdash; I disagree with Deputy Gilmore in this respect &mdash; to put in place audio-visual recording of questioning at Garda stations.  The Minister is genuinely wanting to implement the system but it makes sense to establish a pilot scheme to ascertain the best means of doing so.  I imagine there will be many logistical difficulties and it is important that there be a uniform application of the system throughout the country.  It is regrettable that we have been slow to develop such systems given the fact that electronic recording was provided for in previous legislation.  The Minister is very determined to progress the pilot scheme and the subsequent scheme throughout the country.  This will complement the intent of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I detect in Britain and in Ireland an appreciable improvement in awareness and understanding within the court system of the possibilities of miscarriage of justice.  I suspect people have benefited from the miscarriage of justice that occurred in Britain over the past 15 years. I also suspect that the Judiciary are chastened by this experience.  I believe it has informed, and will continue to inform their approach to cases like this in the years ahead.  We hope some good will have come out of those incidents.  In that context the court system should provide an alternative means of appeal so that a person can be cleared of any wrong-doing under the criminal justice system which will be provided for if a person has the <Col N="472" /> right of appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal.</P>
    <P>In section 17 (1) the registrar is given significant powers to determine whether to summarily dismiss an appeal.  This needs to be further clarified.  This comes back to who determines if a case is genuine.  In the cases I mentioned they did not even get to the courts because of the filtering process whereby the Home Secretary or lower courts held the view that these cases were not valid or were frivolous and there was nothing to proceed with.  One would always be worried that a case could be summarily determined and dismissed.  The registrar might say the case does not merit a hearing.  I would like to see more detailed guidelines to enable the registrar to make that decision or parameters should be laid down to help the registrar in coming to such a decision.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell would have us believe that if this Bill is passed there will be a flood of applications from ingenious prisoners who will spend 15 to 20 years looking at ways and means of petitioning&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy might receive such letters because of his profession and his ingenuity in the legal field.</P>
      <P>The Registrar is empowered to summarily dismiss a case or decide if it proceeds but this matter should be reviewed.</P>
      <P>The provisions in regard to sentencing are welcome.  The Bill is comprehensive in that it deals with compensation, sentencing and conviction procedures.  In the past some sentences were excessive and one is often alarmed at the range of penalties handed down by judges in different jurisdictions.  Such variations in sentencing have given rise to concern so the provision to provide for appeal on the grounds of excessive sentencing is an important one.  People on the prosecuting side should have the right also to appeal what they consider too lenient a sentence, particularly if they are the victims.</P>
      <P>I look forward to the progress of this Bill and I am sure the Minister will accommodate the different viewpoints articulated during the Second Stage debate.  The Minister's track record in accommodating amendments and taking on board changes in regard to other legislation has been good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am alarmed at the perception among the public in relation to crime.  It is perceived that crime pays.  I welcome the debate although I do not welcome the Bill which was introduced in conjunction with the Martin report and will be food for thought for many people.  Many believe that the criminal justice system is weighted in favour of the criminal.  People have told me of the trauma they experienced when, having reported a crime, the person they believed to be the perpetrator was either not convicted or, if convicted, got only a lenient sentence.  Nobody wishes to see a miscarriage of justice whereby a person <Col N="474" /> is jailed for a crime he or she did not commit but there should be some standardisation of sentencing.  We have a good system of justice but no system is so good that it cannot be improved.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I support the recommendation that audio visual equipment be put in place at all Garda stations but it would be farcical if such equipment was installed on a pilot basis only.  Criminals know as much about the law as the professionals representing them, perhaps more in some cases, since knowing about such matters is part of their line of business. They know the shortfalls and the loopholes.  However, if audio visual equipment is put in place on a pilot basis and a suspect is apprehended close to a station with such equipment but interrogated at another place, he or she might allege that they were subjected to abuse and there would be no evidence either to prove or disprove such allegations.</P>
      <P>A suspect might, for instance, inflict injuries on himself or herself.  Such cases are not unknown and the Garda have a difficult task dealing with them.  I am sure the Garda would welcome such a scheme. It would be beneficial not only to the Garda but to the person who is being interviewed to ensure that, subsequently, his evidence is factual.  Such a system would not benefit the criminal.  Cost should not be a factor in the installation of such equipment.</P>
      <P>There has been a small number of miscarriages of justice cases where people have been exonerated in respect of alleged serious crimes.  We have become overly concerned because of serious miscarriages of justice across the water, those well documented cases of the Birmingham Six and the Guildford Four. Because of such cases we should not open up the criminal justice system to those who may abuse it.  In this country the punishment does not fit the crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Statistics show that the criminal has a 50:50 chance of getting away with crime. If a betting man believed there was a 50:50 chance of a horse winning a race he would bet his shirt on it.  Delays in bringing cases to court enable criminals to commit further crimes.  Sentences in <Col N="475" /> respect of crime are nominal and criminals can get early release for good behaviour. Criminals who are properly sentenced should serve the full term of their sentence.  The jail system is chock-a-block, the revolving door syndrome operates.  One criminal must be released before another is admitted and criminals are aware of this position.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the appeal system recommended under this Bill.  Murder is not the only hard crime.  Repeated house burglaries come within that category, too.  It is very traumatic on returning home to find that one's house has been ransacked.  Burglary is a hard crime, but it is treated as a petty crime.  The criminals concerned serve approximately five years in prison.  Under the provisions of the Bill such persons will be able to get a friend to act as alibi and say they were in another place when the crime was committed. Under the provisions of this Bill, too, such criminals will have the right to appeal their case, lay people are concerned about the lenient attitude to crime which supports that provision.  Will such criminals be allowed bail because of an overloaded system under which appeal cases may be delayed for a period of months or perhaps years or will they remain in jail?  Who will pay for the appeal?</P>
    <P>Having regard to the system the Minister proposes to implement, an appeal system will also have to be put in place. Will the Minister indicate if convicted persons will be allowed back out on the streets?  Every system must be available to ensure against miscarriages of justice, but I have confidence in the existing criminal justice system.  I support the appeals system recommendation in the Martin report.  It provides that a board of inquiry will question persons who act as alibis, to ascertain their background, their standing in the community and decide if their statement is reliable.  Such a measure is reasonable and preferable to the establishment of a court of criminal appeal to investigate such matters.  I am not a legal person but such a board of inquiry would not be as public as an <Col N="476" /> appeal case in a court of criminal appeal. To open the flood gates by providing a criminal system of appeal to those who would abuse it and consequently abuse society is not good enough and I could not support anything of that kind.</P>
    <P>I certainly agree with the points made about protecting the Garda and the victim and about having an audio visual system operating in the barracks where the investigation takes place.  I agree too with the Martin recommendation of a system of inquiry.  That will be another safeguard to ensure that people in jail are the people who committed the crime.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to adopt a stronger attitude to crime.  The 1993 figures show an increase in crime because the system is breaking down and crime is seen to pay well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. D. McDowell Mr. D. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Broadly speaking, we have been well served by our judicial system, it would be difficult to devise a better system.  That is not to say that the system cannot be improved or that the system does not make mistakes.  Unfortunately mistakes are made regularly. This Bill sets out to remedy miscarriages of justice.  Some of the circumstances in which miscarriages of justice occur have been alluded to by colleagues here and others are specifically mentioned in the Martin report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report points to circumstances where in good faith people have wrongly identified persons as being criminals.  We already have a procedure whereby judges are required to bring to the attention of juries the unreliability of identification evidence in circumstances where a person sees someone fleetingly and is subsequently asked, months or perhaps years later, to recall the person.  Other circumstances in which miscarriages of justice can be shown in retrospect relate to the Birmingham and Guildford cases where decades later improved forensic and scientific evidence showed that the evidence relied on at the time was unreliable. The committee points out circumstances where somebody recants, where somebody who has given crucial evidence admits that he has perjured <Col N="477" /> himself.  There are also circumstances in which new facts come to light or where facts which were regarded as being of little importance are subsequently seen to be far more important.  I mention all those circumstances, because in such circumstances it is probably appropriate to ask the courts to intervene again.</P>
    <P>There are circumstances where an appeal to the courts is probably inappropriate. There are cases where courts makes simple mistakes, where courts judge evidence to be wrong which subsequently turns out to be right, where courts choose to disregard evidence because it considers the witness to be unreliable and it subsequently turns out that the witness was telling the truth.  In such cases the jury or the judge has simply made a mistake and there is no need for further facts to come to light. We have seen plenty of well reported examples, for instance the Birmingham and Guildford cases where evidence was discounted and subsequently proved to have been accurate.  This has given rise to great public disquiet.  In those cases we are asking a great deal of the courts to ask them to reverse decisions.  Judges, understandably, are reluctant to condemn fellow judges or to say that the system has not worked.  I wonder whether going back to the courts in these cases is most appropriate.  The Martin Committee says that a committee set up by the Minister would have the advantage of being able to inquire into the circumstances rather than simply operating on the adversarial system like the courts.  In that type of circumstances an inquisitorial system would be far more appropriate.</P>
    <P>We must openly acknowledge that in a very limited number of cases judges do not perform well and do not cover themselves in glory.  The same could be said of juries.  They occasionally make perverse decisions.  There have been allegations that a judge has been asleep during the course of a significant amount of evidence given in one of our higher courts.  I wonder whether putting cases of that sort back into the judicial system will produce the necessary result.  We have observed a marked reluctance on <Col N="478" /> the part of some of the Judiciary in the famous cases in England effectively to condemn their fellow judges or parts of the judicial system.  They seemed reluctant to uphold cases where it seemed almost certain that there was physical abuse of prisoners while in custody.  We need only think of the famous Denning judgment in which the good judge could not conceive that the facts as alleged could possibly be true because if they were it would not serve the public good. The judge has since recanted that judgment, but it stood for a long time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. D. McDowell Mr. D. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>While in many cases recourse to the courts may be appropriate there are circumstances where it is not the best way and where the Martin Committee's suggestion of a committee of inquiry would seem more appropriate.</P>
      <P>Under the 1951 Criminal Justice Act the Minister for Justice can remit sentences or fines or can reduce fines.  The Minister in a response some months ago suggested that this power was used in about 4,000 cases in the last 12 months. That is extraordinary.  The judicial system has already been drawn into disrepute by the revolving door system which allows prisoners out simply because we have not enough room to accommodate them.  Under this petition system the Minister can overturn court decisions without further public review. That is also bringing the judicial system into disrepute.  I can well understand why judges in the District Court think twice when they are imposing a fine when the chances are that the individual concerned will appeal it to the Minister, who will consider the appeal in private and might overturn it.  I wonder whether we should use the system to the extent we are currently using it.  I am sure that when this system was instituted it was not intended to be used so regularly.  The system should be used only in exceptional circumstances but the figures the Minister produced some months ago suggest that it is used far more often than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="479" /> I unreservedly welcome some sections, particularly the section in relation to uncorroborated confessions.  The Bill has the balance right in that regard.  It would have been perverse to say that we could not convict on uncorroborated confessions. In that case a person could make a confession knowing that it was not sufficient to convict him, decide to plead not guilty at the last moment and try to undermine the confession.  Juries should be instructed that it is unwise to convict purely on confessional evidence and the Bill has got the balance right here.</P>
    <P>Confessional evidence brings into play the whole business of audio-visual tape recording of interviews in police stations. I know audio-visual tape recording was provided for in previous legislation in 1984.  I am surprised and disappointed that it has not happened before now but I warmly welcome the Minister's announcement that she is setting up a committee to advise her on how best it can be implemented.  The Martin Committee set out in detail the way it could be done.  I see no reason we could not implement most of its recommendations. I hope the committee to be set up by the Minister will complete its work quickly so that this necessary provision can be implemented soon.</P>
    <P>It is correct to say that this would be as much to the benefit of the Garda as to people in custody.  Having made a confession it would be easy for a person in custody to have second thoughts a few days later and allege that he was mistreated. It would be to the advantage of the Garda if they could prove clearly, with the aid of video tape, that this was not the case. I hope, therefore, that this provision will be implemented as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer briefly to the provision for the payment of compensation.  I am pleased that provision is being made for a statutory right to compensation but I am concerned about the wording used. It appears that the Minister will have discretion in the matter.  A person is either guilty or innocent.  If a person is exonerated he or she is entitled to compensation. <Col N="480" /> However, under section 9 the Minister will have discretion.  That section states that where the Minister for Justice is of the opinion tht a new or newly discovered fact shows beyond reasonable doubt that there has been a miscarriage of justice compensation shall be paid.  I do not think we should reserve that right to the Minister in those circumstances. We appear to be saying that although a person has been exonerated the Minister, if he or she still has some lingering doubts, can say that person is not entitled to compensation.  There should be an absolute right to compensation in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>We should also set out in regulations, not necessarily in legislation, the criteria to be used in deciding the amount to be paid in compensation.  I am aware that guidelines have been issued by the Home Office in Britain in this regard.  I hope the Minister will publish the regulations to be applied in assessing the amount to be be paid in compensation.  During the past few years there has been an unseemly wrangle in assessing the amount to be paid in compensation following the Nicky Kelly case.  It is important that this should be avoided if at all possible in the future.</P>
    <P>Earlier Deputy Mitchell referred to a number of issues raised in the Martin report which has not been dealt with in the Bill.  These are few in number but it is important that they are dealt with, not necessarily in legislation but in the Judges' Rules or regulations.  For example, we should set out the circumstances in which people will be entitled to legal advice and have access to a solicitor.  I hope the Minister will address those aspects.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It may not be appropriate in all circumstances to allow someone have recourse to the courts and it would not be difficult to imagine circumstances where this would not be appropriate.  Will the Minister reconsider this aspect?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea) Willie O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I thank Deputies for their contributions.  Many important issues have been raised and I <Col N="481" /> assure Deputies that these will be considered between now and Committee Stage.  Deputies will have an opportunity to raise them on Committee Stage and table amendments, if necessary.</P>
      <P>I would like to comment briefly on the main issues raised by Deputies.  Deputy McDowell strongly suggests that the reputation of the Court of Criminal Appeal would suffer if, on a subsequent application, it quashes a conviction it previously upheld.  With all due respect to the Deputy, a conviction will be quashed on the basis of new evidence; are-examination of previous evidence will not be required.  In any event the proposal made by Deputy McDowell that every case should be considered by a committee of inquiry would result in convictions which had previously been upheld being found to be mistaken.  The end result would be the same.  We should not shrink from the task of seeing that justice is done in every case.</P>
      <P>Deputy McDowell also suggested that in the absence of a process to filter applications to the Court of Criminal Appeal there would be an endless number of applications by convicted persons.  First, as he acknowledged, there is a procedure whereby frivolous or vexatious applications can be dismissed in a summary manner.  However, if a convicted person can produce new evidence which tends to show that his or her conviction was wrong that person should have the opportunity to put forward that evidence provided it is not vexatious, imaginary or thought up and which, at face value, deserves consideration.  If this proves to be awkward or embarrassing, so be it. Justice must be done and be seen to be done.  The standing of the courts in the eyes of the public can only be enhanced if a wrongful conviction is quashed and an innocent person is freed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell suggested that the Garda Commissioner may not be the appropriate person for the Court of Criminal Appeal to ask to make inquiries in an appeal as proposed in the Bill.  Under the Bill the Court of Criminal Appeal is being given an important new power to order the Garda Commissioner to carry <Col N="482" /> out inquiries to see if further evidence ought to be adduced.  It may happen that the behaviour or action of some gardaí may be among the issues raised by the appeallant during the appeal &mdash; they often are &mdash; but what is at issue is the duty of the Garda Commissioner to carry out specific orders issued by the Court of Criminal Appeal having heard all the evidence put forward.  The court will have to be satisfied that any report produced by the Garda Commissioner is adequate and answers the queries raised.  The Commissioner has access to the technical and forensic resources necessary to carry out the inquiry which the court would be likely to suggest.  It would not be appropriate, as suggested, to appoint a person such as the Attorney General who, first, would not have the resources and, second, whose functions would not fit in with the role proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell also said that the parents of a child who is killed and who are unhappy at the acquittal of a person charged in relation to the death should be empowered to petition the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Attorney General or the Minister for Justice to have the case re-opened.  I share his concern at the deep anguish felt by parents in this situation.  Everything possible must be done to ensure that persons suspected of criminal involvement in such a tragic death are brought before our courts.  However, the Deputy is suggesting in effect that the prosecution should have the right of appeal against an acquittal.  That is a fundamental proposal and it would need to be fully and thoroughly debated here before we could make such a change.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>We said we were going to give the Director of Public Prosecutions the right to appeal against a sentence which he considers is not severe enough and I should like to know if he will have the right to appeal against an acquittal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The State has got the right to appeal against a sentence which it considers is not severe enough; it does not <Col N="483" /> have the right to appeal against an acquittal.</P>
      <P>Deputies Mitchell and Gilmore would like the Minister to introduce legislation to implement Part II of the Martin report which deals with audio visual recordings. No legislation is required to implement it; this power is available under the Criminal Justice Act, 1984.  I recall the Committee Stage debate on that Bill in which Deputy Mitchell took part.  Under that legislation the Minister is empowered to make regulations which provide for the audio visual recording of interviews.  Unfortunately, this has not been done as yet.</P>
      <P>The question of instituting feasibility studies on the video taping of interrogations in the investigation of serious crime was first raised by Judge Barra O'Briain in his report in 1978.  I am glad the Minister for Justice is now making provision for the introduction of pilot schemes as recommended by the Martin Committee.  This was one of the questions considered by the Martin Committee which was reported in 1990.  The committee adverted to the fact that this power was available but had not been used.  It recommended that questioning in Garda custody should be recorded audio visually, initially by way of a pilot scheme in selected Garda stations.</P>
      <P>It is worth recalling the clear recognition by the committee of the preparation necessitated by their proposal.  It stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The implementation of such a recommendation is more easily said than done.  Apart from the considerable cost factor involved, which for obvious reasons we are unable to quantify, the choice and purchase of necessary equipment, the modification either by soundproofing or otherwise of interview rooms, together with the need for some degree of training in the techniques involved, must all of necessity involve delay, and perhaps what some might describe as considerable delay.  Should our recommendations be considered worthy of implementation, we would think it <Col N="484" /> unrealistic to expect more than a commitment towards implementation &ldquo;with all convenient speed&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Martin Committee's recommendation has been accepted in principle by the Government and the Minister will set up a steering committee for the introduction of audio and audio-visual recording of Garda questioning suspects on a pilot basis in selected Garda stations.  The steering committee is chaired by a Circuit Court judge, Mr. Esmond Smyth.  The Garda Síochána, the Attorney General, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Bar Council, the Incorporated Law Society and the Department of Justice are represented on it.  The steering committee held its first meeting in April and has met regularly since then.  It will make recommendations to the Minister on the location of the pilot schemes, the type of equipment to be used, the essential modifications to interview rooms, the Garda training required, a code of practice, a possible need to amend the Judges' Rules and the special arrangements adverted to by the Martin Committee which will be needed when questioning relates to terrorism or organised crime.  I understand that the steering committee is dealing actively with these matters and has also seen first hand the experience of electronic recording in England and Scotland.  When the Minister has received the steering committee's recommendations and agreed the features of the pilot scheme, the committee will arrange for the stringent monitoring and assessment of pilot schemes over a period of time.  The steering committee will also submit for the Minister's consideration a report on the outcome of such assessment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell referred to miscarriages of justice in the District Court. The Minister explained that it would not be practical for summary convictions to be referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  The District Court is not a court of record.  Such cases can be dealt with under the pardon provisions of the Bill, i.e. section 7.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell also referred to the <Col N="485" /> definition of new or newly discovered fact.  The suggestion made by the Deputy is one which the Minister intends to consider between now and Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell was concerned about the compensation provisions.  The Minister fully appreciates the point he made on recovering compensation from persons who cause miscarriages of justice. However, the practicality of what the Deputy proposes would have to be looked at.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell also wanted to know whether judges were consulted about section 10.  The Bill was discussed with a wide range of legal persons and their views have been taken into account in preparing the Bill.  Deputies Mitchell and McDowell did not seem to want persons to be able to refer again to the Court of Criminal Appeal but the only way a conviction can be set aside is on appeal to a court of law.  The Minister is providing for a committee which can investigate complex cases which cannot go back to court.  This is a more acceptable way of dealing with alleged miscarriages of justice.  Where the new evidence is inadmissible a committee will be established but, as it will not be a court of law, it cannot set aside convictions.  That is why we are providing, in effect, a dual procedure &mdash; access to the courts where appropriate or access to a committee where that is appropriate.  Where the courts cannot deal with a case the alternative of access to a committee is being provided.  With all due respect to the Deputies, we are providing the best of both worlds.</P>
    <P>Deputy Michael McDowell referred to cases in the 1940s mentioned by the Martin Committee.  I will not refer to any particular cases.  However, I repeat that a pardon does not automatically set aside a conviction.  Deputy McDowell assumes that people would prefer to go through the committee system rather than having their conviction set aside.  I have to question that assumption.  It is certainly not true in every case.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell was concerned that the provisions of this Bill would bring the criminal justice system into disrepute. <Col N="486" /> The provisions of the Bill clearly indicate confidence in our judicial system.  With respect to Deputy McDowell, it seems that it is he who does not have that confidence.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell referred to hearsay evidence.  In such cases referral to the court will, of course, be out of the question, because the court is not entitled to listen to hearsay evidence.  Under the provisions of the Bill, where a new fact is based on hearsay evidence, the alternative procedure of a petition to the Minister for an inquiry or a committee would be clearly appropriate.  It is not correct for Deputy McDowell to imply that the Bill does not provide for such circumstances.  He referred to damage to the integrity of the jury system.  We were very careful not to do anything that would in any way undermine the jury system. The new facts the Court of Criminal Appeal would hear would not have been before the jury system &mdash; that is the whole point of the procedure.  The basis for the referral to the Court of Criminal Appeal is only where a new or newly discovered fact is being considered.</P>
    <P>Deputy Michael McDowell referred to a person having to show beyond reasonable doubt that there has been a miscarriage of justice to qualify for compensation and Deputy Derek McDowell expressed some reservations about the compensation provisions.  The Minister will bear in mind what Deputies said when preparing Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore was concerned about cases where persons cannot get back to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  At the risk of repeating myself, such cases will be dealt with by the alternative system provided in the Bill and that includes the committee which will have the same powers as the inquiry body recommended by the Martin Committee.</P>
    <P>Deputy Martin referred to the powers given to the registrar of the Court of Criminal Appeal under section 5.  The registrar is the person involved in administration. However, jurisdiction of the court under section 5 will be exercised by a judge of that court and his decision can <Col N="487" /> be appealed to the full Court of Criminal Appeal.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boylan was concerned that there might be frivolous appeals.  As I already said, no matter what system is put in place, there will be frivolous applications and the Bill provides clear procedures for dealing with them, whether they are made to the court or the Minister.</P>
    <P>Deputy Derek McDowell asked why the Minister was not taking the opportunity to provide for major changes to our criminal justice system, such as giving the courts inquisitorial functions, etc. The Bill is specific in its objectives and I am satisfied that it meets them.  Other changes to our legal system would have to be considered only after very careful debate.  A country would be very foolish to precipitately change its long established and proven legal procedures unless there was certainty about what was to replace them and it certainly would not be appropriate to replace them piecemeal. The procedures in other countries are sometimes held up as being better than ours, the result of the belief that the grass is greener elsewhere.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 54 together.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach and I had a meeting with John Hume earlier today.  For the information of the House, I will read the joint statement the Taoiseach and I issued after that meeting:</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach, Mr. Albert Reynolds, TD, and the Tánaiste, Mr. Dick Spring, TD, this morning met the leader of the SDLP, Mr. John Hume, who briefed them on the position reached to date in his discussions with the leader of Sinn Féin, Mr. Gerry Adams.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste took the opportunity to express their deep appreciation of the work done by John Hume over the years in the cause of peace.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste believe that the highest political priority must be given to establishing a basis for a just and lasting peace and a permanent cessation of all violence. They will accordingly evaluate carefully the position conveyed to them, and consult with the Government, with a view to ensuring that it can make a very important contribution towards building a consensus for peace.  It would be their intention to take full account of it, and decide how best to continue their efforts in their discussions with the British Government for the achievement of the objective of peace on this island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By definition, this work will require much patient work and preparation. The Government will not be elaborating in further detail for the moment.  A period of reflection, assessment and discussion is now necessary, and the Government believes that in <Col N="490" /> the interests of peace the need for confidentiality should be respected.</P>
    <P>The ultimate goal of all parties committed to a peaceful approach must be to reach a lasting political settlement, which can only be achieved on the basis of the widest political dialogue and participation, with the consent of the people living in Ireland, both North and South.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Unfortunately, it does not clarify for Members what exactly took place at the meeting.  I should like him to elaborate further on what took place at the meeting, the nature of the document, if any, given to the Government, the length of the document and whether that document contained specific proposals or a summary of the discussions which have taken place over the past number of months.  On the basis of the meeting with John Hume, does the Minister expect a cessation of all violence shortly?  Having regard to the sense of isolation felt by the Unionist community and the threat posed to them by these discussions with the Irish Government, can the Minister assure the House that the Government will take these fears into account before it proceeds further along the road with John Hume and Gerry Adams, taking into account the primary objective of bringing about an end to violence and a resumption of the talks between the constitutional parties in the North?</P>

As I said clearly, it is not my intention to elaborate on the nature or content of the discussion which took place between the Taoiseach, John Hume and me.  A period of reflection is necessary.  I ask Members to understand this position.  The meeting took place only this morning.  John Hume has been working for many years to establish peace on this island and to bring an end to the conflict which has ravaged Northern Ireland for the past 25 years.  Both the Taoiseach and I are very conscious of the fears which exist among both communities in Northern Ireland.  I appeal to the House not to take any action or make any statement which would heighten the fears which already exist among both communities.  I reiterate that we need a period of reflection, assessment and discussion.  Obviously the Taoiseach and I wish to consult our Government colleagues on the outcome of the discussion.</P>

      <P>I concur with the points made by the Taoiseach in this House <Col N="492" /> yesterday and at the talks this morning &mdash; any constructive opportunity, which will help establish a peace process on this island, must be taken up.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2, 60, 85 and 94 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following reciprocal recognition by Israel and the PLO on 9 September 1993 a Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government Arrangements was signed in Washington by Israel and the PLO on 13 September 1993.  After the joint declaration takes effect on 13 October 1993 autonomy for Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip is scheduled to proceed as follows: by 13 December 1993, the two sides will sign an agreement on Israeli military withdrawal from Jericho and the Gaza Strip; military withdrawal from Jericho and Gaza will be completed by 13 April 1994; by 13 July 1994 there will be direct elections for a representative council of Palestinians. Israeli military forces will withdraw outside populated areas prior to elections for the council; further pullbacks will take place as Palestinian police assume <Col N="493" /> responsibility; and the mandate for the initial representative council of Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza Strip will not exceed five years.  Negotiations on the permanent status of the West Bank and Gaza Strip will begin not later than 13 December 1995 and conclude by 13 December 1998.</P>
    <P>This historic agreement represents a major step towards the establishment of a just, comprehensive and durable settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict.  For the first time it addresses the core issues which have troubled the region for decades.</P>
    <P>There are indications that the signing of the Israeli-PLO Agreement may lead to further bilateral agreements between Israel and its other Arab neighbours, initially Jordan, and subsequently Syria and Lebanon.  Such agreements would be central to the process of achieving a comprehensive settlement to the problems of the Middle East.  Ireland, together with its EC partners, is actively involved in the multilateral track of the peace process and is firmly committed to the success of the current negotiations.</P>
    <P>Diplomatic relations between Ireland and Israel are at present conducted at ambassadorial level on a non-residential basis.  The question of the establishment of a resident Israeli Embassy in Ireland is under active examination but no decision has yet been taken.  As I mentioned in my speech to the United Nations General Assembly on 1 October 1993, the Government will take steps to strengthen and develop our good relations with Israel and with the Palestinian people, and these were among the topics discussed with the Israeli Foreign Minister, Mr. Shimon Peres, and with the Foreign Affairs Spokesman of the PLO, Farouk Khaddoumi, during my visit to New York last week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the whole world is watching this peace process and welcoming it, will the Minister be a little more specific in regard to giving approval for the setting up of an embassy here, as he has done in regard to South Africa.  He seems to be willing <Col N="494" /> to open diplomatic relations directly with South Africa.  Will he give an assurance that his word will prevail at Cabinet in having an Israeli embassy in Ireland?</P>
      <P>Has Ireland committed any funding towards the setting up of the new territories in Israel?  In view of the fact that the behaviour of neighbouring countries will be central to the continuation of this peace process, has the Minister made contact with some of Israel's neighbouring governments, such as the Iranian Government, to ensure that they do not continue giving support to some of the factions, such as Hezbollah, that are adding to instability on the borders of Israel?</P>

As I said at the UN, there is an opportunity for Ireland to enhance and further strengthen our diplomatic relations with both Israel and the Palestinians and I will be bringing proposals to my Government colleagues to ensure that is done.</P>
      <P>In relation to financial support, at the Conference of Donors to the Occupied Territories in Washington on 1 October 1993 Ireland pledged US$1 million in aid for the occupied territories in 1994.  At EC level we have been co-operating with our Community colleagues and have decided to make 20 million ECU available immediately as emergency aid.  The EC Commission has also proposed a medium-term aid package of 500 million ECU and Ireland has supported this proposal.</P>
      <P>The matter raised by the Deputy in relation to the continuing instability in the Middle East region is one of which we are all very conscious.  The matter was raised by me at my meeting with the Iranian Foreign Minister in New York last week and it has been raised also by my EC colleagues.  There is a direct involvement for the neighbouring countries in the Middle East in establishing and helping the peace process and I set out to convince my Iranian colleague of that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 5, 43, 72 and 88 together.</P>
      <P>It has been the policy of this Government to reach out in every way possible to representatives of the Unionist community in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Programme for Government underlines the importance which we attach to dialogue with the parties in Northern Ireland in the pursuit of peace and of lasting political progress.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach and I have made abundantly clear our desire to enter into dialogue with Unionist political leaders. Through a variety of channels, we have emphasised our interest in hearing their views and concerns at first hand and in discussing with them ways in which a lasting accommodation can be reached between the two traditions in Ireland.  I am satisfied that Unionist leaders are fully aware of our interest.</P>
      <P>The Government is deeply committed to the recommencement of political talks with the aim of achieving peace and reconciling the legitimate rights and aspirations of both traditions. We are working in every way possible to achieve a resumption of the process of dialogue with the parties in Northern Ireland and the British Government.  Our goal is a fair and comprehensive settlement which will address all of the key relationships and will be conducive to lasting peace and stability.</P>
      <P>At the most recent meeting of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference on 10 September, both Governments underlined the urgency and importance of the search for political agreement.  We agreed to continue to co-operate closely and actively to promote political progress by every possible means.  We also agreed to continue to seek common areas of agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consultation between both Governments on ways of achieving political progress in relation to Northern Ireland takes place on an ongoing basis within <Col N="497" /> the framework of the Anglo-Irish Conference. Officials of the two Governments are in continuous contact for the purpose of preparing discussions at meetings of the conference.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of whether I have established a study group in my Department to evaluate the status in law of Articles 2 and 3, I can assure the Deputy that the Government devotes detailed and ongoing attention to all issues which are relevant to the pursuit of a lasting settlement.</P>
    <P>We are ready to make our contribution to the search for agreement.  As I made clear in my address to the United Nations General Assembly last week, we will bring to any resumed talks the resources of goodwill, flexibility and imagination which we believe all participants must display.  We are ready to accept the need for radical and innovative compromise as part of a new accommodation.</P>
    <P>I believe strongly that there is no greater imperative for the two Governments and the parties than to sit down together and to seek a lasting political accommodation through dialogue.  The people of Northern Ireland are trapped in a murderous <i>cul-de-sac</i> and all of us have a part to play in leading them out of it.  The Irish Government will do everything in its power to find a basis for lasting peace, stability and reconciliation on this island.</P>
    <P>The two Governments have a shared responsibility to lead the search for a solution.  That responsibility will remain even if a resumption of the talks process finally eludes us or if resumed talks do not succeed.  In such circumstances, the two Governments would clearly need to consider other ways in which progress might be achievable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>If lines of communication are open to the Unionist community, is the Minister willing to signal to them publicly how he reconciles the notion that Article 1 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement recognises that the status of Northern Ireland will not change without the consent of the majority of people there and, as the Taoiseach reiterated <Col N="498" /> yesterday, it is not the Government's intention to seek any change in that principle, with the suggestion that there is a right of collective self-determination on the part of the Irish people as a whole? Will he indicate to the Unionist community which of those two principles predominates in his approach to the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said on many occasions, it is the desire of both the Taoiseach and myself that there would be dialogue between the Unionist leaders and the Irish Government.  We believe that would be helpful to the whole process of establishing and working for peace on this island.  The Taoiseach affirmed yesterday to this House that Article 1 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement makes it very clear that the &ldquo;the two Governments affirm that any change in the status of Northern Ireland would only come about with the consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland&rdquo;.  That is the Government's position.  There is no intention to vary from it because that is the accepted position under an international agreement lodged with the United Nations.  As I said in reply to the first question from Deputy Owen, it is important at this stage that there is an opportunity for the Government to reflect on the discussions which we have had to date and to consult on how we can further this process.  Nobody on this island wants to see a continuation of the violence which has been prevalent on this island for the past 25 years and it will require reflection, assessment and political skills to bring back the parties on this island to the talks.  In relation to the Unionist leaders and, reports in today's newspapers that Mr. Molynaux may seek a meeting with me, I would welcome such an invitation from Mr. Molynaux and I would make every effort to take up that invitation.</P>

      <P>In relation to the report that working groups were established following the last meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference, will the Minister indicate what those working groups were and their terms of reference?  Will <Col N="499" /> he indicate the length of time which he expects the period of reflection will take on the report he received from John Hume today?  Does he not agree it is important that all of the parties in this House have an opportunity to reflect on what John Hume has agreed with Gerry Adams?  Will he avail of an early opportunity to have a statement made in this House &mdash; if possible next week &mdash; with regard to that matter so that the House can be given an opportunity to discuss it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall conclude on this question.  Will the Minister indicate &mdash; this is not covered in the statement issued by him and the Taoiseach today &mdash; whether he will call on Sinn Féin and the IRA to stop their campaign of killing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me start with the latter request.  I will certainly repeat a call which has been made many times by the Taoiseach and myself, including this week.  I appeal again to the Provisional IRA, and indeed to the Loyalist paramilitaries, to stop the violence in Northern Ireland and allow the possibilities for the peace process and dialogue to recommence.  I value the commitment in this House to the democratic process, to finding a peaceful resolution to the conflict on this island.  Certainly, I shall be mindful of the requests by Deputies De Rossa and Owen that the parties and Members should be informed at the earliest opportunity.  I do not want to put a time constraint on the Government's reflection.  At the same time I say to Members that there is a genuine feeling in Government that we accord the highest political priority to establishing a basis for peace on this island.  In that respect there will not be any delay on the part of Government in assessing and forming views in relation to the discussions that took place this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both Governments, obviously, are committed to re-launching dialogue aimed at a comprehensive settlement.  It <Col N="500" /> is obvious that prospects for dialogue cannot be realised without the agreement and co-operation of both Governments and both Governments are fully aware of this.  The issues under discussion essentially are how their co-operation and resources can be brought to bear on the situation in the manner most conducive to the progress both Governments wish to see.  In this connection there is sustained contact with the British Government, both at political and official level, within the framework of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  This is part of the ongoing process, that officials are available for a regular exchange of views and ideas to ascertain whether we can make progress and find ways forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, and I shall endeavour to assist the Chair in doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the Minister's statement in New York, in which he indicated that we all needed to assess our assumptions about Northern Ireland and the overall Irish situation, will the Minister say whether he would agree with the late Professor Torkel Opsahl, that the concept of national self-determination in divided societies, such as that in Northern Ireland, in unhelpful?  That was the view the late Professor Opsahl expressed in his report.  He indicated it was one of the <Col N="501" /> reasons, one of the designs, behind nost of the conflict and war in the former Yugoslavia.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me avail of this opportunity to pay my respects to the work undertaken by the late Professor Opsahl whose untimely death was a sad loss to anybody involved in the peace process and, indeed, to the establishment of human rights.  There are many historic complexities in relation to the conflict in Northern Ireland.  As Deputy De Rossa said, I consider what is most important at this stage is that, if possible, we shake off the baggage of our history.  We must approach this conflict and problem with a new enlightenment.  As I said on many occasions, it will be difficult, will involve political risk, involve patience and, indeed, determination but, most of all, it will involve compromise and generosity on the part of both communities in Northern Ireland.  I hope both communities, within the context of a resumed dialogue, will work for a peaceful settlement and try to ascertain whether we can find a solution that will allow both communities, neither being threatened by the other, to live in peace in northern Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 27, 48 and 105 together.</P>
      <P>The Government has allocated £100,000 from the Emergency Humanitarian Relief Fund to assist the victims of the earthquake in the Indian state of Maharastra.  The Government's assistance is being channelled through five Irish NGOs: Concern, GOAL, Christian Aid and World Vision Ireland as well as through the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. The Government will decide on possible further emergency assistance in the light of the information which we obtain from the Irish NGOs and the international agencies which are helping the relief operation in the area.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, this tragedy took place while the President was in India on her State visit and she immediately sent a message of sympathy on behalf of the Irish people to the President of India.  The Taoiseach has also expressed the Government's condolences to the Indian Prime Minister.  I would like to take this opportunity to add my own personal sympathy to the Government and people of India on the occasion of this terrible tragedy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I too should like to express my sympathy to the Indian people on this horrific tragedy.  It is almost incomprehensible how this sort of tragedy could affect so many people.  It is equivalent to a town like Clonmel or Kilkenny being wiped out overnight.  That gives one an idea of the depth of the tragedy.  Are there proposals to make more money available, in addition to the £100,000 the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, announced when in India?  Will the Minister review the possibility of sending people with particular expertise that might be required in the re-establishment of these communities that have been completely wiped out?  Will he make the requisite moneys available and grant leave of absence to people from, for example, local authorities and so on who might be willing to assist in rebuilding those communities?</P>

      <P>The question of additional funds is one the Government will decide when it obtains an assessment of the position described by Deputy Owen?  We will receive that assessment from the Irish NGOs and international agencies helping in the relief operations.  When we receive that assessment I hope we shall be in a position to respond generously, as our people have done on many occasions when world tragedies occurred.</P>

      <P>In assessing the additional response the Government might make, will the Minister bear in mind that India, when these priority countries were established in the seventies, was one of our priority countries? We have a long, historic association with India.  Will he agree that as this tragedy was so enormous there is an obligation on us to put our best foot forward and help in any way we can the people there to pick up what is left after this tragedy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware of the historic links between India and Ireland. Those links certainly were strengthened during the course of our President's visit to that country last week.  It would be our intention to do everything possible to assist but, obviously, we shall have to await an assessment by the agencies or NGOs on the ground.  When we receive that we will be in a position to assess what are their needs.  Initially, it was a question of getting funding in for relief as quickly as possible.  When we assess whatever is desirable and necessary we will be able to do whatever is required of an Irish Government.  On Deputy Owen's question, if there is a call for specialist services, medical or otherwise, I am sure the Government will respond favourably.</P>

As soon as the proposals are finalised they will be submitted to Government for approval.</P>

Is it intended that the Freedom of Information Bill will amend the ruling on Cabinet confidentiality given that the confidentiality rule has impinged in a major way on the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Beef Processing Industry?  We do not know whether similar circumstances may arise again.  Is it intended to make provision for an appeals system in the Bill where a Department refuses to provide information because they consider it to be sensitive?  Will the Minister consider using the Ombudsman's Office as a means of ensuring that the information sought would be provided?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The practice in other jurisdictions has been to provide an appeals procedure and at this stage of the proposals we also envisage providing one.  The Deputy referred to the possibility of using the Ombudsman's Office as a means of obtaining information, there is also the possibility of using the Data Protection Office or an independent office.  These details will be studied and investigated with a view to deciding the best option.  The first issue raised related to a finding of the Supreme Court in relation to Cabinet confidentiality.  The Supreme Court found that Cabinet confidentiality was a constitutional requirement. It would require a constitutional amendment to change this.  In the proposals which I am preparing we are examining freedom of information legislation, not a constitutional amendment, because, it does not arise in relation to these proposals.</P>

Will there come a time, say, after 40 or 50 years when, on the Minister's best legal advice, Cabinet papers cease to be confidential? Are there any circumstances in which the Cabinet can waive confidentiality requirements?  Do they apply only to the present Cabinet or to previous Cabinet papers?  Will Cabinet papers continue to be deposited in the national <Col N="506" /> achieve as long as that judgment stands in its present unsatisfactory form?</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>

      <Quest>if he will give his reaction to recent murders and violence in Northern Ireland.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Everyone in Northern Ireland is entitled to lead his or her life in peace, free from the threat of murder or maiming by paramilitaries.  In this House and elsewhere, I have made clear my total revulsion at and condemnation of the activities of groups which seek to achieve their ends by violence, from whatever side they come.  Their actions <Col N="507" /> bring in their wake death and misery, they undermine hopes of economic and social progress and deepen divisions within Northern Ireland.  Just as I condemn Republican paramilitaries, whose repeated acts of violence make a mockery of their declared objectives, so I condemn the murderous activities of Loyalist paramilitaries who last year and this year have been responsible for more deaths than any other group.  I reject in particular their attempts to justify their recent violent attacks on elected political representatives by invoking the spectre of a so-called &ldquo;pan nationalist front&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Last week, I stated at the General Assembly of the United Nations that the continuation of violence is the single greatest obstacle to the realisation of our hopes of a way forward in Northern Ireland.  It must surely be clear that an end to violence could open up new possibilities in the search for a lasting settlement on this island, and thereby set us on the path to peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to endorse every sentence and syllable of the Minister's response to my question and in particular to make it clear that his utter condemnation of violence, Loyalist and Republican, has the full support of this side of the House.  Does the Minister anticipate a cessation of that violence or even a ceasefire in the near future?  Will he accept that the only real response to the violence will be provided by way of a political solution?  Does the Minister accept that the only real response ultimately will be by way of a political solution, regardless of whatever security measures are taken, leading to a total ending of violence?  Bearing in mind the concern of this House and the goodwill of its Members towards the work he is trying to do, will he map out the steps he envisages taking in the coming months to achieve a workable solution acceptable to both communities in Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe has reiterated my own strong condemnation of violence on this and on other occasions <Col N="508" /> and I welcome it.  That has been the view of this House for many years.  Obviously we want a political solution that has the consent of the people of Northern Ireland and indeed the consent of the people of this island.  As I said in reply to Deputy Owen, that will require the best political skills available in this island, the co-operation of the Irish and British Governments and of the parties in Northern Ireland.  The late Professor Opsahl said that if you can remove the violence from the conflict it should provide the key to solving it.  Obviously there is a very strong desire to solve the conflict.  The vast majority of the communities and the people in Northern Ireland do not want a continuation of violence.  Political leadership is required to find the mechanism whereby we can bring about an end to violence and allow the people of Northern Ireland to live their lives in a peaceful manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that it is Government policy to try to re-establish the talks and to get the constitutional parties back to the table.  If that does not work will the Tánaiste give an indication as to what alternative strategy he may have in mind from the point of view of trying to achieve that political solution to which we referred?  For instance, does he consider that the first proposals of the late Professor Opsahl, involving the establishment of an official commission, would be of any assistance if the talks do not get underway?  Does he feel that any alternative strategy from the point of view of both Governments presenting jointly agreed options to the various parties would be helpful?  Is he in a position to give an indication to the House what the approach might be in the event of the talks not getting underway in the near future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be unhelpful if we were to attempt to pursue hypotheses such as if the talks do not resume, if the present process does not come to anything.  What is important is that the Government and all politicians apply themselves to the present process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="509" /> We have been striving, albeit with difficulties, since the Government took office to have a resumption of the talks. That has proved to be a difficult task, but notwithstanding that, the Government is determined to continue with the British Government the dialogue we have been having over many months.  The Deputy will be aware that in the past number of weeks the Secretary of State and his colleagues in Northern Ireland have been undertaking a round of bilateral discussions with the parties in Northern Ireland.  I will be discussing the outcome of those discussions with the Secretary of State at the next meeting of the Intergovernmental Conference this month. The Government may then be in a position to see what progress can be made.</P>
    <P>We should be extremely cautious and careful not to enter into the realms of speculation and not to attempt to hypothesise the various scenarios.  I think everybody in this House is committed to working for a peaceful resolution to the problems and that is certainly my determination and that of the Taoiseach and the Government.  That is what we should pursue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Does this mean the Minister no longer holds the view he expressed in the interview he gave to <i>The Guardian</i> on joint sovereignty as an option for Northern Ireland?  He told us not to speculate and not to hypothesise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to the full interview so that she can read my views on joint sovereignty.  What I said very clearly in the context of a document published by the British Labour Party was that anybody should be allowed to bring forward proposals in relation to joint sovereignty or other options.  At all times I have said that we should be allowed to enter into discussions and dialogue without preconditions.  I do not think it is helpful if people on any side lay down preconditions.  Some of the difficulties in getting a resumption of the dialogue were because parties and individuals laid down preconditions.  We should not lay down preconditions but if <Col N="510" /> the Deputy is wondering if the Government's option is joint authority, it is not.</P>

      <P>I am sympathetic to the Minister's position.  However, I find it difficult to accept the advice that we must be patient, given that we do not know what is going on.  In the absence of hard information there will inevitably be speculation.  My concern is that in the current process there is no doubt that the position of the IRA and Sinn Féin is being strengthened and as a consequence the position of the Loyalist paramilitaries is being strengthened.  My contacts in Belfast indicate to me that the fear in Belfast is palpable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I must dissuade the Deputy from making a statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>It was by way of preamble to my question.  Will the Minister indicate at what point he feels he can give us hard information on the process? Our fear is that while it is being promoted as a peace process it may in fact lead in the opposite direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very conscious that any action on my part or on the Government's part should not lead to an increase in the violence in Northern Ireland.  We have made it clear at all times that we do not wish to threaten or coerce either the Loyalists or the Nationalists in Northern Ireland.  Any solution to the problem must be brought about by consent of the people of Northern Ireland.  If the people of Northern Ireland are listening to the comment from Dublin today, they should not have any fears about this process.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is in the same position as my Cabinet colleagues in relation to information and I believe it is the prerogative of the Taoiseach and me to consult our Cabinet colleagues at the earliest opportunity and then to make the decision to make the information available to this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Bearing in mind that the Minister said in a published speech at a conference in Cambridge <Col N="511" /> recently that the elements of the jigsaw are already there and it is largely a matter of piecing them together in a political process, will he say whether that stands in view of the subsequent developments that led to the latest round of interest in the Hume-Adams process?  Will he indicate in that context whether he thinks it is satisfactory that the army council of the IRA should be aware of the contents of these documents but that Dáil Éireann should be kept in the dark?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The remarks I made in Cambridge in early September still stand. I believe there is a possibility in terms of the discussions taking place between the British and Irish Governments that we can find a way of piecing together the many complex parts in working towards a solution to our problem.</P>
      <P>In response to the other part of the Deputy's question, it is extremely important that anybody who wants to be part of the process should make it very clear that he does not want to be associated with violence and that the killings and the bombings should stop.  It is moral and political blindness to imagine that one can inflict such harm on fellow Irish people and expect to be part of the political process.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the fact that Members of the House and the Leaders of the Opposition parties do not have the information but our Cabinet colleagues should be the first to receive it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>During the summer the Minister mooted the idea of a peace envoy and the former President of the US, Mr. Carter, was approached.  Was this approach taken with the assent of the Government?  What is the status of that proposal at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy would want to read the reports he is commenting from a bit more carefully.  To give the background, the appointment of a peace envoy was raised in the context of the American elections last year.  The matter was discussed by the Taoiseach and President <Col N="512" /> Clinton in March of this year and it was raised with President Clinton on my visit to Washington.  The American people, who have been extremely helpful in terms of economic and political assistance to this country, wish, if it is desired by the British and Irish Governments, to play a helpful role.  There has been no recent discussion with the American administration in relation to it and I understand the position is as stated by President Clinton and the Taoiseach on 17 March this year.</P>

      <P>I share the total confidence of this House that the Irish team will qualify for the World Cup finals.  All our preparations are certainly being made on that basis, and judging by the number of questions, everybody obviously likes winners.</P>
      <P>We have already made representations on the visa issue to the US authorities at the highest level.  When President Robinson was in Washington in May she mentioned our concerns to President Clinton. During the same visit, I met Secretary of State Warren Christopher and emphasised our concern that everything possible be done to smooth the way for Irish fans travelling to the US.  I intend to take up the matter again when I visit Washington next month.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Friends of Ireland in Congress have also raised the issue with the US authorities.  Our embassy in Washington is continuing to impress on the Immigration and Naturalisation Service and other relevant agencies the importance we attach to the matter.</P>

      <Col N="515" /> In Dublin, my Department are maintaining close contact with the US Embassy, the Football Association of Ireland and the Irish Travel Agents' Association about special arrangements that can be made to process passport and visa applications rapidly.</P>
    <P>Everyone involved fully realises the importance of a positive and flexible approach and the need to ensure that genuine supporters do not encounter visa problems.</P>
    <P>I would like to use this opportunity to make a special plea to fans intending to travel to the US to assist by applying for passports and visas in good time.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to people having confidence.  I ask him to note that the many questions tabled on this subject indicate particular confidence in the Fine Gael benches.  All the questions have been tabled by Members from those benches.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that if the Irish team are playing in the Boston area thousands of people will apply to go to the United States for the World Cup, many of whom will be young, unemployed and well educated people?  Will the Minister agree also that those are the cartegories of people who will have the most difficulty in securing visas under the present stringent conditions attached to visa applications for the World Cup?  In those circumstances will the Minister assure us that everything possible will be done to ensure that the necessary advance arrangements are made so that chaos, disappointment and hardship are avoided?</P>

      <P>I assure Deputy Currie that every effort will be made in that regard.  The Government has been conscious for some time of the potential problems that may arise in relation to visas for the World Cup.  As far back as last May the matter was raised with President Clinton in Washington.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="516" /> Despite the tradition of Gaelic football in north Kerry, I will probably receive as many requests for visas to the United States for the World Cup as any other Deputy in this House.</P>

      <P>All I can say is &ldquo;God help Mayo&rdquo;.  Obviously, many people will apply for visas to the United States for the World Cup and I would advise them to apply for their passports and visas in good time.  Our discussions with the Football Association of Ireland, the US Embassy and the Irish Travel Agents Association will eliminate many of the problems which could arise, especially having regard to the experience of the Football Association of Ireland and Irish Travel Agents Association in respect of the World Cup in Italy.  I hope that with the co-operation of the US Embassy we can eliminate many of the difficulties that could arise.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We must bear in mind that the criteria laid down by the American Embassy for entry to the US will eliminate a number of football supporters.  Will the Minister ensure as far as possible that proof of having attended previous qualification and World Cup matches is taken as a genuine intererst in the game for those wishing to travel to the United States? On a broader note, while the American Embassy issued 600,000 visas to this country in the past ten years, will the Minister investigate why Ireland is one of the few countries requiring a visa to enter the United States?  The same stringent <Col N="517" /> requirements do not apply to most of our European partners.</P>

I am unsure whether I should send replies to his Dublin or Mayo address, but if he raises that matter with me again I will reply to it.</P>
      <P>Many difficulties arise in respect of visas to the United States, some of which have been raised in this House from time to time.  I would remind the Deputy that the American Embassy, as an agent of the American Administration, makes its own rules and regulations and we will consider the Deputy's suggestion in the discussions which will take place between the embassy, the FAI and the Irish Travel Agents Association.  I commend the FAI for its accommodation of soccer fans both on a domestic level and on trips abroad and for the great work it has done for the sport.  This matter will require consultation and negotiation between the US Embassy and ourselves and we will do everything possible to eliminate any problems which might arise.  Indeed, many problems will arise because of the strict criteria laid down by the US Embassy but we will do everything possible to eliminate them and, for that reason, we commenced negotiations on this matter last May.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that since citizens from nine of the 12 member states, including Northern Ireland, do not require a visitors visa to enter the US and the same applies to citizens of San Marino, Liechtenstein and New Zealand, the problem is not one of representation to the US Embassy but of updating two friendship agreements, the No. 7 Treaty of 1950 and the No. 10 Treaty of 1948, which seem to have operated in only one direction?  I regret that I must take away from some of the good natured exchanges that have taken place <Col N="518" /> between the two countries, but we have provided a fine house in the Phoenix Park at a cost of 1p a year as part of a friendship agreement between the two countries.</P>

Is he aware that visas are given to other EC member states with a higher rate of unemployment than Ireland?  Is he further aware that US citizens coming to Ireland, including people working in this House, do not require a visa?  If the agreements on economic co-operation and friendship are relevant, why are we being treated in that manner?</P>

      <P>As I stated in a reply to Deputy Kenny, the US authorities are responsible for the implementation of US law but I am aware of the discrepancy raised by the Deputy and I will pursue it. Obviously I would prefer if visas were not required for Irish citizens travelling to the United States and that is the desired conclusion, but at present we must endeavour to put in place a system whereby we can obtain the visas required for the World Cup.  In the context of our discussions in that regard we can attempt to make progress in respect of securing access to the United States for Irish citizens without a visa.  The American Government and our friends in Congress have been extremely helpful in providing access to the US for Irish citizens in the past number of years by way of the Morrison and Donnelly visas.</P>

Is the Minister aware that people born here prior to 1949 can travel <Col N="519" /> to the United States without a visa if they avail of a British passport to which they are entitled?  There are many people in my constituency, including myself, who were born prior to 1949.  Many people living in my constituency and elsewhere in this country were born in the UK and can travel to the United States without a visa.  A high level representation should be made to the US authorities to extend the same facilities to our supporters as the British and other supporters would be entitled to if they qualify.</P>

      <P>I concur with Deputy McGinley's remarks in relation to the Irish supporters.  It was reported widely that Irish supporters were ambassadors for this country during the World Cup in Italy.  Many Italians visit this country as a result of friendships between our soccer supporters and members of the Italian community.  I am aware of the anomalies raised by Deputy McGinley and those matters are the subject of discussion by the Department of Foreign Affairs, the United States Embassy and the United States Administration.  I will raise them during my visit to Washington next month.</P>

Citizens of nine of the 12 European states, as well as people in Northern Ireland.  Liechtenstein, San Marino, New Zealand and Switzerland do not require a visa to travel to the United States.

I ask him to accept that representations need to be made at the highest level to ensure people who wish to support our team are not disappointed by being denied visas to attend the World Cup next year.  Having regard to what may be referred to as our special relationship with the Americans, will the Minister accept that we are being discriminated against from the point of view of a visa requirement?  Indeed, the attitude of consular officials in many instances at the embassy is one of indifference, unhelpfulness, rudeness and arrogance and that is not acceptable.  Will the Minister bear in mind that the appeals procedure whereby a TD could vouch for <Col N="521" /> a person who had been denied a visa was withdrawn last year?</P>

      <P>As I stated at the outset, I have had many discussions with American embassy officials in relation to visa applications because, like any rural Deputy whether in Opposition or in Government I must go through the lobbying system.  I thought the system introduced by the American Embassy which provided Oireachtas Members with a special facility whereby they could guarantee visa applicants was a sound and workable one and resulted from representations by Members of this House. Unfortunately, this system was abused and it is because of that abuse by a small number of Members that all Members lost their privileges.</P>

One <Col N="522" /> is left with the impression on many occasions that people are told curtly that in one context or another they cannot go to the United States and that they need not bother reapplying for 12 months and they receive this information on a photocopied sheet of paper.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister consider a proposal I made at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, before Fine Gael became so interested in this matter, that the posting of a performance bond for people in high risk categories might be considered. Many genuine people who wish to travel to the United States are in such categories and many know of people who will act as guarantors for them in a tangible way but such a measure will not persuade the American authorities to grant visas because there is no system in place to allow for that.</P>

We will continue to pursue a solution to this problem first by addressing the immediate problems in relation to the World Cup and, secondly, the matters raised by Deputy Mitchell.

      <P>Deputy McDowell's last comment had soundings of leadership. The American Embassy issued 600,000 visas to Irish people during the past ten years.  I endorse the Minister's comments about the privilege given to Oireachtas Members being abused by a small number of Members which has resulted in that privilege being withdrawn. Will the Minister liaise with the FAI to ensure that the people who will be refused visas will have at their disposal an early appeals system and that they <Col N="523" /> might be allowed to have a representative who may also act as guarantor for them in attendance at the appeal to present their case?  The matter should be dealt with on a confidential basis between a consular official and the applicant.  An early appeals system with that facility would iron out any remaining difficulties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Members will appreciate that we are discussing a special situation in 1994 in relation to Ireland qualifying for the World Cup.  The Irish Travel Agents Association has suggested that approximately 18,000 to 20,000 people will wish to travel to the matches in the United States.  Obviously it will require great co-operation between the FAI, the travel agents and the US Embassy to satisfy the demand, apart from any difficulties traditionally associated with visas.  The demand will require a special operation and will put enormous strain on the American Embassy.  I will liaise with the FAI, whose co-operation has been outstanding.  The manner in which they look after their supporters is second to none.  I will be working with them, the travel agents and the embassy and I hope we can resolve the difficulties.</P>

      <P>I am grateful that the Tánaiste will take up the matter with the US Administration.  Would the Tánaiste agree that while we are anxious to have visas made available to supporters who will want to travel to the US for the World Cup, the essential problem is that the population of the Republic of Ireland is being treated differently from 95 per cent of the population of the European Community, including enclaves associated with the Community like Liechtenstein and San Marino and countries of similar size to Ireland, such as New Zealand, would he also agree that the real solution is to put an end to this unfair treatment?

      <P>In view of the importance of this matter would the Tánaiste consider informing the American authorities that all Irish people should not be tarred with the same brush because some people irresponsibily abused the privilege of guarantors?  If the Americans restore this facility and it is abused I suggest that names should be supplied to the Minister or to this House and we should undertake to publish them.  Would the Americans consider that proposal in the lead up to the World Cup?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that that suggestion was put to the US officials in the embassy.  Because of the difficulties caused by a few Deputies, the American Embassy were not inclined to reinstate that system.  I will raise the matter with the US Ambassador in the ongoing discussions between the embassy, the FAI and the Irish travel agents in an effort to find a solution.  We expect that there will be between 18,000 and 20,000 travellers many of whom will already have visas but I want to ensure that Irish soccer fans travelling to the US will not create difficulties which would affect our relationship with the embassy.  I assure Deputy Currie and other Deputies that everything possible will be done to ensure that this does not become a serious problem.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 14 together.</P>
      <P>When Ireland became an observer at the Western European Union last November, the Government indicated that, because our observer status was linked to the new relationship between the European Union and the Western European Union in the Maastricht Treaty, we did not intend to fully exercise our rights as a Western European Union observer until the Maastricht Treaty had been ratified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I attended an extraordinary meeting of the Western European Union Council of Ministers in Luxembourg on 5 April 1993 to discuss the crisis in the former Yugoslavia and Ireland was represented at official level at the Western European Union Ministerial Council in Rome on 19 May 1993.  Ireland has also been represented, at official level, at meetings of a working group which is considering the future relations between the Western <Col N="526" /> European Union and the European Union.</P>
    <P>After the Maastricht Treaty has been ratified, I would envisage that Ireland will regularly attend future meetings of the Western European Union Ministerial Council as an observer.  I would also envisage that officials from my Department will attend as observers at meetings of the Western European Union Permanent Council and working groups which we are entitled to attend as a Western European Union observer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it envisaged that this House will be kept informed of Ireland's relationship with the Western European Union and that what is observed will be the subject of some degree of reportage to this House?  Why was it thought that Ireland should only attend in a limited way in advance of the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty? Will the Tánaiste indicate the prospects for ratification of the Maastricht Treaty and whether the Germans will finally sign the Treaty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give the Deputy a Kerry view on whether the German constitutional court will find in favour but the expectation is that the Germans will be in a position to ratify as of next Tuesday. We hope that will happen so that we can get on with the Maastricht process because it is in all our interests to have the Maastricht Treaty not only ratified but implemented.  Because of the difficulties in Denmark, Britain and Germany the Maastricht process and prospects of revitalisation of the European Community have been hampered. I will strive earnestly to ensure that the House, perhaps through the Foreign Affairs Committee is informed of what we observe at the Western European Union ministerial meetings or working groups.  I have no interest in keeping a veil of secrecy over any discussions that take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We became an observer at Western European Union because of the link between the Western European Union and European Union in the Maastricht Treaty.  We do not envisage participating <Col N="527" /> fully as an observer until the Treaty has been ratified.  If an occasion which would warrant our attendance arises, we are in a position to attend, as I did earlier in the year.  I can assure the Deputy and the House that I have no difficulty informing Deputies of the proceedings and of what is progressing between the Western European Union and the European Community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Why has the Government sought observer status as distinct from full membership?  Is it intended to apply at any point for full membership?  Is the Government concerned about the current basis of the Western European Union and their strategy which includes the retention of nuclear weapons and the strategy of nuclear deterrents?  Will the Government seek to have that changed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, in 1992 the Government decided to take up observer status.  This decision was in keeping with the Maastricht Treaty. There are no proposals before the Government at present to take up full membership of the Western European Union.  If there was any such intention the matter would have to be brought before this House.  What was the Deputy's second question?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you and the Ceann Comhairle for choosing this item and the Minister of State for coming into the House to listen to what I have to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pauline will be 14 years old in December. She is mentally handicapped and emotionally disturbed.  Since the age of five she was catered for on a daily basis by the Brothers of Charity, Boyle, County Roscommon.  I pay tribute to the Brothers of Charity for the tremendous level of care provided for Pauline during the <Col N="598" /> years and for their absolute devotion to her welfare.  No words could adequately express the gratitude of Pauline's parents for the level of service provided for her and for the daily relief provided for them as the parents of a handicapped child.</P>
    <P>However, approximately one and a half years ago Pauline's parents were notified by the Brothers of Charity that they could no longer cope with her, she was extremely strong, given to tantrums and they could no longer devote the physical resources on a daily basis to cope with her.  An arrangement was made which, very kindly was paid for by the Brothers of Charity whereby two women were employed to take Pauline into their home on a Monday to Friday basis.  This arrangement operated very satisfactorily and provided tremendous relief for the parents who took Pauline home each weekend.  However, two weeks ago the two women caring for Pauline notified the Brothers of Charity and her parents that they could no longer provide custody and care for the child.  She is now back home with her parents.</P>
    <P>Pauline is literally uncontrollable.  She has the strength of an adult and requires two people to contain and restrain her at times.  Everything within reach is in danger; plates, implements and pieces of furniture regularly become missiles. Some tantrums can even lead to biting. The situation has to be seen to be believed and I have seen it.  Everything I have said has been verified by the social worker.</P>
    <P>These parents cannot cope.  They have a social and constitutional right to a level of service for their child appropriate to her needs which are definite, well defined and, I admit, difficult.  I consulted the social worker at length and without doubt, given her condition, the most appropriate institution for Pauline is Cregg House, Sligo.  Unfortunately, Cregg House does not have the resources or the place at present.  However, they have an application with the Department of Health for additional places.  I ask that in the interim a place be created for her at Cregg House and that the necessary resources be made available to provide, <Col N="599" /> first, this additional place and, second, the much required additional places which have already been the subject of an application to the Minister and his Department.</P>
    <P>I appreciate there are major calls on the funding available to the Department of Health.  However, this is an emergency and the position is out of control.  The furrowed faces of Pauline's parents tell the story very graphically.  I again urge the Minister to take a personal interest in the matter and intervene to ensure that proper institutional care is provided immediately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge that Deputy Higgins has taken a personal interest in this case and has done tremendous work for this unfortunate girl and her parents.  The person referred to by the Deputy is a 13 year old child from County Mayo with autism, severe mental handicap and severe behavioural problems. I understand that the child in question had been provided with an intensive home care service by two care workers. The issue of residential care has now arisen because the care workers have recently left the area.</P>
      <P>The provision of mental handicap services in County Mayo is the responsibility of the Western Health Board.  Services for people with autism in the Western Health Board area are provided mainly by the Western Care Association on an agency basis for the Western Health Board.  Current policy is that persons with a mental handicap should be treated as far as possible in their own health board area.  The Deputy will appreciate that Cregg House serves the needs of clients in the North-Western Health Board area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A case conference on this child was held on Thursday, 30 September 1993. The conference was attended by the health board's area medical officer and social worker as well as the child's parents and representatives of the Western Care Association.  The association are currently considering placing the child in <Col N="600" /> their new facility in Foxford which is currently being developed.  In the meantime the Brothers of Charity are offering a limited crisis intervention service until the end of December.</P>
    <P>As regards the child's long-term needs a further meeting between the Brothers of Charity and the Western Care Association was held at 3 p.m. today.  I will communicate with Deputy Higgins concerning the outcome of this meeting.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that the Programme for a Partnership Government includes a commitment to the provision of additional funding to enable the implementation of the recommendations of the review group on mental handicap services to be accelerated.</P>
    <P>In the budget this year the Government made available an additional £8 million for improving and strengthening health services to people with a disability and, in particular, those with a mental handicap.  In addition to this £2 million is being made available from within the Estimates of the Department of Health to strengthen the funding base of some of the direct funded mental handicap agencies and to meet some essential service needs.  A sum of £4 million has been allocated to the health board regions, of which £158,000 has been allocated to the western region, and this money is being used to provide additional residential respite emergency and day care services and to develop further early intervention in child education and developmental services.</P>
    <P>The precise services to be provided in each region have been agreed by the regional mental handicap co-ordinating committees within the guidelines issued by the Department of Health and approved by the Minister for Health. These allocations were determined on the basis of the waiting lists for services and the current level of service provision in each area.  Provision has also been made for the capital investment necessary to support the initiatives put in place this year.  In all, the total amount being spent this year on services for people with mental handicap is £209 million.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="601" /> However, I fully accept that much more needs to be done to meet fully the needs of all persons with a mental handicap who are on a waiting list and it is intended to build on the improvements already put in place in future years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Cabinet, at its meeting today, decided to reintroduce export credit insurance for beef exports to Iran.  While easy headlines have been inspired by lawyers' fees at the Beef Tribunal, this hugely controversial issue which was such a major issue before the tribunal has received very little analysis to date.  Now that the Government has made its decision, there is a need to look at the economic rationale for awarding the benefit of export credit insurance to a third country, specifically, in this case, Iran.</P>
      <P>What are the benefits which are conferred on a national economy through the provision of subsidised credit insurance to exporters?  Exports that fall into this category of ECIS are uninsurable credit risks or risks that are only insurable at enormous cost.  If the Government offers export credit insurance to Iran at low cost, what benefits to the national economy are thereby obtained and to whom to these benefits accrue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the specific case of beef, which is a product covered by EC intervention arrangements, the benefit to the national economy secured through having export credit insurance subsidies can be no greater than the excess of the Iranian price, inclusive of EC export refunds, and the floor price available in Europe. The exporter does not require State subsidised ECIS to get the floor price available in Europe.  For example, if we take it that the Iranian price is £120 per tonne and the European floor price is £100 per tonne, it follows that the benefit to the national economy cannot exceed £20.  In fact, it will be less than that because transport and other costs have to be taken into account.  Therefore it is misleading <Col N="602" /> of the Government to argue by way of reference to gross value of exports to third countries achieved as a result of export credit insurance since this greatly exaggerates the national economic benefit of such schemes.</P>
    <P>There may be an impact on the trading margins of the exporting companies which would be likely to improve their profitability but in economic terms that is not the same as increasing output or employment.  In the case of commodity-type food exports, these are constrained by, for example, the availability of domestic supply.  We saw the recent dramatic example of beef being sourced outside the State to fill contracts and the Irish taxpayer taking the full risk for UK suppliers. This must not be allowed to happen again.</P>
    <P>The cost of providing export credit insurance is not immediately apparent. The State incurs a risk which may not be easy to quantify and charges a premium which everyone knows to be less than the commercial market would seek.  In principle, the cost of an export credit insurance scheme is equal to the level of premiums which a commercial insurer would charge, less the amounts actually charged.  Has the Government established what the London premium would be to cover these contracts, and if the London market is not quoting for such contracts at the moment, why does the Government consider it wise to reintroduce such cover given the extent of risk to the Irish taxpayer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  I believe the House is the appropriate place to set out the facts. This issue has been bandied about in the media in the past couple of weeks, giving rise to a misconception which I would like to clear up.</P>
      <P>There has been much talk about the restoration of export credit insurance cover for Iran.  We have not been off cover for Iran.  Therefore, the question of restoration does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past few years the Iranian market has been closed to sales of Irish <Col N="603" /> beef.  This was because of the BSE scare. We were satisfied that there was no BSE risk in so far as our beef was concerned, but I suppose the Iranians were being extra careful and did not distinguish between us and other countries.  We made many attempts at ministerial and official levels to persuade the Iranians that Irish beef carried no health risk. These efforts have only recently succeeded and this led to a number of applications being made to my Department for export credit insurance.  It was clear that these exports would be of tremendous benefit to Ireland.  We had just reopened the market and it was obviously important that success on the veterinary issues should be followed up by sales which would prove our contention that our beef is safe.</P>
    <P>There was also the attraction that the exports were of boneless beef, far more beneficial than the export of live animals or the putting of beef into intervention. However, the provision of cover for this beef would also increase our exposure on the market.  I had to balance this against the possible downside.  We had reports of <Col N="604" /> some difficulties in the market.  I decided that the best course would be to take the matter to Government, given that the issues were of concern to many of my ministerial colleagues.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the Government considered the issue today and decided on the terms which should be offered to exporters.  I believe what is on offered to exporters is realistic but not overgenerous in the current circumstances of the market.  The terms would be more onerous than when beef was last exported to Iran but I think it appropriate that the sector should carry a fair proportion of the risk.  My Department is advising the companies concerned of the terms.</P>

      <P>Eleven member states have ratified the Maastricht Treaty on European Union.  German ratification is still outstanding.  The remaining obstacle to ratification by Germany is that the Federal Government must await a decision by the Constitutional Court before it can ratify.  Indications are that a decision will be made by the court in the very near future, possibly next week. It would not be appropriate for me to speculate as to the outcome of the court's deliberations but I am hopeful that the Treaty will be fully ratified by all before long.</P>
      <P>Ratification of the Maastricht Treaty has proved to be a difficult undertaking throughout the Community.  Lessons have been learned, including the need for open debate on major issues and the need to inform the electorate of what is at stake in negotiating such a Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Treaty provides an agenda for the <Col N="529" /> Community in the years ahead.  Some of its elements are already being implemented &mdash; for example the Cohesion Fund is in place.  Other major chapters &mdash; health, education, culture, foreign and security policy co-operation and justice and home affairs matters &mdash; will come fully into effect after the Treaty is ratified.  Economic and Monetary Union has had real setbacks but remains an important objective.</P>
    <P>I expect that final ratification of the Treaty will give a boost to the Community's confidence and enable us to get on with its implementation.  It will also enable us to focus on action required to deal with issues such as economic growth which, as the Copenhagen European Council agreed, has to be the Community's priority at the present time.</P>

      <P>Most of Ireland's assistance to the newly independent countries of Eastern Europe is channelled through multilateral aid programmes such as the PHARE and TACIS programmes of the European Community and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.  The Department of Foreign Affairs also operates a modest programme of bilateral assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year £100,000 was allocated for bilateral assistance to Eastern Europe. The money has been disbursed in the form of grants to agencies and companies. Projects assisted ranged from the Polish Business Advisory Service to an ESB International scheme to help the Romanian national electricity company. <Col N="530" /> I will make the full list available to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>This year for the first time Ireland agreed with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to set up a fund for use by Irish consultants in Eastern Europe.  The Government has provided £80,000 for this fund and the EBRD will use this money to employ Irish consultants.</P>
    <P>As far as practical assistance is concerned a number of Government Departments and State bodies has responded positively to requests for assistance.  My own Department, for example, has advised the Polish and Latvian Foreign Ministeries on organisation matters and has participated in EC programmes of assistance in what was formerly East Germany.</P>

They supported the efforts of the UN Secretary General to achieve a just, comprehensive and internationally acceptable settlement of the question of East Timor.  And they also expressed support for the ongoing dialogue between Portugal and Indonesia under the auspices of the Secretary General.  The question of international sanctions does not arise while these efforts are continuing.</P>

      <P>I will take Questions Nos. 16 and 66 together.  A group of EC Ambassadors in Beijing, including the Irish Ambassador, made a fact-finding visit to Tibet from 16 to 23 May 1993.</P>
      <P>An intensive programme was drawn up in response to requests from the Embassies. This included meetings with the Vice-Governor of the Tibet Autonomous Region and with a broad range of government agencies in Tibet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The delegation raised with the local authorities questions concerning religious freedom and matters relating to the preservation of the cultural, religious <Col N="533" /> and national identity of the Tibetan people.</P>
    <P>They also raised human rights concerns. The delegation handed over to the Chinese authorities in Tibet a list of some 50 Tibetan political prisoners with a request for information on their welfare. The delegation also sought an explanation about the arrest of three Tibetans prior to the arrival of the delegation who were said to be seeking to present a report on the situation in Tibet.  After the delegation left Tibet, demonstrations were held in Lhasa.  The Twelve have expressed their concern at reports of police actions against the demonstrations.</P>
    <P>I will be happy to make available to Deputy O'Donnell a report on the visit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 32 together.  Since my appointment as Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs I have made 18 official trips overseas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of official commitments fulfilled in the course of these visits is, of course, much higher.  In the course of my visit to New York to address the General Assembly of the United Nations last week, for example, I had meetings with UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, US Secretary of State Warren Christopher, EC Foreign Ministers, Russian Foreign Minister Kosyrev and the Foreign Ministers of the Gulf region as <Col N="534" /> well as 16 meetings with other Foreign Ministers and representatives of organisations such as the PLO.  I also undertook a programme of meetings with potential investors on behalf of the IDA and I had a series of meetings with representatives of Irish Community organisations and immigrant assistance groups.</P>
    <P>I have made 11 overseas journeys in the context of our membership of the European Communities, attending eight meetings of the General Affairs Council, two Informal Ministerial meetings and one European Council.</P>
    <P>I have fulfilled four overseas commitments in connection with Anglo-Irish Affairs including two meetings of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference in London and two meetings of the British Irish Association.</P>
    <P>I have accompained President Robinson on visits to Spain, the United States and New Zealand.</P>
    <P>I have made official visits to Poland, to Hungary and to Germany.</P>
    <P>I have fulfilled three commitments in the framework of the United Nations.  I had a meeting with the UN Secretary General in New York in May, I attended the UN World Conference on Human Rights in June and I have already referred to my attendance at the UN General Assembly in New York last week.</P>
    <P>I have instructed that every effort be made to keep the frequency and cost of visits to a minimum consistent with the appropriate discharge of my responsibilities as Minister for Foreign Affairs. Where commercial flights are used preference is always given where possible to Aer Lingus or to other Irish based carriers.</P>
    <P>Accounting practices do not provide for a full breakdown in relation to the cost of individual visits.  I am sure that the Deputy will be pleased to know that on my appointment as Minister for Foreign Affairs, I accepted a reduction in the allocation for ministerial travel of approximately 12 per cent.  Figures which are available to date indicate that, in the period from my appointment in January to the end of August some 22 per cent of <Col N="535" /> that reduced allocation was accounted for.  This represents a sizeable saving in the figure budgeted for the same period.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="536" /> I am asking the Ceann Comhairle to circulate in the Official Report a tabular statement setting out all available details requested by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government welcomed the decision of the European Council in Copenhagen last July that the European Community and its member states should elaborate common proposals for a Pact on Stability in Europe. The Deputy's question refers to a &ldquo;Security Pact&rdquo;, but it concerns stability rather than security.  Against the background of disputes of the kind that led to the crisis in former Yugoslavia, they support fully the objective of this initiative, which is to seek to enhance stability in Central Europe, in particular through the resolution of disputes involving miniorities and borders.</P>
      <P>Since the decision last July, Ireland has been actively involved, together with our EC partners, in drawing up proposals for this initiative.  It was agreed at the Council of Ministers meeting in Luxembourg last Monday that the concept is not sufficiently well developed to enable the Presidency to carry out consultations with those countries directly concerned, notably those in Central and Eastern Europe which envisage future membership of the Community.  Although the Community's proposals will not be finalised until these consultations have been finalised, the main features of the proposed Pact are already clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The emphasis is being placed on preventative diplomacy.  The Pact itself will probably be of a political rather than legally-binding nature, although it may incorporate bilateral agreements of a legal character.  It is intended to base its work on existing principles of the UN and CSCE rather than to elaborate new ones.  No new institutions will be created, but it is envisaged that existing institutions such as the CSCE and the Council of Europe, may have a role to play.  Negotiations under the auspices of the Pact will take place only with the full consent <Col N="540" /> of the parties concerned.  They will not apply to existing conflict situations, such as that which exists in former Yugoslavia. The pact itself will not be directly concerned with security issues except in so far as the provision of guarantees in respect of agreements concluded under its auspices could involve bodies such as the Western European Union.</P>
    <P>I anticipate that the European Union will continue to play a major role in the promotion of this initiative.  Ireland's role will therefore be primarily one of helping, as a member of the Union, to develop what will be seen as one of the first initiatives of the new common and foreign security policy.  It is not envisaged that the pact will apply to any other potential conflict situations outside Central and Eastern Europe.</P>

      <P>There are only two cases pending against the State before the European Court of Justice.  In both cases the Commission has asked the Court to rule that Ireland is in breach of Community law because EC Directives have not been implemented domestically within the permitted time limit.  The State is defending both cases.</P>
      <P>In Case C-381/92 <i>(Commission v. Ireland)</i> the Commission is asking the court to rule that, in not bringing into force within the time permitted the measures necessary to comply with Directive 88/407/EEC, (laying down the animal health requirements relating to imports of deep-frozen semen of domestic animals of the bovine species) Ireland is in breach of Community law.</P>
      <P>Similarly in Case C-384-92 the Commission is asking the Court to rule that Ireland has not implemented within the time allowed Directive 88/66/EEC on the zootechnical standards applicable to breeding animals of the porcine species.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 39, 47, 95 and 109 together.</P>
      <P>I am gravely concerned at the latest setback to the efforts to bring about peace in Bosnia-Hercegovina, and the danger of renewed fighting in Croatia as well as the possibilities for the over-spill of conflict in the region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The package elaborated between the parties under the auspices of David Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, the Co-Chairmen <Col N="542" /> of the International Conference, while not ideal, represents an opportunity for peace in Bosnia which should not be lost.  The prospect of a continuation of the war during the harsh Bosnian winter and the death and destruction which this will bring make it imperative that the outstanding difficulties should be resolved without further delay.  It is, however, ultimately for the parties themselves to determine what is acceptable to them.</P>
    <P>The lines of our approach to the crises in former Yugoslavia were set out in the Declaration adopted by the European Council in June 1993 which stated that a negotiated settlement must be based on the principles of the London Conference and contain a firm commitment of support for the International Conference Co-Chairmen in their efforts to promote a fair and viable settlement acceptable to all three constituent peoples of Bosnia.</P>
    <P>The negotiations under the auspices of the Co-Chairmen have continued intensively over the past three months.  They have worked tirelessly and with determination to facilitate a settlement between the parties which would avoid a human catastrophe in Bosnia over the coming winter.  EC Foreign Ministers have been kept fully informed of the developments in the negotiating process. David Owen briefed Ministers in this regard at their meeting in Luxembourg on 4 October.</P>
    <P>Through the efforts of the Co-Chairmen who have been conducting the negotiations on behalf of the EC and the UN, broad agreement from the three parties was secured on a number of key elements of an overall package.  This includes a Constitutional Agreement &mdash; based on the concept of a Union of Republics of Bosnia-Hercegovina, composed of three constituent republics and encompassing three constituent peoples; provision for the administration of Sarajevo by the UN and the appointment of an EC administrator for Mostar; detailed provisions on the protection of human rights; the establishment of an access authority to ensure free movement and transport on key roads; and a military agreement for implementing and monitoring a cessation <Col N="543" /> of hostilities and for the demilitarisation of Bosnia-Hercegovina.</P>
    <P>Negotiations then focused on the map delineating the boundaries of the three constituent republics.  The Co-Chairman, with our full support, insisted that the Muslim majority republic should have no less than 30 per cent of the national territory and have guaranteed access to both the Sava River and the Adriatic. These negotiations, which were particularly difficult, led to provisional agreement as part of an overall package on an increase in the size of the territory to be assigned to the Muslim majority republic and on provisions governing access to the Adriatic for that republic.</P>
    <P>The prospects for agreement before the onset of winter have receded following the decision of the Bosnian Parliament on 29 September to reject as inadequate the territorial aspects of the package.  This situation has been compounded by the reaction of the Bosnian Serb Assembly which has decided to withdraw territorial concessions made in the course of the negotiations in recent weeks.  The Co-Chairmen of the International Conference are actively pursuing their contacts with the Bosnian parties with a view to securing agreement on the outstanding issues.</P>
    <P>The European Community and its member states have underlined to all of the Bosnian parties &mdash; in particular to President Izetbegovic &mdash; their determination to participate actively in the implementation of an agreement accepted by the parties in accordance with the Principles of the London Conference and the Conclusions of the European Council in Copenhagen.  Preparations for implementation are continuing within the EC, at the United Nations and in other fora.</P>
    <P>Following the Copenhagen European Council's decision that EC member states would support the implementation of the Security Council resolutions on safe areas through contributions commensurate with member states' abilities, Ireland and its EC partners have maintained close contact with the UN Secretary General.</P>
    <P>In response to a request from the <Col N="544" /> Secretary-General, Ireland has made available an additional three military observers to supplement UNPROFOR's capacity in this area and Government will be contributing a sum of $450,000 up to December 1993 towards the cost of UNPROFOR's operations in the safe areas.  The Secretary-General has now received pledges for the 7,600 additional personnel required for the safe areas, including significant contributions from a number of EC member states, including France and Denmark.  Equipment is also being provided by one EC member state to non-EC contingents who are to be deployed in the safe areas.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21, 56, 58, 59, 75, 98, 99 and 106 together.</P>
      <P>The question of the reform of UN structures is under active discussion in a number of UN fora, and Ireland is making a constructive contribution to the debate.  It is now universally accepted that the new climate in international relations and the many extra demands being placed on the UN require a critical examination of the organisation's existing structures.</P>
      <P>This was a central theme in my address last week to the UN General Assembly which dealt in particular with the reform process as it affects the Security Council, the General Assembly, UN Peacekeeping, Human Rights and UN finances.</P>
      <P>In my statement, I made it clear that Ireland supports the case for an increase in the membership of the Security Council in order to enhance the Council's political authority and its capacity to act decisively and with confidence.  I expressed the hope that decisions on this can be taken before the fiftieth anniversary of the UN in two year's time. In separate submissions to the Secretary General and to the Committee on the UN Charter, the Government has set out Ireland's approach in greater detail emphasising the need to enhance the Security Council's representativity, legitimacy and effectiveness.  Copies of my address and of Ireland's submissions have been placed in the Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="546" /> It would be wrong, however, to assume that equipping the Security Council to meet the challenges of the 1990s, rather than those of the Cold War period, is simply a matter of increasing its membership. In my address to the General Assembly I also called for greater transparency in the Council's decision making and for a more inter-active relationship between it and the General Assembly. This is vital in a situation where countries such as our own are being increasingly called upon to supply peacekeeping personnel and finance as a result of Security Council's decisions.  I suggested too that we must look for ways to make the General Assembly itself more effective. Work in this area is on going and there has already been a rationalisation of its Committee structure.</P>
    <P>Another area that requires close attention is the UN's capacity to make and keep the peace.  Proposals to strengthen the capacity of the UN in the fields of preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and peacekeeping were set out in last year's report of the Secretary-General entitled an <i>Agenda for Peace.</i>  Ireland has welcomed this report and we have been actively involved in the follow-up work. Our Permanent Representative to the UN in New York was Vice-Chairman of the working group established by the General Assembly to review the report.</P>
    <P>In relation to the specific area of peacekeeping. I underlined in my statement the need to maintain peacekeeping and peace-enforcement operations within an overall political framework; the need for the Security Council to pay special attention to the issues of command and control; and the need to improve military planning at UN headquarters.</P>
    <P>On financing I called on all members of the UN in arrears, especially those on the Security Council, to comply with their financial obligations.  It is not acceptable that the UN should be asked to undertake new responsibilities while denying it the necessary resources.</P>
    <P>In the area of human rights, Ireland has proposed the early establishment of the post of UN High Commissioner for Human Rights; a doubling of the financial <Col N="547" /> resources allocated by the UN to human rights activities; a strengthening of the UN's human rights machinery; and the establishment of an international criminal tribunal to prosecute persons responsible for violations of humanitarian law wherever they occur.</P>
    <P>It will be clear from the foregoing that Ireland is fully engaged across the range of issues relating to UN reform.  The Irish delegation at the current session of the General Assembly will pursue actively all the proposals I outlined in my statement to the Assembly last week.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22, 29, 52, 61, 68, 69, 84, 93 and 100 together.</P>
      <P>Following the publication last June of the Opsahl Commission report, I welcomed the report as &ldquo;the culmination of a very worth-while endeavour to provide a vehicle through which people in Northern Ireland and beyond could express their views on possible ways forward&rdquo;. I gave a fuller response during a debate in Seanad Éireann on 13 July, when I saluted the achievements of the Commission and paid particular attention to a number of its findings.  I responded further to the report in the course of a recent address to the British-Irish Association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the ideas in the report undoubtedly deserve careful study, and a continuation of the exercise in some form would be valuable in itself, the proposal for the establishment of a commission to continue the work of the Opsahl Commission <Col N="549" /> raises a number of difficult issues. The task of devising and taking forward policy in relation to Northern Ireland is, I believe, properly one for Government. As regards the report's recommendations in relation to integrated education and integrated housing in Northern Ireland, the Government considers that these provide a valuable basis for further discussion. In relation to all such matters the wishes of the individual are, of course, of fundamental importance.  For example, it seems that at present a majority of parents in Northern Ireland wish to send their children to schools with a particular religious ethos and it is obviously important that they should continue to be able to do so.  However, there is also clearly a growing interest in integrated education and the Government believes that this should be facilitated wherever possible. The question of housing is also a complex and sensitive matter and it is clearly essential that any changes in this area should take place only on a voluntary basis.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23, 35 and 104 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nicaragua has been experiencing great difficulty in reaching genuine national reconciliation following the end, in 1990, of the 12 year civil war.  This has led in recent months to a political crisis culminating in serious violence in the <Col N="550" /> northern town of Esteli which left 45 people dead and 98 wounded.</P>
    <P>An attempt to bring about reconciliation by launching a &ldquo;national dialogue&rdquo; between all parties has not been successful.  The dialogue was to have been conducted in the presence of the foreign ministers of the other Central American Republics.  An attempt by the OAS Secretary General to break the deadlock between the parties has also failed.</P>
    <P>Consultations are taking place between the Secretaries General of the United Nations and the Organisation of American States to consider how the UN and the OAS might assist Nicaragua to bring together political and social forces to work towards the strengthening of democracy.  Ireland has condemned the use of violence for political ends in Nicaragua.  Together with our partners in the European Community we will continue to monitor the situation closely with a view to seeing what positive role the European Community can play in assisting the efforts of the UN and the OAS.</P>

      <P>There is undoubtedly an important role for the Department of Foreign Affairs in the promotion of Irish tourism, trade, and foreign earnings generally.  This is one of the priority areas of the Department's work to which considerable resources are devoted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The particular role played by individual embassies depends on a number of factors, including the economic system of the country concerned, the opportunities it offers for Irish economic interests and whether or not the Irish semi-State bodies maintain offices in the countries concerned.  If the semi-State <Col N="551" /> bodies are locally represented, the embassy works very closely with them in support of their marketing and promotional efforts.  Where the semi-State bodies are not represented, the embassy is more directly involved in promotional work and in facilitating Irish exporters and other business interests.</P>
    <P>In all locations, the embassy monitors economic and financial developments, lobbies as necessary at Government and official level and is involved in the organisation of ministerial and other visits with an economic focus.</P>
    <P>My Department liaises very closely with the home economic Departments, particularly the Department of Tourism and Trade, to ensure a fully co-ordinated approach; we are represented on the Foreign Earnings Committee which meets regularly and brings together all the relevant Departments and semi-state bodies.</P>

      <P>Co-operation North has received grant aid of £50,000 in each of the years 1986-91 and £20,000 in the years 1991-92 under the subhead for North-South and Anglo-Irish Co-operation in the Vote of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  It has received £20,000 in respect of 1993.</P>

      <P>Following the signature of the agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation on 13 September 1993, a conference to support Middle East peace was convened in Washington on 1 October, co-sponsored by the Governments of the United States of America and of the <Col N="553" /> Russian Federation.  Ireland participated in the conference and pledged $1 million for the coming year, to support Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza.  It is envisaged that this level of commitment will be maintained in following years.</P>
      <P>As part of this commitment, Ireland will increase its ongoing support for the UN Relief and Works Agency and for Bethlehem University.  I should add that Ireland had already committed £300,000 in aid to the Occupied Territories this year.</P>
      <P>Irish officials will visit the West Bank and Gaza in the near future to identify suitable areas for Irish support.  It is anticipated that Irish aid will concentrate on key social sectors such as health, education, training and infrastructure. Ireland will also participate in the normal way in financing the commitments given at the conference by representatives of the European Community.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, Saudi Arabia applies the <i>Shari'a,</i> or Islamic law, based on the Koran.  This prescribes the death penalty for those lawfully convicted of serious crimes, such as murder, rape or drug smuggling.  I have seen reports of a substantial increase in the application of the death penalty in Saudi Arabia this year.</P>

    <P>I regret the fact that many states retain the death penalty in their law.  Ireland has abolished the death penalty and has acceded to the Second Optional Protocol of the UN Convention on Civil and Political Rights.

We urge other countries to take similar steps and <Col N="554" /> I hope that our example will prompt the wider abolition of capital punishment.</P>

      <P>When I addressed the World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna on 14 June 1993 I announced that the Government had decided to accede to the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenent on Civil and Political Rights.  This is the major international instrument which provides for abolition of the death penalty.  As the Deputy will be aware, the death penalty had already been abolished in Ireland with the enactment of the Criminal Justice Act (1990).</P>
      <P>Ireland's Instrument of accession to the Second Optional Protocol was deposited with the UN Secretary-General on 18 June 1993.  We acceded without making any reservation.</P>
      <P>This country is one of only 18 states parties to the Second Optional Protocol and we are, thus, to the forefront of international efforts to abolish the death penalty.  Although the number of states acceding to the Protocol is still small, I believe that it is significant that six countries, including Ireland, have become parties since the beginning of this year.  I hope that our example will promote the wider abolition of the death penalty.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40, 107 and 108 together. I have had the instances of non-accompaniment referred to in the Deputies' questions raised with the British authorities, through the Anglo-Irish Secretariat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government continues to attach very great importance to the application of the principle that the armed forces &mdash; including the Royal Irish Regiment &mdash; operate only in support of the civil power in Northern Ireland, with the particular objective, as set out in the Hillsborough communique, &ldquo;of ensuring as rapidly as possible that save in the most exceptional circumstances there is a police presence in all operations which involve direct contact with the community&rdquo;.  The Government's firm and abiding objective is to see that the principle of accompaniment is implemented fully, in line with the commitment which was made at the highest level in the Hillsborough communique, and on many occasions subsequently. Anything which falls short of <Col N="556" /> that commitment cannot be regarded as satisfactory.</P>
    <P>The British Government have confirmed that they remain committed to the principle of police accompaniment of Army (including the Royal Irish Regiment) operations which involve direct contact with the community and that it is their intention to maximise levels of accompaniment, particularly in sensitive nationalist areas.  While they point to increased levels of police accompaniment on the ground, they continue to indicate that a number of practical, logistical or resource constraints make it impossible to guarantee a continuous police accompaniment in all areas.  For my part I have made clear the Government's concern that these constraints should not impede the full implementation of the commitment given at the highest level at Hillsborough.</P>
    <P>The Government devotes close and continuing attention to the issue of accompaniment.  While accompaniment levels do appear to have improved I do not regard the current position as satisfactory. The Deputy can be assured that I shall continue, through the Anglo-Irish Conference, to convey our strong wish to see speedy progress towards the objective of full accompaniment as set out in the Hillsborough Communique.</P>

The Irish Ambassador in Vienna is accredited to the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.  The Irish Ambassador in Warsaw is accredited to Latvia and Lithuania and the Ambassador in Stockholm is accredited to Estonia.</P>

      <P>A meeting of the Conference on Accession to the European Union took place on 5 October in Luxembourg with each of the EFTA applicant countries: Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway.  This was the third meeting of the conference held with each of the applicants at ministerial level.  The conference recorded significant progress in the negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the purposes of these negotiations, the areas of Community law to which the applicant countries must adapt has been divided into 29 Chapters.  Since the opening of negotiations at the beginning of <Col N="558" /> this year the Conference on Accession has taken up 22 of the 29 Chapters for negotiation.  Furthermore, the examination of secondary legislation has been completed for all Chapters apart from those relating to the provisions of the Treaty on European Union.</P>
    <P>Of the 29 Chapters, negotiations have been completed on nine Chapters with Austria, ten Chapters with Sweden, eight Chapters with Finland and seven chapters with Norway.  In addition, significant progress has been recorded in other Chapters with each of the applicant countries.</P>
    <P>The Copenhagen European Council on 21-22 June 1993, set the target date for accession to the European Union of the EFTA negotiating candidates at 1 January 1995.  This target date implies that the negotiations must be complete by the end of 1993, or early in 1994, to allow sufficient time for ratification procedures to be finalised by the applicant countries, the union and the member states.</P>
    <P>Ireland is in favour of a speedy conclusion of the enlargement negotiations which will allow accessions to the European Union by the target date of 1 January 1995.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49 and 89 together. Eleven member states have ratified the Maastricht Treaty on European Union. The final ratification will, hopefully, take place shortly.</P>
      <P>Far from contemplating changes to the Treaty, we should look forward to its full ratification and entry into force.  This is the best way to stimulate moves towards European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Community has been functioning well, in spite of the difficult economic climate and the pressures on the ERM. It has, to take perhaps the clearest example, been able to agree on the framework for its future financing until the end of the century, with greatly increased funding, in real terms, for many policy areas.  The most obvious for Ireland is the significant increases in Structural and Cohesion funding.  The Community should now proceed with the immediate tasks in hand.  It should ensure <Col N="560" /> that the necessary decisions are in place to show that the Second Stage of European Monetary Union is starting in January 1994 as provided for in the Treaty on European Union.  It should also ensure that the many new areas of policy included in the Treaty are given effect.</P>
    <P>Another important task which the Community has set itself, and to which Ireland attaches particular importance, is to give greater priority to action in the areas of economic growth and employment. As a result of discussions at the Copenhagen European Council, the Commission will produce a White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness and Employment in time for examination at the December European Council.  The Government has submitted to the Commission various ideas for inclusion in the White Paper.  I would expect discussion of the White Paper, and its implementation, to be a major issue on the Community's agenda in 1994.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 53 and 102 together.</P>
      <P>The recent developments in the Russian Federation, which we are monitoring very closely, are a matter of very serious concern to the Government.  The loss of life, resulting from events in Moscow on Sunday and Monday last, is tragic.  Those who precipitated this violence bear a heavy responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 21 September, when President Yeltsin issued a decree dissolving the Russian Parliament and providing for parliamentary elections in December, he acknowledged that it had proved impossible to establish new constitutional structures <Col N="562" /> without acting beyond the limits of Russia's inherited Constitution.  Subsequently he announced that presidential elections would be held in June 1994.</P>
    <P>Following the 21 September decree, President Yeltsin continued to seek a compromise solution with members of the Parliament, including through the mediation efforts of the Patriarch of the Russian Orthodox church.  The responsibility for the violence on 3 and 4 October rests with those in the Russian Parliament who have so clearly demonstrated their implacable opposition to reform.</P>
    <P>The broad approach which the Government has taken to the political and constitutional crisis has been to:</P>
    <P>&mdash;support President Yeltsin in his efforts to bring about political and economic reforms;</P>
    <P>&mdash;emphasise that the principles of democracy and human rights should remain central to these reforms; and</P>
    <P>&mdash;underline the importance of the Russian people having the opportunity to express themselves through early elections.</P>
    <P>At their meeting in Luxembourg on 4 October, EC Foreign Ministers confirmed their support for President Yeltsin and the reform process and stressed the need for an early restoration of a peaceful and democratic order.  They agreed to press forward as a matter of urgency with the negotiation of a Partnership and Co-operation Agreement between the Community and the Russian Federation.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in reply to a written question yesterday, we have taken steps to ensure that the Russian Government is fully aware of our concerns about the situation in Russia.  On 29 September, the Taoiseach conveyed to President Yeltsin his hopes that the efforts which he and his Government were making to implement political reforms, consolidate democracy and to create a market economy in the Russian Federation would be successful. I had the opportunity of meeting Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev in New York last week and I shall avail of future contracts with him to discuss the situation in <Col N="563" /> Russia and how we can most effectively assist the reform process.</P>
    <P>The Government hopes that the current crisis in Russia will be quickly overcome, that the emergency measures can be rescinded, and that the Russian people will be given the opportunity to express themselves through the democratic process.</P>

      <P>I totally condemn the recent attacks on, and threats against, GAA clubs, their members and supporters in Northern Ireland.  The Government have raised these matters with the British authorities through the Anglo-Irish Secretariat and have emphasised to them the seriousness with which these incidents are viewed.  In this regard we have drawn attention particularly to the dangers posed by the inaccurate and inflammatory character of comments about the GAA made by certain groups and individuals.  It is important that all those in responsible positions exercise restraint and avoid statements which can only have the effect of putting lives and property at risk.</P>

      <P>The problem is such that remedial action at international level is required and discussion is going on in various institutions.

On nine of these occasions the Minister of State accompanied me at meetings of the EC General Affairs Council, seven of these were in Brussels and the remaining two were in Luxembourg. The Minister of State also attended one EC Summit meeting in Copenhagen.</P>
      <P>From 20 to 25 February 1993 the Minister of State attended an EC-Latin American group meeting in El Salvador.  On the return journey he visited the US State Department in Washington and the United Nations in New York for discussions with regard to the murder of Concern volunteer Valerie Place in Somalia. He was accompanied by four officials.</P>
      <P>From 21 to 31 March 1993 the Minister of State paid a visit to Africa to examine Irish bilateral aid projects and to meet volunteers.

On his way back from Sudan the Minister of State had talks with his Dutch and Swedish counterparts in Amsterdam and Stockholm.  Three officials accompanied the Minister of State in Sudan, while two others accompanied him in the Netherlands and Sweden.</P>
    <P>On 14 May 1993 the Minister of State attended a Council of Europe ministerial meeting in Strasbourg.  He was accompanied by three officials.</P>

    <P>While accounting returns do not provide for the isolation of costs relating to individual visits I can inform the Deputy that as of 31 August 1993 a total amount of £34,183 had been spent from the Minister of State's travel budget.  This represents 38 per cent of the Minister of State's travel budget for the year.</P>
    <P>Where possible, the Minister of State uses an Irish airline.  For travel to EC General Affairs Councils he was part of the delegation using Air Corps transport. For other travel, various international airlines were used as convenient and in <Col N="567" /> some instances in Africa it was necessary to charter private planes for routes not covered by commercial flights.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Office of the Tánaiste, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, made one visit abroad as part of her assignment to that office.  She travelled to Brussels by Air Corps transport on 3 June 1993 to speak at &ldquo;Directoria '93&rdquo;, a convention for directors of local and regional authorities, returning to Dublin by commercial aircraft, Aer Lingus.

      <P>In reply to a question on 10 June 1993 I gave the House detailed information on the establishment of the <i>ad hoc</i> International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the former Yugoslavia since 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a number of developments in relation to the <i>ad hoc</i> Tribunal since that date.  In June the UN Secretary-General invited member states to nominate candidates for the tribunal in accordance with its statute.  Ireland subsequently nominated a candidate.  On 20 August the Security Council established a list of 23 candidates from the nominations received taking due account of the adequate representation of the principal legal systems of the world.  The Irish nominee was not among those selected. The General Assembly proceeded to <Col N="568" /> elect 11 tribunal judges from this list in extended balloting between 15 and 17 September 1993.  It is expected that issues related to the financing of the tribunal and its location will be further considered at the current session of the General Assembly.</P>
    <P>When I addressed the World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna on 14 June 1993 I stated my belief that the agreement to establish the <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal for the former Yugoslavia is a development of the greatest importance for the protection of human rights.  I added that the time has come for the creation of an international criminal tribunal of wider scope to prosecute persons responsible for violations of humanitarian law wherever they occur.</P>
    <P>I returned to this issue in my statement to the General Assembly on 1 October 1993 when I said that the <i>ad hoc</i> approach which the international community has rightly found essential in the case of the former Yugoslavia pointed to the need for a permanent international criminal tribunal with an established jurisdiction and an identified body of applicable law. I urged the General Assembly to examine the valuable work which has been done over a number of years on this topic by the International Law Commission.</P>
    <P>Ireland will continue to press in the relevent UN fora for the establishment of an international criminal tribunal with competence in the fields of war crimes and violations of human rights.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I was a member of the British-Irish interparliamentary body and chairman <Col N="569" /> of its committee on economic and social issues which in May, 1991 produced the report to which he refers.  Two of the nine recommendations in the report are addressed to the British authorities; the position with regard to the other seven is as follows:</P>
      <P>(i)  Recommendation: that the Irish Government seeks to maximise the employment content of economic policy so as to reduce the need for involuntary emigration.</P>
      <P>As is clear from our Programme for Government and from the policies we are pursuing generally, the maximisation of employment is one of the Government's top priorities.</P>
      <P>(ii)  Recommendation: the establishment of a comprehensive database on the Irish in Britain and the exchange of information between Government Departments responsible for employment policy in the two countries.</P>
      <P>The question of a database is under active consideration jointly by the Department of Enterprise and Employment here and the Department of Employment in London.  The DÍON committee, an umbrella body of Irish immigrant assistance groups in Britain which reports to the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, is currently compiling data to supplement the findings of the 1991 British census. A transfrontier committee under EC auspices, which includes representatives of FÁS and of their British counterparts, has been set up in London.  An Official from FÁS based in the British employment service provides labour market information which FÁS passes on to potential emigrants.</P>
      <P>(iii)  Recommendation: that both governments consider further ways to assist voluntary bodies active in the field of advice and support to prospective emigrants and new arrivals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An example of the efforts we are making, additional to the annual grants amounting to £500,000 provided through the DÍON Committee, is the funding of a special co-ordinator of <Col N="570" /> community care development in the Federation of Irish Societies in London.</P>
    <P>(iv)  Recommendation: that the two Governments co-operate in establishing joint recognition of identity documentation.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social Welfare and the British Department of Social Security are together examining how these proposals might be implemented.</P>
    <P>(v)  Recommendation: that the two Governments consider jointly ways of providing appropriate information through schools to would-be migrants.</P>
    <P>In Ireland, FÁS has the main responsibility for providing pre-emigration advice.  All FÁS training courses now include information on living and working abroad.  An interdepartmental committee on emigration in Dublin and the transfrontier committee in London are actively considering other ways in which advice can be made available to potential emigrants.</P>
    <P>(vi)  Recommendation: an examination of ways in which voluntary bodies dealing with problems of homelessness might be further assisted.</P>
    <P>This is being considered by the DÍON Committee subject to the constraints of available resources.</P>
    <P>(vii)  Recommendation: that a formal liaison committee between FÁS and their British counterparts be established.</P>
    <P>The transfrontier committee to which I have already referred includes representatives of the two services and is performing very effectively the cooperative and co-ordination functions envisaged by the British-Irish Interparliamentary body.</P>

      <P>On 2 March 1993 the UN Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 809, requesting the Secretary-General to report on the prospects and modalities for the holding of the referendum on a free and fair basis, with a view to its taking place by the end of 1993 at the latest.</P>
      <P>The Secretary-General informed the Security Council on 21 May 1993 that his Special Representative, Mr. Yaqub-Khan, had visited the area at the end of March for talks with the parties.  Mr. Yaqub-Khan had reported that both sides had shown a desire to move towards an early referendum.  The Secretary-General also said that he would personally visit the area in June, accompanied by Mr. Yaqub-Khan, in order to make one more effort to seek a compromise solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Secretary-General visited the region between 31 May and 4 June 1993, during which he met Morocccan and Polisario leaders.  This visit led to direct Moroccan-Polisario talks between 17-19 July 1993 aimed at facilitating implementation of the settlement plan.  There has also been progress towards the registration of voters.  The efforts of the Secretary-General <Col N="572" /> to secure agreement on the criteria for inclusion in the voters' list have my full support.</P>

      <P>The safety of Irish personnel serving with UNIFIL in South Lebanon is a matter of paramount concern to the Government and is kept under careful review.  It is also the subject of regular discussions with the Israeli authorities, who are fully aware of the importance we attach to the question.</P>
      <P>On 26 July 1993, I issued a statement expressing the Government's grave concern at the Israeli Defence Forces' attacks across Lebanon the previous day and I deplored the loss of life resulting from these actions, as well as from the attacks against Northern Israel from inside Lebanon.</P>
      <P>On the same day, and on the basis of my statement and of information received from the Defence Forces on the situation on the ground, my Department protested to the Israeli authorities.  The Government's concern at the behaviour of the Israeli Defence Forces and the <i>de facto</i> forces in the Irish Battalion's area of operations was particularly underlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 29 July, the Taoiseach's concerns at the continuation of the shelling were communicated to the Prime Minister of Israel, Mr. Yithzak Rabin, through the Israeli Ambassador to Ireland.  The Taoiseach stressed the Government's concerns at the continuing and apparently indiscriminate shelling of the Irish area. Throughout the operation, the Israeli Government maintained that the activities of their Defence Forces were being taken in self-defence and as a last resort after all other means to ensure the protection of Israeli citizens had been tried. This was the substance of the reply given <Col N="574" /> by Israel to the Government's representations. As Deputies will be aware, the Israeli operation was ended on 31 July.</P>
    <P>I again raised the question of the safety of Irish UNIFIL personnel in a bilaterial meeting with the Foreign Minister of Israel, Mr. Shimon Peres, in New York on 29 September.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware of the major developments that have taken place in recent months in the Middle East Peace Process, culminating in the agreement between Israel and the PLO which was signed in Washington on 13 September. These developments constitute a historic step towards the establishment of a just, comprehensive and durable settlement of the Arab-Israeli dispute and open the way towards achieving a wider settlement in the region.  The Government is committed to playing its part in the effort to secure a permanent solution to the longstanding problems in the Middle East, including South Lebanon.</P>

      <P>So far this year, the Government has allocated £1.12 million <Col N="575" /> from the Emergency Humanitarian Assistance Fund for relief operations in Sudan.  Most of this assistance has been channelled through Irish voluntary agencies such as Concern, Trócaire, GOAL and Christian Aid for their respective emergency health and feeding programmes in Southern Sudan.  The conflict in Sudan has created a huge refugee problem and we have contributed an additional £100,000 to relief programmes for Sudanese refugees which are operated by GOAL, Concern and the Irish Mill Hill Fathers.</P>
      <P>In addition to providing humanitarian assistance and food aid, Ireland has had a bilateral aid programme in Sudan since 1975.  The projects within this programme are focused on addressing the basic development needs of rural villagers in the central state region.  Assistance is being provided in such areas as primary health care, water supply, renovation of schools, clinics and hospitals, and community forestry.  From the NGO Co-funding scheme, projects with Irish and local NGOs have been supported.</P>
      <P>The Government remains deeply concerned at the continuation of the conflict in southern Sudan and at the serious violations of human rights there.  We have raised these concerns with the Sudanese authorities and with the faction leaders, and have stressed to them the need to respect human rights and to bring an end to the fighting.</P>
      <P>These points were made directly to the Sudanese Government during the visit to Sudan last April of the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Tom Kitt, and by our Ambassador to Sudan during a recent visit to Khartoum.  I discussed the situation in detail with the UN Secretary-General, Dr Boutros Boutros-Ghali, in New York last week and encouraged the UN to intensify its efforts to end the conflict and bring lasting peace and stability to Sudan. We continue to monitor the situation very closely and we will do all that we can, both bilaterally and in conjunction with our European partners, to bring about a resolution of this conflict.</P>

    <P Just="Center">Notes on Table</P>
    <P>
      <i>Column (a)</i>
    </P>
    <P>(i)  The average tax payment for each year is obtained by dividing the net receipt of PAYE tax in each calendar year by the number of taxpaying units effectively liable to tax in the income tax year in which the calendar year ends, e.g. the 1989 net receipt is divided by the number liable to tax in 1989-90.</P>
    <P>(ii)  The figures in column (a) of the table are based on income tax collected through the PAYE mechanism which covers more than income tax on ordinary wages and salaries.  It includes tax paid by directors of close companies who are akin to the self-employed as well as tax on &ldquo;other income&rdquo; of employees such as rent and other investment income.  It also includes the tax paid under PAYE on the income from employment of farmers and other self-employed individuals.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Column (b)</i>
    </P>
    <P>(i)  In calculating the figures in this column the estimated net receipt from farm taxation in each calendar year has been divided by the number of farming tax units which were formally assessed for tax on their farming profits in the year of assessment in which the calendar year ends, e.g. the 1989 receipt is divided by the number assesassessed <Col N="577" /> for the year 1989-90, irrespective of whether tax was actually payable in all cases.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Full-time farmers and farmers who, or whose spouses, carry on another trade or profession have been included in the calculations in respect of tax paid on their farming profits.</P>
    <P>(iii)  Income tax on farming profits is collected with Schedule D tax generally and the figures shown for tax payments by farmers are, to some extent, estimated.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Column (c)</i>
    </P>
    <P>(i)  The figures contained in this column are obtained by dividing the estimated net receipt of income tax in each calendar year from tax units whose main sources of income is from selfemployment, other than full-time farming, by the estimated number of those units assessed to tax in the year of assessment in which the calendar year ends as explained in note (i) for column (b).</P>
    <P>(ii)  Some of the increases in the average tax payments made by other self-employed in 1988 are due to the introduction of the withholding tax on professional fees in 1987 and the combined effects of the tax amnesty, the introduction of the self-assessment system and a full year payment of the withholding tax in 1988.  The 1989 yield was the first to reflect a full year's credit for withholding tax paid in the previous year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>General Notes</i>
    </P>
    <P>(i)  A married couple who has elected or has been deemed to have elected to have the income of both spouses assessed on the husband is counted as one tax unit.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Some figures in the columns differ from those given previously.  This is due to more accurate information becoming available in the meantime.</P>
    <P>(iii)  Receipts of deposit interest retention tax and tax deducted by building societies under the former composite rate arrangements are not included in the calculations.  Basic data are not available which would enable the amounts of these taxes referable to interest paid or credited to particular classes of taxpayers to be ascertained.</P>
    <P>(iv)  The yield in 1991 from farmers and other self-employed was reduced by the once-off effect of deferring payment of the balances of 1990-91 tax from 1991 to 1992.  Ordinarily these balances, amounting to about £50 million, would have been paid in 1991 but were deferred to 1992 as a transitional effect of introducing the Current Year Basis of assessment for self-employed persons in 1990.  The yield from farmers in 1991 was further reduced because of a decrease in farming profits.</P>

      <P>The &ldquo;Annals of Innisfallen&rdquo; were bequested to the Bodleian Library in Oxford in 1755 on the death of their owner.  In response to previous requests to return the annals to this country, the library authorities contended that they could not do so, on the grounds that they were statute bound not to dispose of such bequests.  This situation remains unaltered.</P>
      <P>The &ldquo;Annals of Innisfallen&rdquo; were loaned to the Office of Public Works by the Bodleian Library for some months in 1983.  As part of the fiftieth anniversary celebrations of the Bourne Vincent Memorial Park, the annals were exhibited to the public in Muckross House, Killarney.</P>

      <P>I have seen reports of the survey referred to by the Deputy.  My more immediate concern in the negotiations for a new programme will focus on the immediate and long-term need both to protect existing employment and to create new jobs. It is imperative that the outcome of any new wage negotiations for 1994 and beyond should be moderate and lead to improved competitiveness and so have the potential to improve prospects for employment.</P>

      <P>The investigation into the collission between the Irish trawler <i>Orchidee</i> and the French trawler <i>Agena</i> has been largely completed but cannot be finalised until the French authorities are in a position to forward their response to questions posed by the Department's Marine Surveyor and to permit him to interview the crew of the French trawler.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The French authorities are conducting a judicial inquiry into the casualty.  The complex legal nature of the French proceedings have, to date, prevented the French authorities from meeting our information requirements, although we have their assurances that they will be met as soon as their procedures allow. The Department, with the assistance of the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Irish Embassy in Paris, is regularly pressing the French authorities for progress. I can advise the Deputy that <Col N="586" /> embassy officials are meeting relevant French officials again this week in a further effort to expedite matters.</P>
    <P>In addition to pursuing our concerns through diplomatic channels the Department has been in regular contact with the Chief State Solicitor's Office.  In particular, legal advice has been sought and obtained on a number of related issues and the Department is proceeding in line with that advice.</P>
    <P>The Department will continue to use all possible avenues to advance matters with the French authorities so that we can finalise our own investigations without further undue delay.  I am particularly conscious of the understandable concerns of the bereaved relatives in this case.  The Department is in regular contact with the families and will continue to advise them of developments as they arise.</P>

      <P>It is not always possible because of the tasks involved in the disease eradication schemes to give any notice of visits as such notice could defeat the purpose of these visits.</P>
      <P>In the case of the FDS, prior appointment is normally made with the farmer and a mutually acceptable day and time is agreed.

    <P>Orthopaedic surgery is one of the specialities which is being targeted in the £26 million Major Action Programme on Hospital In-Patient Waiting Lists. Under this programme, I have provided funding for an additional 100 hip replacement operations and 160 other orthopaedic procedures to be carried out in the South-Eastern Health Board area in 1993.</P>

      <P>The Southern Health Board agreed to carry out 340 additional hip replacement operations as part of the waiting list initiative, 300 at St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital and 40 at Tralee General Hospital.</P>
      <P>The additional activity commenced at Tralee General Hospital last month and 13 additional hip replacement operations have been carried out at the hospital to date.  The board expects that all 40 additional operations will be carried out by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>Delays in implementing the initiative have been experienced at St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital due to difficulties in recruiting a locum consultant orthopaedic surgeon.  In this regard, the Deputy will be pleased to learn that I have recently approved the appointment of an additional orthopaedic surgeon on a permanent basis.  Pending the filling of the post the Southern Health Board examined treatment options outside its own area for the 300 hip procedures for Cork patients.  The Deputy will be aware that earlier this week the board announced details of an agreement reached with the Royal Group of Hospitals in Belfast under which the Royal Group of Hospitals will carry out 300 hip procedures for Southern Health Board patients who are on the waiting list.  The option of taking up an early appointment for the hip procedure of course, will, be an entirely voluntary matter for the individual patients concerned.</P>
