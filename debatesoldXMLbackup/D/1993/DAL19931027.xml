      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste and I have taken every possible opportunity to convey our desire for dialogue with Unionist political leaders.  We sincerely hope that such dialogue will soon be realised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said in my Bodenstown speech on 17 October, this Government's objective <Col N="2" /> is a just and lasting peace.  I would again like to reassure the Unionist community that we do not seek to impose a solution. We will uphold the principle that negotiations on a political settlement can only take place between democratic Governments and parties committed exclusively to constitutional methods.</P>
    <P>I wish to take this opportunity to express my abhorrence at the horrendous death and injury inflicted upon defence-less men, women and children by the IRA's callous bombing on the Shankill Road on Saturday.  The other sectarian murders and murder attempts of the previous and subsequent days stand equally <Col N="3" /> condemned.  I know that all Members of this House will join me in conveying our deepest sympathies to all the bereaved and injured.</P>
    <P>To those who have inflicted such terrible suffering on the people of Northern Ireland through the years, I wish to say that the violence must be brought to an end.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the Taoiseach in expressing sympathy to the bereaved of those killed in the tragedies during the past week.  Will the Taoiseach agree that such horrendous tragedies, particularly those which took place on the Shankill Road, at the council depot and others, highlight the need for an accelerated approach to political dialogue and that, in effect, the need for talks with and between the constitutional parties was never greater?  How does the Taoiseach suggest that such talks be got underway at the earliest possible date? Has he any specific idea to achieve that objective?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by Deputy O'Keeffe, that the talks process and dialogue should be restarted.  Every effort that can be made is being made by both Governments to bring about that political dialogue and have the talks recommenced. We are ready to sit at the table today, tomorrow or whenever and so, too, are the Alliance Party and the SDLP.  The question in regard to the Official Unionist Party remains open.  There appears to be a tendency to return to the table, but the Democratic Unionist Party has steadfastly refused to do so.  I should be in a better position to make a judgment on the present position following my meeting with the British Prime Minister next Friday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach any specific proposal for arranging talks with the Unionists?  Will he accept that a general invitation is unlikely to bring about a response in the short term, particularly because of the rather frosty reception <Col N="4" /> some Unionists got when they came to Dublin last year?  Does the Taoiseach not realise that it was possible for the Leader of our party, Deputy Bruton, myself and others to meet with the Unionists in Belfast yesterday?  Will he agree that if he made a more direct approach to the Unionist parties, particularly the Official Unionist Party, it might lead to a more positive response?</P>

      <P>My door is always open.  On a number of occasions in the past invitations have been extended to those and we are all hopeful that political dialogue will take place.  I am not aware of any occasion on which a Unionist leader came to Dublin and received a frosty reception.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of the valuable discussions it is possible to have with all parties in Northern Ireland, including the Unionists &mdash; and I speak from recent experience in that regard &mdash; may I suggest that the Taoiseach should go a little further than stating his door is always open? He should knock on the Unionist doors and ask if they will talk to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can be assured that, literally, the knocking to which he referred has taken place and that an official invitation has been extended by the Tánaiste to Unionist leaders.  They are well aware that we are anxious to sit down and talk to them whenever they are available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, wish to be associated with the Taoiseach's words of sympathy to those who were bereaved at the weekend.  The photograph in yesterday's papers of Darren Baird holding his six week old sister tells the story more clearly than any words of ours.  Given the Government's anxiety to have a debate later today on the developments in Northern Ireland, is the Taoiseach prepared to brief the leaders of the Opposition parties on the Hume-Adams talks?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to be helpful. I asked the Taoiseach if he will brief the Leaders of the Opposition parties about what is contained in the Hume-Adams proposals in advance of the debate later today in order to have a meaningful and effective debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Democratic Left I, too, would like to be associated with the vote of sympathy to those in Belfast who have suffered during the past few days.  In view of the growing crisis in Northern Ireland, people would welcome a move by the Government to meet representatives of the largest community there.  The Taoiseach stated that an invitation had been extended.  The indications up to now were that the door was open.  Will the Taoiseach indicate, the precise form of the invitation he extended to representatives of the majority in Northern Ireland to meet with him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated that the Tánaiste invited leaders of the Unionist Parties in Northern Ireland to meet with him.  I have had meetings with representatives of the communities in Northern Ireland on a regular basis.  Last week I had three visits from various representatives. I do not advertise that this is the position and neither do they.  They want to conduct business in that form and I will continue to do so as long as that is their wish.</P>

      <Quest>when work will commence on the National Conference Centre in Dublin; if a site has been decided on for the centre; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I mentioned in the House on 2 March 1993, the Royal Dublin Society was asked to produce detailed proposals for the design, construction and financing of the National Conference Centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In broad terms, 50 per cent to 75 per cent of the capital costs of the centre could be made available from the Structural Funds and the promoter will have to meet the balance.  Regrettably the RDS has not generated sufficient matching <Col N="7" /> funds and it has now been informed that unless the complete financing package is in place by mid-November, proposals from other promoters will be explored further.</P>
    <P>I would like to confirm that the Government is committed to developing a major conference centre, capable of accommodating up to 2,000 delegates, in Dublin.  It is included in the <i>National Development Plan 1994-1997</i> at a projected cost of £50 million.  This investment could generate each year over 30,000 visitors, £29 million per annum in foreign revenue and support 1,500 jobs in the tourism sector.  The Government is determined that Irish tourism will benefit from this new and highly lucrative segment of international business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate if the reduced level of Structural Funding will affect the overall figure of £50 million earmarked for this project? What are the specific percentages of Exchequer, Structural and private funding? Has a private investor been identified for construction of the conference centre?  In the event of no investor being found in Dublin will the Taoiseach consider other locations for this project, such as Shannon?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with the series of questions raised by Deputy Deenihan.  The funding for this project will not be affected by funds being in short supply as suggested by Deputy Deenihan.  I stated that 50 per cent to 75 per cent of the capital costs of the centre could be made available from the Structural Funds.  One never says in advance exactly what the allocation will be.</P>

I thought I was specific in the questions I asked the Taoiseach but obviously he does not wish to reply.

If the RDS does not fulfil its obligation in respect of the centre by November we will consider the other applicants.

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware <Col N="10" /> that some organisations are planning large scale conferences in the anticipation that this centre will be available?  There is a long period before those conferences are due to take place and the uncertainty expressed by the Taoiseach in respect of the proposed National Conference Centre would be of concern to the organisers. When does the Taoiseach expect the work on the centre to start and when will it be completed?  I am aware of an international conference being organised on the premise that the proposed National Conference Centre will be available within a short timespan.  Dublin will be bereft if that conference is not held here.  Will the Taoiseach give details of the timescale for the construction of the centre and when does he expect it to be completed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, it might be useful for the House to know that, in view of the latest revelations in respect of how little money there is, I tabled a priority question to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry about proposed spending on agriculture as outlined in the plan.  That question was transferred to the Minister for Finance.  I now find that the Minister for Agriculture, <Col N="11" /> Food and Forestry has agreed to take Question No. 29, in the name of Deputy O'Donnell in respect of the funding of the plan.  I do not object to the Minister taking Deputy O'Donnell's question, but is this another example of the &ldquo;spin the bottle, pass the buck&rdquo; game that is going on between the Government Members, where responsibility is being shunted from the Taoiseach to the Tánaiste to the Minister?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 5, 11, 17, 34, 40, 58, 62 and 136 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The currently proposed outline agreement for agriculture is based on the proposals put forward by the then Director General of the GATT in December 1991, as amended by the Blair House agreement reached by Commission and US negotiators in November 1992.  The House is well aware that I have concerns regarding the proposed text.  The main problem is the commitment to reduce the volume of subsidised exports by 21 per cent and the mechanisms for implementation including the continuation of the restriction on subsidised exports to South East Asia.  Other difficulties are the limited scope and duration of the peace clause and the need to ensure that the Community's approach to market access, particularly aggregation, is fully secured <Col N="15" /> in any final agreement.  While the Commission has given specific assurances that disadvantaged areas payments would be exempt from the support reduction commitment, I am seeking to ensure that this understanding is legally underpinned in any final agreement.</P>
    <P>The proposed commitments would inevitably require some reductions in output levels for the Community as a whole in a number of sectors, particularly in the beef sector where exports would have to be reduced substantially in the first year of an agreement compared to the average levels of recent years.  There would also be cutbacks, on a smaller scale, in the dairy, pigmeat and poultry sectors.  It is not possible to quantify the actual impact of the commitments on agriculture sectors or economies of individual member states as this will largely be determined by the internal mechanisms adopted by the Community to fulfil the undertakings.  This would be a matter for negotiation in the Council at a later date.</P>
    <P>The House can be assured that the Government and I have taken every opportunity both bilaterally and multilaterally to raise our concerns in all the relevant fora.  There was an extensive debate on the agriculture aspects and in particular their compatibility with the reformed CAP at the Jumbo Council on 20 September.  At this meeting, Ireland and France in particular expressed serious reservations on the agreement while various othe member states raised points of specific concern to them.  The unanimous conclusion of the Council was that the Community will ensure that international agreements are compatible with the CAP and the GATT outcome would not directly or indirectly jeopardise the CAP or its basic principles. The Council also underlined the need to maintain the Community's export presence on international markets and defined certain general guidelines for the Commission for the conduct of further discussions in the search for an agreement acceptable to all parties.  I am satisfied <Col N="16" /> that these guidelines take on board our concerns on the proposed agreement.</P>
    <P>The Commission held discussions with the US on 27 September and again on 13 October.  The public US response to date has been that it is not prepared to renegotiate or reopen the Blair House agreement. Nevertheless, recent Councils have requested the Commission to continue the negotiations on the basis of the guidelines unanimously arrived at on 20 September during the Jumbo Council. The matter was discussed most recently at the Agriculture Council last week when the Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr. Steichen, confirmed that the Commission would continue to pursue the discussions in accordance with the guidelines laid down by the Council.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Tourism and Trade has commissioned a consultancy study to examine the impact of a GATT agreement on Ireland in all areas of the negotations, including agriculture.  The study was carried out in co-operation with all Departments involved in the GATT negotiations, including my own Department. The study has not yet been considered by the Government.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to press the Commission to seek a solution to the problems we have identified.  There are serious difficulties in other areas of the negotiations also and considerable work remains to be done if a comprehensive and balanced agreement is to be reached by 15 December.</P>
    <P>A decision on Ireland's attitude to a final agreement will be taken only when agreement has been reached in all areas and in the light of whether and to what extent our problems have been addressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a fascinating response more for what it conceals than what it reveals.  It must be the longest apology I have ever heard from a Minister in this House, but it has not answered the question.  I asked the Minister what steps yet remain to be taken to finalise the EC position on the matter.  Will the Minister confirm that the matters now <Col N="17" /> being discussed are comprehended in the agreement which on the night it was signed was confirmed publicly by the Minister as being a good deal, and about which he now claims he has concerns? What opportunities has the Minister, or the Minister for Tourism and Trade or whoever is responsible for these things, between now and 15 December to stiffen the European Community's back on this matter and get some real negotiation going rather than the half-hearted apology that he has indicated to us?</P>

      <P>The Government and Ministers directly involved are taking every opportunity to ensure that the present draft is modified to meet the concerns which we have raised at all Council meetings.  The Deputy will recall that at the Jumbo Council meeting of 20 September we reached unanimous conclusions which mean that the Community has agreed concerns, rather than Ireland being left in isolation with its concerns.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>In my question I asked the Minister to outline the amendments required to the Blair House agreement which would enable Ireland to accept the GATT agreement.  I listened to his long reply but he was not specific in relation to the amendments he is seeking.  If no changes are made to the Blair House agreement what position will the Government adopt on 15 December and is it of the opinion that it has the right to exercise a veto?  Is it its intention to exercise a veto?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of the modifications and adjustments which the Government and I are seeking I wish to repeat that the Government and I are concerned about the proposed reduction of 21 per cent in the volume of subsidised exports, the continuation of the restriction <Col N="18" /> on subsidised exports to South East Asia, the peace clause, aggregation and disadvantaged areas payments.  We are availing of every opportunity at various fora to ensure that our concerns are met. I cannot say what position the Government will adopt as I do not know what shape the final agreement will take. There are no proposals on the table as yet which I could present to the Government. We are in the middle of discussions and until I see the final proposals I will not be in a position to say what position I will adopt.</P>

      <P>It is not the practice to reveal internal office procedures that have to be carried out by district livestock offices prior to sending applications for the deseasonalisation slaughter premium scheme or other schemes for payment as such disclosures would have serious implications for control of the schemes.</P>
      <P>To date 46 per cent of all applications received under the scheme have been paid representing close to 60 per cent of those forwarded to headquarters.  A further 1,250 cases are expected to be paid later this week.</P>
      <P>Up to 25 per cent of applications under the scheme are rejected when submitted to computer validation check, largely due to invalid tag numbers.  I would, therefore, exhort farmers to take great care in completing applications under this and other premium and headage schemes as this facilitates processing and ensures that EC requirements are met.</P>

      <P>The Minister has told us that it is not the practice to reveal internal procedures but that is not the reason.  The reason is that it might prove embarrassing for both him and his Department.  Can the Minister tell me why in one county <Col N="21" /> last week 100 per cent of all applications received had been forwarded to his Department for payment while in another county not that far away only 10 per cent of the applications received had been forwarded for payment?

      <P>It is my intention to ensure that all compensatory payments to which farmers are entitled are made as expeditiously as possible.  Many new schemes were put into operation this year.  I should say that departmental officials in Agriculture House and in offices throughout the country are working themselves to the bone to ensure that the best possible service is provided to farmers.  There is an error rate of 25 per cent in respect of all applications forwarded to the Department and this is not in the farmers' interests.  For instance, incorrect tag numbers have been given as farmers looked at the blue cards instead of quoting the number on the animal's ear.  In addition, female animals have been included in applications made under a male animals' scheme. Farmers should be more careful.  The position is that 16,332 applications have been received and of these 13,077 have been forwarded for payment.  I expect that every eligible applicant will be paid within the next few weeks.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that it is vain to plead in his own defence that a number of new schemes have been put into operation since he went along with the nonsensical reform of the Common Agricultural Policy?  Will the <Col N="22" /> Minister answer the question I put to him?  Why is it that in some counties there appears to be no difficulty in forwarding expeditiously applications for payment to his Department while in other counties there are long delays?  Last week in one county only 10 per cent of applications received had been forwarded to his Department.  Can the Minister explain the difference and indicate the reason the huge number of farmers disadvantaged in this way?</P>

      <P>The United Nations is the main international organisation involved in the collection and dissemination of statistics in relation to the timber trade.  The UN gathers data on trade flows, production and consumption in all regions of the world and also carries out studies on future supply and demand patterns.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal market for timber and timber products which will emerge from Ireland's increasing forest estate will be Europe.  UN studies predict that the demand for timber and timber products in Europe will rise substantially by the year 2010.  Afforestation policies and targets are determined by reference to supply and demand predictions for industrial roundwood.  Total demand for industrial roundwood in Europe is expected to almost treble, from 298 million cubic metres in 1991 to 855 million cubic metres in 2010.  However, production <Col N="24" /> capacity in Europe is projected to increase at much slower rate &mdash; the relevant figures are 1991 production at 284 million cubic metres rising to 469 million cubic metres in 2010.  Accordingly, the UN predicts that there will be a growing requirement in Europe for timber products, based on consumption forecasts in the following categories:</P>

    <P>The planting target of 30,000 hectares per annum which has been set by the Government is geared towards taking advantage of the market opportunities predicted.  I believe that Ireland, having one of the fastest growth rates for softwoods in Europe, is well placed to take advantage of this growing demand.  Our planting programme will provide the raw material resource to manufacture value-added products such as oriented strand board and medium density fibreboard the consumption of which, as I have already indicated is predicted to almost treble within the next 20 years.</P>

      <P>The purpose of our forest programme is twofold, first, to increase the level of exports and, second, to add the maximum value-added to the produce of our forests.  We are doing that through the two processing facilities, one being expanded and the second in the context of the new strandboard mill which will come on stream within the next 18 months approximately.  It is estimated that the employment generated as a result of these two facilities, together with the increasing planting programme, will be between 1,600 and 2,000 people over the five years of the development plan which we are announcing.  It is difficult to predict the long term increase in employment over the next 20 years. However, if there is increased activity in forest production there should be a corresponding increase in the level of employment.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 28, 49 and 137 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has reached agreement with officials of the EC Commission on the terms of the early retirement scheme for farmers and I hope that formal approval by the Commission will be forthcoming in the next few weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="28" /> The scheme will be put into operation as soon as it is approved.  Application forms and information will be available in good time.</P>
    <P>Following consultation with the Commission my Department has been informed that farmyard enterprises were not eligible for participation in the scheme.  Accordingly the question of assessing pension per labour unit does not arise.  Full details of the draft scheme will be circulated with the Official Report.</P>
    <P Just="Center">EC Aid Scheme for Early Retirement from Farming.</P>
    <P>This draft scheme is one of the accompanying measures of the CAP reform agreed in June 1992.</P>
    <P>Under EC Regulation No. 2979/92 member states may institute a Community aid scheme for early retirement from farming partly financed by the EC. Early retirement aid may be paid to farmers and to workers.</P>
    <P>A draft programme and scheme has been agreed with the Commission.  It is hoped that final approval will be obtained shortly.  The main points are as follows:</P>
    <P>(a)  this is a pension scheme open to farmers between 55 and 66 who have practised farming as a main occupation for the preceding 10 years, and who retire from farming definitively and transfer their farms by gift, lease or sale essentially to farmers who will expand their holdings;</P>
    <P>(b)  the rate of annual pension will be at a basic 4,000 ECUs (£3,515 at current conversion rates) and 250 ECUs (£220) per hectare up to a maximum of 10,000 ECUs (£8,788) for a farm of 24 hectares or over.  The pension rate will be fixed in ECUs so as to avail of the benefits of any changes in the ECU conversion rates which could result in increases in the pension when expressed in Irish pounds.  For example the rates quoted above are for 1993 and these will probably increase by about 10 per cent in 1994 because of <Col N="29" /> changes in the ECU conversion rate. Payment will be on a monthly basis;</P>
    <P>(c)  the pension will be paid for a maximum of 10 years but in any event not beyond the retired farmer's 70th birthday nor the retired worker's 65th birthday;</P>
    <P>(d)  the minimum size of holding to be transferred to a transferee is 5 hectares;</P>
    <P>(e)  there is a minimum enlargement provision of 5 hectares or 10 per cent of the transferor's holding whichever is the greater&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  if a person succeeds the transferor as head of the holding he must meet this enlargement condition</P>
    <P>(ii)  if a person holds land in his own right which was not the subject of a transfer from the transferor after 30/7/92, he can meet the enlargement condition by taking over the transferor's holding;</P>
    <P>(f)  there is an upper age limit of 50 years for a farming transferee; the transferee would have to have an agricultural qualification or be otherwise suitably qualified and undertake to farm the land for a minimum of 5 years or for as long as the pension is payable;</P>
    <P>(g)  transfer of land can be to persons or bodies, or the owner himself can reassign the land for non-agricultural uses, forestry or ecological reserve creation if a suitable farming transferee cannot be found; also a farming transferee can use the released land for forestry;</P>
    <P>(h)  a pension (one pension only) may be payable where a farm being released has been managed jointly and where a member of the partnership meeting the age criteria or other criteria is not the owner;</P>
    <P>(i)  there must be a transfer of production/quota rights with the land other than in cases where the transferee does not want them subject to quota regulations;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="30" /> (j)  there will be an element of backdating to allow applicants who ceased farming on or after 30 July 1992 when the EC Regulation entered into force, and who met the qualifying age limits to become eligible for the scheme, however, there will be no retrospective payment of the pension;</P>
    <P>(k)  there is also a pension scheme for workers (or family helpers) between 55 and 65, under certain conditions, who lose their employment as a result of the farmer's early retirement; rate of pension is 2,500 ECUs (£2,196) per year up to 65, subject to a maximum of two workers per holding;</P>
    <P>(l)  where the pensioner dies, payment of the balance of the pension due may be made to the spouse and/or dependants, subject to the resulting total annual income not exceeding the maximum of the pension and the average industrial wage as determined by the Central Statistics Office;</P>
    <P>(m)  the pension will only be paid from the date all the conditions of the scheme for transferors and transferees are met;</P>
    <P>(n)  payments will be subject to tax where appropriate;</P>
    <P>(o)  if a State pension becomes payable to a transferor the retirement pension will be offset by this amount.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's concern about the timescale.  It is obvious that the Minister has done everything possible to bring the scheme to fruition, evidence of which lies in the fact that <Col N="32" /> the Government granted approval for the scheme this morning.  We expect that the scheme will be in operation in December of this year.  As regards the details of the scheme, my understanding is that a memorandum has been circulated on a number of occasions outlining the Government's broad approach to the early retirement scheme.  Now that approval has been granted by the Commission and the Government, we will be putting together detailed guidelines in relation to the scheme and we will endeavour to circulate this information to all interested people and organisations.</P>

      <P>Will all farmers over 55 years be eligible for this scheme and how many people will be involved?  What has been the cause of the delay in proceeding with the scheme?  It was to be announced first in early spring, then in early summer, then late summer and now we are promised it will be in operation by the end of the year.  I do not know whether that can be taken with a grain of salt.  When will the scheme be up and running?</P>

A memorandum has been circulated on the matter and in conjunction with my reply I am circulating again full details of the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I wold ask the Minister to reconsider the question of farmyard enterprises.  To proceed along the lines suggested will militate against constituencies such as mine where there are many small farmers.  In the case of one farmer who has ten acres of land and a labour unit of 1.2, if the scheme is based on acreage he will receive only one-third of the amount he would receive had he the maximum farm acreage.  If this scheme is not re-examined it will be very unfair on enterprising farmers with small acreages who supplement their income with other farmyard enterprises.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the point raised by Deputy Leonard.  He raised that matter with me and the Minister on a number of occasions.  I assure the Deputy and the House that this requirement was pursued with the European Commission who gave a negative reply in that it clearly indicated that the farm retirement scheme is related to land and that a certain element of reestructuring is involved.  Therefore the people in whom the Deputy has displayed an interest cannot be accommodated within the scheme.</P>

I welcome <Col N="34" /> the fact that agreement in principle has been reached with the Commission.  Will the Minister confirm that the moneys allocated in the 1993 budget for the farm retirement scheme will not be used this year as the scheme will not be off the ground by the end of the financial year? To what specific purpose does the Minister intend to put those moneys?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme as it is formulated and approved by the Commission is a very generous one.  All farmers who meet the conditions will qualify for the scheme.  For example, farmers who transfer five hectares of land will qualify for the minimum pension provision. I am very optimistic and hopeful that the scheme will be successful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the press releases, it is not the information given but rather the information not given which is giving rise to all the questions. Can the Minister of State say if it is proposed to exclude part-time farmers, farmers, whose spouses are working and young farmers with a part-time job who will inherit the land from the scheme?  If this is so, does the Minister of State accept that vast areas of the country will not benefit from the scheme?  We are all concerned about this issue and I ask the Minister to clarify the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>The conditions governing the scheme are laid down in Community regulations.  Farmers who qualify under the scheme will have to derive 50 per cent of their income from agriculture. We discussed this matter with the Commission in great detail.  I can inform the House that in the case of a husband and <Col N="35" /> wife where the husband does not qualify under the scheme and it can be demonstrated that the wife is involved in full time farming she will be entitled in her own right to make an application under the scheme, which, hopefully, will be approved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>The conditions in this respect are clearly laid down and are quite simple.  The only problem, if one wanted to describe it as such, is the requirement of additionality which amounts to 5 per cent of the land being transferred.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister is aware, a number of broiler producers in my constituency, many of whom were farmers, diversified out of economic necessity.  Will these producers be debarred from the scheme because they are engaged in what would be regarded as a farm enterprise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the conditions of the scheme is that a farmer must transfer five hectares of his land.  With regard to the type of alternative farm enterprises referred to by the Deputy, the income from the enterprise will be taken into consideration in assessing eligibility under the scheme.  The level of benefit under the scheme will be calculated on the basis of the amount of land being transferred.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the request by my constituency colleague, Deputy Leonard, to have the scheme re-examined. It is very hard to accept that some small farmers who have made extraordinary efforts in very difficult conditions will once again not be eligible for inclusion in the scheme.  Can the Minister <Col N="36" /> tell us the number of farmers who have indicated their wish to participate in this scheme?  Having regard to the number of phone calls I received and the number of questions I have been asked, it seems that there is panic in the farming community &mdash; farmers have lost the will to stay in farming, they are worried about CAP reform&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>If it were not for the efforts of my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Walsh, the scheme would not be as suitable as it is for Irish farmers.  It has to be borne in mind that the European Commission is funding this scheme to the extent of 75 per cent.  Apart altogether from its direct benefit to farmers and Irish agriculture, the scheme is extremely valuable and attractive so far as the economy is concerned.  I accept the views expressed by the Deputy and I understand his concerns.  I agree that he comes from an area where there is a very high level of off-farm enterprises.  However, we could not convince the Commission of the importance of including these enterprises in the scheme.  The best concession we could get in this regard was a commitment to take into consideration the income derived from alternative farm enterprises in deciding qualification in terms of the transfer of land.  I can assure the Deputy that the Minister and I identified this problem long ago and, together with other aspects of the scheme originally circulated by the Commission, we took it into consideration in the negotiations. The original scheme formulated and circulated by the Commission has been amended and adjusted.</P>

I am satisfied that the excellent team of civil servants in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry who will be dealing with this scheme will make steps to ensure that it becomes operational as <Col N="39" /> quickly as possible.  The only doubt which exists about the speed with which the scheme can be brought into operation relates to the decision to be taken by the Commission, which we have been told will take four to six weeks.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government accepted the broad thrust of the report of the Expert Group on the Food Industry in July.  As a result I was authorised to draft the legislation to set up An Bord Bia and draw up a new national programme for the food industry covering investment aid, marketing and promotion, aid for research and development and training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation to establish An Bord Bia is presently being drafted and will be presented to the House at the earliest possible opportunity.  The new national <Col N="40" /> food programme has been included in the National Development Plan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister acknowledge that there is considerable concern about the fact that the development of the food industry is to be the responsibility of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, that inevitably this will mean that it will be producer/farmer driven rather than market driven and that if this continues to be the case it will never realise its full potential?  Will the Minister accept that it would be of value both to the food industry, to the potential jobs that can be created and to the Irish nation as a whole if he would release An Bord Bia from his clutches and let it remain within the ambit of the industrial and trade area where it belongs?</P>
      <P>Second, would the Minister agree that there is a danger of fragmentation if we establish another body to deal with the whole development of our exports when we have an organisation to do this, namely, An Bord Tráchtála?  Will this not result in unnecessary duplication and a failure to realise the potential of the food industry?</P>

      <P>The establishment of An Bord Bia was recommended by the Expert Group on the Food Industry which included experts from all areas of that industry.  However, there was one dissenting voice and a minority report was presented.  The Government has decided that the responsibility for An Bord Bia rests with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  The debate on that issue is over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the point raised by the Deputy that we have an organisation promoting the food industry, it is true to say that An Bord Tráchtála has food functions <Col N="41" /> but there are other bodies also who carry out such functions, in particular CBF.  In regard to the Deputy's other point that An Bord Bia is producer driven, the board deals solely with exports.  That is the brief of the board. The whole emphasis in the expert group's report is on the consumer, consumer demands and the thrust of production being consumer driven.  The point the Deputy made is inaccurate and she should read the report of the food group.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred to fragmentation in relation to our export drive.  The whole thrust of An Bord Bia is to streamline what is taking place, bring the various elements together and give better value to the taxpayer in terms of the promotion of our Irish product and of assisting the food companies to launch their products or to continue to promote and market those products on the European market and further afield.</P>

The Deputy used the word &ldquo;rationalise&rdquo;, and I accept that to mean bringing the various marketing elements together and obtaining the best <Col N="42" /> possible result for producers and for the food processing industry.  The other matters are ones for decision by Government but the question relates specifically to An Bord Bia.  I am glad there is support on the Opposition side for the whole concept.  We are moving as quickly as possible to put this board in place and assist the industry in selling more of its product, thereby creating further employment in the food industry, which is the concern of Deputy McManus also.</P>

      <P>Within the context of what I call the &ldquo;womb to tomb&rdquo; operation, that the whole system is integrated from the producer right up to the supermarket shelf, will the Minister explain where CBF comes into An Bord Bia? What role will CBF have in this regard and, more particularly, will the expertise it has in overseas trading be integrated into the new board?  What will be the staffing arrangement?</P>

      <P>Legislation is in the course of preparation and I cannot be specific in my reply to the Deputy's question. However, in the time I have been in office I have come to admire greatly the work being done by CBF.

      <P>In his response the <Col N="43" /> Minister stated that the industry was very much consumer driven.  It must be a bitter disappointment for the Minister that a person who produced a minority report has probably the greatest appreciation of consumers than many other people on the committee.  It is an indictment of An Bord Bia that a minority report was produced by a person who would be very much consumer driven.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I would defend the right of any individual to seek to have a minority report published.  If someone felt strongly enough about an issue to publish a minority report so be it.  However, the bottom line is that the consumer driven aspect obviously is focused to a great extent on a European market where we must now look in terms of our commodities and the results of CAP reform where intervention as a market mechanism will no longer be as easily available as it has been.</P>
      <P>Therefore, our thrust must be towards many more value-added products.  An Bord Bia has a huge role to play in launching those and placing them strongly on the market.</P>

      <P>The Minister stated that the expert group represented all interests.  For the record I wish to state that consumers were not represented on that expert group.

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but the expert group was lacking in that key area.  I suggest to the Minister of State that it would be at his peril to disregard the case made in the minority report with regard to the future development of the food industry.  I remind him that, while that debate may have concluded within the Government, certainly it has not concluded outside the Government.  Would he not accept that the policy pursued <Col N="44" /> by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry has led to huge accumulations of basic commodities in cold storage while, at the same time, we have an under-developed food industry that could have created badly needed jobs?  If the Government insists on pursuing this course of action, does the Minister of State not recognise that that will be the future of the food industry as well?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Members of the Expert Group on the Food Industry were consumers also and essentially were nominated because of their particular expertise within the context of greater job creation throughout the food industry generally.  I do not accept the Deputy's criticisms of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, who worked within the marketing mechanisms available within the European Community. Obviously, while companies and firms were taking commercial decisions on how they would dispose of products, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry was implementing the schemes provided by the EC.  I suggest that all Members of this House support An Bord Bia in the very important work it will be undertaking in the not too distant future.</P>

I happen to have served on the board of Córas Beostoc agus Feola for seven years and remember an occasion when the then Minister halved their budget within one year, causing them major problems.  I am glad to note that CBF will become a major part of An Bord Bia and will have a major role to play within that board.  Will the Minister of State say whether the recent fiasco <i>visà-vis</i> the funding of the National Development Plan will have any effect on the long term finances of An Bord Bia?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Sir.  My view is that this debate is too short, that if we are going to have a debate on Northern Ireland &mdash; and it now appears it is going to be a substantive debate with a motion and with amendments to that motion &mdash; the subject is too serious to be dealt with in this impromptu fashion.  I was willing to agree to a short series of statements that would involve expressions of sympathy and general statements of view.  I do not think the House should place itself in a position in which we will have a debate with competing amendments being tabled by different quarters of the House, at short notice, when none of us will have had an apportunity to look at amendments tabled by others, in view of the very great seriousness of the situation in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House will be aware, I have been pressing the Government for some time to have a debate on this subject.  I am sorry that the debate did not occur before the recent atrocities.  It is a pity that we appear to be reacting to atrocities rather then seeking to shape events.  If we are to have a debate, it should be properly prepared, especially if it is to be based on a substantive motion when there will be the potential for disagreement, rather than our seeing the motion at 12 o'clock today.  There is also <Col N="159" /> an amendment and we must decide whether we will vote on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>My party, like at least one other party, was not consulted last evening about this procedure.  In fact I learned of it on the 12 noon news headlines today.  Had we been consulted I would have made it perfectly clear that we cannot have a meaningful debate on this issue.  I am quite happy to have short statements of condemnation.  My party Whip has already so indicated.  We also wish to proceed with the motion of no confidence in the Government.  For that reason I wish to propose an amendment to the Order of Business.  If you will allow me, Sir, I will now read that amendment as follows:</P>
      <P>That the debate on item No. a6 shall not exceed one hour 15 minutes; that the speeches of the main spokespersons shall not exceed 15 minutes; that the Tánaiste shall be called upon to reply not less than 15 minutes before the debate is due to conclude; that the Dáil should then proceed to consider the Motion of no confidence, item No. 19.11, in the names of Deputies John Bruton, Rabbitte and myself and that the House shall sit not later than 10 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a difficulty because, in ordering the business of the House, I have to endeavour to get agreement between all sides.  In the absence of agreement between all sides the Government is left in the position where it must endeavour to go along with the majority of the views opposite.  That is why we went along with the motion tabled. However, in deference to the views of the House, I do not have a problem in not having a motion down if there is serious disagreement about that.  I have no desire to divide the House on that issue.  We can substitute statements for the motion and carry on on that basis if that is what the majority of the Members opposite want.</P>

      <P>I would be willing to accept that.  It is better, if we are going to draft a substantive motion, that we take time to do so.  We should have a motion which is properly prepared.  It should not be debated until we have had a chance to prepare it properly.  However, may I suggest that we allow the debate, including statements, to continue until 8.30 p.m.?  I am sure many Members of the House would wish to contribute in a constructive fashion and it should not be confined merely to prepared statements on the part of party Leaders.  I hope the House will agree to extend the debate somewhat to allow more Members to contribute.</P>

      <P>I am happy with the Taoiseach's suggestion that we should have statements only.  I am not happy that we should have a four-hour statement session, which I believe would be unhelpful. The Taoiseach said last week that it would be unhelpful even to have a private briefing with Leaders of the Opposition. This subject is much too important not be be helpful.  Therefore, I suggest that we accept the Taoiseach's proposal of short statements and then proceed to discuss the motion of no confidence.</P>

      <P>I am in a difficulty here. As far as I am aware, the proposal to continue the debate on Northern Ireland until 8.30 p.m. apparently is supported by one party.  As I understand the position, the proposal on the part of the Technical Group is to have a substantial debate on Northern Ireland today and defer the motion of no confidence until next week, if necessary, while the Progressive Democrats want statements on Northern Ireland followed immediately by the motion of no confidence this evening and tomorrow.  I am trying to keep the House together on a particular issue by having statements which could be over in a couple of hours.  We could then proceed to the ordinary business of the electoral motion and have the confidence debate tomorrow, if that is satisfactory to the other side of the House.</P>

I understood that the proposal was that the party Leaders would take 20 minutes each to be followed by the Tánaiste who would take 20 minutes, which would leave five minutes for each of four participants.  This effectively would rule out people like me.  It would seem this is showing much less urgency than this drastic situation demands.

      <P>As I understand it, the Government is not offering this debate by way of response to requests that have been made in the House for a debate on Northern Ireland but rather as a response to the atrocities of the weekend.  Like Deputy Bruton, I believe Members of the House, other than the party Leaders, ought to be given an opportunity to contribute. It may even be unseemly for us to proceed with the motion of no confidence immediately after that debate.  If that means reverting to the Government's programme of legislation, that is what we ought to do.  I agree with the proposal that the debate on Northern Ireland should be extended to 8.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>I am happy to accept the Taoiseach's proposal that we should proceed by way of statements.  Our proposal and preference is that these statements should continue until 8.30 p.m.  It would be grossly insensitive to deal with a motion of confidence following statements on the atrocities in Northern Ireland.  The Taoiseach is not correct in saying that the Opposition is running from the vote of confidence.  This motion is being taken today because it cannot be taken any other day this week owing to the summit conference on Friday.  I would point out that we have also made proposals to the Government regarding special arrangements for the Tánaiste to speak at an earlier time on the vote of confidence tomorrow, to extend sitting hours tomorrow and have the vote on the issue of confidence tomorrow evening.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>All Members of this House will, I know, wish to join me in expressing our abhorrence at the appalling <Col N="167" /> death and injury inflicted on defence-less people on the Shankill Road last Saturday and at further sectarian murders in Belfast during the last few days. To all those who have been bereaved and injured in recent days, we convey our deepest sympathies.</P>
      <P>I have stated on many occasions that those who perpetrate such actions have absolutely no mandate from the people, North or South, for their vicious campaigns. Excuses such as have been put forward are not acceptable.  Tragic civilian deaths on a large scale are the inevitable and direct consequence from time to time of any bombing campaign, whatever the intentions or the warnings.</P>
      <P>I can assure the House and people North and South that the Government will continue to take all necessary measures to combat paramilitary violence. Our commitment in this regard is clear and unambiguous.  We continue to provide all necessary resources to the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces. The Irish taxpayer contributes three or four times more to the cost of security related to the Northern situation than his or her British counterpart.  We have had many successes in recent times in uncovering arms, capable of causing large-scale loss of life and destruction in the North.  We will also exercise the greatest vigilance in order to prevent any attacks on this jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>We continue to review the effectiveness of the various legal measures in force.  In this regard, the Government will shortly introduce measures to amend our extradition legislation.  The primary purpose of these measures will be to provide for an amendment of the Extradition Act of 1987 in order to further clarify the circumstances in which offences are excluded from the political offence exception and to deal with issues raised by the judgments of the Supreme Court in the Magee, McKee and Sloan cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Security co-operation with the Northern Ireland and British authorities is effective, and the Government will ensure that it remains so.  Paramilitary organisations should be in no doubt as <Col N="168" /> to our determination to deal with their terrorist activities in every way open to us.</P>
    <P>Northern Ireland has in recent weeks witnessed a serious upsurge in violence from paramilitaries on both sides.  Each atrocity provokes a vicious response from the other side, and it seems that there is no end to the spiral of mistrust and hate. People live in fear of answering a knock on the front door or of going about their daily tasks.  Can we offer any hope to the people who are trapped in this awful way?  Must they and their children face a further 25 years of violence?  When the immediate crisis dies down, we still have to face the underlying problems of the situation, and we must never be deflected from our search for peace and political progress.</P>
    <P>The people of Northern Ireland must not give way to despair.  The vast majority have shown restraint and dignity in the past in the face of provocation.  Any other approach would only prolong and aggravate the sorrow and heartache of the past few days.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government remains convinced that the problems of Northern Ireland have to be resolved by a process of political dialogue and co-operation between parties dedicated to the democratic process.  There can be no other way.</P>
    <P>People ask what progress has been made in this regard.  It is sometimes forgotten that for some seven months last year a process of political talks was undertaken.  For the first time, Irish Government Ministers met with leaders of the Unionist tradition.  The issues discussed at that time were not and are not capable of instant solution.  Nevertheless, there was progress.  Each side went away with a better understanding of the other's concerns than was possible before.  These concerns were conveyed with a remarkable degree of goodwill and sincerity and with recognition that the validity of both traditions had to be respected in any eventual settlement.  The Government remain firmly of the view that this recognition will have to be at the centre of any solution.  As I said recently, both <Col N="169" /> the Unionist and the Nationalist communities have identities and important rights which cannot be ignored.  We must all recognise that a broad accommodation of different identities, rights and aspirations can only be on the basis of freely given agreement and consent.</P>
    <P>Can we build on the valuable foundation which has been laid?  The Irish Government stand ready to do so and to approach talks with an open mind and without pre-conditions.  We do not accept the argument that a resumption of these talks would be pointless.  Talks are never pointless between constitutional parties committed to the democratic process.  I would echo the call of the leaders of the main Churches in Ireland, who have called on political leaders to show courage and vision in the present difficult situation.  Both the Tánaiste and I have made clear our openness to dialogue with Unionist political leaders to advance the cause of just and lasting peace.  I am convinced such dialogue could also hasten progress towards a permanent cessation of all violence.  If Unionist leaders consider that the Irish Government is not fully alert to its views on the issues which confront us all, we stand ready to listen to them at any time and in any place. In the meantime, I have made arrangements to meet the leader of the Alliance Party, Dr. John Alderdice, next week.</P>
    <P>There is a tremendous desire for peace among the majority of the people of this country, North and South.  The violence is utterly senseless.  It will not promote or advance any political cause.  It does not serve the interests of any community. It simply inflicts suffering and grief on families and communities across the North.  It damages the reputation of this country abroad.  It is harmful to our efforts for economic development and diverts vast resources into maintaining security, which could be better used elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Ever since I came to office, I have made the achievement of peace my first priority.  I am deeply committed to finding a formula for peace, which will allow a process of peace to begin with a complete and lasting cessation of violence.  Who <Col N="170" /> can be afraid of peace?  What are the fears of people that prevent them grasping the opportunity that may exist for peace?  I still await the answers.</P>
    <P>We all fervently wish that those engaged in violence would heed the voices of political leaders, church leaders and community leaders, all of whom rightly demand that the slaughter be brought to an end without delay.  At the same time, it is the duty of both Governments to do anything and everything in their power, consistent with their long-established principles and obligations, to hasten that day.  An absolute commitment to peace is needed from everyone because, unfortunately, the reality is that it is unlikely to come about of its own accord.</P>
    <P>When people talk of violence and the search for peace they should always remember that violence is coming from both communities.  If we emphasise more violence on one side than the other we will not get the desired result.  We want to try to stop the violence on one side in the belief that the public statements of the other side will respond to a cessation of violence.</P>
    <P>I am convinced, notwithstanding the terrible events of the last few days, that an opportunity for peace may exist, and, if so, that it must be grasped.  The two Governments have a responsibility to ensure that if indeed the opportunity does exist, it is not allowed to pass.  The immediate situation in Northern Ireland is threatening enough.  We cannot allow a slide into worse violence in the near future.  Neither the British nor the Irish Government would be lightly forgiven if either were to ignore or reject a genuine opportunity for peace.</P>
    <P>There has been much discussion in recent times of the Hume-Adams dialogue. I would like in this context to salute the courageous role of John Hume in that dialogue and the crucial part he has played in advancing the acceptance of principles, which carried to their logical conclusion should bring about peace.</P>
    <P>However, the creation of a peace process has to be more widely based, and to involve the two Governments, conscious <Col N="171" /> of both their international obligations and their wider responsibilities to both communities.  Consistent with these, the two Governments must work together to reach a common understanding in their own terms on a framework for peace. Any initiative can only be taken by the two Governments, and there can be no question of them simply adopting or endorsing the report of the Hume-Adams dialogue that was recently given to us and which we have not passed on to the British Government.  Much of the current speculation is to that extent inaccurate and has a misleading focus.  The British Government has made it clear that it is always prepared to listen to what the Irish Government has to say to it.  The Irish Government has been working for some time past on the elaboration of a formula for peace and our view is that both Governments must act and work together.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste will elaborate later on some of the principles involved in the formulation of this peace process.  Such a formula would have to take account of many vital concerns on all sides.  The purpose of the formula would be to help bring about a permanent cessation of violence and the commencement of a peace process, which would lead in time to a just and lasting political settlement or, in other words, peace in the fullest sense of the word.</P>
    <P>I repeat there can be no question of trying to predetermine the future or to impose any particular kind of political settlement, which must be left to negotiations between democratic Governments and the constitutional political parties.  There can be no question of tampering with the principle of consent, as set out in Article 1 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  But, subject to that constraint, the people of Ireland, North and South, have the right to determine their own future.  We are prepared to accept into the democratic process any party that permanently and verifiably renounces violence.</P>
    <P>The House will understand that I am not able to say more at the moment.  If a <Col N="172" /> peace process is to be advanced great sensitivity has to be exercised.  International experience shows that results are best achieved in circumstances of complete confidentiality.</P>
    <P>I will be meeting Prime Minister John Major on Friday to discuss urgently the current situation and the best way in which both Governments can advance progress towards peace and the process of dialogue that could lead to a political settlement.  In this regard I want it to be clearly understood that I seek a cessation of violence that will transform the atmosphere surrounding both communities in Northern Ireland.  In the future I hope a political settlement can be reached that recognises the diversities and different identities and will provide a balanced accommodation for both communities who can live and work out their future on this island together.</P>
    <P>Both Government have a duty and responsibility to look on the present situation and to quickly address their minds to what will restore hope and confidence in the democratic process.  We cannot hand over the stage to the paramilitaries on either side.  Time is not on our side.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have returned from spending two days in Northern Ireland meeting politicians of the major parties. The image that remains most vivid in my mind from that visit is not that of any of the people I met.  It is the picture in the newspaper of a nine year old boy, holding his infant sister, who had lost both parents in the Shankill bomb.  That is one of the many images of utter bereavement and loss during the past 25 years.  It is the greatest challenge to all of us in democratic politics to find a way to end this violence.  Apart from the Shankill bomb, what is particularly dispiriting is that specific threats have been issued to named elected politicians in Northern Ireland during the past few days.  That appalling threat struck me during my meetings with a number of the elected politicians.  While members of all the main parties were determined to continue with their work, the sense that their loved ones and themselves were at risk of a boot to the door <Col N="173" /> any night and that that could be the prelude to the end of their lives is something that weighs heavily on all the people involved in direct politics in Northern Ireland.  Everyone who will speak in this debate will be conscious of that and will want to help those in democratic politics in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Much has been said and written about the Hume-Adams process and some of the phrases used in the declarations emanating from the process have been criticised.  I am among those who have criticised some of the words used because they are open to an interpretation which is not benign.  What strikes me forcibly about what Mr. John Hume is trying to do is his discussions with Mr. Gerry Adams, or Provisional Sinn Féin, is that he is trying to use the language of others to express a more benign and peaceful concept.  He is going out of his way to use other people's language, even if he does not particularly like it, in order to try to draw people who are using that language towards peace.  The Nationalist tradition, referred to by the Taoiseach, and the Unionist tradition are equally important. We in the Nationalist tradition should make a special effort, as Mr. John Hume is doing in his discussions with Mr. Gerry Adams, to try to use some of the language and the concepts of the Unionists with a view to enabling them to have a better understanding of our point of view and to approaching their point of view on issues where there is potential agreement.</P>
      <P>What is particularly worrying is that the agenda in Northern Ireland seems to be created at the moment by those who are involved in or supporting terrorism. We are trying to read their minds and wonder what they will do next.  It is unhealthy to allow those who are engaged in terror or who are supporting terror to drive the political agenda or create the political news.  It is important that democratic politicians on these islands should recapture the political agenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most recent talks were three-stranded talks based on internal discussions, North-South discussions and interGovernmental <Col N="174" /> discussions.  The strands were dealt with in that order.  The result was that a framework was not created by the Governments for internal discussions, which unfortunately came to an end without agreement, having gone a long way.  In an effort to be helpful and without wanting to be dogmatic, I suggest that the Governments might put the strands in reverse order to see if they can create a framework in which the other strands could work more fruitfully.  That would have to continue to operate on the basis that nothing would be agreed until everything was agreed, if there was disagreement internally, whatever was agreed in the first strand would not come into effect.</P>
    <P>A slightly contrary point which nevertheless is worth making is that there is a risk in applying to every subject the principle that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.  I have no doubt that agreement could be reached on some things which could be put into effect as a confidence building measure without waiting until the entire picture was painted. We should consider that approach to try to make progress on some specifics because there is a need for people in Northern Ireland to see something useful happening.</P>
    <P>In my discussions in Northern Ireland over the past two days and in my discussions with people on the Opsahl Commission, I was struck by the sense of utter hopelessness and alienation of people <i>visà-vis</i> politicians.  The general public do not see anything happening.  Nothing is changing.  Belfast City Council is the same as it was 20 years ago and the same sorts of resolutions are being passed. That suggests that there is a case for agreeing even a few small things and implementing them rather than waiting until everything else is agreed.</P>
    <P>It is important that we on this side of the Border should recognise that Loyalist violence exceeded Provisional IRA violence in the last year and that Loyalists are on the way to acquiring bomb-making capacity of equal ferocity and terror to the Provisional IRA.  It is worth nothing that more Loyalists have been arrested <Col N="175" /> in the last 12 months &mdash; 180 loyalists as against 110 Provo bombers or gunmen. That indicates that the security response is matching the situation.  That is something that cannot be ignored by those involved in terror or by anybody.  The Provos and the INLA must recognise that things have changed as far as they are concerned.</P>
    <P>I was surprised that the Provisional IRA could have a one week ceasefire when Mr. Bruce Morrison was here.  If they could do that for Mr. Bruce Morrison, why can they not have a one month ceasefire for Mr. John Hume?  I know the objective of the peace talks is the total cessation of violence but surely anybody with intelligence can see that the Shankill bomb blew away the prospects of peace along with the unfortunate people who were killed.  If the IRA could do it for Mr. Bruce Morrison, as a confidence building measure to show that they are serious about peace, they could do it for Mr. John Hume.  I do not have much confidence or trust in the IRA but I put that point to them, if they listen to anything anybody says any more.</P>
    <P>In Northern Ireland there is tremendous war weariness among all the communities. In West Belfast, particularly among the families of prisoners, there is an urgent demand for peace.  I find it hard to know how people at the Unionist grassroots feel about the Hume-Adams process and I have heard contrary views. I have heard that many individual Unionists are very pleased that an effort is being made and that others have never been more angry, upset, insecure or alienated from the rest of this island than they are now.  I do not know what the truth is but it is important that the House should recognise that there is a difference of opinion about this.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Provisional IRA placed a &ldquo;no warning&rdquo; bomb in the Shankill Road may not be a sign of strength. Perhaps they are under such pressure from the security forces that they cannot adopt the targeted activities they adopted in the past and we are seeing an organisation under severe pressure because of <Col N="176" /> increased intelligence being deployed against them.  I hope that is the case.  It is important to recognise that the Provisional IRA is funded chiefly by legitimate activities, not by bank robberies. These apparently legitimate activities include the operation of black taxies, pubs and clubs, not all of which are located in Northern Ireland; some are probably located in this State.  It is essential that we interdict the sources of funds for the Provisional IRA.  That is one of the reasons I have been pressing the Government to introduce legislation dealing with money laundering.  It was obliged to introduce this legislation at the beginning of this year but it has not yet done so.  It seems that the biggest money launderer in Ireland is the Provisional IRA; it is laundering money raised by way of legitimate activities and directing it towards terrorism.  If we can cut off the flow of funds, through effective legislation dealing with money laundering, to various organisations, including the Loyalists who are also deriving most of their income from apparently legitimate activities, we could do more to combat terrorism than the most sophisticated intelligence operations carried out by the Garda and the RUC.</P>
    <P>In my conversations in Northern Ireland I was struck strongly by the confidence that the RUC has in the Garda Síochána in terms of the co-operation received.  This is well recognised and should be recorded in this House.  As I said, the Government can do more.  For instance, they could deal with the money laundering problem.  In addition, a case could be made for setting up a specialist anti-terrorist unit to operate along the Border with a tighter system of command and control which would enable it to match the speed of response and the more plentiful resources available on the other side of the Border.  That might be worth considering.</P>
    <P>I have made a few references already to the Hume-Adams process but I should say that there is a risk that the terrorists, in particular the IRA could be put in a win-win situation.  If the talks fail they will have gained political recognition and <Col N="177" /> acquired a status and a legitimacy which they would not otherwise have had.  If the talks succeed perhaps the Government would start to do the work for them. There is a real risk that the only people who will gain from this process are Sinn Féin.  It is very important, from the point of view of everybody in this House, that nothing happens which could be interpreted as a success for those using terrorism because this House was founded on resistance to it.</P>
    <P>I welcome what the Taoiseach had to say in one passage of his speech.  He said that there can be no question of tampering with the principle of consent as set out in Article 1 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  That is extremely important and it puts the Hume-Adams dialogue in context &mdash; it is a rock of security for everybody living on this island.  This is not the first time the Taoiseach has made this point &mdash; that the Government will not depart from the principle of consent in any circumstances.  I am sure he speaks for the entire Dáil.</P>
    <P>As I said in my opening remarks, I hope in this debate we will try to understand other people's fears.  I would like to comment on the fear of Unionists about this process.  It should be spoken in this House, not inferred.  Unionists are worried that the Hume-Adams process will lead to a situation where the British Government will be persuaded to wash its hands of the problem and stand back from it, that they will be pushed into a position where they will be a permanent minority in the negotiating process; that two years down the road as the negotiations proceed they may find they cannot agree and have to say no.  They are worried that at that stage the British, having washed their hands of the problem two years before, would not be willing to re-engage and that they would be cast adrift on the sea where they would be friendless.  If we put ourselves in their position we should be able to sympathise with their point of view.</P>
    <P>The Unionists also believe that they made a serious effort to table serious proposals about a Bill of Rights to ensure that no legislation could be passed in <Col N="178" /> Northern Ireland unless there was a two-thirds majority.  Effectively this would involve power sharing.  They got no response during the recent talks.  They are fearful that the Hume-Adams dialogue will be used as a means of getting away from an area where progress was being made and the Unionists were making concessions &mdash; but not enough &mdash; and to put more pressure on them, not because of any inherent objections to the proposals they made but to increase the leverage.  This adds to their sense of isolation and they sense that they are being cut apart from the process.</P>
    <P>We should take seriously the suggestions the Unionists have been making about a Bill of Rights.  The concept could be extended to include community and group rights as well as individual rights and the right to political participation. The great advantage is that this is a Unionist proposal.  The sensible response from Nationalists would be to try to use the proposal and advance it rather than simply to say that we should try to put the matter in a different context.</P>
    <P>The Unionists also fear that the process will be used as a means of getting away from democratic accountability within Northern Ireland.  This was true of many of the parties that I met, not just the Official Unionists.  There was a feeling that the assembly had to be the source of democratic and moral authority for whatever executive would operate in Northern Ireland.  There was a fear that what the other parties wanted was an intergovernmental institution which would be considered the ultimate source of authority.  One of the great strengths of parliamentary democracy is that it draws its legitimacy from the people it governs rather than from some remote institution.  They have a strong and valid point in that regard.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I say to the Unionists that they should look carefully at the concept of a dual referendum as suggested by John Hume because it would change the entire context in which the traditional Irish demand for national self-determination is expressed; instead of being expressed in a unitary fashion, it <Col N="179" /> would be expressed in a dual fashion. Two legitimate political entities would express a joint national will to determine their future.  That sophistry is extremely useful in the sense that the problem would be redefined in a context where it would be possible to find agreement, whereas if one continues to define the problem in a unitary concept one would not find agreement.  Unionists should look more seriously than they have to-date at the strong beneficial effects that the dual referendum concept would have and the security it could provide.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier in the debate, we should not hesitate to make small progress on small issues because we have not found the key to the entire problem. We should try to make progress in two areas.  The RUC complaint procedures are not working adequately.  This was very clear in the Opsahl report. Those who make complaints against the RUC are not satisfied.  This is not a reflection on the majority of those in the RUC but perhaps on their superiors who have shown hyper-caution and who, for example, do not want interrogations to be recorded, even though this would be of great help in showing that the complaints in many cases are baseless.  The Government should try to improve procedures in regard to complaints about the RUC and the British Army.  By implication, we should be willing to do exactly the same in our own jurisdiction; we should lead by example, not by prescription in our dealings on this matter.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the Chair's tolerance on this occasion in regard to time, and I do not want to trespass on the time of others. I feel strongly that integrated education has a particularly useful role in Northern Ireland.  Only 1.5 per cent of the school-going population in Northern Ireland attend integrated schools.  I know many of the maintained schools which are nominally Catholic and the State schools which are Protestant are not in fact so but are integrated in many respects. However, much effort should be made on an incremental basis to promote integrated <Col N="180" /> education in Northern Ireland and also to promote joint projects between North and South, particularly in regard to history teaching.  It is only if we change people's concepts that we make progress. One of the most unhelpful concepts is the sense that somehow or other the drift of history is on the side of one group rather than the other.  There are some Nationalists in Northern Ireland who believe that the drift of history, whether it be emanating from demography or some other source, is on their side.  That is a mistake. It leads to arrogance and to misjudgments. There is no drift of history that is on any side.  The drift of history has been against everybody for the last 25 years.  We, as a people, have gone backwards in the last 25 years.  Let us recognise that and try to make a new start.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Every decent and right-minded person is appalled by the sheer barbarity and ferocity of the latest bloodletting and the taking of human life.  No cause justifies such carnage and horror. With over 3,000 people already dead, those who plant bombs and pull triggers must now appreciate that murdering people achieves nothing.  The photograph of nine year old Darren Baird holding his six week old sister, having lost both his parents and his other sister who had gone to buy a wreath for his grand-father's grave, brought home vividly to all of us the horror of what went on in the Shankill Road last Sunday.  It must make all of us, as constitutional politicians, redouble our efforts to find lasting peace on this island.</P>
      <P>It is completely false to speak in terms of creating the conditions for violence to end.  There are no conditions in Northern Ireland which call forth or legitimise violence. Every murder is a conscious and deliberate choice of the killers and the godfathers who direct their operations. None of them can look to any external justification or explanation for their savagery. Their guilt is entirely their own and the decision to end the violence is in their hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everyone in this House is rightly <Col N="181" /> appalled by the frenzy of violence in Northern Ireland and everyone deeply sympathises with all the victims and unreservedly condemns the activities of the murder gangs on both sides.  Likewise, everyone in this House believes in restraint and sees the democratic process as the only vehicle for worthwhile progress in resolving the tragic conflict in Northern Ireland.  There is no disagreement in the Dáil on that issue.</P>
    <P>What would be worthwhile is a debate on the methods open to democratic and constitutional politicians to achieve progress towards a peaceful resolution of the Northern conflict.  That would entail a detailed examination of the content and prospects of the two broad avenues of approach now open.  The first is an attempt to achieve an agreement between the constitutional parties within Northern Ireland, mainly the Official Unionist Party, the SDLP and the Alliance Party who, between them, represent 75 per cent of the people of Northern Ireland and all moderate opinion.  If the DUP wish to become involved in that process, that is a matter for them, but they should not be accorded a veto on that talks process.</P>
    <P>The other possibility lies in what appears now to be the remote likelihood that the IRA and Sinn Féin will renounce violence completely, hand up their arsenal of death and destruction and come into the political process on the basis of ordinary democratic participation. The Hume-Adams process which is addressed to that end has suffered a terrible blow by the clear exposure of the provisional movement's willingness to continue its murder campaign with unrelenting viciousness. Those of us who are willing to go the extra mile to seek out any possible accommodation which would end the killing now know that the provisionals will not renounce violence until they have extracted concessions of principle which are simply not on.  If there were ever any reality in distinguishing between the political intentions of the different parts of the provisional movement, one would expect that Sinn Féin could at least <Col N="182" /> moderate the use of violence by the IRA to create some semblance of calm and some impression of the benefits of ending violence and establishing peace.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's comments on the Hume-Adams talks.  It is important to distinguish between supporting and saluting those who set out to achieve peace and rejecting any report that they might produce.  The Taoiseach has this to say on the Hume-Adams talks:</P>
    <P>However, the creation of the peace process has to be more widely based and to involve the two Governments, conscious of both their international obligations and their wider responsibilities to both communities.  Consistent with these the two Governments must work together to reach a common understanding in their own terms on a framework for peace. Any initiative can only be taken by the two Governments and there can be no question of them simply adopting or endorsing reports of the Hume-Adams dialogue that was recently given to us which we have not passed on to the British Government.</P>
    <P>That is the clearest indication yet of the Government's attitude to those talks, although having read yesterday in <i>The Irish Times</i> comments by Gerry Adams in regard to the Tánaiste, I do not think he is in any doubt about the Government's view of that report.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrates believe that the kernel of a settlement of the Northern tragedy lies in an agreement between the constitutional parties there. As the Tánaiste has stated, the elements of the jigsaw are well known.  The areas of broadly available agreement have been well explored and identified.  The areas on which further compromise and innovative thinking is needed are also obvious.  The Progressive Democrats have a clear view of what must be done to achieve peace in Northern Ireland. First, we must recognise and acknowledge that a lasting peace will not simply happen, nor will it materialise if certain politicians merely repeat, mantra-like, how much they want peace and believe <Col N="183" /> in the so-called peace process.  For peace to come about, Governments and political parties and their leaders must be courageous and generous.  They must take risks and they must be willing to compromise.  That applies to the constitutional parties on both sides in the North.  It also applies to the British Government and, not least, it applies to our Taoiseach and our own Government.</P>
    <P>I passionately believe that the vast majority of the people of this Republic, of Northern Ireland and of Great Britain want their constitutional political leaders to sit down immediately together and to work out the basis for an equitable, balanced and lasting political solution in Northern Ireland in the wider set of relationships between the people of these islands.  From acceptance of that fundamental principle would flow agreement to afford full and equal recognition to the human rights, identity, culture and national outlook of both communities and a power sharing Government arrangement to give institutional expression to this consensus.  Following from that settlement too, and forming an integral part of it, there must also be strong North-South institutional links formally and fully to reflect the Irish identity and aspirations of the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland, which would represent no more and no less than the North-British links that reflect the identity and national allegiance of the Northern majority community.</P>
    <P>Without closing any door irrevocably on any prospect for peace, serious politicians must concentrate their efforts on viable and realistic political goals rather than illusory and secretive deals which do not correspond to political reality.  It is not enough for somebody merely to say they want to be part of the peace process and refuse to condemn violence. That seems a fundamental contradiction in the thinking of Mr. Adams.  It seems strange that somebody should carry the coffin of a person who planted the bomb and yet say they want to be part of the peace process.  People keep telling us <Col N="184" /> things are different in Northern Ireland, but some things are the same.</P>
    <P>I welcome some of the other comments from the Taoiseach.  He said: &ldquo;I would like to repeat there can be no question of trying to predetermine the future or to impose any particular kind of political settlement, which must be left to negotiations between democratic Governments and the constitutional political parties.&rdquo;  I certainly welcome that statement. The Taoiseach went on to say: &ldquo;There can be no question of tampering with the principle of consent, as set out in Article 1 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement&rdquo;. I also welcome that statement. Unionists have a right to self-determination, and we respect and appreciate that.</P>
    <P>I disagree with some of the Taoiseach's comments, for example, on the need for complete confidentiality.  I respect that a Government, in negotiating a successful outcome in relation to the difficulties in Northern Ireland, must do so in secret. However, there is a difference between negotiating in secret and informing constitutional parties, particularly their leaders, of the contents of the Hume-Adams report.  Given what is happening in Northern Ireland, so much secrecy is unacceptable.  It is unacceptable that we do not know what is in the Hume-Adams report while members of the Provisional IRA and the Army council do, as do many members of Congress in the United States.  I regret that the Taoiseach has not been forthcoming in briefing Opposition speakers.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable too that on the other side the British Government has done a secret deal with the Unionist parties.  I hope that nobody's short term political future will jeopardise peace on this island, the possibility of a settlement within Northern Ireland and a solution that involves North-South relations and east-west relations.  We have all had enough.  Twenty five years after the troubles started there are 3,000 people dead.  People of all persuasions, no matter how intransigent they may have been previously, want to see an end to the violence.  The message that must go <Col N="185" /> out to the men and women of violence is that we have had enough, that we want to see peace on this little island.  Peaceful solutions are being found in countries all over the world and it is not too much to expect that it can happen here too.</P>
    <P>I would like to see more openness and more generosity from the Government in relation to Articles 2 and 3.  While I welcome the Taoiseach's comments in relation to the forthcoming legislation on extradition, it is ludicrous that there is a distinction between the use of automatic and non-automatic weapons and that some murders can be regarded as political offences.  That is not acceptable in this day and age.  It is three years since those loopholes have been pointed out to the Taoiseach and his party and I very much regret that we have not yet seen the legislation.  I hope it will be introduced soon and I assure the Taoiseach and the Government that my party will ensure a speedy passage of that legislation through the Oireachtas.  We need to do this to show our good will, to show the people who are trying to move forward on all sides that the Government is not going to be intransigent and that in no sense is the Government going to play politics or delay on this matter.</P>
    <P>I welcome these statements today.  I am pleased we do not have to divide on the issue.  I felt it necessary to put down an amendment to the Government motion because I believed it did not go far enough.  If we had proceeded with the motion in its previous form there would have been a vote.  It would have been dishonest of me not to put forward my party's position on these matters.  We can give the Government and other politicians the benefit of the doubt, but in politics that is not good enough; we have to put forward concrete proposals.  The Tánaiste, as Minister for Foreign Affairs, should spare no effort to bring together the constitutional parties in Northern Ireland because until such time as the forces of moderation come to an agreement, unfortunately there will always be an excuse for the men of violence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking in this <Col N="186" /> debate due to the enforced absence from the House of my party leader, Deputy De Rossa, who has made valuable and consistent contributions over the years in relation to peace and democratic politics on this island.</P>
      <P>On behalf of Democratic Left, I join in the expressions of sympathy with the victims of the Shankill bombing, with the victims of the subsequent reprisal killings and with the victims too of the one-by-one, tit-for-tat sectarian slaughter which preceded Shankill.  I renew here again my party's deep compassion with all the victims of the long quarter century of death and violence on this island whether they be Catholic or Protestant; murdered by loyalist or nationalist terror gangs, or indeed by the security forces; and whether death and injury came to them <i>en masse</i> like Shankill, Warrington or Enniskillen, or in the solitude of their own house or on a country lane.</P>
      <P>Once again, this House on behalf of the citizens of this State unites to abhor the massacre, to condemn the violence, to hope for peace and to urge political action, but why does it have to take yet another obscene massacre to bring us a discussion in this House on the worsening situation in Northern Ireland.  Since the Dáil reconvened at the beginning of this month, my colleague and party leader, Deputy Proinsias De Rossa, rose every day to ask for a debate on Northern Ireland; for this House to be informed of the Government's position on the Hume-Adams talks and for us as democratically elected representatives of the people to be enabled to discuss Northern Ireland. Does it not speak volumes that the Government ignored the requests of Members of this House for more than three weeks and acceded not to a debate but to a series of statements on Northern Ireland only after the terrorists had spoken through their bombs and bullets? Does this not raise the most fundamental of questions as to who is setting the agenda on Northern Ireland &mdash; the terrorists or the democratic politicians?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Shankill bomb attack on Saturday last was one of the most appalling sectarian outrages perpetrated over the past <Col N="187" /> 25 years of conflict.  It is hard to think of a more murderous and provocative act that the detonation of a huge bomb in the heartland of Protestant Belfast, in a Shankill Road crowded with women and children on a Saturday lunchtime.  Certainly not since the Enniskillen massacre in 1987 has there been a single act so deliberately designed to deepen the divisions within Northern Ireland and fan the flames of sectarian hatred.  The IRA either went into the Shankill Road with the aim of inflicting the maximum number of civilian casualties possible, or else they went in pursuit of their target with total disregard for the civilian casualties that would ensue.  The end result was the same.  The motive of the IRA makes no difference to the dead and will provide no comfort for the mutilated and the bereaved.</P>
    <P>The hypocritical statements of regret on the part of the IRA leadership and the phoney expressions of concern on the part of Gerry Adams will be treated with the contempt they deserve by the majority of decent people on this island, particularly as his real loyalty was demonstrated by his active presence this morning at the funeral of one of the bombers. What the events of last Saturday show is that despite the attempts by themselves, and others, to impart an artificial aura of political respectability on their organisation, the IRA is just another sectarian murder gang, no better or no worse than the loyalist murder gangs who have been waging such a murderous campaign against innocent Catholics.  The Provos knew only too well that an act like this was certain to provoke a response from Loyalist murder gangs, as inevitably it did, with the murder of four more people over the past few days.  It is part of the perverse strategy of the Provos.  They attack in the knowledge that this will in turn provoke further attacks on Nationalists, which will allow the Provisionals to masquerade as the defenders of Catholic areas.</P>
    <P>The events of the past few days clearly show that Northern Ireland stands on the brink of a sectarian abyss that could <Col N="188" /> bring violence on an unprecedented scale.  We must all be aware of the dangers of &ldquo;talking up&rdquo; the current conflict, but it would be equally dangerous to ignore or to downplay the gravity of the situation.  Whole communities are being subjected to a reign of terror as the murder gangs target people because of their religious backgrounds or simply because of where they live.</P>
    <P>It must now be clear to all rational people that whatever remote hopes there might have been that the Hume-Adams talks might lead to peace they lie buried in the rubble of Frizzells fish shop on the Shankill Road.  When the Hume-Adams talks first came to light last April, my party warned that there was a real danger that, far from bringing peace, they could lead to even greater violence.  Unfortunately this is exactly what has happened, with loyalist gangs driven to a new murderous frenzy, while the IRA continues to murder and destroy as it has done for more than 20 years.</P>
    <P>We have never disputed John Hume's intentions or his personal commitment to peace, but we have challenged his judgment in embarking on discussions with Gerry Adams and particularly the wisdom of agreeing common policy positions with the political leader of an organisation that continues to murder and maim.  Despite his best efforts, John Hume has clearly been unable to convince Gerry Adams and his colleagues in the Provisional leadership that the mass murder of women and children is not a legitimate tactic for advancing their cause.  In addition, the failure of Gerry Adams to unequivocally condemn the Shankill bombing raises very serious questions about what Mr. Adams has described as his &ldquo;personal commitment&rdquo; to peace.  The strongest word Mr. Adams could summon up to describe the dismemberment of women and children was that it was &ldquo;wrong&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The end result of six months of Hume-Adams talks has been an intensified Provo campaign of violence and a new political arrogance on the part of Mr. Adams.  Mr. Adams rebukes the British Prime Minister for being &ldquo;rude&rdquo; and he <Col N="189" /> now talks about the agreement between himself and John Hume as &ldquo;the Irish peace proposal&rdquo;&mdash; although the Irish people have never been consulted and the Irish Parliament is still unaware of its contents.  The only development that might have rescued the Hume-Adams process in the aftermath of Saturday's outrage would have been an immediate Provo ceasefire.  There is no evidence of this and the renewed Provo bombing campaign in Britain over the weekend indicates that they intend to persist with the tactics that brought such carnage to the Shankill Road on Saturday.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said last night that the latest round of tit-for-tat murders must not be allowed to dictate the political agenda.  The tragedy is that this has already happened.  The Provos have been allowed to murder and bomb their way into negotiations with the leader of the largest constitutional nationalist party in Northern Ireland.  The policy position of which Mr. Adams is joint author is, apparently, regarded as being worthy of serious consideration by our Government. This has given Mr. Adams and his colleagues a political influence they have never enjoyed before.  It allows Mr. Adams to say: &ldquo;If you accept my conditions, I will go to the Army Council and urge a ceasefire&rdquo;, the unspoken, chilling threat being, of course, that if you do not accept Gerry Adams's conditions, there will be more violence, more Enniskillens, more Warringtons and more Shankill Roads.</P>
    <P>Mr. Adams has gained much from his talks with Mr. Hume.  He has gained a degree of political respectability and a centre stage position.  Such is the yearning for peace that the Hume-Adams talks have been treated with benign neutrality by the Irish and British Governments and have elicited signals from Unionist politicians that, in certain circumstances, there was a place at the negotiating table for Sinn Féin.  What has Mr. Adams contributed to this process?  What has he given?  Why must peace be the result of the process rather than the basis for building new relationships on this island? Why is there no ceasefire?  Either Mr. <Col N="190" /> Adams does not want one now, which would certainly show where he stands, or he cannot deliver a ceasefire, in which case what is the point in continuing to talk to him?</P>
    <P>We are all for peace.  As the Taoiseach said last week: &ldquo;Peace &mdash; who is not for peace?&rdquo; But how do we get peace?  We appear to be constantly waiting &mdash; waiting for the Unionist leaders to come back to Dublin, waiting for the Hume-Adams talks and waiting for the gunmen to give up violence.  All the while we are waiting, the toll of deaths continues to mount.</P>
    <P>Surely it is the task of democrats to take the initiative in a climate where democracy and tolerance are being swept aside by hatred and revenge.  What are we going to contribute to the peace process? It is time for plain speaking and for an end to fantasy solutions which lead nowhere except to the graveyard for more men, women and children.  Neither side is solely to blame for the failure of the inter-party talks last year and neither side is exempt from a share in the blame. All sides should reject recriminations about last year's failures and agree to wipe the slate clean and start anew.  I agree with Deputy Harney that our task as democratic politicians is to see in what way we can contribute to the process of peace.</P>
    <P>At the recent party conference of Democratic Left, Deputy Proinsias De Rossa set out a new democratic agenda for peace which could rally democrats, both North and South.  Some of the principle features of the democratic agenda for peace were: a commitment by all participants to establish democratic government institutions in Northern Ireland; agreement to alter our Constitution, including an alteration to Articles 2 and 3; the recognition that Northern Ireland has a right to continue to exist within the United Kingdom; a Bill of Rights that would guarantee equality of citizenship in Northern Ireland and recognise the fundamentally mixed basis of Northern Irish society and politics, and a programme for the regeneration of the Northern Ireland economy, linked to cross-Border institutions to enhance <Col N="191" /> economic, social and environmental co-operation.</P>
    <P>He also suggested a number of initiatives to encourage the paramilitaries to come in out of the cold and to promote the de-escalation of military activity by both legal and illegal forces.  Bearing in mind that there is a war weariness in Northern Ireland, Deputy De Rossa's proposals included the accelerated releases of prisoners, an amnesty for activists who reject violence, a period during which weapons could be surrendered without penalty, reduced security force activity in areas where paramilitaries cease to operate and civilian observers from the CSCE to reassure communities in flashpoint areas. This democratic agenda could provide the basis for discussions between the democratic parties in Northern Ireland and for co-operation between the British and Irish Governments, because it starts from the basis of reality and does not seek devious routes either to a united Ireland or greater integration with the UK.</P>
    <P>The ordinary people of Northern Ireland can make their contribution by rejecting the culture of sectarianism and by taking a stand against all those in their communities who advocate, promote or engage in violence.  In the end, primary responsibility rests with the democratic politicians.  Above all, we have to face reality.  Northern Ireland is a real entity and the settlement of its conflict has to be internal to Northern Ireland.  There is no settlement without an internal settlement and grand constitutional arrangements between Governments are meaningless unless they can deliver peace between the divided communities in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is time that we in this House unambiguously rejected unrealistic political demands which are based on grand notions of nationhood, however expressed &mdash;&ldquo;national self-determination&rdquo;, &ldquo;a united Ireland&rdquo; or &ldquo;union within the United Kingdom&rdquo;.  These are the lofty dogmas which hijacked the modest campaign 25 years ago in Northern <Col N="192" /> Ireland for civil rights and equality of treatment within the Northern Ireland state.  Let no one suspect that young Loyalist or Republic terrorists are contemplating complex concepts of nationhood as they set out on their missions of murder.  They are driven by nothing more than raw hatred and revenge.  It is the lofty national or ethnic concepts, often crafted by polite intellectuals in the comfortable environment of a university common room or a television studio, which provide the cause for the continuing murder.  What begins as an aspiration in Donnybrook can often end up as an atrocity on the Shankill Road.</P>
    <P>The agenda on Northern Ireland must no longer be set either by the gunmen of whatever origin or by those with unspoken objectives.  It must now be set by those who want peace and who are prepared to give up aspirations in order to achieve it.  The time to replace old slogans has long passed.  Pearse's slogan that &ldquo;Ireland unfree will never be at peace&rdquo; has left us with more than 3,000 graves but without peace the people of Northern Ireland can never be free.</P>

      <P>I wish first to put the record straight.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs has met on two occasions in recent weeks to discuss in detail the Opsahl report.  Deputy Proinsias De Rossa has made a major contribution at these meetings.  There has been a democratic input by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs on this matter in recent weeks.  I welcome Deputy Bruton's proposal that this debate should deal with the need to come to grips with the situation and we should avoid rhetoric.  Rhetoric in regard to personalities, individuals or group, serves no purpose in this matter.</P>
      <P>There has been serious instability in Northern Ireland for 25 years and there is no point in dealing with the politics of the last atrocity.  Rather we should deal with the politics of the future, of where we are going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="193" /> I welcome in particular the principle enshrined in the Taoiseach's statement that a political settlement must be left to the negotiations between the two democratic Governments involved and the constitutional political parties.  I welcome also the further statement that there can be no question of tampering with the principle of consent as set out in Article 1 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  That is important because it is a guarantee to the Unionist community in Northern Ireland that no settlement, however it is arrived at or however it is structured, can be reached without their consent.  That is fundamental to the whole process.</P>
    <P>The next important aspect of the process is to achieve a permanent cessation of violence.  That is essential.  There is no point in the democratic political leaders and the two Governments engaging in what they see as fruitful talks if the violence continues, if the paramilitaries are rampant on each side.  The first and fundamental aim must be to achieve peace, to persuade the leaders of the paramilitary groups that the only way towards peace is through political dialogue and to bring them in from the cold of extremism and violence to the democratic way of approaching problems.  That is precisely what John Hume has been engaged in with Mr. Adams in recent months.  He should be congratulated and not condemned in any way for his courage and his integrity in pursuing that aim in a selfless manner which is his outstanding characteristic.  That dialogue must be maintained because unless the Provisional IRA cease its violence on a permanent basis there cannot be meaningful political discussions.</P>
    <P>I appeal to people of a constitutional frame of mind, leaders of the Unionist constitutional parties, to do likewise with Loyalist paramilitaries and to seek talks with them so that there can be an end to their assassinations while, at the same time, the Provisional IRA ceases its bombings and outrages.  That is the sensible way forward and we should attune our minds to the fundamental reality that even though ultimately it will be constitutional politicians and the two constitutional <Col N="194" /> Governments who will arrive at the ultimate settlement of this matter, the settlement cannot have any meaning until there is a cessation of violence on the part of the paramilitaries.  The paramilitaries must be approached by people of the calibre of John Hume and people of similar calibre on the Unionist side to cease their mindless and hopeless violence.</P>
    <P>That is the backdrop to the problem and nobody should be condemned for making an effort on either of these two tiers, the tier of making contact with the men of violence to achieve a cessation of violence and the tier of engaging in political talks with all constitutional parties and with the two Governments.  The two processes run parallel but the cessation of violence is the more essential of the two because any progress made by the constitutional elements in this equation will be nugatory and ineffective unless there is a cessation of violence on the part of the paramilitaries.</P>
    <P>There is no point imputing a contradiction into this debate.  There is no contradiction.  If one examines the issue closely there is a clear interface between the approach being adopted by John Hume to Mr. Adams and the approach that I hope will be adopted by the Unionist constitutional leadership to their paramilitaries. There is an interface between that and the ultimate objective of having the constitutional parties involved North and South and the two Governments in London and Dublin come together to reach a final settlement of this matter.</P>
    <P>That is the only way forward and we should not be deterred by the appalling events of the weekend.  They are appalling but they should not divert us from what should be a positive approach and a positive way forward.  No matter how hopeless the scenario may appear to be, that must be the only sensible approach in this situation.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that there is a fundamental strength in the three strand approach that was adopted by the two Governments in their discussions with the other constitutional parties last year. Deputy Bruton advanced the idea that <Col N="195" /> perhaps one element of the three strands could be discussed before the other two. That may be progressive thought and might be put into action, but they are all part of the problem and, with respect to Deputy Gilmore, there is no point in isolating one from the other.  The internal solution to the problems of Northern Ireland is linked to the relationship with the Republic because the community in Northern Ireland that is part of the internal problem, the Nationalist community, have an allegiance to the rest of Ireland.  That is part of the problem and, therefore, we cannot separate in any way the internal political problem in Northern Ireland from the problem of the relations between Northern Ireland and the Republic.  Of course, the two sovereign Governments, London and Dublin, must be constantly involved, for obvious reasons and the strengthening of Anglo-Irish relations must continue to be of paramount importance to provide the underlying guarantee and support for whatever agreement is eventually reached.  They are the three strands and I do not believe they can be disentangled. They are essential in any rational view of the problem.</P>
    <P>It is important to mention that as a result of the Anglo-Irish Agreement there has been tremendous co-operation between the two Governments.  They have never been closer in their approach to the problem and there is total security co-operation between the two Governments, particularly between the RUC in Northern Ireland and the Garda in the Republic.  I saw that developing as cochairman of the Anglo-Irish Conference and I believe it has been one of the major successes of the Anglo-Irish Agreement. However, at the end of the day, regardless of how close the security operation, regardless of how the two sovereign Governments co-operate and regardless of what agreement is reached between the constitutional parties, the two Unionist parties, the SDLP, the Alliance Party and all of the constitutional parties down here, it will be all to no avail unless the paramilitaries end their violence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="196" /> Yet there are voices here who would discourage legitimate politicians who are not involved in Government from approaching these paramilitaries to achieve a cessation of violence.  It all fits into a legitmate picture where every constructive step must be followed and there must be a total mobilisation of all leadership in these two islands at political level, at church level, at trade union level, at public opinion level and at a media level. There must be a complete example of leadership which is geared to one objective, namely, to obtain a cessation of violence and so impose on the men of violence, through the persuasion of public will, the overwhelming compulsion to get away from the totally arid policy that they have pursued for the past 25 years.  Anybody who can achieve that, or who appears likely to achieve that, should not be discouraged but should be encouraged.</P>
    <P>I do not mind if there are failures or if people who approach the Provisional IRA or the Loyalist paramilitaries do not succeed in their endeavour.  I welcome the fact that they are trying to achieve something. We must continue in that direction because a cessation of violence must be the secure foundation on which to create the environment for legitimate constitutional politicians, who abhor violence, to work together with the encouragement of the two sovereign Governments to achieve a lasting peace and democratic structures in the North, between North and South and between this island and the neighbouring island, lasting democratic structures to which the public in all parts of this island and in Britain can give adherence and support. That is where we want to go.</P>
    <P>Much of that is already written into the Opsahl report &mdash; aspects like a basic charter of rights, like partnership government within Northern Ireland, like co-operation between North and South on a permanent institutional basis; aspects like continued co-operation between Britain and Ireland to sustain whatever agreed structues are there under whatever negotiated formula arises from discussions. Much of that is already <Col N="197" /> contained in the Opsahl report, can be considered in detail and, in my view, could form a useful discussion document when talks resume.  I hope when talks resume &mdash; I will not even contemplate that they will not resume &mdash; they will pursue a more constructive path than the talks which unfortunately did not work out last year but which at least brought parties together for the first time.</P>

      <P>It is very clear at this stage that this debate is a useful one.  Of course, it is all too brief, with us talking about sharing time, having less than five minutes.  Since I am sure many others in the House want to contribute we are willing to share time.  Nonetheless, it does indicate that in the future the Government should adopt a change of approach in relation to these debates.</P>
      <P>While it is quite correct that the Government should not disclose to the House secret diplomacy or terms of negotiations, there should be transparency about the policies of the Government. Indeed, such debates in this House would afford an opportunity for such transparency and constructive debate on those policies.  To be honest about it &mdash; I shall pass this point very quickly &mdash; it is a bit much for a Member of this House to have to accept that we are not privy to the report on the Hume-Adams dialogue when it is made available to people in this country like the IRA.  I would hope the Government would understand our sense of frustration in such circumstances. Yet we shall endeavour to be as constructive as we can within the limited time and weighting available to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me say first that my visit to Belfast over the past couple of days with Deputy John Bruton did convince me, if I needed to be convinced, of the real fear and tension felt by all sections of the community <Col N="198" /> in Northern Ireland.  In expressing heart felt sympathy for those who have been victims let us not forget that every man, woman and child in Northern Ireland is affected, that all of them are either victims or potential victims.  Therefore our sympathy, support and solidarity must be with all the people of Northern Ireland, who have been on the wrack of violence for the last 25 years.  Our sense of solidarity must not begin and end with expressions of sympathy and motions of condemnation of violence.  We have Northern Ireland centre stage today.  Let us ensure for the future that Northern Ireland is given the utmost priority and undivided attention of the Government and of the Members of this House until such time as we see a just and acceptable political settlement.  Until that is achieved it is difficult to foresee an end to violence.  Even with its achievement there may remain some rump elements who will, no matter what the terms, refuse to accept any settlement.</P>
    <P>Of course, the objective must be to get the broadest possible consensus in support of a settlement and the complete isolation of such extremists.  In that context it is relevant to ask: where stands Sinn Féin in relation to a settlement? It represents about 10 per cent of the electorate.  Its leaders might be surprised at the number and political background of people who said to me that Sinn Féin should be part of a settlement; yet all were unanimous in rejecting any discussions with them unless and until they completely end their support for violence.</P>
    <P>We must have the greatest understanding and sympathy for all the constitutional parties who are trying to preserve the political process under such present difficulties.  It is very easy for us from afar to make judgments and cast aspersions on their words and actions. But since all of the pressures on them are so intense, the wonder is that they are able to maintain a semblance of political normality at all.  That is why I have been pressing the Taoiseach so hard to have discussions with the Unionist parties. Again, despite his denial of my reference <Col N="199" /> to the frosty reception given the Unionists in Dublin last year, let him be in no doubt that that is how it was perceived in Unionist circles.  Therefore, it behoves the Taoiseach to make it absolutely clear that there is a red carpet welcome for Unionist leaders if they come to see him. I do not think a mere general reference to an open door is a sufficient approach on the part of the Taoiseach at this stage. There is ground to be made up and he should know it.  The Taoiseach should waste no time in making up that lost ground.</P>
    <P>Even in these dark days I think there are a few hopeful signs around.  There are some bones of a settlement there. There is some evidence of movement. There was the movement on the part of the Taoiseach in relation to Articles 2 and 3.  There is the commitment in relation to extradition.  I tabled a Bill before this House three years ago with a view to closing those loopholes.  Let us have no more promises on that; let us produce the Bill.  I was heartened by the references in Northern Ireland and the acceptance that security co-operation is now at a very high level.  While Deputy John Bruton mentioned a few ways in which it might be improved, it is encouraging to hear that acceptance.</P>
    <P>Finally, let me say that I think the follow-up here should be a full meeting between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister, not just on the margin of the EC Summit on Friday next, which would amount to perhaps only ten minutes or half an hour.  They need a full meeting and need it quickly.  I would suggest that thereafter there should be the follow-up of an unrestricted debate in this House to afford us all ample opportunity to debate the issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very conscious that this debate takes place at a time of high anxiety in Northern Ireland.  I am conscious also that we must be very careful about what we say here.  Having said that, I honestly believe that much of what we have heard in this debate so far is the same old candy floss that the people of <Col N="200" /> Northern Ireland, the Republic and of Britain have heard over years, ineffective candy floss.  We have had 25 years of violence, yet we are having paraded before us the same old response, as Deputy McGahon said, the same platitudes.</P>
      <P>First, I am very glad that we do have an Anglo-Irish Agreement.  I am grateful to Deputy Brian Lenihan for having praised it, even though he worked very hard against it when it was agreed initially. But the Anglo-Irish Agreement is an agreement between the two Governments and has greatly improved the relationship between those two Governments. There is need for a similar agreement between the two communities in Northern Ireland.  For example, under the terms of the Anglo-Irish Agreement we can see the adept handling of this grave crisis by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Sir Patrick Mayhew, in all his public utterances whether in the House of Commons or on radio or television.  I want to congratulate him on that and offer my thanks.</P>
      <P>I want to make the point very briefly that the Taoiseach's statement that he has not handed over the proposals or principles of the Hume-Adams talks to the British Government is simply not credible.  Sir Patrick Mayhew has been saying the same thing, but both beg credulity. We have Mr. Hume and Mr. Adams seeking an urgent response.  Yet Mr. Hume ran off to America before giving our Government those proposals, but returned after ten days or so and then gave them to the Government.  Now we hear that the British Government have not got these proposals, yet that Government is being asked for an urgent response.  That is not credible.  The fact of the matter is that neither the Taoiseach nor the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Sir Patrick Mayhew, is telling us the whole truth nor can they inspire confidence in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is entirely appropriate that this debate should take place.  It is entirely appropriate, too, that we should suspend even the motion of no confidence in the Government because of the seriousness <Col N="201" /> of the present position.  I also want to make the point that I share the very high regard in which Mr. John Hume is held. Mr. Hume has earned that respect.  But I have to say that I believe the Hume-Adams talks are wrong.  I believe they will lead to a cul-de-sac and I will tell the House why.</P>
    <P>First, it is self-evident that anything that bears the fingerprint of the IRA will be met with a very severe reaction on the part of the Unionist community, even without the atrocity of last Saturday having happened.  The Unionist community will not react in a way that sets up the IRA, and/or confirms them as being at the centre of events.  Second, seeking a pre-condition of a permanent ceasefire from the IRA is tantamount to asking the IRA to go out of existence, because if there is a permanent ceasefire there will be no need for an IRA.  They are not going to go out of existence. Third, these talks give the impression that the IRA will be at the centre of events, somehow will play a pre-eminent role, over and above that of the Irish Government and of the SDLP.  Of course, that cannot be.  For those reasons I believe the initiative has been mistaken and somebody in this House has a duty to say so.</P>
    <P>We have had 25 years of deaths in Northern Ireland.  In 1971 a hamfisted attempt at internment was tried by the British Government, without consultation. That grave mistake has set back much support for the policy of internment. I should like to repeat what I said on a previous debate on Northern Ireland about four years ago.  Internment is an evil proposition but it is a lesser evil than taking the lives of people day in and day out.  Internment has to be on the agenda, given the havoc which has continued in Northern Ireland for so long.  It does not have to be done in the dark of night or by way of a big round-up but rather it must be under the auspices of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, it must be fairly executed and on both sides of the Border in both communities.  Otherwise, if we do not seriously consider that proposal, as de Valera and the former Taoiseach, <Col N="202" /> Mr. Charles Haughey did, we are engaging in candyfloss and more people will die on the streets of Northern Ireland and elsewhere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Mitchell that words in this House can cost lives in Belfast and Northern Ireland today, tonight and tomorrow.  I should say at the outset that there are no easy solutions to this problem.  If there was a quick fix solution to the problem we would have found it before now.  The first thing we must understand is that the problem has been around for centuries. No matter what proposals emerge between the Governments the people in Northern Ireland must creep before they walk.  Dramatic improvements cannot be achieved overnight.  A solution or a compromise between extreme Unionists and Nationalists cannot be achieved if both insist on being right.  The only way forward is through some compromise or on middle ground.  As far as I am concerned, people come first.  James Connolly once said: &ldquo;Ireland as distinct from her people means nothing to me&rdquo;.  I agree with that aspect of Connolly's philosophy. We must bear in mind that people come before territory, land or property.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, we in this House and in the Republic often see the Northern Ireland problem through a very narrow perspective.  Most parties in this House are chips off the old Sinn Féin block. The term &ldquo;Sinn Féin&rdquo; means &ldquo;ourselves alone&rdquo;, it is not inclusive, it is exclusive. The Minister's own party, Fianna Fáil means &ldquo;soldiers of destiny&rdquo;.  I have difficulty in working out a translation of Fine Gael but I think it means &ldquo;a tribe of the Gael&rdquo; or &ldquo;people of the Gael&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that what it means?  It can be very difficult for people in Northern Ireland to understand those titles. We have never said that in this House. Sinn Féin would have meant anathema and death to Unionists from Northern Ireland in 1922 because they were <Col N="203" /> involved in free trade.  They were exporting to Britain as it was part and parcel of the economy of the United Kingdom. They were involved in linen, shipyards and so on and were not concerned with tariffs and import duties but rather with being part and parcel of their economy and their future.  In many ways the partition was brought about by the economic realities of the time, by the uneven development of business and capitalism in this country.</P>
      <P>Since he became Tánaiste eight months ago, Deputy Spring has been attempting to create space for new dialogue.  Unless we have new proposals the answer will not be found.  We must have new thinking on this problem and the Tánaiste's ambition has been to create dialogue and space in which people can find a way forward through compromise.  Unless we have compromise and tolerance no answer will be found to the problem.</P>
      <P>I will not funk the issue of the Hume-Adams talks because that would be an evasion of reality.  I understand the fears of both the Irish and British Governments about these talks and about being manoeuvred by the principles that emerged from the talks into an untenable and difficult position.  The fear of the Irish and British Governments is that they will be manoeuvred by the principles that have emerged from the talks between Gerry Adams and John Hume into a position they cannot defend because of the pressures which will build up.  I am opposed to anybody being manoeuvred along those lines.  I believe in hope, democracy and compromise.</P>
      <P>What is involved here is an attempt to square a circle because on the one hand there is extreme Unionism and on the other hand there is extreme Nationalism and both cannot have their way.  We must try to find a formula which will accept the rights of Unionists to remain within the British state.  They must be allowed to remain British in the same way as the Scots are Scottish and British and the Welsh are Welsh and British and, on the other hand, to respect and enshrine the rights of Nationalists to a United Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="204" /> That ambition and that aspiration must also be enshrined in whatever formula will emerge.  That is at the very basis of the problem and unless we can find some formula to accommodate those two viewpoints we are speaking in riddles and not dealing with reality.</P>
    <P>I hope representatives of the two Governments will meet on Friday and consider the principles before them from the Hume-Adams talks and that they will issue a statement following that meeting. I would ask that those principles be made available to us for consideration.  So far as the Labour Party is concerned we want peace and compromise with justice and equality on both sides.  We do not claim domination over anybody &mdash; that is not our ambition in the labour movement.  In the international movement our ambition is to see peace, tolerance, compromise, co-operation and good will between the two communities.  We want consensus and good relations, co-operation and friendship between the Unionists and Nationalists in Northern Ireland not violence, intimidation or blackmail.  No cause can justify laying bombs in streets in Northern Ireland, in the Republic, in London or in any part of Britain, in pubs, hotels or elsewhere.  That is totally wrong.  Mowing people down with a machine gun is totally wrong.  My party will always stand against that type of intimidation.  Neither it nor sectarian violence will achieve anything.</P>
    <P>It makes no sense in today's world to shoot people on the basis of their religion.  It is totally wrong and it has nothing whatsoever to contribute to finding a solution to this problem.  The violence of the past 25 years has achieved nothing whatsoever.  It has polarised communities more than had been the case 25 years ago.  It has damaged our economy.  The Minister concerned informed us that Border security is costing us £134 million per year.  How we can quantify the loss in tourism, industry and jobs?  These people are not patriots, they are damaging ordinary people on both sides of the divide.  One cannot attempt to quantify the loss in revenue and lives which has taken place over the past 25 <Col N="205" /> years in Britain, Northern Ireland and here.  The reality of the modern world is this: if you cannot force your way by force of arms you must attempt to achieve consensus through dialogue and through working together.  The reason I came to the House this evening was to bring that message.</P>
    <P>These are bleak and dark days of fear and death.  As public representatives we cannot shirk our responsibilities. We cannot run away from the issue no matter how unpleasant.  We have a duty to contribute to finding a way forward and we must offer hope and goodwill to the people of Belfast city and Northern Ireland.  We must reach over the sectarian barriers to ordinary people on the ground of all religious persuasions.  They must live and work together to achieve common objectives.  We must reach across the gunmen to ordinary people to find an answer to this problem.  One side achieving victory and dominating the other is not the answer.  We must find a compromise, a middle ground between extreme Unionism and extreme Nationalism.  Above all, we in this House must turn our face against sectarian intimidation and violence.  The bombing and shooting we have seen in Northern Ireland has no place in a democratic society.  In the past the gunmen have ignored our appeals but the time has long passed when violence could accomplish a solution to this problem.</P>
    <P>As chairman of the Labour Party, I want the message to go out loud and clear that there is no place on this island for sectarian violence.  I appeal to all concerned to work out a solution and above all I appeal to the Government to respond to the Hume-Adams proposals and to make them available to us next Friday so that we can see what is contained in them.</P>

      <P>I too was in Northern Ireland over the long weekend but on family rather than political business.  Fear and foreboding, to an extent I have not encountered before, except possibly in the &ldquo;murder triangle&rdquo; at the height of the sectarian assassination campaign in the mid-seventies, is widespread in both sections of the community.  There is also, I am happy to say, a greater commitment to peace among ordinary people than I have ever detected before.  There is nothing more powerful than an idea whose time has come and it is possible that now is the time for peace.  No praise is too great for all those members of political parties who are committed to the constitutional way forward.  Members of this House do not know how lucky they are in not having to operate under the pressures on politicians in the North. The pressures on John Hume are almost intolerable and denigration by a section of the media here does not help.  Apart from the pressures on him, the pressures on councillors in his party, and on the ordinary men and women and their families living under threat, should underline for us the price being paid for a commitment to peace.</P>
      <P>I have not seen the so-called Hume-Adams plan, but I was a member of the SDLP team who negotiated with Sinn Féin in 1988.  In the two statements emanating from the Hume-Adams dialogue, I detected words and phrases which I remembered from that time.  Indeed, some of these words and phrases could not have appeared in the statements unless matters which had been a source of disagreement five years ago, had been clarified.  That is a matter for hope.  I have noted with particular interest the expression of confidence by John Hume that the principles agreed on represent the best chance for lasting peace in 23 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two essentials if progress is to be made.  First is the consent of the Unionists on anything relating to their constitutional future, their right to say no as well as their right to say yes.  One of the hallmarks of Unionism over the years has been the no surrender mentality, <Col N="207" /> based on the proposition that if they gave an inch they would be forced to concede a mile.  That attitude has been reinforced by recent developments and their fear is that everyone is ganging up on them, the SDLP, Sinn Féin, the IRA, the Irish Government and elements in both the US and Europe and possibly even in the British Government.  In these circumstances and in the aftermath of the Shankill Road there should be no room for suspicion in the Unionist mind that we would approve of a situation where they would be coerced into unacceptable constitutional arrangements.</P>
    <P>The second essential is the cessation of violence.  No Government will enter into any arrangments with Sinn Féin without a permanent cessation of violence and it would be an insult to the Unionist community to suggest that their representatives should negotiate with Sinn Féin while their constituents are being murdered by the IRA, particularly after the Shankill Road murders.  If the IRA has, as it claims, a vested interest in peace, it should end its murderous and self-defeating campaign immediately.</P>
    <P>I have always been a supporter of a bipartisan approach to Northern Ireland. That remains my position, but I have some criticisms which I offer in the most constructive way possible.  Any chance of agreement depends on the Irish Government showing the generosity promised by successive Governments to the Unionists but which was so clearly missing when they courageously came to Dublin last year.  I did not understand, and I said so publicly, why the Government had difficulty with the words &ldquo;would and could&rdquo; in relation to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution.  If the Government had shown a willingness in the talks with the Unionists to amend, change, subsume Articles 2 and 3 in a wider agreement, I understand from what they indicated since that much more progress would have been made.  Generosity should mean generosity.</P>
    <P>I understand why the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs felt it necessary to signify a mark of respect to the <Col N="208" /> Unionist community after the butchery of the Shankill Road but I believe the decision to postpone the meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference was a mistake. Terrorists should not be able to dictate the political agenda.  The best response to that atrocity would be to bring forward the meeting but certainly not to postpone it.  The politics of the last atrocity is not the best basis for political action.  I hope this Government will make it clear that terrorists of whatever ilk will not be allowed to dictate the political agenda.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach had some careful comments to make about the Hume-Adams dialogue when he said:</P>
    <P>Any initiative can only be taken by the two Governments and there can be no question of them simply adopting or endorsing the report of the Hume-Adams dialogue, that was recently given to us and which we have not passed on to the British Government.</P>
    <P>I think I understand what this language means and if so I agree with him, as no Government can hand over its functions to others, and particularly to one so closely associated with paramilitary activity.  The British Government clearly does not want the parcel although they know what is in it, whatever they might say.</P>
    <P>Principles are to be subsumed.  It is stated that the Irish Government has been working for some time on the elaboration of a formula for peace.  I believe that is the way forward, but I stress that whatever the Government is going to do, there is now an urgency about it.  People talk about a &ldquo;window of opportunity&rdquo;. There is a very small window here and it is the responsibility of both the British and Irish Governments to seize the initiative now and take it from the men of violence.  The situation in Northern Ireland is so critical that quick action is required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague for sharing his time with me.  I join with others in expressing my abhorrence at events in Northern Ireland over the week-end and at many events over the <Col N="209" /> past 25 years.  We are dealing with a great many frightened people on both sides of the divide in Northern Ireland.  Each community is terrified of the paramilitaries on the other side.  That need not be the case.  I think politicians have a lot to answer for in opportunistically exploiting people's fears.  I do not think we should be afraid to say that the hardline Loyalist politicians by their attitude and intransigence have caused almost if not as much of the misery and suffering in Northern Ireland as the Provisional IRA and Sinn Féin.  Mr. Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Féin has disgraced himself most of all in recent days.  He disgraced and contradicted himself today by taking part in a peace process while condoning and supporting the people carrying out the atrocities.  Such action must be condemned.  If we are to have peace talks and a solution to the problems in Northern Ireland, we will have to depend on people with greater courage and integrity than Gerry Adams. However, he is probably one of the most frightened people on this island, probably even more frightened of those in his own element than those in the opposition. We must tell the Paisleys, the Molyneauxs and the other hardline Loyalist politicians that we have had enough and that must be the voice of Thirty-two Counties.</P>
      <P>Both past and present Loyalist supporters must tell those people they have had enough of their diehard stances.  We must depend on moderate Unionists such a Ken Magennis and people in the Alliance Party and the SDLP.  People in the Twenty-Six Counties must stop the double talk, particularly in respect of Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution.  We have heard a great deal of such talk in the past year from the Taoiseach in this Chamber in refusing to give a commitment to hold a referendum to remove Articles 2 and 3.  I accept that would not bring an end to the problems in Northern Ireland, but it would at least give an indication of our goodwill for openness. We must start by taking that stance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Bruton stated earlier, we should have adopted a policy on integrated <Col N="210" /> education 25 years ago.  The Opsahl report is excellent and should be debated in depth in this House.  It states that integrated education is an integral part of any solution to the problems in Northern Ireland.  It proposes that people of both persuasions should be educated together as is the case throughout the world, irrespective of colour, race or creed.  It is a damning indictment on us that we have not been able to adopt a policy on integrated education.  I was saddened to hear at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs only four weeks ago that the leaders of the various Churches, the Methodist, Presbyterian and Church of Ireland, were willing to discuss the question of integrated education with the members of the Opsahl committee, but when they asked the Roman Catholic authorities to discuss the matter, their request fell on deaf ears. They were given to understand that they were not welcome and that the matter was not open for discussion.  There are faults on all sides.  We should not condemn people in any one specific area except, of course, the paramilitaries.</P>

      <P>I too, am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this debate on Northern Ireland.  This House should reflect on the horrific events in Northern Ireland in the past few days and consider their implications for finding a basis for lasting peace and stability on the island of Ireland, now a more urgent challenge than ever before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within the grim litany of atrocities we have seen over the years in Northern Ireland, the slaughter visited on the innocent men, women and children as they went about their business on the Shankill Road last Saturday stands out as an act of exceptional cruelty.  We are numbed by the cynicism and depravity of those who would plant a bomb in a crowded shopping area at the busiest time of the week.  The certainty of that attack causing <Col N="211" /> death or serious injury to a large number of innocent people in the vicinity was clearly a matter of complete indifference to those who perpetrated and planned it. It was an act with few precedents in the contempt which it displayed for the most basic of human rights, the right to human life.  The dreadful violence which has been directed at innocent members of the Nationalist community in the wake of the Shankill bombing has shown an equal disregard for human life.  Each of the murders or attempted murders which took place this week added to the toll of suffering for ordinary families in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is crucial that people on both sides of the divide should exercise restraint at this difficult time.  Despite the enormity of the provocations they have suffered, it is a time for the most careful reflection on the consequences of violent retaliation. The further escalation of sectarian violence will serve only one purpose, it will reinforce the barriers of fear and hatred which already divide the two communities and make an already tense situation infinitely more difficult.  All of us in this House express our deepest sympathy to those whose loved ones were the victims of this week's terrifying spiral of violence.  We want to spell out in the clearest possible terms that violence is wrong and is abhorrent to the overwhelming majority of Irish people.  It is a profound violation of the right of the people living in this island, North and South, to determine their future on peaceful and democratic terms.  It is the most formidable obstacle to the realisation of the dreams we all have, both North and South, for a future characterised by lasting peace, reconciliation and stability.</P>
    <P>The Government has set out on the road towards that future and we will not be deflected from it by acts of violence perpertrated by paramilitary organisations on either side of the divide.  We have chosen the path of political dialogue because there is no alternative path to peace.  Our companions on the way are those who are prepared to abide exclusively <Col N="212" /> by the political process.  The condition for participation is, and will remain, a clear and definitive renunciation of violence as a means of pursuing political objectives.</P>
    <P>The approach of the Irish Government is to work through the political process with the British Government and the constitutional parties in Northern Ireland for a resolution of the differences which afflict this island.  The only way forward is through peaceful discussion of our problems and a collective effort to find answers acceptable to all.  There is, and can be, no alternative to political dialogue. The only agreement which can be of any value is one into which all the participants in negotiations enter freely and without pressure or coercion of any kind.  No other approach offers any chance of producing arrangements for this island which will bring lasting peace and stability.</P>
    <P>Article 1 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, which was referred to by a number of speakers, makes crystal clear the acceptance by the two Governments of the principle of consent as the basis for any change in the status of Northern Ireland.  That is a key component in the Government's position and one which is endorsed without hesitation by John Hume and the SDLP.  Those who have expressed fears about the Hume-Adams talks should reflect on the full implications of that shared commitment.</P>
    <P>As the Taoiseach stated clearly, the achievement of peace is a top priority for the Government.  From the day it took office we have dedicated ourselves unremittingly to the pursuit of peace and stability through political dialogue.  We have worked in every way possible to bring about a process of dialogue which might lay the foundations for a fair and honourable accommodation between the two traditions in Ireland.  The Programme for Government made clear that in entering such dialogue we would address comprehensively all the relationships involved in an open and innovative spirit, ready to discuss every issue and to incorporate all agreed changes.  We will use the process of dialogue to work <Col N="213" /> towards an accommodation between the two traditions in Ireland based on the principles set out in the report of the New Ireland Forum.  The Government's willingness to bring goodwill and flexibility in the search for a lasting political solution has been impressed on all the other participants in the process.</P>
    <P>It is hoped that the tragic events of the past few days, which have sent a shiver of trepidation throughout this island, will impress on those who are as yet uncommitted to a resumption of dialogue the importance of making the earliest possible progress towards that solution.  The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste have made it clear that they attach the highest political priority to establishing a basis for a just and lasting peace and a permanent cessation of all violence.  That is the context in which the Government has been evaluating the position which John Hume conveyed to us following his talks with Gerry Adams.</P>
    <P>Both the Irish and British Governments have a moral responsibility to do all in their power to facilitate the achievement of lasting peace and stability throughout these islands.  That responsibility is taken very seriously by both Governments and is a central element of our relationship.  There is no question but that the Shankill bombing has dealt a severe blow to the hopes vested in John Hume's talks with Gerry Adams.</P>
    <P>The lessons to be learned from the events of last weekend have yet to be absorbed fully.  However, one lesson is immediately clear.  Those responsible for the Shankill bombing must explain to the Irish people how we are to understand their professions of commitment to a peace process.  In this instance actions speak much louder than words.  Since last Saturday there is considerable scepticism about the degree of real commitment within the Republican movement to the purported objective of a peace process.</P>
    <P>As both the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste made clear, the Government wishes to see a total and permanent cessation of violence as a prelude to any peace process.  We are determined to work in every way possible to translate <Col N="214" /> into reality the desire of the overwhelming majority of Irish people, North and South, for lasting peace and stability.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>In the time available I will convey my thoughts on Northern Ireland. Looking back on the history of Ireland and Britain I cannot help but notice that every time Nationalists or other politicians left the Houses of Parliament violence broke out on the streets.  That happened when the old Nationalist Party stopped going to Westminister.  It started during the Treaty debates.  When Deputies who opposed the Treaty left the House civil war broke out.  During the decades when Northern Ireland was under Stormont rule every time a Nationalist MP left Parliament there was street violence.  When Westminster prorogued Stormont the UDA came on the streets for the first time to deal with street violence.  Therefore, we cannot ignore the fact that there is a relationship between not having a local parliament and street violence.</P>
      <P>The sooner there is a local parliament or an assembly in Northern Ireland the better.  It is the responsibility of the politicians in the North to establish structures of government that will help both sides govern themselves.  That means that the talks must start.  If we wait any longer for the talks to start what will happen?  The British Government's performance in Northern Ireland during the past 25 years has not been successful.  It has been holding the middle of the ring to prevent a civil war.  If there was no British presence there would be a blood bath.  There is evidence that is the case without my making the argument.  Neither the Protestant nor the Catholic communities are satisfied with the British security policy. The Catholic community blame the Southern Government for not co-operating with the Protestant community on security policy.</P>

    <P>I do not wish to dictate to people who are in a difficult position in Northern Ireland, living in different circumstances to people in the South.  Those who criticise John Hume should ask themselves what they would do in similar circumstances. <Col N="215" /> The difficulties with which he is confronted puts him in a different category to us.  If his talks with Gerry Adams are successful he will be the uncrowned king of Ireland, but if they are unsuccessful he will have to carry the can.  Judgment on the talks process should be delayed.  It depends on one's background whether one is in favour or against the Hume-Adams talks.</P>
    <P>The talks must start.  If they do not start, the British Government must realise that its security policy is not effective for a number of reasons.  It cannot secure Northern Ireland without the full co-operation of the Irish Government and the security forces on this side of the Border.  That must be acknowledged.  I know many members of the RUC.  They are good Christian men.  They are trying in difficult circumstances to be the force of law and order.  However, it is seen by the Catholic community as being Protestant and is not accepted as the force of law and order.  I question whether John Hume, the SDLP Party or any other party in the North could get Catholics to make up 40 per cent of the police force or the Northern Ireland regiment.</P>
    <P>There is an obligation on the British Government to protect the lives, limbs and properties of every individual, both Catholic and Protestant, in Northern Ireland.  Its security is weak to the extent that it cannot provide protection in the Catholic areas because the Catholic community see the RUC as a Protestant force.  It is regrettable that this is the case because many members of the RUC are trying in difficult circumstances to be honourable people and in many cases they are succeeding.</P>
    <P>Where does the answer lie?  The British Government will not be able to change matters in the next 25 years.  They will be no different to the last 25 years unless it obtains the full co-operation of the Government on this side of the Border. I see the future of Ireland as based on security, political renewal and economic co-operation in a new arrangement between the British and Irish Governments. If the British Government wish us to play <Col N="216" /> a full part on the security front it must recognise that we must have a political input.  The Catholics and the Protestants in Northern Ireland must be told that they must talk about security and political renewal.  The Protestant political leaders will talk about security but not political renewal.  The Catholics will talk about political renewal but not security.  Both must talk together about security and political renewal.  This Government must talk about economic co-operation; and if that means parity with Sterling the sooner the better, because we want trading between communities North and South of the Border.</P>
    <P>I do not see any option other than shared responsibility between Governments to ensure the protection of the lives, limbs and properties of people living in Northern Ireland.  That is the sole responsibility of the British Government. It is failing in its responsibility in that it needs our co-operation to meet its responsibility.  Therefore, I ask the Government to negotiate with the British Government on their shared responsibility to provide protection and stop the present violence.</P>
    <P>I do not believe in internment. However, if any one challenges the authority of the British or Irish Governments to share responsibility in respect of Northern Ireland, they should be told bluntly, in unambiguous language, that if they do not behave themselves, whether in the North or South, they will be locked up and will be released when they behave themselves.  They will be well treated while interned.  The Northern politicians who say they will not share responsibility should be told it is not our choice to share responsibility for the governing of Northern Ireland &mdash; we would prefer them to do it &mdash; but the politicians have the obligation to find the political structures to govern Northern Ireland.  If they cannot agree those structures, regrettably the only option is shared responsibility.  I hope the politicians in Northern Ireland find another solution.</P>

      <P>On Saturday afternoon I was visiting a zoo in Berlin when I heard <Col N="217" /> the news of the massacre in Belfast.  My first reaction was a sense of shame and my second was to wonder how Irish people living abroad felt when a massacre on such a scale occurs in their home country. Nearby a German said &ldquo;Irish scum&rdquo; and I could not blame him.  I hung my head. As someone who has had a grandstand seat and witnessed atrocities in Northern Ireland during the last 25 years, I do not believe there is any solution.  The gulf between Unionism and Republicanism is similar to that between a husband and wife who cannot live together.  Their aspirations are irreconcilable and the sooner that is recognised the better.  In that context I must criticise the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  At the time it was initiated it was a laudable document. With the passing of time it has become a disaster, a recipe for much of the trouble that has occurred in the last seven years. We are now reaping the inevitable consequences of the seeds sown in that document which excluded the Unionist voice and gave notice of further impositions on Unionist people, who number one million.  The rhetoric and bull which I have heard here in Northern Ireland debates over the last 11 years would make a stairway across the Irish Sea.</P>
      <P>The hard reality is that aspirations and appeals for peace and vigils are fruitless. Rhetoric is useless when people are being killed on such a scale.  Over 24 years 4,000 people have been buried and over 100,000 people have been injured; many having lost limbs and sight.  We need realistic measures to prevent the North of Ireland being turned into a slaughter house, and that is why internment, objectionable though it might be in normal society, is a possible answer, along with capital punishment.  People who murder on the scale of the IRA and the UVF should not be allowed to live.  They are the scum of the earth and they bring shame on our country internationally. Tough measures must be introduced. Repeated appeals for peace are pointless. The pope came here in 1979 and they did not listen to him.  They are not likely to listen to platitudes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Adams's action tonight in carrying <Col N="218" /> that coffin is not a peace signal to the Unionist community.  Mr. Hume was correct in talking to him but following the holocaust on the Shankill Road last Saturday, he should suspend those talks immediately and talk to the people who matter, the moderate Unionists who have indicated their willingness to talk to constitutional parties.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGahon told us where he was when the dreadful news of last Saturday's bombing broke.  It is a bit like the assassination of President Kennedy in that many people remembered exactly where they were at the time of the tragedy.  I was addressing a group of Tipperary emigrants in London when this tragedy occurred.  Such tragedies affect all sorts of people far removed from the immediate area.  We must remember that in mainland Britain innocent English and Irish people are often confronted with bombs, bomb scares and inconvenience and it is only when one is part of it that one realises how serious the situation is. It is very serious for both the British and Irish Governments and for all constitutional politicians.  The weekend events have been among the most horrific ever witnessed here.  The Saturday bombing and the attacks which it triggered have led to the bloodiest period in Northern Ireland history.  The victims of these massacres come from both sides of the community.  There is naked sectarianism on both sides.  Television and newspapers have carried pictures of children orphaned by people who in order to secure self-determination believe that it is legitimate to bomb and maim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The events of the weekend have further undermined the Hume-Adams peace initiative.  This initiative was on the periphery of dialogue that was going on elsewhere.  Many people were optimistic as to the outcome but last weekend the Provisional IRA made the prospect of reaching a solution much more difficult <Col N="219" /> to achieve.  The bomb and the bullet are not the instruments of peace and cannot help a peace initiative.  The only way to a lasting peace is through consensus and dialogue.  Peace achieved through force will not last.  That aspect was dealt with in the Opsahl report.  Neither side has the power to veto the other, so a forced solution would sink in the sand on which it was built.</P>
    <P>Since the formation of this Government, the Tánaiste, Deputy Dick Spring, has worked at developing contacts and relationships across communities and with the British Government.  He has put the North of Ireland at the top of his political agenda and at the top of the Government agenda and has repeatedly said that lasting peace can only be achieved through consensus.  What future would we have if even a tiny majority believed that violence should be used to secure a political aim?  The use of violence to achieve an end would do a grave disservice to future generations. Although this week has been one of the cruellest and most dreadful weeks in our history it tells us that we must continue to work for peace and not be put off our endeavours by the men of violence. Peace can only be achieved by negotiation.</P>
    <P>Those who want to achieve peace must lay down their arms so that we can have peaceful dialogue which will take on board the views of the different traditions in the North.  We cannot tolerate people who justify the use of violence in order to obtain peace.  This Government will remain committed in its opposition to men of violence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher (Laoighis-Offaly) Mr. Gallagher (Laoighis-Offaly)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this debate which is taking place in such sad circumstances.  In the past I consistently declined to enunciate a position on Northern Ireland.  I approach the subject with much interest and with some experience, having been involved for a number of years in youth and community work in Belfast in Nationalist and Unionist areas with Loyalist and Republican <Col N="220" /> people and with young people from the city of Belfast and from my own area in the midlands.  My views are formed by my experiences in that area.  From that background I find the happenings of Saturday and of yesterday most tragic as I know both areas quite well.  Indeed, one of the groups with whom I worked closely is situated on Kennedy Way.  I made contact with them yesterday morning and learned that the community there is confused, bewildered and outraged.</P>
      <P>One other point is that we should avail of every opportunity to promote the concept of integrated education, not necessarily by scrapping immediately the present structures, to allow young people in places such as west Belfast, in particular, White Rock and Rathcoole, to meet, mix and socialise with young people from other communities.  I found when I brought young people from that city to the Republic, Holland or Germany that they quickly discovered they had more in common than they thought, that they formed relationships and got on very well together.  However, on their return this was brought to an end very quickly.  We should avail of every opportunity to promote the concept of integrated education.</P>
      <P>Democratically elected politicians, North and South, must provide leadership. Something must be done in an effort to break the logjam.  In this regard, I support the efforts being made by John Hume to break the logjam on the Republican-Nationalist side.  No party has done more, particularly at election time, to fight Sinn Féin than the SDLP, yet John Hume has the courage to engage in this process which may or may not work.  We should not condemn those who are trying to achieve what we all want to achieve, which is to get the paramilitaries to lay down their arms.  We should avail of every opportunity to get them to do this. I appeal to Unionists and to their democratically elected politicians to seize every opportunity on their side to do the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people have drawn an analogy between Northern Ireland and what is happening in South Africa.  In South <Col N="221" /> Africa, people who held diametrically opposed views had the courage to move from fixed positions.  I say to the Unionist leadership in Northern Ireland that if they show courage we will support them, that if they argue their case and put their goods in the shop window we will take this into account.  If they show courage and take on the men of violence on their own side I can assure them, as a democratically elected politician on this part of the island, that I will be open, understanding, flexible and accommodating.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to say a few words in this debate or series of statements, brief though it is.  I should start by saying that my party and at least one other in this House tried for several weeks to have a debate on Northern Ireland but we were told that this was not possible because there were very sensitive matters which could not be disclosed to this House and that a debate would be held at some future date.  Lo and behold, a debate is being held today which I suppose is welcome but most people are of the view that this debate is being held because bombs went off in Belfast last Saturday and there have been reprisals.  That is not the real reason; it is only the superficial reason.  The real reason this debate is being held today is that a motion of no confidence in the Government was tabled and was due to be taken today.  This is an admirable counter attraction to divert attention from the matters which led to that motion of no confidence being tabled.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that it is only at times like this and in circumstances such as these, following a series of atrocities, that a debate is held here.  We are not unique in this.  Last Friday there was a debate on Northern Ireland in the House of Commons. They do not wait for atrocities to happen.  I saw some of it on television last Friday night and only a handful of members were present.  On Monday when the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland had to deal with the tragic and barbarous events that occurred during the weekend the House of Commons was full.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="222" /> Should we ask ourselves, as Deputy Harney and Deputy Gilmore did earlier in this debate, who is making the running? Is it people like ourselves who are democratic politicians and want to stick to the constitutional path or is it those who reject this?  The truth is that it is the latter.  I, the leader of my party, Deputy Harney, and others like us in this House are not to be trusted with any information about what arose from the discussions that took place over a period of six months between Mr. Hume and Mr. Adams.  As someone who stood in this House and bore the heat of the day from the Provisional IRA and their fellow travellers 23 years ago this year, the brunt of it from the side of the House and quite a bit from behind my back, I resent the fact that I cannot be trusted while Mr. Adams, Mr. McGuinness and the members of the Army Council of the IRA can be trusted and given all the details and issue statements approving it. The first people to be briefed, before the Irish Government or anyone else, were the people who made the decision to place the bomb at 273 Shankill Road last Saturday.  They are the people who are given priority while Members of this House who are committed to democratic and constitutional means to change and improve the position on this island are brushed aside because we are of no consequence. For those who choose to follow that path that is a very slippery one indeed.</P>
    <P>As we stand here to take part in a meaningless debate to discuss a matter hidden from us, we should ask ourselves what is the effect of dealing with a proponent of violence who refuses to refute or abandon violence.  If one deals with and gives credibility to such a person, one is encouraging those of a like mind or ilk on the other side of the divide in Northern Ireland to adopt the same procedures and process.  They will say that Gerry Adams is being half accepted both in this country and throughout the world as some kind of quasi-statesman, not because he has a democratic mandate but because he represents at the political level those who have resorted to violence <Col N="223" /> for over 20 years and who have killed and maimed thousands of people.  Is this not an encouragement to others to follow the same path and is it not an extremely dangerous course to take?  Is it not untrue to say that if an initiative of that kind fails nothing will have changed?  I think it is untrue to say that because a great many things will have changed if it fails.  This may well happen.</P>
    <P>On a number of occasions I have asked in his House for the appointment of a Minister with sole responsibility for Northern Ireland.  At the beginning of this month when the House reassembled, I put down a Question to the Taoiseach asking if he would consider doing that and giving some of the reasons I thought it was vital, as a result of my own experience particularly last year at the talks in Stormont, in Dublin and in London where I saw the absolute necessity of having somebody from the Irish Government who had no other distractions. Curiously enough, a Cheann Comhairle, you ruled out my question on the grounds that the Taoiseach had no responsibility in the matter.  If the Taoiseach does not have responsibility for appointing Ministers, who does?</P>
    <P>I avail of the brief opportunity afforded by this debate to reiterate to the Taoiseach and to all parties in this House the vital necessity of having somebody dealing with nothing except Northern Ireland.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, who at present has responsibility for Northern Ireland, has responsibility for a myriad of functions, including talking, not terribly successfully it seems, to the President of the European Commission at 5.30 in the morning and getting matters rather confused, to say the least, with very serious consequences for this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I tried to say at the outset, today and tomorrow are inextricably interlinked and if the British Government regard Northern Ireland as <Col N="224" /> of sufficient importance to have a full-time Secretary of State and six or seven parliamentary secretaries, it is not asking too much that the Government of the Republic should have at least one person who has no other responsibilities to take the Northern Ireland brief.  The necessity is brought home to us in the vivid carnage, in the blood of people, when we see the events of the last weekend.  Even if last weekend never had happened, my suggestion is valid and should be acted on to show that we are serious and will commit ourselves full-time to finding a solution.</P>
      <P>Finally, I endorse the suggestion by Deputy Harney that if there are some who will not take part in a democratic dialogue, let us leave them aside for the moment at least and let all men and women of goodwill from parties of goodwill who are prepared to take part in a dialogue sit down and enter into that dialogue.  How many more times must the people of Northern Ireland go through not just what they have gone through in the last week but in the last 22 or 23 years?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley's party has made much of the fact that they are not being allowed in on the negotiations and the text of the documents on the Hume-Adams talks.  I would like to remind him that negotiations in the two outstanding areas of conflict, South Africa and the Middle East, have been carried on behind closed doors.  In the Middle East they have been carried on in a different country without any of the opposition parties having anything to do with them and I think, and I hope Deputy O'Malley would agree, that they are beginning to reach a reasonably successful conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>James Connolly once remarked that Ireland without its people meant nothing to him.  The proclamation he signed in Easter Week called on people not to dishonour the Republic by cowardice and inhumanity.  The perpetrators of the Shankill Road massacre are guilty of sickening hypocrisy by claiming to act in the name of that Republic.  If the slaughter <Col N="225" /> of women and little children is not cowardice and inhumanity, what is?</P>
    <P>It is equally nauseating to hear Loyalist gunmen claim that they are defending the Protestant religion by murdering innocent Catholics, and it was frightening to hear them announcing last weekend that they would avenge the Shankill by targeting the entire Catholic community. There have been over 20 such murders in the recent past and no single one has attracted more than minimum publicity.</P>
    <P>I happen to believe that the eventual unity of Ireland, in one form or another, would be the most productive outcome for everybody on this island.  However, like Deputy Currie, I am well aware that the majority of people in Northern Ireland would not agree with me, and that is their right.  I would like to think that one day they may be persuaded to change their minds, but I will never tolerate a situation where any human being's life is forfeit simply because he or she holds a particular opinion.  Right now we must pay more attention to the feelings and the welfare of the people of Ireland and less to the interminable arguments about territory.  The feelings of people include a sense of belonging to one tradition or another.  It is surely possible to accommodate both but it will probably take at least a generation to wipe out the bitterness of the past 25 years.</P>
    <P>It makes me sad that after 25 years of murder and mayhem some politicians are still coming out with the same sterile old statements and all kinds of preconditions before they will be prepared to talk to anybody.  Meanwhile people are dying on the streets of Belfast and elsewhere.  How can one justify this attitude to the bereaved families of the victims of Provo and Loyalist killers?  The latest convenient bogey-man is Mr. John Hume. Like the rest of us, he was aware that for years the countless appeals and condemnations from politicians were completely ignored.  Eventually he decided to reach out to at least half of the equation of violence.  He began to talk at length to the leader of Provisional Sinn Féin in the hope that he could persuade him that <Col N="226" /> murder and destruction serve no purpose whatsoever.  The credentials of Mr. John Hume are unquestioned except by those of opposite extremes.  He always argues his case with devastating logic, and it is already clear from the joint Hume-Adams statement that the two men have reached quite a remarkable consensus.</P>
    <P>The statement signed by Mr. Adams clearly acknowledges that any agreement must have the consent of the Unionist and Nationalist communities.  This is a giant step from the old &ldquo;Brits Out &mdash; wrap the Green Flag around me &mdash; United Ireland&rdquo; solution which took little account of the wishes of Unionists.  This statement, together with the guarantees from both Governments, endorses the position that the majority of people in Northern Ireland must give their consent to any new arrangement and that every party at the conference table must have renounced violence as a means to a political end.  We have to ask what some Unionist politicians are afraid of when they say they will not talk to Mr. Hume or anybody else representing the Nationalist community.  I would like to see Unionist politicians of the calibre of Mr. Ken Magennis, Mr. Martin Smyth, Dr. Ian Paisley or our own Senator Gordon Wilson talking to the UDA leadership in the same way that Mr. Hume is doing with Mr. Adams.  A complete cessation and renunciation of violence on both sides will clear the way for calm deliberation. No one has ever been killed by talking.  In the present circumstances he who refuses to talk is clearly saying that he is incapable of compromise, even if it means the saving of countless lives and the well-being of children yet unborn.</P>
    <P>The late Mr. John Healy had little time for the &ldquo;play safe&rdquo; politicians whose idea of leadership was &ldquo;there goes the mob, I must follow&rdquo;.  It sometimes takes great courage to provide real leadership without looking over one's shoulder.  This is the type of leadership recently shown by Martin Smyth and John Hume.</P>
    <P>My message to Mr. Adams at this time is to show his good faith by doing his utmost to persuade his friends in the Provisional IRA to bring an immediate end <Col N="227" /> to their campaign without any preconditions. If the Loyalist paramilitaries refuse to follow suit, I do not have to spell out where the sympathies of Great Britain and the rest of the world would lie.</P>

      <P>In reply to what Deputy O'Malley had to say, I think it would be morbid in the extreme if we were to debate the Structural Funds today in the light of the situation pertaining on our island in the past few days.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley indicated that a Minister for Northern Ireland Affairs should be appointed by the Government.  Yet I did not see that point in the Programme for Government which he put in place with Fianna Fáil a number of years ago.  During a Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs discussion I called for the establishment of a Northern Ireland committee. It is time such a committee was set up so that from time to time issues of importance in relation to the two islands could be debated.  I compliment two of the elder statesmen in this Chamber, Deputy Lenihan and Deputy Harte, on their contributions and the views they have expressed.  I do not think this debate is worthless, as one or two speakers said. It is an extremely good debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McDowell and myself, together with one or two other Deputies recently attended the British-Irish Association Conference.  Deputy McDowell and I were members of a working group of that conference which discussed whether the situation is such in the North that people are crying out for action from the politicians.  I was astounded by the reaction of some very distinguished and supposedly expert people on Northern Ireland affairs, <Col N="228" /> people from within Northern Ireland, who said the position in the North is not bad enough to warrant such action. Parallels were drawn with the position in Israel and South Africa and it was stated that if these countries can come to terms with their problems why can we not do the same.  I wondered why we were debating the matter if the position in the North was not bad enough to warrant action.  I wonder do the people who made these statements at the time feel the same way, given the events of last weekend.  It is incumbent on every elected representative on this island, particularly in the South, to constantly seek a solution to the Northern problems.  I compliment the Fine Gael Party for going across the Border and meeting with people on both sides of the divide.</P>
    <P>Today I took part in a debate with a Unionist from a neighbouring constituency of mine.  I am co-chairman of the British-Irish interparliamentary body and it has come to light that the UK is discussing the establishment of a select committee to try to appease the Unionists. Yet the Unionists will not partake in the British-Irish interparliamentary body which was set up not by the two Governments but by the two Parliaments.  Even though many Unionists believe in a British-Irish forum, they refuse to participate in the interparliamentary body. I suggest that the Taoiseach and John Major, who will meet next Friday, should encourage the Unionists to join the British-Irish interparliamentary body before a select committee is put in place. That is the ideal forum for them at which to articulate their fears and aspirations with backbench Deputies from the Republic and Members of Parliament from the UK.</P>
    <P>Much of the blame for the problems on this island rests with successive British Governments.  I was astounded at the suggestion in Mrs. Thatcher's book that at some stage there was talk of redrawing the Border.  Thankfully somebody advised that such a course of action should not be taken.  That would be almost akin to what is in Article 1 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement which, in my <Col N="229" /> humble opinion, is a fallacious article in that it states that the day there is 50 per cent plus one in favour of a United Ireland we will promote, in both Houses of Parliament, legislation to bring that about.  I would not like to be around the day that happens because the Unionists, rather than being a majority in the Six Counties, will be, against their wishes, a minority on the island.</P>

      <P>In a very compressed debate such as this it is impossible to set out fully any line of thought.  Therefore I will refer to what I said in this House on 1 April last on these issues in volume 429, columns 79-85 of the Official Report.  I stand by the views I expressed at that time, one of which is that the two fundamental political aspirations in Northern Ireland are irreconcilable, neither one can be realised without dashing the other.  I am strongly of the view that we should stop trying to square that circle because that enterprise is impossible.</P>
      <P>The idea behind the three strand talks which broke down last year was that the agreed outcome would be simultaneously put to a referendum of the people on both sides of the Border.  In that way the intention would be to make it clear that terrorists have no mandate on any part of this island.  That idea was first developed by Mr. John Hume, and its force is immediately clear and evident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="230" /> The problem, however, is to know what question to put to the people.  If the question leaves open, appears to leave open or can be represented as leaving open the possibility of a United Ireland, even at some unspecified date in the future, the likelihood is that there would be a majority for that question on this side of the Border and a majority against it on the other side.  If, on the other hand, the question put to the people maintains, appears to maintain or can be represented as maintaining the union of Northern Ireland with Great Britain, the likelihood is that there would be a majority against that question on this side of the Border and a majority in favour of it on the other side.  I am less sure about that than about the first question, but on balance it seems that would be the case. Therefore answering either of those two fundamental questions, or any of their many variants, will not solve the problem.</P>
    <P>Politicians who are elected to find solutions to political problems must then ask, if it is impossible to find a way forward by answering either of those questions, which seems to be the case, what is possible?  I expressed my view on this matter on 1 April last.  Since then we have had the views of the Opsahl Commission and their reflections on the evidence it heard North and South of the Border and elsewhere.  I was gratified that the commission, not because it agrees with me but because it is a sensible way to proceed, developed a good deal further along the line of thinking which I put before this House last April.  I will quote from the Opsahl report which, if we take note of it, might result in a worth-while solution.  It states:</P>
    <P>It is evident from the views submitted to the Commission that a parliamentary system of government based on the Westminster model, with its emphasis on majority rule, is not a suitable model for the governing of this fundamentally divided society.</P>
    <P>In Northern Ireland, as currently constituted, notions which may be discarded are that:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="231" /> (a)  Northern Ireland is like any other part of the United Kingdom;</P>
    <P>(b)  the communities in Northern Ireland will agree to independence;</P>
    <P>(c)  the United Kingdom will withdraw from Northern Ireland under pressure of violence;</P>
    <P>(d)  the Republic of Ireland will renounce the aim of Irish unity;</P>
    <P>(e)  Irish unity is a realistic prospect in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>It also appeared from what we heard and read that:</P>
    <P>1.  Majority rule in Northern Ireland, whether simple or proportionate, is not currently a viable proposition.  The Nationalist Community has no obligation to agree to it and has the critical mass to prevent its imposition.</P>
    <P>2.  The Unionist community will not accept an administration for Northern Ireland that gives an executive role to anyone outside the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>Those statements are unchallengeable in any political analysis.  The Opsahl Commission came to the conclusion that:</P>
    <P>The task of creating a government for Northern Ireland within the limits described above should not be beyond the realm of the possible and the practicable. In essence, we consider that provided that Irish nationalism is legally recognised in Northern Ireland, a government of Northern Ireland should be put in place, based on the principle that each community has an equal voice in making and executing the laws or a veto on their execution, and equally shares administrative authority.</P>
    <P>This government should be free to discuss and negotiate its relationships, institutional and other, with the Government of the Republic of Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is in the context of that exposition that we should seek to find &mdash; and where, I <Col N="232" /> believe, we would find &mdash; fruitful ground for action by the Governments and the constitutional parties.  It is only in the context of an agreement on a formula such as that set out by the Opsahl Commission that we will find a practical means &mdash; not perhaps an ideal means &mdash; of making it clear that the people of this island want to live in peace and reject the use of murder and terror to achieve any of their aims.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I have to say that any solution or attempted solution which is based on an effort to vindicate either one of the fundamental political aspirations in Northern Ireland seems to fatally lack the conditions required because it will not achieve the agreement which is needed in order to make it possible for constitutional politicians to say beyond any doubt or gains say that the terrorists have no mandate.  It is time we started looking along those practical lines for a solution and stopped chasing dreams which are unrealisable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard the solution to the problems in Northern Ireland as the ultimate challenge to democratic politics on this island.  If peace is to be achieved on this island, ultimately it has to be achieved between the Nationalist and Unionist communities.  There is some common ground between those two important traditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I spent the last two days in Belfast as part of a Fine Gael committee and I have to say that I was saddened and appalled by the conditions in which the people of that city have to live.  Equally, I was humbled by the courage and energy displayed by people involved in democratic politics in Belfast and Northern Ireland generally.  These people live in terror every day and night.  This puts into context the scale of the measures required to bring about a resolution of this problem. Just as the gunmen on both sides of the divide have brought their actions to a new horrible level, the engine of democratic politics must respond at the highest level. The Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister must bring this issue to the centre of the political agenda.  There is <Col N="233" /> a deal of common ground between all parties and traditions in this conflict and it is on that common ground that foundations must be built which will eventually enable the men of violence on both sides to be dealt with through the democratic process.</P>
    <P>When one looks at the faces and into the eyes of the people on the streets of Belfast one can see the fear with which they live.  It is sad that Irish people should have to live in fear of the wrong car pulling up at traffic lights, sudden noises and unpredictable events.  If the people in this forum wish to understand what is happening in Northern Ireland and the complexity of life for the people there, it behoves them to acquaint themselves with the situation on the streets.  I hope that this debate will give the Taoiseach the impetus to explain the Government's strategy to us prior to his meeting with the British Prime Minister so that we can judge whether or not valid progress is being made.</P>

      <P>On every occasion there has been a debate on Northern Ireland during my 16 years as a Deputy there has been ongoing violence in the North which has caused a loss of life, injury and suffering in both communities. Not alone must we always condemn violence, but as democratic politicians we must work with more urgency to try to find a solution to the tragedy in the North.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The best way forward is through the three strands of talks &mdash; the talks between the two communities in the North, the talks between North and South and the talks between the British and Irish Governments.  It is disappointing that these talks have not been resumed, particularly as there is no justification for the delay.  A I said in this House in April, I do not understand why the talks cannot resume.  Deputy Kenny said that there <Col N="234" /> is much common ground between the communities living on this island.  There is no reason these communities cannot sit down and discuss the issues on which there is agreement and leave the more difficult constitutional issues until the end of the talks process.</P>
    <P>I fully support John Hume in his peace initiatives.  He is a man whose judgment I respect.  John Hume has been to the forefront of democratic constitutional Nationalist politics for the past 30 years. I hope he will succeed in his efforts to help create the environment which will bring an end to violence on the Nationalist side.  I should also like Unionist politicians to talk to Loyalist paramilitaries in an effort to direct them away from violence, which can only lead to further suffering.</P>
    <P>The best way of achieving peace is through the talks at the three different levels.  I would question the wisdom of establishing a select committee on Northern Ireland by the House of Commons.  I do not understand what role that committee will play in the negotiations.  Such a committee will make no contribution to peace in Northern Ireland.  Indeed, decisions may well be made by that committee which will frustrate peace.  There are many other fora in which this issue could be dealt with &mdash; for example, the British-Irish Parliamentary Group.  I would like to see the Unionist parties participating in that group.</P>
    <P>As a Deputy from a Border constituency, I am very concerned at the misrepresentation about the level of security along the Border contained in the memoirs of the former British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher.  She must have known of the commitment of successive Irish Governments, the Irish Army and the Garda Síochána to eradicate terrorism on this island.  She must also have known that this commitment cost £450 million per year, which is much more in <i>per capita</i> terms than the money spent by the British Government on security on its side of the Border.  I am disappointed she did not recognise, as successive Secretaries of State for Northern Ireland have, the contribution made <Col N="235" /> to security by the Irish Army and the Garda Síochána on this side of the Border.</P>
    <P>Having grown up in Northern Ireland and as a Deputy for a Border constituency, I respect the rights of both communities in Northern Ireland.  It is very important to stress yet again that the right of the Nationalists to be Irish cannot be disregarded.  Deputy Dukes outlined an option which he thought might work. While I would accept that all options have to be examined, I believe that what was decided by the parties in the New Ireland Forum is the best way forward &mdash; the right of the people of Ireland, Nationalist and Unionist, to determine their future without any pressure on anyone to participate.  Talks between the various parties is the way forward.  I would like to see those talks resume as soon as possible so that we might reach a solution to the problems on this island where all the people can live in harmony together.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the opportunity which has been afforded to me and indeed to the House to condemn the terrible atrocities that have occurred in recent days.  I am somewhat disappointed at the rather divisive note which has entered the debate, first in so far as we had to have a vote on the actual procedures to be adopted and, second, at the suggestion made by Deputy O'Malley that this debate was a counter measure to the vote of confidence and was an attempt to postpone it.  I found that suggestion very disturbing and I resent it <Col N="236" /> deeply, because a vote of confidence or any other issues that we have to debate in this House pale in significance in the context of the enormity of the atrocities that occurred in Belfast last weekend. It is imperative that this House would address this issue and join in unified condemnation of what occurred.</P>
      <P>I want to take the opportunity of paying tribute to the courage and the enormous contribution which John Hume has made to increasing an understanding of the Northern problem among Southern people and their opinion. Indeed, as a young person growing up &mdash; I was eight years of age in 1968 &mdash; I had a southern perspective of the ongoing atrocities in Northern Ireland and of the whole issue.  My understanding of the problem has been improved enormously by John Hume.  He has contributed greatly to moderating opinion on both sides of the Border and we should never forget that.  I take him very seriously when he says that he is personally convinced that there was and is a basis for peace in the process in which he engaged with Gerry Adams.  I have listened intently to his statements over the past few days and he has repeated that view. He has made comments such as &ldquo;I am not an idiot, I know what I am saying and I am saying this with total deliberation&rdquo;. We cannot run away from statements such as those nor can we ignore opportunities that may lie therein.  However, in the aftermath of what has happened, to suggest that the British and Irish Governments should make an immediate response is somewhat unrealistic and insensitive to what has taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only way forward for a formula which has, in the Tánaiste's own words, been &ldquo;grievously damaged&rdquo;, is for Gerry Adams to go to the IRA and request a full cessation of all violence.  If some agreement or formula is achieved or if there is some understanding of the basic principles, they should put those to the test in the context of a full cessation of violence and Gerry Adams and the IRA should make the first move in that regard. They should not be putting preconditions to the two Governments that if they agree <Col N="237" /> to certain issues there will be a cessation of violence.  The responsibility is totally on the Provisional IRA to take that bold step.</P>
    <P>If one considers what Martin Smyth has said in the past and certain responses from the Unionist community, and if one considers the British Government's position and the evolution of its policy over the past ten years, it is quite clear that the British Government does not have a strategic or imperialistic approach to Northern Ireland.  It is there to facilitate a proper resolution of the problem with a full accommodation of all concerns. Given those objective facts, such a move by the Provisional IRA could assist the peace process.</P>
    <P>We should acknowledge also that the Unionists, through the Official Unionist Party, have made considerable attempts in recent times to bridge the divide.  They have come to Dublin, they have met with the Irish Government, they have put forward proposals and they deserve a meaningful and sensitive response.  I am conscious that within Unionism there is a genuine desire to secure an all-party agreement on Northern Ireland, particularly in relation to the constitutional parties.  That desire should be met with a response and that was implicit in the Taoiseach's statement today when he said that the peace process involves a much wider process than the Hume-Adams initiative.</P>
    <P>If one examines the contents of the Opsahl Commission report one finds a palpable sense of war weariness among the population in Northern Ireland. People on all sides have had enough and in that context peace initiatives should be proceeded with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MattBrennan" hpid="Mr. M. Brennan Mr. M. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to condemn the violence that occurred last Saturday in the Shankill Road in Belfast.  I admire the courage of John Hume in speaking to Gerry Adams.  The Unionist politicians should speak to the UVF, as Gerry Adams is speaking to the IRA, because everyone must condemn what happened in the Shankill Road last Saturday.  The statement by the UVF that they would <Col N="238" /> retaliate for the atrocity was very sad.  I want to say to the Unionist politicians that they should talk to these men of violence because as Deputy Enda Kenny has said &mdash; he has been in Belfast during the past few days &mdash; the people of Belfast are living in constant fear in their homes not knowing when a knock will come to the door.  No bolt on a door is sufficient when it can be broken down with a sledgehammer and a 74 year old man can be shot, having been previously terrorised for an hour.</P>
      <P>This is the sad reality of what is happening in Northern Ireland today.  I want to say to the Taoiseach, who is meeting John Major next Friday, that Mr. Major should be told some home truths about what is happening in Northern Ireland. Do the British politicians realise what is happening in Northern Ireland, or have they any interest in what is happening there?  The people in South Africa have come together and next year for the first time both black and white citizens will be elected to the one parliament.  Consider what took place between Israel and the Palestinians and what happened when the Berlin Wall came down.  But the Six Counties of Northern Ireland have been a problem for years and will continue to be a problem.  However, men such as John Hume should be admired as politicians. Now the onus is on the Unionist politicians to speak to the men of violence and, hopefully, end all violence in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>Until Deputy Martin mentioned it a moment ago, I was unaware that Deputy O'Malley had suggested that the debate was being held today so that the Government could have a distraction from the debate on the Structural Funds. It is a thought that occurred to me when I heard this morning that this debate was taking place, given that for the past three weeks Opposition parties have been <Col N="239" /> requesting a debate on Northern Ireland and have been refused such a debate.  To quote T.S. Elliot: &ldquo;The last temptation is the greatest treason: To do the right deed for the wrong reason&rdquo;.  Having said that, I would prefer the Government to have this debate on Northern Ireland because it created a distraction from the rightful criticism it will receive over its handling of the Structural Funds issue than for it to be held as a reaction to the violence that took place over the weekend.</P>
      <P>Far too often we have come into this House over the past 25 years for debates like this provoked by violence, not just in the North of Ireland but in other parts of Britain and Ireland; we have had Warrington, Brighton, Enniskillen, the Miami showband incident and, as we were reminded yesterday with the resignation of Bishop Edward Daly of Derry, Bloody Sunday over 20 years ago. It has all been words, necessary words of sympathy to people, many of them innocent, with no political involvement, certainly no involvement in violent organisations, who have lost their lves in circumstances in which politicians did not do their duty.  We do not have debates in this House when there has not been violence, when we could take a more considered, long term view.  Such a view &mdash; as was referred to earlier by Deputy O'Hanlon &mdash; was taken by the Nationalist politicians on this island when they drew up the New Ireland Forum Report over ten years ago out of which came the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985.  I think everybody in this House now supports the Anglo-Irish Agreement.</P>
      <P>I want to remind the House of the purpose of that Agreement which was contained in its preamble and which contains:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>...Recognising the need for continuing efforts to reconcile and to acknowledge the rights of the two major traditions that exist in Ireland, represented on the one hand by those who wish for no change in the present status of northern Ireland and on the <Col N="240" /> other hand by those who aspire to a sovereign united Ireland achieved by peaceful means and through agreement;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;... by peaceful means and through agreement&rdquo;.  That is the solemn declaration by two Governments, endorsed by two Parliaments and registered with the United Nations as an international agreement.</P>
    <P>There have been two British Prime Ministers since, first, Mrs. Thatcher &mdash; Deputy O'Hanlon referred to her total miscomprehension of what the agreement was about &mdash; who understood it to be something to improve the security arrangements between Britain and Ireland.  As was pointed out to her on numerous occasions &mdash; I have made endless speeches on it myself in this House and outside it &mdash; the solution to the problems of Northern Ireland will not be achieved by security means, rather the solution will be achieved by political means and we politicians have a responsibility to devise those means to bring about that solution.</P>
    <P>Mr. Major &mdash; even though he says no deal exists, nor was any offered or accepted &mdash; by his agreement with the Unionists to obtain their support to get the Maastricht Treaty through the House of Commons in July last, and the payoff for that agreement &mdash; evidently, the establishment of a committee of the House of Commons on Northern Ireland affairs &mdash; has taken a step back from the Anglo-Irish Agreement because he is substituting for that Agreement an integrationist policy on the part of the British Government.  The Tánaiste has an obligation to point that out to the British Government.  In fact a special meeting of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference should have been called in July last to point that out to the British Government, not that inherently is there anything wrong with a committee of the House of Commons to debate Northern Ireland affairs.  But it is the political implications, both in the North of Ireland and in the House of Commons, of the formation of such a committee that <Col N="241" /> amounts to a negation of clauses in the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  I believe the Tánaiste has an obligation to point that out to the British Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say something about the Unionist-Major pact, something about which this Government should have protested much more vigorously than they did.  The other matter is the Hume-Adams talks.  Bishop Edward Daly said yesterday &mdash; and we should take note of it &mdash; that John Hume had moved towards Gerry Adams, that it was now Gerry Adams's turn to reciprocate by moving towards John Hume.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any elected politician on this island does not approve of what Gerry Adams stands for; they do not support his support for the men of violence.  The only credibility he has at present is given him by John Hume whom everybody, Unionists and Nationalists on this island, respect, whose judgment in most matters they share.  Therefore, Gerry Adams, if he wanted to retain the cloak of respectability given him by these talks with one of the most respected politicians on this island, has to deliver; he has to deliver a cessation of violence which he says he can do, that his word will be taken by the Provisional IRA and that they will do what he wants.  If that is so, he must deliver that cessation in the immediate future and not call on the British or Irish Government to respond quickly to the demands.  He has primary responsibility; the next step is his, to call for and insist on a cessation of violence so that the people of this island &mdash; and we are all affected by it &mdash; can live in peace together.  If the politicial solution to the problems of this island had been found a generation ago we would not now be troubled by the amount of Structural Funds from Europe because our economy would have been transformed. However, there is a far better reason <Col N="242" /> that that, there would not now be 3,000 people dead.</P>
    <P>Therefore, what is needed are politics and persuasion &mdash; persuasion on the part of the Irish Government of the British Government; persuasion on the part of the British Government of the Unionists and persuasion by Mr. Gerry Adams of his friends in the IRA to stop the violence and allow that political process to take over.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Barry for allowing me to make a few comments. Like others, I should like to join in expressing sympathy to all those who have been bereaved in the past few days from whichever side of the divide they come.  Violence begets violence.  Clearly, and very unfortunately, we have seen that to be the case.  Having talked to some of my closest friends in Northern Ireland I realise that tensions there have not been so high since the Enniskillen massacre until the past few days.  We must keep that fact in mind.</P>
      <P>We all appreciate, which has been clearly acknowledged in this House, how much effort Mr. John Hume has put into trying to develop talks with Sinn Féin. Indeed one could not say this evening that there is much difference between Sinn Féin and the IRA when one witnessed the closeness of Gerry Adams today to the man who helped carry out the atrocity that occurred on the Shankill Road on Saturday last.  Gerry Adams must clearly and immediately indicate his total rejection of violence in a clearer manner than he did this day if he is to retain any credibility in talks.  Some of my own Church leaders, in the persons of the Right Reverend Godfrey Browne and the Right Reverend Jack Weir, also tried to talk to these people and spent a lot of time in that endeavour.  Therefore, we can fully appreciate what John Hume is trying to do.  He desperately wants peace on this island; we all do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the Tánaiste being present.  In the short time remaining to me I want to ask the Tánaiste and also the Taoiseach to be as generous as possible, generous to a fault, in their endeavours <Col N="243" /> to get the talks going again among democratically elected people on this island. Of course I know it will be difficult at times; I know one can encounter small print difficulties but small print is much less important than people's lives. Indeed, what my party Leader did this week, going informally to visit both Unionists and Nationalists in Northern Ireland, is the type of simple, unorganised manner in which much good work can be done.  If something like this is not done we will have nothing but anarchy in the future.  I would remind the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste &mdash; I am aware of the Tánaiste's commitment to the whole process of peace &mdash; that we cannot overemphasise the need to be generous to a fault if we are to achieve proper dialogue between the two communities in Northern Ireland and bring about peace. We must ensure that the men of violence on either side do not have hundreds or even thousands of people quietly supporting and advising them that they are doing a good job.  One would have to react rather angrily to some of the groups who have come out, even today, to show support for men of violence.</P>

      <P>Like the previous speaker I wish to extend my sincere sympathy to the relatives of the victims of the recent outrages in the northern part of our country.  When one speaks on the tragedy in Northern Ireland one must be very careful in the language one uses as the matter is not just a political one but a threat to human life.  When we speak of human life we speak of all human life &mdash; the innocent people caught in the wrong place at the wrong time, the security forces and the many misguided young people who carry out the most atrocious crimes.  All of these people have much in common.  They all have brothers and sisters, wives, husbands and relations <Col N="244" /> who suffer great grief at the loss of loved ones.  No constitutional politician or political party on either side of the political divide in Northern Ireland has the luxury to refuse to sit down and discuss and explore all avenues which could lead to a lasting solution to the conflict.</P>
      <P>The British Government also should not allow themselves to be deflected in any way, either by their concern for a majority in the House of Commons or by the threat of further violence from whatever source, in their resolve, together with the Irish Government, to bring about a solution to the conflict. They, too, have an important role to play and they must not shirk from that responsibility where Northern Ireland is concerned.</P>
      <P>Politicians in the south must ensure that in attempting to appease the Unionist population they do not appear to alienate the Nationalist community.  If that happens, that section of the community will turn to the paramilitaries for protection. We know this because it has happened many times in the past.  In addition, we must not forget the level of fear and mistrust which exists along both sides of the Border and which has built up not only during the past 25 years but many years before.</P>
      <P>Any effort to bring about a cessation of violence must be welcomed.  I, like other speakers, would like to take this opportunity to applaud John Hume for his courageous efforts to bring about a path to peace through his dialogue with Gerry Adams.  A significant development on the path to peace is possible arising from this initiative.  Perhaps Unionist politicians who have some influence with loyalist paramilitaries should be also open to dialogue in an attempt to convince them that murdering and bombing is not the way to achieve a lasting peace.  Politicians must try to move forward from the events of the past few days.  It is possible to create a climate in which both the British and Irish Governments can put forward a solution for a lasting peace to the people of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I appeal to all politicians, and indeed, to certain commentators, not to <Col N="245" /> knock or to be too critical of the dialogue between Gerry Adams and John Hume. We must explore every avenue in order to bring the terrorists and the paramilitaries into the talks process proper.  Before this happens those paramilitaries must put their weapons aside so that they can come in from the cold and participate in the process of achieving the lasting peace that everybody is crying out for on both sides of the Border.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join with colleagues on both sides of this House in condemning unreservedly the violence of the past few days and those who perpetrated it.  I sometimes feel, as I am sure many others do, that there is something perfunctory or almost a cliché, in the way we condemn violence and the perpetrators of violence.  We have to ask ourselves what is the alternative.  The moment we stop condemning violence and stop raising our voices to condemn those who perpetrate violence on our behalf is the moment of greatest danger, when &mdash; unnoticed perhaps to ourselves &mdash; we begin to accept that violence is part of our political culture.  That is something we should never do.</P>
      <P>I should like to say a few words about the Hume-Adams process.  In my view the Unionist people of Northern Ireland have been badly served by their leaders during the past 15 years.  By contrast John Hume stands out as leader of constitutional Nationalism who has shown on occasion clarity of vision and great leadership.  For that reason many in the Republic and many in Northern Ireland also have been willing to give him the benefit of the doubt, to hope against hope, to trust his judgment that he was getting it right and that something will come from the process which he and Gerry Adams have initiated.  While that hope has taken a battering during the past few days, we still hope something will come from that process so painfully started.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am conscious too &mdash; as I know John Hume and the Tánaiste are &mdash; of the dangers involved.  Those dangers should be articulated in this House.  When <Col N="246" /> Unionists woke up some weekends ago to hear the comments on the RTE or the BBC news that John Hume was to give a report to the Irish Government about the conclusion of his talks with Sinn Féin many felt that this was the ultimate nightmare. The words spoken about the Pan-Nationalist front were suddenly beginning to come true.  They saw it as the Irish Government being in consort, wittingly or otherwise, with Sinn Féin and the SDLP, dealing behind their backs with the British Government about their future.  I know the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste wish to have no part in any Pan-Nationalist front and neither do I.  We have no wish to deal with the British Government behind the backs of Unionists in Northern Ireland.  The fact remains that that prejudice is there.  The fact that part of this process has been in public, but mostly in private, has helped to fan the prejudices and has led to the perception of Unionists that something untoward was happening that would, in a sense, sell them down the river.  For that reason I believe we must pursue that process with greater urgency.  We must pursue it with great vigour over the next days and weeks because, as the Taoiseach said this afternoon, time is not on our side.  We cannot continue to deal with it in this semi-light for much longer.</P>
    <P>The danger in this process is that we will see it as the be all and end all.  We must remind ourselves that we have at the table, in so far as negotiations are taking place, the representatives of constitutional nationalism and non-constitutional nationalism in this island, but the problem is largely one between Unionism and Nationalism.  Governments have a role, our Government and the British Government have a role but in many ways it is peripheral.  We can set the context and encourage and cajole the parties and perhaps, forcefully persuade the parties to do certain things.  We can move along the process by taking action but ultimately there will not be peace in Northern Ireland until the people of different identities in Northern Ireland decide they want to live in peace and are willing to be part of a process of <Col N="247" /> negotiation which sets the parameters within which they will live together over the coming decades.  That can only happen in the context of talks which involve not only John Hume and Sinn Féin but all parties in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I know our Government has been anxiously pursuing an agenda since last year of trying to get the talks going again. It is important at a time when our concentration is being deflected that we keep our eye on that ball and that we bear in mind the importance of getting all-party talks going as soon as possible in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>I wish to join with the other expressions of sorrow at the grief of the families whose lives have been devastated in the past few days.  These terrible events have resulted in this long sought for debate taking place but it must not end tonight.  In the search for peace there is an onus on the Government to pursue public open debate and dialogue on Northern Ireland and dialogue in Northern Ireland.  There is an onus on the Government too to set the context for a democratic initiative that is realistic, that rcognises that the State of Northern Ireland exists, that it has existed for a long time and will continue to exist as long as the people of Northern Ireland wish it to be so.  The Opsahl report which was debated in the Seanad &mdash; unfortunately we did not get the opportunity to debate it in this Chamber &mdash; offers food for thought and particularly so on this debate.  One point that Torkel Opsahl made is that:</P>
      <P>The concept of national self-determination, which is the design behind so much death and destruction in the former Yugoslavia at the moment, is not a helpful one, particularly in a divided society like Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>When John Hume drew up his joint statement with Gerry Adams they agreed that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We accept that an internal settlement is not a solution because it <Col N="248" /> obviously does not deal with all the relationships at the heart of the problem. We accept that the Irish people as a whole have a right to national self-determination&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>We have seen that this so-called right has led people in former Yugoslavia into a terrible destructive war.  If we are to prevent a deepening crisis on this island we have to find as democrats a different way from that articulated by John Hume and Gerry Adams.  Any effort to draw terrorists away from violence is welcome but as democratically elected representatives we have a responsibility to establish a democratic agenda for peace and not one based on unreal and dangerous principles.  The Government must recognise that the efforts to externalise the quest for reconciliation in Northern Ireland by taking power away from the people of Northern Ireland and locating it elsewhere in the hands of the British and Irish Governments is not the way forward.  The Government must be humble about its ambitions.</P>
    <P>The failure of the Anglo-Irish Agreement should be a lesson that a solution must include those parties who represent the people of the two communities.  I am the daughter of an Ulster Protestant and a Southern Catholic.  In the debate tonight Members referred to the other side and the concept of &ldquo;us&rdquo; and &ldquo;them&rdquo;. I do not see it as &ldquo;us&rdquo; and &ldquo;them&rdquo; because of my family situation and I am only one of many.  We all live on a very small island and we need to stop talking about &ldquo;us&rdquo; and &ldquo;them&rdquo; in those terms and instead see &ldquo;us&rdquo; as those who are loyal to democracy and &ldquo;them&rdquo; as those who give their loyalty to the gun and to violence and set a difference that is based on reality rather than on something that does not exist.  Ulster people are known for their plain speaking and as never before we need to speak plainly to them.</P>
    <P>Our Constitution contains an imperative in Articles 2 and 3 which is an obstacle to peace and which no longer reflects the wishes of our people and provides a justification for acts of murder and devastation.  One gesture that we can <Col N="249" /> make if we truly want peace is to agree to remove Articles 2 and 3 and their inherent threat from our Constitution.  It is time for democrats to clear a space in the jungle to enable the constitutional parties to meet.  Our Government must present a different perspective on the future of Northern Ireland from that of John Hume.  John Hume is an able and committed representative for his electorate in Northern Ireland but our Government represents a larger community that has a different perspective. The interests and needs of an entire island must not be sacrificed for a Nationalist chimera.  To continue with any illusion that the political process needed can lead to a united Ireland is highly irresponsible and destabilising. The Opsahl Commission put forward a concept of a new Government of Northern Ireland based on the principle that each community should have an equal voice in making and executing laws and an equal share of administrative authority. This was a radical proposal but it was found to have the support of over 63 per cent of people in Northern Ireland. In the Republic 86 per cent supported it and in Britain 81 per cent supported this concept.  There was no national right to self-determination and no territorial claims; instead it was a radical proposal that ensures power and equality where it is most needed, that is with the people of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Over the past 20 years the justifiable demand for civil rights and equal citizenship has been drowned in the Nationalist reign of terror that has only been matched by the crimes of the Loyalist murder gangs.  While the horrors of recent atrocities are still fresh in our minds and before they are replaced with other unimaginable atrocities let us state clearly that we recognise reality, that we will support in every way we can the development of democratic structures in Northern Ireland and the establishment of full civil rights for its citizens.  This Government bears a grave responsibility to offer support to an internal solution. So far it has failed to face up to that historic challenge.  We now have the <Col N="250" /> opportunity to take the initiative.  I urge the Minister for Foreign Affairs in particular to make that leap.  We can no longer sustain fantasy at the expense of truth.  For too long the terrorists have set the agenda.  The cost in the ever rising death toll and destruction is getting heavier by the day.  If we are to face the deepening crises in Northern Ireland it must be on the basis of democracy not on outworn aspirations that are only an obstacle to building peace and understanding.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I join with other Members in expressing my complete and utter abhorrence at the terrible acts of violence which have occurred in Northern Ireland in the past few days, and over the past 24 years.  This spate of atrocities has shown a wanton <Col N="251" /> disregard for the sanctity of human life. The majority of people in both parts of Ireland are appalled by the cycle of savagery and want it brought to an end immediately.</P>
    <P>More than 3,000 people have died in Northern Ireland in the past 25 years, many more have been injured and some have been maimed for life.  Those who died were made up of young and old, male and female, Catholic and Protestant. They were our fellow countrymen and women and each life lost has been as precious as the next.  There is no difference between Nationalist and Unionist blood or between Catholic and Protestant tears.  Every death through violence, whether it occurs on a lonely country road, a busy shopping street, in a home or in a work place, is a tragedy and an outrage.  Every murder must be condemned equally.  We must not allow ourselves to be hardened to the horror of violence from whatever quarter it comes.</P>
    <P>I condemn all paramilitaries and their organisations.  I condemn the IRA whose repeated acts of violence serve only to drive the two communities apart.  I condemn equally the sectarian assassins of the UFF and the UVF who together were responsible for most of the killings in Northern Ireland this year.</P>
    <P>Violence and sectarianism bring in their wake death, misery and despair and deepen divisions within Northern Ireland and between North and South.  It is incumbent on all of us in this House to demonstrate that the political process offers the only way forward.  We must show that democratic and constitutional politics alone provide a framework for achieving the kind of progress we all wish to see.  All our efforts must be directed towards bringing pressure to bear for a total and permanent cessation of violence and for the establishment of a process which, as the Taoiseach stated, can bring about peace in the fullest sense.  We need to create conditions in which agreement and consent can be freely given on all sides to structures which can accommodate on a fair and honourable basis the two main traditions on this island.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="252" /> The path to peace is through dialogue. The Taoiseach has rightly expressed the view that the problems of Northern Ireland must be resolved by a process of political dialogue and co-operation between parties dedicated to the democratic process.  The two Governments have a central role to play in devising a framework which can lead to lasting peace and stability based on freely given consent.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Hume-Adams proposals, I want to place on record my deep respect and admiration for what John Hume has done in recent months.  He has shown remarkable dedication and courage in his search for a basis for a total and permanent cessation of violence and for the construction of a lasting peace. During the past 25 years nobody has made a greater contribution to the search for peace than John Hume and nobody has done more to re-examine and redefine what our objectives as nationalists should be.  He has consistently placed agreement and consent at the heart of the equation.  He has made a potentially significant contribution to the creation of a peace process.  Such a process will, necessarily, involve the two Governments who, as the Taoiseach stated, must work together to reach a common understanding in their own terms of a framework for peace.  The Irish Government has made the achievement of peace its top priority and during recent months we have been working on the elaboration of a formula for such peace.</P>
    <P>John Hume realises the political consequences for himself.  He deserves the deepest respect of the Irish people for his efforts to achieve peace, not the personal vilification he suffered in recent weeks, particularly from certain sections of the media.  I would like to see Unionist political leaders following the example he has set by establishing contact with Loyalist paramilitary organisations for the purpose of persuading them to renounce violence also.  No greater service could be rendered to the people of this island, North and South, than if all the men of violence on both sides of the divide laid down their weapons forever and devoted <Col N="253" /> themselves to the pursuit of their objectives by exclusively peaceful and democratic means.</P>
    <P>I want to respond to a political point made earlier.  For the past number of weeks members of Opposition parties have called for briefings on the Government's knowledge of the Hume-Adams peace initiative.  From 1982 to 1987 when the Anglo-Irish negotiations took place, the main Opposition party at that time, the Fianna Fáil Party, were not consulted or informed in respect of the proceedings.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, for giving me an opportunity to contribute briefly to this debate.  I join with other speakers in extending sympathy to the families who have been bereaved in the troubles in the North during the past week.  I extend my sympathy also to the many other families bereaved during the past 25 years.</P>
      <P>Many efforts have been made to find a solution to the Northern problem but to date those efforts have failed.  One could take consolation from a statement made by the late John F. Kennedy in Washington in June 1963 when he stated: &ldquo;Our problems are man-made, therefore, they may be solved by man.  Man can be as big as he wants, no problem of human destiny is beyond human beings.&rdquo;  Those words should inspire people on all sides and provide the basis for a solution.  I hope that through discussion and dialogue among the constitutional parties North and South we can find that elusive solution to the Northern troubles so that we might see an end to death and destruction.</P>

      <P>I want to add my words of condemnation of those who perpertrated the atrocities not alone last weekend but on a continual basis since 1969.  I pledge my support to those who <Col N="254" /> have been working for peace during the past number of years with little to show for it at the end of the day.</P>
      <P>People on both sides of the community in Northern Ireland are frightened and people in the South are frightened also in case the violence might spread to this side of the Border.  Such fear is being heightened by the media in certain respects.  A Sunday newspaper recently published an article which focused on an area south of the Border and could have caused great concern to the local people.</P>
      <P>I want to add my voice in support of John Hume's efforts during the years. Anybody in a right mind would have to be influenced by those efforts.  No one understands the Northern position better or has been as dedicated to finding a solution to that problem down the years than John Hume.  If we follow his advice we will be going down the right road.</P>
      <P>Members of the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body visited the North during the past few years.  They met with various trade and commence committees, union representatives, corporate bodies and community groups.  Those groups displayed a commitment to co-operation to improve trade and goodwill between the North and the South and this is an area that must be given more careful consideration. Our exports to Northern Ireland in 1990 represented only 3.5 per cent of our gross domestic product and a study revealed that manufacturers in the South sell only one-third as much <i>per capita</i> in the North as they do in the home market while their Northern counterparts only sell one-sixth here.  Members of local authorities have a responsibility to co-operate to ensure that violence is reduced.</P>

      <P>This debate arises from the events that caused such horror and shame in Belfast this past weekend. In speaking here, I have a responsibility to speak as openly, as dispassionately and as frankly as I can about the events and what they mean.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the few days since this House last met, 15 people have died in one of the <Col N="255" /> bloodiest few days in the history of Northern Ireland.  Those victims have come from both communities and form a part of the escalating spiral of violence and hatred which must concern us all.  I have to say that it is almost impossible to find the words that would adequately describe the revulsion, indeed the despair, that I felt when news of the Shankhill massacre reached me on Saturday afternoon.  Yet another place name must be added to the dark history that has been accumulating in the last couple of years alone &mdash; another to stand beside names like Warrington, Castlerock and Teebane Cross.  Yet another community, with more than its fair share of troubles already, has been added on to the list of those who must cope with trauma and bitterness.  Yet more families, to add to the thousands in both communities and from both islands, have been left to suffer the bottomless agony of loss and left with the bitterest feeling of all &mdash; that there is no point, meaning or purpose to the violent deaths of their loved ones.</P>
    <P>The most savage irony of the Shankhill massacre lies in two facts.  First, the victims of that massacre were blown to pieces on the orders of people who believe, or say they believe, in the right of the Irish people to self determination. Second, the people who authorised that massacre are the same people who, just about a week ago, issued a public statement proclaiming their support for a peace process.</P>
    <P>There is no one on this island more committed to peace who practices democracy with more conviction, honesty, and integrity, than John Hume.  The initiative he has taken, with a view to finding a pathway towards peace, is potentially one of the most significant pieces of the jigsaw of recent years.  If the provisional IRA has done nothing else by its actions of last weekend, it has made it far more difficult to find the basis on which we might be able to proceed with and to develop that initiative, combining it with the other elements essential to a lasting peace.</P>
    <P>The Government cannot be deflected <Col N="256" /> from the search for peace.  We owe it to the thousands of people who died before last Saturday, to those slaughtered on Saturday and on the days since, to the families who mourn them, to the communities who are the poorer for their loss, never to be turned away from the quest.  That does not mean, and it can never mean, surrendering or capitulating to men of violence on any side.  To do that would be to negate the very democracy that John Hume and many others like him practise with such distinction and courage.</P>
    <P>The democratic way forward must be founded on certain key principles.  If I attempt here to outline these principles, I do so not in any way to fudge the need for a negotiated and agreed approach.  In the final analysis, there can be no lasting settlement except through agreement between the Unionist and Nationalist traditions about how we can share this island which is our common home and where we both have our rights.  The British and Irish Governments have major roles to play and major responsibilities, but peace must come finally from within the hearts of the people who live in the shadow of violence.  In addition, in setting down principles I am not attempting to lay down preconditions for any negotiation. I make only one exception &mdash; the only people welcome at the negotiating table would be those who have foresworn violence. Nobody can be expected to negotiate about their future, or the future of their community, with guns outside the door.  Bombs and guns must be set aside if we are to avoid a recurrence of the horror and terror of the Shankill massacre, and the frightening aftermaths on Kennedy Way and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The democratic principles which can underpin a peace process, and which can be combined through negotiation and dialogue to secure sustainable peace, are simply set out.  Indeed, many of them are already encapsulated and contained in Article 1 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement to which the Irish and British Governments remain fully committed.  That Article solemnly enshrines the principle of consent.  We can build on those principles <Col N="257" /> by seeing them in the following way.  First, the people living in Ireland, North and South, without coercion and without violence, should be free to determine their own future.  Second, that freedom can be expressed in the development of new structures for the governing of Northern Ireland, for relationships between North and South and for relationships between our two islands. For many of us, of course, the freedom to determine our own future by agreement should ideally lead to the possibility ultimately of unity on this island.  Third, no agreement can be reached in respect of any change in the present status of Northern Ireland without the freely expressed consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland &mdash; free as I have said from coercion or violence.  Fourth, let us once and for all accept that if we talk about the freedom of Unionists to give their consent to constitutional change, we must also recognise the freedom of Unionists to withhold their consent from such change, unless and until they are persuaded by democratic political means only.  Fifth, if we believe in consent as an integral part of any democratic approach to peace, we must be prepared at the right time and in the right circumstances to express our commitment to that consent in our fundamental law.  Sixth, even in the aftermath of some of the most horrible crimes we have witnessed, we must be prepared to say to the men of violence that they can come to the negotiating table, that they can play a peaceful part in the development of Ireland's future, if only they will stop the killing, and maiming and the hurting.  We will make a place, and we will develop structures, to bring in from the cold those who have lived in the shadow of their own terrorism and we are prepared to begin that process the moment a total cessation of violence makes it possible for us to do so.</P>
    <P>The British Government has said repeatedly that it has no selfish or strategic interest in remaining in Northern Ireland.  It has said that Britain is in Northern Ireland because the majority of the people of Northern Ireland want it <Col N="258" /> that way, and for no other reason.  At the same time, the British Government has said it will not yield to terrorism, nor bargain with it.  That is the way it is and that is the way it will remain.  I do not believe that the British Government has any objection to or could find anything to argue with in any of the principles I have outlined above.  I do not believe that any Unionist could, on calm reflection, find fault with any of these principles. Above all, I do not believe that anyone who claims to be a modern Nationalist or Republican could seriously reject any of these principles.  They are more than a basis for peace; they are a basis for people working together for the good and the future of this whole island.</P>
    <P>Ireland may remain divided by a Border for years to come.  What is vital is that we begin now to find ways of breaking down the barriers that are between us, rather than erecting new ones with more bombs and more atrocities. Many of the activists in the Provisional IRA have been involved in violence and terror for all of their adult lives.  Many of them now have teenage children.  They have a choice.  They can condemn their children, and their children's children, to lives of violence and terror, or they can stop.  If they were to stop now, it would re-establish, at least to some extent, the credentials of the peace process that they claim to have publicly endorsed.  It would provide hope that politics can replace terror as a means of achieving political objectives.  It would free their children from the shadow of the gunman and empower them for the first time in their lives to contribute to the wellbeing of their own communities.</P>
    <P>We are at a crossroads.  If the horror of recent days is not to be the latest step in an every-rising stairway of violence, then those involved must draw back. They must reflect now on the opportunity that is open, on the possibility that political action is a legitimate alternative for them.  We can condemn, and I condemn without reservation the atrocities of recent times, but this is a time to appeal for reason and for hope.  If the men of violence would only agree to give peace <Col N="259" /> a chance the political future of Northern Ireland can be utterly transformed.  All of us in this House should unite in saying &ldquo;Do it now&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>To Unionists, I would say that the two traditions on this island can work out a covenant for our own times.  What I envisage is a covenant of rights and guarantees capable of being applied by agreement to every part of this island and to every aspect of the relationship between these islands.  It would provide an assurance for all time to every citizen on this island &mdash; Protestant, Catholic or Dissenter, Nationalist or Unionist &mdash; that basic political rights, including political identities, can be enshrined to ensure that nothing, even a change in sovereignty if such were ultimately arrived at by agreement and consent, could undermine them.  Any accommodation between the two traditions on this island must be based on the principle that both identities must each have equally satisfactory, secure and durable political, administrative and symbolic expression and protection for their rights and identities. The principle of equal respect for both traditions, of equal expression of allegiance, can be worked out in innovative ways, if we want to do it.</P>
    <P>There is a heavy onus now on all democrats. Now is one of those moments in our history when we choose to go forward or backward.  As someone who was elected to speak on behalf of a new generation, I say &ldquo;we must go forward&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter relates to a 19 year old youth who suffers from a mild mental handicap.  Essentially he suffers from a chromosome disorder called Kinfelter Syndrome.  The main behavioural characteristics of this syndrome is that the boy is immature, suffers from nervousness, excessive shyness, tends to be aggressive and tends to get involved in anti-social behaviour.  Physically he is <Col N="260" /> tall, underweight, with long legs and his appearance is somewhat different from normal boys of that age.  The youth has very basic academic skills and has been classified as being very immature.  He tends to be over-familiar in social terms with adults and is very easily led.  He is naive about the consequences of his actions and in the attitude which he adopts to those actions.  He needs close supervision and his parents have made a great attempt to provide that supervision but it is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain the level of supervision which is required for this young man as he becomes more adult.  The position is now almost impossible for his parents.</P>
      <P>I am raising this matter following representations from his parents, particularly following representations from the parents which relate to an incident which took place on 21 July this year.  On that day this youth, in effect, escaped from his residence, made his way into the centre of Dublin and became involved with people who hung around pubs and such facilities. He was lured away to a flat in the centre of the city where he became involved in what one of the experts described as an inappropriate sexual experience with a male adult.  One can figure out the type of person involved.  This is the second occasion on which this young man has been involved in that type of experience. For that reason I am appealing to the Minister to take some action which will ensure that this young man is not exposed to this type of incident.</P>
      <P>This is a particularly difficult situation which is being made worse by the social problems experienced by the family of this young man.  I spoke to the father this evening and he said that he did not object to my saying that he is a recovered alcoholic.  The boy's mother suffers from a series of other disorders.  The family in effect are now almost running a prison for this young man.  I am advised that there is a very serious risk of this boy becoming involved in similar type incidents unless he is placed in an appropriate institution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that it is not easy to get an institution to cater for this young man's <Col N="261" /> requirements, but it is essential that action be taken.  I am asking the Minister to try to do something about it.  The parents are at their wits end wondering and worrying about when he will next escape from the house and become involved in an incident similar to the one which took place on 21 July.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Upton for raising the case of this young man and I would like to outline the position for him and the House.  This person has a mild mental handicap and in the ordinary course of events he would not require a place in a residential centre and could be coped with adequately in the community. However, in this instance the risk of sexual abuse lends a further aspect to the case and I am concerned that the young man be properly protected.</P>
      <P>He attended St. Augustine's special school in Blackrock which is run by the St. John of God Brothers.  He resides in Crumlin where the services for persons with mental handicap are predominantly provided also by the Brothers.  However, the Brothers are not in a position at present to provide him with a secure place which would be appropriate to his needs.  It would not be appropriate, for example, to place this person in a home with persons with a severe or profound mental handicap.</P>
      <P>Consequently, the Brothers approached the Eastern Health Board with a view to the board providing appropriate services. However, the difficulty arises there also in that he may still be at risk in the community no matter what level of support is provided and secure residential placement is much too restrictive in view of the mild nature of his handicap.  The health board had him assessed on 27 September and this assessment confirmed the need for protection because of the risk of abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A meeting is being held tomorrow morning between the Eastern Health Board and the St. John of God Brothers at which it is hoped that the most appropriate and safe level of service can be provided.  I have asked that a detailed <Col N="262" /> report be sent to me in this case and I will keep the Deputy informed of developments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to you for allowing me to raise this matter and to my constituency colleague, the Minister, for coming into the House to respond.</P>
      <P>Thousands of families throughout the counties of Offaly and Laois are being denied access to multi-channel television services due to the difficulties encountered in the provision of a signal in the midlands.  The Minister is fully aware of this problem given that he represents the same constituency as I do.  I wish to remind him, however, of the commitments made in this regard by his Fianna Fáil predecessor.  The then Minister, Deputy Séamus Brennan, informed the Dáil on 18 June 1991 that &ldquo;there is no question of anybody being switched off.  There is no question of permitting a gap to be created.  Therefore, the consumer need not be overconcerned about losing a service&rdquo;.  Subsequent events and the passage of time prove beyond doubt the insincerity and the inaccuracy of these statements and show that on that occasion Deputy Brennan seriously misled the House.  The present Minister, Deputy Cowen, has a chance to redeem the situation and to ensure an element of fair play which is sadly lacking in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is gross discrimination in the provision of the multi-channel service, depending on the part of the country in which one lives.  The price variation among the various licensed companies is considerable and inequitable.  Throughout the counties of Offaly and Laois a number of deflector operators provided a most acceptable and widely cherished service, particularly in rural communities. I understand that these operators were told that they could continue in operation until the MMDS system was put into operation.  Licensed companies, however, once favoured with a licence from the Minister proceeded to bring the <Col N="263" /> heavy arm of the law to bear on the voluntary operators and swept them out of business in a manner likened to the landlordism of 19th century rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>It now transpires, however, that the licensed MMDS suppliers are unable to fulfil their contract to supply rural Ireland with multi-channel television services.  It is not possible for the companies to supply a signal to wide areas of Counties Offaly and Laois due to the lack of technical equipment.  Families and householders accustomed to a choice of viewing over the past few years are now confined to watching RTE alone.  This is most unfair when compared to the service available to consumers in urban Ireland and Dublin in particular.</P>
    <P>So far as pricing is concerned there does not appear to be sufficient, if any, control over what a franchise holder can charge.  In this regard I see a positive role for the Director of Consumer Affairs and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment in ensuring a system of price control. The monopoly arrangements as introduced by the Minister have little regard to the consumer and a watchdog body is essential to monitor and review the charges.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to act on behalf of thousands of families in Offaly and Laois who do not have a multi-channel television service.  The overriding objective must be the provision throughout the State of a service with the right of the consumer to receive a choice of channels of high quality at a reasonable cost.  Anything less is fundamentally wrong.  The views and rights of people must not be trampled upon but represented and encouraged by lawmakers in Government. This problem must be rectified in the interests of fair play.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>With any innovative development such as the multi-point microwave distribution system, or, as it is known, MMDS, it is to be expected that there will be some adverse reaction especially where people face an increase in charges during the <Col N="265" /> introductory phase.  I am aware of some dissatisfaction in Counties Offaly and Laois on this score.  However, I believe that it is as important to focus on the quality aspects as it is on the price aspects of any comparison between MMDS and any existing deflector systems.</P>
      <P>The provision of MMDS-based multi-channel TV choice has been part of Government policy since 1988 when the Minister of the day announced the Government's decision to proceed with the system in this country.  I should remind Deputies that the illegal deflector system is not available throughout the country.  Indeed a previous Minister, Deputy Jim Mitchell, had already announced in 1987 Fine Gael's commitment to it.  MMDS was designed to allow legitimate access to a wider choice of television services in those areas which do not enjoy a geographical advantage in being able to receive foreign TV channels directly, or where a cable service is not viable.  MMDS franchises covering the entire country were awarded in late 1989 and early 1990 following public advertisement. MMDS systems are now in operation in nine of the ten franchise areas and the last one, in Waterford, is expected to commence operations in the New Year.  To date a total of some 47,000 connections have been made.</P>
      <P>The MMDS system was chosen because it was the only practicable system possible that was compatible with our national and international frequency management obligations.  In adopting the MMDS route the objectives were to provide real multi-channel television choice in a professional, technically competent manner and to make available on a nation-wide basis the same quality and continuity of service which is currently available on cable systems in the urban areas.  At that time a very thorough investigation of the alternatives was made and the conclusion was that only MMDS could meet these objectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the main difficulties which has arisen with the introduction of MMDS is caused by the remaining illegal deflector systems within the franchise areas.  I can understand the feelings of those viewers <Col N="266" /> who have been relying on the services of these systems up to now, especially where the services were provided by communal initiative, but these systems could never have aspired to the nation-wide requirements for multi-channel choice that I have already mentioned.  Furthermore, as they operated without licences, they were always illegal.  Now that we have acted and adopted MMDS and choice of quality viewing is legally available, the inescapable fact is that such illegal deflector systems can no longer be allowed to continue in operation.</P>
    <P>I can, furthermore, sympathise with new subscribers to MMDS who have to pay more for multi-channel TV than they paid while linked to a deflector system. However, unfair comparison has been made between MMDS and illegal deflector systems with regard to price.  It is true that MMDS typically costs more than the deflector systems.  One must also bear in mind that the capital cost of the MMDS transmission facility is higher since it must provide a more widely available service and meet the highest technical standards.  The MMDS operators must also meet all the usual obligations of copyright payments and, of course, they must pay tax and VAT.  The illegal operators were often in a position to avoid these structures and could, therefore, keep the price to the subscriber comparatively low.  In the case of MMDS, on the other hand, the subscriber is given much greater choice of channels than that available from the deflector systems.</P>
    <P>The basic problem with deflector systems is that they operate in a part of the UHF band which has been allocated to Ireland for television use by the Stockholm Treaty of 1961.  The spectrum space so allocated provides sufficient frequency space for the transmission of four TV channels and no more.  Accordingly there is simply not enough frequency space available to Ireland to enable a nation-wide network of deflector transmitters to be established and at the same time meet other national requirements such as RTE's two channels, a possible independent third channel and the proposed Telefís na Gaeilge.  Each of these stations <Col N="267" /> would require high and medium powered transmitters and local transposers throughout the country and that is why the full range of our UHF frequency allocation must be protected.  Those calling for the licensing of illegal deflector systems are in effect asking me to close off options for the future development of domestic television services in this country.</P>
    <P>I take the view, a Cheann Comhairle, that spectrum allocations to Ireland are national assets to be used prudently and wisely in the national interest.  Such frequencies cannot be taken over and used willy nilly by those involved in illegal deflector systems especially where they are already earmarked for national requirements.</P>
    <P>It is crucially important to understand that there is not actually a choice as between deflector systems and MMDS if the non-cabled public are to be given multi-channel television.  The fundamental physics of frequency management, combined with the international constraints which apply, mean that it can only be done by MMDS and unless or until there is an understanding of that fact there cannot actually be a rational discussion on this issue.  In this regard, before MMDS was conceived in Ireland successive Governments had reached the conclusion that the deflector approach was not an option.  I would, therefore, like to take this opportunity to make it as clear as I can that the MMDS system is here to stay and that no other re-transmission system can, or will, be licensed.  The policy of successive Governments has been that they have no wish to deprive anybody of a choice of television viewing; but the illegal systems will have to close down as alternative legal services, whether cable or MMDS, become available.</P>
    <P>Although there have been some difficulties with the introduction of MMDS in Counties Laois and Offaly, I am happy to say that the situation is rapidly improving. Initially, because of the existence of deflector systems, the MMDS companies had difficulty in penetrating the market; <Col N="268" /> but now that people see that MMDS provides a better service there is strong interest in subscribing to MMDS.</P>
    <P>Because MMDS operates on a &ldquo;line of sight&rdquo; basis, certain geographic features can present problems in the provision of a signal.  However, I am assured by the companies concerned that, with the aid of &ldquo;beam-bending&rdquo; technology and a certain amount of local cabling, they will soon be in a position to provide service to the great majority of subscribers. Thus, for instance, in the village of Kinnity, where such a signal &ldquo;black spot&rdquo; area was identified, a beam bender is now being installed to provide service for the people affected.  The Deputy will be aware that in the town of Mountmellick the company concerned inform me that they have reached an amicable agreement with the deflector operator for an orderly transition to the MMDS system. They are now using a combination of a beam bender with limited cabling to bring service to those parts of the town not in the direct line of the MMDS transmitter.</P>
    <P>I understand further that Suir Nore Relays Ltd., who hold the MMDS franchise for most of County Laois, are now offering a substantial discount on the installation charge to pensioners living alone.  Both franchise holders in the counties of Laois and Offaly now offer phased payment systems to new customers.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn finally to certain criticisms of MMDS concerning supposed health risks.  Public exposure to microwave radiation has been examined by health authorities in the US, the UK, Sweden, Germany, Canada and in many other developed countries.  This work has been carried out since 1990.  In all cases the allowable or safe exposure of the public to radiation at the MMDS frequencies, that is 2.5 to 2.7 Giga Hertz, has been set at levels of around ten watts per square metre.  My Department has measured peak levels near an MMDS transmitter in the West of Ireland at 0.00023 watts per square metre.  The human body itself emits microwave radiation at a much greater level than this.  I think, a Cheann Chomhairle, that this <Col N="269" /> evidence speaks for itself and I hope that the Deputy and the House are now fully assured on the matter.</P>
    <P>In general, a Cheann Comhairle, I can report that while there have been startup difficulties associated with the introduction of MMDS in Laois and Offaly, these are now being worked out and there is growing interest in the MMDS system.</P>

      <P>I want to thank the Minister for coming in here tonight to deal with this urgent matter as I know she is very busy.  It is extremely rare for me to use the mechanism of the Adjournment Debate. The fact that I have availed of it tonight reflects the urgency of this matter of St. Kevin's School in Glendalough, County Wicklow.</P>
      <P>The Minister has looked into this with me and other Deputies in the past and I know she is <i>au fait</i> with the situation.  I want to emphasise the time factor here tonight.  There is a major problem in the school, and that is accepted.  I have here a report from the Eastern Health Board school medical officer which states that the building is quite unsuitable, that there is no natural light and flourescent tubes must be used, the toilets are totally inadequate and rodents have been seen in the school hall.  The report concludes that the premises are definitely unsuitable and require to be replaced by modern premises as soon as possible.  In addition to that, the INTO in a nationwide survey this week highlighted this school, among other schools, as being in urgent need of attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local community hall is being used at the moment as a classroom for this school, leaving the local community devoid of a hall and, although they have been ultra co-operative, they have issued <Col N="270" /> notice to the school management to vacate the premises.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Minister is <i>au fait</i> with the situation.  I am equally satisfied that she is concerned about it.  She has already authorised the work that needs to be done.  What I am now asking is that she would expedite the provision of the necessary funding so that work can proceed.  If she could tell us tonight that she will include this in her 1994 figures, we would be extremely delighted going back to Wicklow this evening.</P>

      <P>Glendalough is associated with scholarship and learning since the beginning of the last millennium.  It was the University of Europe in those early years, when it sent its scholars all over Europe to educate and illuminate the great traditions of education throughout Europe. We have seen many millions of pounds spent in Glendalough on maintaining the historic buildings in that area and on interpreting the work done in those early years, and the Minister has visited there on many occasions.</P>
      <P>On this occasion we should consider the needs of the young students who are there today, fewer in number but nevertheless very important to Wicklow.  We are not asking for millions of pounds; we are asking the Minister to raise the standard of the building to an acceptable level.  I know the Minister has great knowledge of County Wicklow, particularly of this area and that we can count on her to intervene to ensure that work is carried out on this building as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity the Deputy has presented me with to clarify the position in relation to this matter. This three teacher school had an enrolment of 70 pupils in September 1992.  The existing accommodation consists of two classrooms, and I understand that the <Col N="271" /> third teacher is at present accommodated in the local parish hall which is situated some distance from the main school building.  My Department is aware that the conditions at this school are far from satisfactory, and of the need to provide suitable accommodation for the third teacher and class.  Approval has therefore been given for a major building project at the school.</P>
      <P>The scheme will include the upgrading and refurbishment of the two existing classrooms, together with the provision of additional classroom and ancillary facilities.  The architectural planning of the project is proceeding and I understand that sketch plans are in course of preparation.  When these have been completed they will be forwarded to the school authorities to enable them to apply for local authority planning permission for the project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will appreciate every <Col N="272" /> school invariably makes the case that its project is deserving of special attention. My Department and I would be more than delighted if, in a world where resources were unlimited, every scheme could proceed at the same time. However, as the Deputy will be aware, because of the large volume of major building projects on hands and the limitations on resources, it is possible to allow only a certain number of projects to proceed to construction in any one financial year.  Unfortunately it was not possible to include this project in the national schools' capital programme for 1993. However, I wish to assure the Deputies that my Department accepts that this is a project deserving of the highest priority in the context of projects to be allowed to proceed to construction in 1994.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 8.55 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 28 October 1993.</P>

      <P>I am confident that the level of funding for the headage scheme over the lifetime of the plan will accommodate the increased payment rates introduced in 1992 which resulted in a 25 per cent increase in total headage payments and also the outcome of the appeals panel which should result in payment increases for a number of low income farm families.</P>
      <P>Funding for headage payments cannot of course be considered in isolation from the needs for Structural Funds support for other equally important areas such as on-farm investment for dairy hygiene and pollution control purposes, the food industry, rural development and forestry. Any further increases to farmers, therefore, including low income farm families, would have to be considered by reference to other competing needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputies will also be aware that substantial extra aid for farmers including low income farm families, will become available shortly under our new agri-environment and forestry programmes and a generous scheme of early retirement <Col N="48" /> for farmers should be formally approved by the Commission in the next month or so.</P>

      <P>Vine weevil (Otiorrhynchus sulcatus) is established and widespread in this country for years. The question of eradicating it would be entirely impracticable.  The range of plants it attacks are soft fruit plantations, primulas, rhododendron, azaleas and some pot plants.  Crops can be grown successfully where control measures are operated to prevent a heavy build up of the pest.  A range of agro-chemicals are available for this purpose and there is also a natural predator available commercially for controlling the pest.</P>
      <P>Under a new EC Directive which is to come into effect from the end of this year, it will be mandatory that certain host plants of the vine weevil which are being marketed for replanting shall be examined and found free of the weevil.</P>
      <P>The advisory services of Teagasc should be contacted by any grower who has particular problems with vine weevil.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 53 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>EC regulations governing the suckler cow premium scheme provide for the establishment of a national reserve and a special reserve for the disadvantaged <Col N="50" /> areas for allocation to certain categories of producers.</P>
    <P>The national reserve is to be established by the deduction of premium rights from quota holders and is to be equivalent to between 1 per cent and 3 per cent of the total allocated to producers in the State.  The special reserve for the disadvantaged areas is to be equivalent to 1 per cent of the individual quotas allocated to producers in those areas. These reserves cannot be established until all applications submitted in 1992 have been processed.</P>
    <P>In order to assist producers, my Department accepted applications under the suckler cow premium scheme up to the end of 1992.  The scheme provided for a 6 months retention period &mdash; which in many cases did not end until 30 June 1993.  When these applications have been processed, I will announce the size of quota deductions to be made for the purpose of establishing the national reserve and the priority categories for the allocation of both reserves.  Producers will then be invited to submit formal applications for reserve quota and to provide evidence in support of their claim.</P>

      <P>The new Single Market controls operative within the EC since 1 June, 1993 include a provision that a limited number of plant species be accompanied to the final consumer by a plant passport in the form of a label.  Such label denotes that the production area of the plants in question has been officially inspected and found to be free of the more serious diseases and pests.</P>
      <P>The species which requires passports in this country relate to diseases and pests which could affect the more important crops grown here.  In the garden centre area, the most important disease is fireblight which can damage a range of fruit and ornamental plants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These controls are essential to enable Ireland, in the absence of internal border inspections, to maintain its relative disease-free status by precluding the sale of those plants which do not meet the required standard.  The controls will <Col N="53" /> also act as an effective measure to trace any infected material to its origin so that remedial action against its spread can be taken quickly.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 131 together.</P>
      <P>In order to qualify for payment of the special beef premium, applicants are required, to submit their cattle identity cards to my Department's special beef premium unit which was set up in June of this year especially to operate this scheme.  This unit is now operating from Portlaoise.  A total of 84,000 applications, covering over half a million animals, was received for the June-July application period.  Applicants were required by EC regulations to retain the animals in question on their holdings for a minimum period of 2 months from the time my Department received the applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The procedures adopted for administering this scheme involve, <i>inter-alia</i>, the checking of the applications against the cards submitted.  Where the details on both the card and the application agree, cards are returned promptly to the applicant. Unfortunately, a considerable number of queries regarding card details arose in the most recent scheme, for example, where the card number did not coincide with the tag number listed on the application or indeed where female cards were submitted for what is a male animal scheme.  In addition many applicants <Col N="56" /> submitted cards separately from the application, without indicating the relevant herd number or similar indication of ownership and the &ldquo;matching&rdquo; of these cards with the correct application is a time consuming process.</P>
    <P>The current position is that of a total number of over half a million cattle identity cards received in June-July approximately 1 per cent is still retained by my Department pending the satisfactory resolution of queries.  The farmers involved are being contacted by my Department in order to resolve these queries.  The question of compensation for farmers does not arise.</P>
    <P>In applying for aid under the special beef premium scheme and indeed under all premium and headage schemes, it is essential that farmers exercise extreme care thus ensuring smooth processing of applications and compliance with the various conditions laid down by the EC for these schemes.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware I have vigorously opposed by all means at my disposal the Commission Regulation imposing a weight limit on carcasses which may be sold into intervention.  The Government have decided to challenge this measure in the European Court of Justice and a case was lodged accordingly with the court on 4 June, 1993.  The Government also applied to the Court on 13 June for interim measures whereby the implementation of the weight limit of 380 kgs as from date of the first tender in July 1993 would be suspended but the court did not grant this suspension.  However, the court decision does not prejudice the outcome of our substantive case against the Commission Regulation.</P>
      <P>Intervention is much less important in Ireland this year because of better and more consistent marketing by the beef industry, reduced beef production in the European Community, the re-opening of certain third country markets which had recently been closed to Irish beef and increased live exports.  Accordingly, the effect of the 380 kg weight limit has been considerably reduced and, indeed, this year steer prices have been consistently above last year's levels.  Despite the absence of any price reduction the direct compensatory payments under the premium schemes have been substantially increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission regulation provides for the weight limits to be reduced to 360 <Col N="58" /> kgs from 1 January 1994 and to 340 kgs from 1 July 1994.  However, the Commission has undertaken to submit a report to the Council before the end of November on the implementation of the weight limit and this will give the council an opportunity to evaluate its impact.  I have, however, raised the issue of the weight limit at the meeting of the council on 18/19 October in order to restate my strong objections to the measure and to alert the Commission to the possibility that it might be necessary to re-introduce intervention for heavy carcases in the event of a heavy glut of cattle coming onto the market over a short period.  The conclusion of contracts for the supply of over 16,000 tonnes of beef to Iran before the end of the year has stabilised the market and it is likely that the beef industry will be able to secure markets for all of the heavy cattle coming on the market during the remainder of the year.  I will, of course, continue to monitor market developments very carefully.</P>

      <P>Under the new support system for arable crops provision is made for differentiation of aid to take account of differences in yields as between homogenous yield regions.  A yield region can be an entire member state or a region within a member state.</P>
      <P>Historical average yields must be used for the calculation of aid.  In Ireland's case official yield figures are not available on a regional basis.  In any event the use of homogenous yield regions would not be appropriate in our case because yields obtained by individual producers can vary substantially within any region.  Any attempt to differentiate yields (and therefore levels of aid) by region would give rise to anomalies both between and within regions.</P>
      <P>Because of these factors I had no option but to designate Ireland as a single yield region which means that all producers are paid at the same rate irrespective of yields.  This militates against growers of winter cereals and favours spring cereal producers.</P>
      <P>As an alternative to regional yields I sought, during the CAP reform negotiations, a differentiation of aid by winter and spring cereals.  I got no support from any other member state.</P>
      <P>The EC Commission has recently submitted a proposal to the Council of Agriculture Ministers providing for certain changes in the basic rules covering the support system for arable producers.</P>
      <P>During the discussions at Council I have sought a change in the rules which would enable compensatory payments to be differentiated according to yields for winter and spring sown cereals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Should such an arrangement be agreed <Col N="60" /> by Council the question of detailed implementing rules will be a matter for the EC Commission.</P>

      <P>A number of reports have been received from Teagasc regarding crop damage due to bad weather.</P>
      <P>My Department is discussing this issue with the EC Commission which has been at pains to point out that there are only limited means available to the Commission to help producers who are faced with such difficulties.  It was never the intention that Community funds be used to compensate for loss of income due to poor weather conditions which the Commission regard as a normal risk associated with the business of growing crops.  In the case of annual crops the possibility of Community intervention is extremely limited.</P>
      <P>The principal crop affected is potatoes. My information is that the bad weather has resulted in a general reduction in yields.  On the other hand this reduction has been partly offset to date by substantially increased prices compared with last year.  However, I can assure the Deputy that I am keeping the position under continuous review.</P>

      <P>The EC regulations in force regarding the use of pesticides are as follows:</P>
      <P>(a)  <i>Classification, packaging and labelling of pesticides:</i> All products must be cleared for marketing under these regulations.  It involves an assessment of the toxicity, eco-toxicity and physical chemical properties to ensure that there are no unacceptable risks to human health or to the environment.</P>
      <P>(b)  <i>Prohibition of Dangerous Substances in Pesticides:</i> These prohibit the sale of known dangerous substances, such as DDT, dieldrin, and organochlorine compounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="62" /> (c)  <i>Maximum level of Pesticides Residues:</i> These regulations prescribe maximum levels of specific pesticides which may be present on or in fruit, vegetables, cereals, dairying and meat products put on sale.  The controls consist of sampling, testing and taking appropriate action against any breaches of the standards.  The objective of the regime is to protect consumers.</P>
    <P>(d)  <i>New regulations on Acceptance of Pesticides:</i> This EC directive was adopted by Council in December 1991 and will come into operation shortly. It extends the harmonised rules for approving pesticides in a number of ways, in which member states will cooperate in the approval of active substances. Formulations will continue to be approved by each member state in accordance with Community rules. This will include evaluation of the efficacy of pesticides.</P>
    <P>These combined measures are designed to maintain an acceptable balance between the efficacious use of pesticides as a necessary tool in agricultural output and a satisfactory level of protection and safety to human health and the environment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="64" /> Basically, the position is that the Noxious Weeds Act was designed, and has been operated, to deal with weeds which have a direct and significant adverse effect on the production of farm animals or crops.  All the weeds which have been designated under the Act are in that category. In this respect we are in line with similar legislation in other countries.</P>
    <P>The giant hogweed has no agricultural implications nor has it any significant occurrence on farmland.  Its habitat is mainly in amenity areas such as river banks and public parks or roadsides.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture Food and Forestry (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Sales of beef into intervention so far this year have been at considerably lower levels than in recent years because of a number of factors. The Irish beef industry has exploited the increased market opportunities in the European Community and has dramatically increased the quantity of steer beef sales on the commercial market this year compared to recent years.  The live exports trade to third countries has resumed this year and this has helped to underpin the market.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, I succeeded earlier this year, after prolonged negotiations, in securing the reopening of the Iranian market and I am very pleased that contracts for the supply of approximately 16,000 tonnes of boneless beef (i.e. the equivalent of 60,000 head) have been concluded recently for delivery to Iran by the end of the year.  I am confident that these contracts, along with other contracts for supply to the Community beef market and other Third Country outlets, will keep the intervention requirement for the remainder of the year at relatively modest levels.  In these circumstances, I do not envisage tenders for intervention being insufficient to cater for the numbers of cattle coming on the market this autumn.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50, 64, 66 and 67 together.</P>
      <P>EC funding for the 1993 Bovine TB programme has not become available. Agreement has been reached with the Commission Services on the technical conditions associated with the funding but the EC Veterinary Fund is not adequate to meet existing demands.</P>
      <P>I have been pressing at EC Council level for an increase in the Veterinary Fund in order to enable the TB Programme in this country to be supported as well as having a greater level of resources available to assist the attainment of the highest possible animal health status in the Single Market.</P>
      <P>The 1993 annual round of testing is well on the way to completion.</P>
      <P>With over 99 per cent of the cattle population free of TB the problem is a residual one.  I am satisfied with the fact that orderly and complete rounds of testing have been carried out in recent years and with the reduction in the incidence. However testing <i>per se</i> is not the full solution and special emphasis is being placed on having a more broadly based strategy in order to address all the factors involved in the spread of TB as well as incorporating new technological developments into the programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 59 and 76 together.</P>
      <P>Over recent years my Department has introduced controls with the aim of ensuring that all grant-aided farm buildings are installed to a properly specified standard and at the same time securing good value both for farmers and tax payers.  Standards have been set for testing and design of cattle-slats, metal cladding used in farm building work and the protection of structural steel.</P>
      <P>Following consultation and liaison between my Department and the cement and concrete manufacturing industries a new &ldquo;Concrete Manufacturers Specification Certificate&rdquo; was introduced on 1 June of this year.  The certificate includes all the necessary information on the supplied aggregates, on the quantity of cement and various admixtures, and also references to appropriate National or International Standards.  Certificates are not required for sand or gravel, though such materials in the concrete must be to standard.  To achieve consistency, high quality concrete requires a regularly-serviced plant with a full range of equipment, so it was therefore necessary to place some restriction on access to these certificates.</P>
      <P>Manufacturers who apply for these certificates must show evidence, via a technical audit of their plant, that consistently high quality can be achieved.  Manufacturers whose plant is close to the standards of the audit, and who are currently upgrading their equipment to meet these standards, also have access to the certificates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As this has been a question of the concrete industry raising its own standards, the certificates have been jointly produced by the two associations involved: The Concrete Manufacturers' Association of Ireland; and The Independent Concrete Manufacturers' Association.  Both associations hold stocks of the certificates, and keep records of those to whom they have been supplied.  However, I want to make it clear that access to the certificates is not restricted to members of the association, <Col N="70" /> but is open to everyone who complies with the technical audit.  The audit itself may be carried out by the independent auditors to the associations, or by other recognised independent authorities such as EOLAS, or the National Standards Authority of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I am happy that the new certification system will ensure the appropriate standard for concrete which is the major component in most farm structures.  This can only be to the benefit of farmers.</P>

      <P>It is now generally acknowledged that infected badgers play a role in the transmission of bovine TB.  Research studies in this country have shown that up to 14 per cent of badgers can have TB lesions.</P>
      <P>My Department has currently a comprehensive research programme under way in regard to the role of wildlife in the transmission of disease.  A major project in County Offaly is nearing completion. A key project is an EC Interreg funded joint feasibility study on the concept of a vaccine for wildlife.  Considerable research had been done into the ecology and behaviour of the badger population.</P>
      <P>At farm level, badgers can be removed under licence from the Office of Public Works where their involvement in the spread of infection has been identified where breakdown occurs.

      <P>In announcing on 23 March 1993, my decision to include support for democracy and human rights as an integral part of Ireland's Official Development Programme, I informed this House that it was my intention that Ireland should play its part in assisting South Africa in transition from apartheid to a non-racial democracy.</P>
      <P>Support for the successful organisation of South Africa's first democratic, non-racial elections next April was one of the issues that Mr. Mandela discussed with the Taoiseach and me during his visit on 10 October.</P>
      <P>We are examining how we will respond to his request.  The Twelve have recently sent a mission to South Africa to examine how the Community and its Member States could support the 1994 elections and its report is presently being discussed.

      <P>Ireland has already announced its support for Frankfurt as the location for the European Monetary Institute.  However, strenuous efforts are being made by the Government to have the proposed European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products sited in Ireland.  It has been decided that with its long tradition in medicine and in research and given that it has all the necessary access, communications, and support facilities, Dublin would be the most appropriate location for the Agency.</P>
      <P>In regard to the effect of the Single Market on the number of Customs and Excise staff employed in the Dundalk area, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that arising out of a Government decision to give them responsibility for the collection in respect of Ireland of Community INTRASTAT statistics and the VAT Information Exchange System, it was possible to retain approximately 90 Customs and Excise staff in the Dundalk region who otherwise would have been surplus to requirements.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the extension from 1 January 1994 of tax clearance to farmers in receipt of headage payments from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  The Deputy will recall that this was originally intended to take place in 1992 and would apply to headage payments which in total amount to £500 or more.  However an extension was granted to allow certain farmers more time to obtain a tax reference number.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the interim the tax clearance procedures have been adapted specifically to accommodate those farmers who would not have an RSI number for tax purposes but who are receiving a means-tested <Col N="78" /> social welfare payment.  In future such applicants for headage payments will be able to quote the RSI number under which the Social Welfare payments are made.</P>
    <P>From 1 January, 1994, all applicants for headage payments of £500 or more will have to comply with tax clearance procedures which already apply to all other applicants for public grants and subsidies.  I would like to take this opportunity to again emphasise that tax clearance does not result in any additional liability to tax.</P>

      <Quest>the present policy regarding reinstatement of married women who were formerly employed in the Civil Service; whether he plans changes in this policy in view of the findings that this policy is discriminatory; and his views on the fact that for many families hit by unemployment, reinstatement would relieve the hardship they are suffering.</Quest>
      <QRef>
      </QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The practice of reinstatement of certain former women civil servants has been governed by specific statutory provisions in the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1956 and Civil Service (Employment of Married Women) Act, 1973.  These exceptional provisions permitted a woman who resigned from the service for the purpose of, on or following marriage to be reinstated to her former position if she were subsequently widowed, if she did not marry or if she established to the satisfaction of the Minister for Finance that she was not being supported by her husband.  The provisions were challenged under the terms of the Employment Equality Act, 1977 by the Employment Equality Agency and were found by the Labour Court to be discriminatory and contrary to the principle of equal treatment. The Labour Court recommended that the relevant statutory provisions be repealed at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Court finding is, of course, <Col N="79" /> an enforceable determination of the matters at issue in the case.  Having taken legal advice on the matter, I do not consider that I have any option but to terminate the practice of reinstatement and introduce the appropriate legislation to repeal the relevant statutory provisions. However, applications which were submitted on or before the date on which the Determination issued will be processed to finality and any of the applicants who met the qualifying requirements on that date will be reinstated as and when suitable vacancies arise.</P>
    <P>On the question of the reinstatements scheme relieving hardship, it should be appreciated that the scheme did not result in any net increase in employment in the civil service.  The vacancies to which reinstated women were appointed would otherwise have been filled, directly or indirectly, from recruitment panels formed by open competition.  Accordingly, each person who qualified for reinstatement secured employment at the expense of another person who had succeeded in an open competition.  In its report on the recent case, the Labour Court took the view that &ldquo;all recruitment to the service should be by open competition through the Civil Service Commission, including the re-recruitment of former civil servants who resigned for whatever reason&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A development of some relevance in this context is the raising of upper age limits in open competitions for recruitment to the civil service.  Since 1991, the upper age limit for most competitions has been raised to 50, replacing age limits as low as 20 which had formerly applied. This change in age limits enables most of the women who might previously have applied for reinstatement, and would previously have had no other means of returning to the service, to seek to resume their careers in the service through the normal competitive procedure.</P>

      <P>While it is to be expected that a prudent enterpreneur will ensure that he and his project come within the terms of the scheme before deciding to leave his employment and set up his down business, almost from the announcement of the scheme queries have been received by telephone and in writing regarding the acceptability of various proposals. Already applications for certification of 13 new projects have been received by the industrial development agencies.  The first application for refunds in respect of one of those companies was received and processed by the Revenue Commissioners in October and refunds were authorised.  It is expected that a number of further refunds will be processed in the near future.  This indicates a lively interest in the scheme.</P>

    <P>These figures have been prepared on the basis of information made available on a confidential basis to the IDA. Accordingly, it is not possible to indicate the identify or current turnover of each firm.</P>
    <P>The target in the National Development Plan for a doubling of the number of indigenous manufacturing firms with a turnover in Ireland in excess of £100 million (from 16 in 1989 to 32 in 1999) was based on sector by sector analysis of the likely and desirable structural changes in indigenous industry by the end of the decade.</P>

    <P>The achievement of this target is also closely related to the attainment of the scale of export growth projected in the Plan.  The Plan projects an increase in indigenous exports from £3.7 billion in 1992 to £6.8 billion in 1999 (1992 prices).</P>

    <P>I am informed that statistics differentiating between industrial and nonindustrial start-ups are not readily available in respect of the agencies/groups, other than IDA and SFADCo, involved in this area.</P>
    <P>In terms of the future, the County Enterprise Boards (CEBs) which I recently announced, will be the primary source for generating industrial start-ups. The CEBs will seek to tape the employment opportunities in their individual localities and to encourage local-based start-ups including industrial start-ups by providing grants, support and advice to small commercially viable projects.</P>

      <P>The level of payments to participants on the Social Employment Scheme is pitched above that to which such persons would be entitled had they remained on the Live Register.  Accordingly, persons on the scheme are compensated for the loss of the extra benefits such as fuel allowance, butter vouchers etc to which they might be entitled had they remained in receipt of social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>The Community Employment Development Programme, which was introduced on a pilot basis in the twelve partnership areas designated under the Programme for Economic and Social Progress strategy to combat long term unemployment, provides, <i>inter alia,</i> for the retention of social welfare benefits by participants.  The reason for this and for the other special measures operating in these areas is, as indicated in the Dáil by the Taoiseach on 7 October, 1992, to reduce some of the disincentive effects which attach to the removal of welfare benefits from persons in the areas and categories in question when they obtain employment or take up a training or employment scheme opportunity.</P>

      <Quest>whether, the requirement under the Companies Act, 1990, that a person who obtains an interest of 5 per cent or more of the shares in a public limited company must give notice to the company is proving excessively onerous in view of the fact that failure to comply renders the transaction unenforceable; and if he will make changes such as those operating in the UK where the penalty for noncompliance is a normal offence under the law rather than one that renders the transaction unenforceable.</Quest>

      <P>Chapter 2 of Part IV of the Companies Act, 1990, which deals specifically with disclosure of holdings in public limited companies, is designed to promote greater disclosure, so that all parties interested in a particular public limited company can act on the basis of the availability of the greatest amount of information.  The disclosure requirements in themselves are not particularly onerous.</P>
      <P>Section 79 of the Act contains both civil and criminal sanctions for failure to comply.  Section 79 (1) provides that parties who fail to comply with the relevant disclosure requirements are liable to criminal sanctions.  However, it is possible that certain parties would be prepared to run the risk of prosecution and payment of a fine if, in the long run, they derived benefit from their actions.</P>
      <P>The civil sanction contained in section 79 (3), which provides that a person who has failed to make the requisite disclosure cannot enforce any right or interests which he may have, by action or legal proceedings, is considered to be an important buttress to ensuring that the disclosure requirements in this Part of the Companies Act, 1990 are complied with, and I do not propose to repeal them.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may wish to be aware that, with the approach of the deadline of 30 September 1992 for the notification of existing agreements, the Competition Authority waived the requirement that the Annex to Form CA (containing the information supporting the request for a certificate or licence) be submitted with each notification.  Of the nearly 1,050 notifications received at that time, over 900 did not submit an annex.  All that they submitted was a completed form (2 page) and a copy of the relevant agreement. Of that 900, only 35 to 40 have since submitted a completed Annex.</P>
      <P>It is only when the Authority is examining individual notifications that it requests information from the notifying parties.  No party has been requested to present files to the Authority.  Parties have been requested to submit specific information only.  This process, to date, has probably involved 35 parties.

      <P>The central objective of the <i>National Development Plan 1994-1999,</i> is the creation of more employment opportunities.  The Plan features an increased emphasis on harnessing local initiative through a new Local Development Plan.</P>
      <P>One of the elements of the Local Development Programme in the <i>National Development Plan 1994-1999,</i> is the extension of the Area Based Response to Long-Term Unemployment. The Area Based Response is a pilot initiative introduced under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> Partnership companies were established in twelve designated areas to promote integrated measures to support job creation, training and education opportunities targeted on the long term unemployed or those in danger of becoming long term unemployed.  Under the Local Development Programme the area based partnership approach is to be extended.  The number and location of areas to be selected is under examination and will be a matter for discussion with the European Commission.</P>
      <P>The establishment of County Enterprise Boards represents a further element of the Local Development Programme. Under the Programme, the County Enterprise Boards have been given clear enterprise and job-creation objectives. They will not have any specific remit in relation to training and education as had originally been envisaged when the report of the Interdepartmental Group was completed in November 1992.  The provision of training through the medium of community-based initiatives remains a significant feature of FÁS activity throughout the country.</P>

In accordance with that Act, the area committees were consulted by the area managers in the preparation of the report but, in their statutory submissions to me, neither Dublin Corporation, Dublin County Council nor the Fingal area committee put forward proposals for any further boundary alterations.</P>

      <P>Under the 1993 tenant purchase scheme, tenants of local authority dwellings, with certain limited exceptions, are entitled to purchase their dwellings.  Substantial discounts, from a minimum of £3,000 up to 30 per cent of the value of the dwelling, are provided in order to bring purchase within the reach of tenants.  As in the case of previous purchase schemes, only those who can afford the repayments will be in a position to purchase.  Mortgage <Col N="102" /> loans to finance the full nett purchase price, that is, after discounts and allowances, may be obtained from either the local authority or a commercial mortgage lender.  However, any tenant who does not obtain a loan from a commercial lender may apply to the local authority, and it is a matter for the authority in each case to decide if the applicant has the means of making the loan repayments.</P>

This involves re-routing the link main through an area which would be served by the proposed Ballahantourigh, Counguilla and Canker scheme.

      <P>In the period 1990 to 1992, special road grants amounting to £1.285 million were provided towards the cost of work on sections of the Fonthill-Newlands Road.  A further provision has been made in this year's allocations, including £75,000 for public lighting on Fonthill Road.</P>
      <P>The sections of the road which remain to be provided are between Neilstown and Nangor Road and between Boot Road and the Naas Road.  Proposals were received in my Department from Dublin County Council on 18 October last for the appointment of consultants for the detailed design of the Neilstown to Nangor Road section; these are at present under examination.  A compulsory purchase order has been prepared by the county council for the acquisition of land for the construction of a new road from Boot Road to the Naas Road-New Road junction.  A public local inquiry has been held into objections made against confirmation of the order and I will determine the matter as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The question of providing special road grants towards the cost of the remaining road works will be considered in the context of the determination of the road grant allocations for future years.</P>

      <P>Following the publication in 1991 of the report by the Institute of Fiscal Studies on the role of central grants in local finance, a second phase study by the IFS was commissioned to examine options for the distribution of the rate support grant.  A report on this study was published in May 1992 and sent to each local authority for their views.  Most local authorities made observations on the report's findings, some favouring implementation of the recommendations in one form or another, and others wholly opposing them.  This polarisation of views is directly related to the predicted outcome of a redistribution of grant allocations which was outlined in the report. Many authorities suggested that the report's findings, which were based on analysis of the 1991 spending estimates only, needed to be tested on more than one year's spending to establish conclusive indications of the extent of redistribution that might arise.  I agreed with this view and asked my Department to undertake a further analysis of the distribution <Col N="105" /> criteria by reference to the 1993 local authority estimates.  The initial results of this further analysis are under consideration at present.</P>

      <P>By-Law (No. 4) Dungarvan Bay, dated 4 July 1849 governs the size and type of nets permitted in the area referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The by-law:</P>
      <P>(i) (a)  Prohibits the use of trammel and every other fixed or moored net (except bag or other nets for taking salmon) in Durgarvan Bay, within the space lying between a line passing due east and west through the northernmost point of Helvick Head, and a line passing due east and west through the southernmost point of Ballinacourty Head, Co. Waterford.</P>
      <P>(b)  Provides that, to the north and east of the line through Ballinacourty Head, and to the south and west of the line through Helvick Head, such trammel or moored nets may be set and remain set in the water between 3 p.m. and the following 9 a.m. during January, March, October, November and December in each year, and between 5 a.m. and the following 7 a.m. during the months of May to September inclusive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(ii) (a) Prohibits having such nets athwart or within 200 yards (182.38m) of any boat which at the time of setting <Col N="108" /> such net is moored and the crew thereof engaged in line fishing.</P>
    <P>(b)  Provides that at least one floating buoy or board, upon which is painted in legible characters not less that one inch (2.54cm) in length, in white upon black ground, the letter of the District and the name of the net's owner, be attached to every train of such trammel or moored nets.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Of more relevance to contemporary fishing activities is EC Regulation 3094/86 and amendments thereto, which lays down technical measures for the conservation of fishery resources.  This regulation provides that in respect of any trawls, Danish Seine or similar towed net, the mesh shall be a minimum size of 80mm.</P>

      <P>Aggregate farm income increased by 33 per cent in nominal terms between 1987 and 1992, taking 1987 as the base year.  This would represent an increase in real terms (taking inflation into account) of 16 per cent.  The rise in farm income between 1991 and 1992 was 18 per cent.  The indications are that farm incomes will increase substantially again this year, but the exact level of increase remains dependent on prices and output in the main commodity areas, particularly the beef sector for the remainder of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The estimates for aggregate incomes <Col N="109" /> are taken from CSO data.  The CSO does not publish estimates of incomes on a sector by sector basis.</P>
    <P>Estimates of family farm income levels for the different main farming systems are provided in the annual Teagasc National Farm Survey.  The Survey includes about 1,400 farms and is selected to represent the major systems of farming and also to be representative of all sizes of farms within these systems.</P>

      <P>Ireland has experienced very strong export growth since the mid-1980s and now enjoys a sizeable trade surplus with almost all of the countries of continental Europe.

    <P>Despite this satisfying position, I believe that there is still potential for increased penetration of the European markets.  An Bord Tráchtála now offers <Col N="114" /> a wide range of services and schemes to indigenous Irish firms to help them explore new markets and market segments on continental Europe.  Among its schemes to help the Irish business person in the European market are three initiatives I announced earlier this year.  These are:</P>
    <P>&mdash;Europlace &mdash; under which ABT pays two thirds of the costs to a firm of appointing additional overseas based salespersons in the continental European markets;</P>
    <P>&mdash; Marketlink &mdash; under which ABT contributes towards the cost of the appointment of a home based person to liaise with overseas market contacts; and</P>
    <P>&mdash; Selling in Europe &mdash; financial support for persons and companies establishing themselves in order to represent Irish manufacturers in continental European markets.</P>
    <P>In addition, I have recently been to the Czech Republic, Slovakia, the Russian Federation and Ukraine as part of a strategy to help advance Irish interests in Central and Eastern Europe which offers significant new opportunities for Irish business expertise.</P>

    <P>On 30 June 1989 agreements were concluded between the Minister for Energy on the one hand and Tara Exploration and Development Company Limited and Tara Mines Limited on the other for the sale of the State 25 per cent shareholding in the latter company and in respect of the State's royalty entitlement of 4.5 per cent of the profits of the company as computed by the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="118" /> for Corporation Profits Tax purposes.  The total consideration for the elements of value being sold was $50 million, of which $16.1 million was deemed to be in full and final discharge of all past and future royalties due to the State.</P>
    <P>The following table shows the published figures for the total tonnage of ore extracted by Tara Mines in the years in question.  The value of ore production is subject to normal commercial confidentiality and is a matter for the company to disclose if it so wishes.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 154 and 155 together.</P>
      <P>The loss of the BSkyB satellite channels on Cablelink resulted from a dispute between the companies concerning the charges to be introduced by Sky for the relay of its channels.  For several years these channels were available to Cablelink without charge to the company or to its subscribers.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year agreement was reached between Cablelink and BSkyB for the return of a range of satellite channels to the Cablelink network.  The agreement is based on a mix of increased charges to the subscriber and locally inserted advertising on the satellite channels. Some months ago, Cablelink submitted an application to my Department seeking approval for this two-pronged approach.</P>
      <P>The two elements of the package are being examined by my Department in the context of a wide range of observations submitted by other interested parties. Despite appearances, the issues involved here are complex, especially when full account is taken of the various interests involved.</P>
      <P>In making my decision on Cablelink's proposals, my intention will be to set down policy for Cable and MMDS generally.  I am conscious of the ever changing technological environment in this area.  It is necessary to ensure that any decision will be capable of standing the test of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The policy criteria informing the decision-making process include: the <Col N="119" /> interests of subscribers in relation to the cost of the service, its quality and the range of TV channels available; the financial viability of Cable and MMDS licensees; the impact of the proposals on other media interests.  I would hope to be in a position to make an announcement on Cablelink's proposals in the near future.</P>

      <P>An initial allocation of some £77.205 million was made available by my Department to the Midland Health Board this year to provide services for which the board has responsibility, which includes the hospital, details of which have been supplied by the Deputy.  In addition to this initial allocation approximately £1.7 million extra has been made available this year to the Midland Health Board.  The funding provided by my Department to the board includes provision for additional and enhanced services, such as the waiting list initiative, the phased implementation of the EC Food Hygiene and Foodstuffs Directives, the Nursing Homes Act, 1990, the Child Care Act, 1991, and the provision of services for the mentally handicapped.  All proposals for the development of services are looked at and will continue to be looked at as sympathetically as possible by my Department having regard to competing service demands, the availability of financial resources and applicable personnel criteria.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that considerable financial resources have been made available to the Midland Health Board this year.  No information is currently available to my Department which suggests other than that sufficient resources have been provided by my Department to the board to allow it to ensure that adequate staffing levels in the hospital in question obtain.</P>

    <P>* £360,000 is to be paid on 28 October 1993 and the balance in mid-November.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="124" /> In this regard I have now secured agreement in principle with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, to a refinancing package which will address the problem of outstanding payments. The details of the package are now being finalised by our two Departments.  I am hopeful that the cash position will be considerably eased in the near future.</P>
    <P>Additional funding has been made available to each of the health boards to implement the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990.  Subvention payments will be made when health boards have assessed and qualified those applying for a subvention and when nursing homes are registered under the new Act.  I understand that steady progress is being made in the Mid-Western Health Board on both these issues.</P>

My Department is discussing with both the ESB and Telecom Éireann ways and means of exploiting technological developments so as to continue to achieve improved efficiencies.</P>

    <P>The recommendations of the interdepartmental group in relation to the <Col N="130" /> development of a range of child care and family support services will be pursued by the EHB in the context of its responsibilities under the Child Care Act, 1991.

This special allocation is being used to fund a major programme of new developments which will greatly strengthen the capacity of the health boards to respond to children and families in need.</P>
    <P>Funding has been made available to the health board for the development of an integrated family-school project in North Clondalkin.

      <P>The methods of payment of pension entitlements made available to retired employees of health boards are a matter for each individual health board.</P>
      <P>The Midland Health Board, the NorthWestern Health Board, the Southern Health Board, and the South-Eastern Health Board have facilities in place which allow for retired employees to opt to receive their pension entitlements by bank transfer.  The Eastern Health Board has such a facility in place for retired employees receiving payment on a monthly or fortnightly basis.  Bank time scheduling restrictions have meant that the Eastern Health Board is not yet in a position to offer this facility to retired employees paid on a weekly basis.  The Mid-Western Health Board does not have a bank transfer option generally available for their retired employees at present but it is the board's intention to offer such an option from early next year. The North-Eastern Health Board does not have a bank transfer option available at present for retired employees but the board intends making such an option available to their retired employees by early next year through the introduction of the Pay Path System.  The Western Health Board does not operate a Pay Path System.  Retired employees in receipt of a pension are paid on a current basis.  Arrangements are made by the board with pensioners who may take long vacations abroad from time to time to have their cheques paid into their bank accounts.</P>

      <P>I understand that the ultra sound facility available to GPs in the Mater Hospital has been withdrawn on a temporary basis.  This is due to an increase in the number of referrals which has resulted in an unsatisfactory waiting period for patients awaiting ultra sound.  The hospital is dealing with all current in-patient and out-patient referrals.  All emergency referrals continue to be handled immediately.</P>
      <P>The Mater Hospital is working to clear the current ultra sound waiting list so that routine GP referrals can be accepted again.  The hospital is endeavouring to increase the ultra sound throughput to meet the increase in referrals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be helpful to the Deputy if I set out the procedures for qualifying for a subvention under the recently commenced nursing home legislation.  A person applying for a subvention to a health board is first assessed to establish whether or not he or she is sufficiently dependent to require care in a nursing home.  Under the Regulations, there are three maximum rates of subvention which may be paid to a person depending on whether his or her level of dependency is maximum, high or medium.</P>
      <P>If a person is sufficiently dependent to require nursing home care, the health board will assess his or her income and assets to establish whether or not the person can pay the cost of nursing home care.  The Regulations provide that a person whose means do not exceed the non-contributory old age pension will qualify for the maximum rate of subvention related to his or her level of dependency.</P>
      <P>A health board may only inquire into the income of a son or daughter of the applicant if the board has decided that the person qualifies for a nursing home subvention.  A health board's inquiries are confined to sons or daughters aged 21 years of age and over residing in the jurisdiction.  The purpose of such inquiries is to establish whether or not a son or daughter is in a position to contribute towards the cost of a parent's care in a nursing home.</P>
      <P>The legislation does not oblige sons and daughters to contribute towards the cost of a mother or father's care in a nursing home.  The successful applicant remains entitled to a subvention irrespective of a son or daughter's capacity or willingness to contribute.  However, a health board may take the ability of a son or daughter to contribute into account in deciding the amount of subvention to pay the person who has qualified for a subvention.</P>

      <P>An application for grant aid towards the provision of a Sports Hall for St. John of God Secondary School, Kilmore Road, was received in 1983. However, because of the financial constraints which have existed for a number of years it has not yet been possible to make funding available for the provision of physical education facilities at the school in question.  Due to demands on the capital resources available, priority has been given for some time to the provision of essential teaching spaces.</P>
      <P>The provision of indoor sports accommodation in schools, in the form of a general purpose area at primary level and a hall at secondary level will resume as soon as pressure on available resources for urgent classroom accommodation has eased.  In the meantime, additional emphasis is being placed on the adjacent siting and common use of school and community recreational facilities and schools should make maximum use of other sports facilities in their area.</P>
      <P>There are no funds available to my Department from the proceeds of the national lottery under which consideration could be given to grant aid the cost of the rental of a community hall by the school.</P>

However, as they are attending a different school, the question of grant-aid does not arise.  The children of the second family are not eligible for grant-aid, as they live under three miles from their nearest appropriate school.</P>

      <P>I have had no complaints of exploitation on these courses.  The Deputy can be assured that my Department will investigate fully any complaints of exploitation made in regard to this or any other course operated under its aegis.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 190 to 198, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The views expressed in the report of the Interdepartmental Group on Urban Crime and Disorder on the importance of education, including vocational education and training, reflect the views which inform the ongoing policy of my Department.  The report outlined in detail the education services being provided in the area, including initiatives in the area of non-formal education, and the extent to which additional resources are being targeted towards the disadvantaged in this and other similar areas.</P>
      <P>I consider the issue of greater access to quality education services to be an essential component in any strategy to address the problems of areas such as Ronanstown.  As the Deputy will be aware, the report of the Interdepartmental Group which studied this issue, acknowledged and welcomed the emphasis which my Department places on the need to support the disadvantaged and the value of initiatives taken, such as the disadvantaged areas scheme and home-school community liaison scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this connection, I should point out that already in the North Clondalkin <Col N="151" /> area, there are ten primary schools which are included in the disadvantaged areas scheme.  All of these schools receive supplementary capitation grant support at the rate of £17 per pupil and are also allocated <i>ex-quota</i> concessionary teaching posts.  In addition, all of the schools in question are included in the home-school community liaison scheme.  In fact, the area in question enjoys above average coverage in terms of home-school community liaison, in that six of the ten schools mentioned have their own home-school community liaison co-ordinator devoted full-time to their needs.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that, in line with the commitment contained in the Programme for a Partnership Government, it is my intention to continue to target resources on disadvantaged areas. Already in 1993, an additional 50 primary schools have been included in the disadvantaged areas scheme and an additional 27 schools have been included in the home-school community liaison scheme.  I have also recently announced that the home-school community liaison scheme, which previously operated on a pilot basis, has now been put on a permanent footing.  It is my intention to build further on these developments in the coming years to ensure that children in areas such as Ronanstown are given every possible help to participate in and benefit fully from the education system.</P>
    <P>I should also point out that the question of access to education in disadvantaged areas is one of the issues examined by the Special Education Review Committee, which reported to me very recently.  I can assure the Deputy that I will be giving careful consideration to the committee's recommendations in considering what further measures can be introduced to ensure that the needs of children in disadvantaged areas are fully addressed.</P>
    <P>Since the publication of the report of the Interdepartmental Group the following initiatives have been taken in the adult education and youth work services areas:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="152" />&mdash; An additional 20 VTOS places have been allocated to the overall Clondalkin area, including Ronanstown, bringing the total to 60 in Ronanstown and 80 in the overall Clondalkin area.  Eligibility for the scheme was broadened to include lone parents and others not perviously included.</P>
    <P>&mdash; The allocation for adult literacy work in the Ronanstown area under the adult litereacy and community education scheme was increased from £20,800 to £45,000.  An additional amount of £17,000 was allocated for the provision of second-chance education for disadvantaged members of the community including financial support for participation in the Department of Social Welfare second level scheme, financial assistance towards fees for adult education courses and financial support for community adult education initiatives.</P>
    <P>&mdash; The Department has given approval to the County Dublin vocational education committee for the operation of a pilot grant scheme for local voluntary youth groups engaged in direct youth work in Ronanstown. The scheme is to be administered and monitored by the Ronanstown Youth Service.  The sum of £6,000 has been allocated for the scheme.</P>
    <P>In regard to the matter of school truancy, the report, in response to local suggestions, acknowledged that there was, at present, no provision in law for the appointment of specialist school attendance officers in the county area.</P>
    <P>The report referred to the fact that a full examination of the truancy problem generally was being conducted by the Department of Education and supported the role, meantime, of the neighbourhood gardaí in Ronanstown who are actually the school attendance officers under existing legislation.  This examination of the truancy problem generally is continuing actively in my Department <Col N="153" /> in the context of the review of the School Attendance Act.</P>
    <P>In relation to the family-school project referred to in section 4E (3) of the report, the report welcomed the response of the Eastern Health Board, indicating its willingness to undertake development of the project.  My Department has conveyed its willingness to provide a teaching post as part of the staffing of the project.</P>

      <P>A number of papers presented to the convention dealt at some length with the special needs area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, as part of the analysis of issues sessions which took place during the convention, separate consideration was given to the special education area by a group comprised of parents, teachers and schools management.  This group also had the benefit of an input from the chairman of the special education review committee whose detailed report on the special education area was recently presented to the Minister.  A comprehensive report on the outcome of this session was presented to the convention <Col N="154" /> and will provide a valuable input into the planning of future provision for the special education area.</P>
    <P>I should also point out that I intend to hold a one-day seminar devoted entirely to the special needs area on 6 December next.  With this in mind, I am arranging to make the report of the special education review committee available in advance to all interested parties so as to facilitate a full debate on this very important area.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 201 and 202 together.  The information required by the Deputy is given in tabular form.  The data is in respect of two consecutive school-years, that is 1991-92 and 1992-93.  Statistical data in respect of the current school-year are only in the process of collection from the approximately 3,200 national schools throughout the country and it will be some time before corresponding information is available in respect of 1993-94.</P>
      <P>To conform to statistical norms and to maintain consistency with the format in which data are presented in my Department's annual statistical report, the class-size bands differ slightly from those indicated by the Deputy in his question.</P>
