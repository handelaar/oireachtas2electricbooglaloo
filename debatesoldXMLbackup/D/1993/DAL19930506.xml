    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 3 and 4.</P>
      <P>It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that:</P>
      <P>1.  Business shall be interrupted at 4.45 p.m. today.</P>
      <P>2.  The proceedings on the Second Stage of No. 3, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 4.45 p.m.</P>
      <P>3.  In the case of the resumed debate on No. 4, the speech of each Member called on shall not exceed 20 minutes in each case.</P>
      <P>I would also add that I would like the Whips to come together after the Order of Business to arrange for a statement to be made by the Minister for Finance in relation to the sale of Greencore shares, which, I am sure, is of concern to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>May I now ask if the proposal that business be interrupted at 4.45 p.m. this evening is satisfactory and agreed?  Agreed.  Is it agreed that the proceedings on Second Stage of No. 3 shall conclude at 4.45 p.m. today? Agreed.  Are the proposals for dealing <Col N="770" /> with item No. 4, the resumed budget debate, satisfactory and agreed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox:</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the budget debate, will it be possible for this House, in view of the budgetary implications of the matter raised by the Taoiseach, to debate rather than simply have statements on the sale of Greencore shares? It is not satisfactory that one is not entitled to have answers to questions in the Statements procedure.  This House was assured by the Minister for Finance as recently as 36 hours ago that he was completely satisfied with the sale of Greencore shares and he congratulated the stockbrokers on how they had handled the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates:</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am making is that there should be an opportunity to have some element of question and answer in this debate as opposed to statements which would not shed full light on what has happened.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a Private Notice Question tabled on this matter, and I am sure other Deputies have also.  I take it the Taoiseach is leaving open the opportunity for the Whips to agree statements. It is a serious matter that the Government entrusted with running the country cannot even manage to sell off bits of it efficiently.  I am sure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I was trying to obey your ruling, Sir, that we should not interrupt when you were in the middle of reading out the Order of Business, but others got in ahead of me.  I welcome the fact that at last the Taoiseach has agreed at last to allow statements in the House.  I hope that is the agreement that will be arrived at between the meetings of the Whips.  I agree with other Deputies that a straight statement form of debate will not be sufficient to investigate the gravity of the situation <i>vis-á-vis</i> the suspension of the Greencore shares.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa:</NameTxt>
      <P>May I clarify, before we agree to this arrangement, that we are not being asked to choose between questions or statements, that we will have an opportunity to question the Minister if we agree to statements being taken today?  It is not a matter of either or.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not put any restrictions on what type of debate the Whips will agree to; it is a matter for all parties to agree.  If Deputy Rabbitte has tabled a Private Notice Question, we are not trying to sidestep it; he is free to ask his questions on it.  So too is everybody who has tabled a Private Notice Question. I cannot for the life of me understand what Deputy Owen is trying to insinuate when she said that at last the Taoiseach had agreed.  The Taoiseach was not even asked.  He came into the House and offered to arrange for a statement to be made by the Minister for Finance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>The only satisfactory way of dealing with a matter like this is by way of a debate.  If statements are made here, the opening statement will be made by the Minister of Finance.  He will give his version of events.  Other Deputies will then speak.  They will raise various questions, but there will not be a reply by the Minister for Finance to those questions.  That is not satisfactory.  It is not possible to elucidate fully&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid their hands might be tied before they commence their discussions.  The Taoiseach intervened a couple of times to say that if Private Notice Questions are tabled, he would be willing to take them.  My concern is that if, when the Whips meet, Private Notice Questions are down that will be the only method of elucidation.  I want to be sure that the Whips will be able to allow both to take place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is on exactly the same matter.  I concur with Deputy O'Malley. During your service in this House, you have seen it move from being a debating Chamber to one where Deputies come in and read out statements.  Deputies on the Opposition side of this House find it unsatisfactory that matters are dealt with by way of statements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa:</NameTxt>
      <P>When I adjourned the debate the other night I was referring to the funding of RTE.  I pointed out that in regard to the funding of broadcasting the United Kingdom is the exception in the way it funds its broadcasting services and that nearly all small and medium sized countries finance their national broadcasting by a combination of licence fees and advertising as we do here.</P>
      <P>The increased profitability of RTE has not been achieved on the backs of licence payers, RTE has not had to resort to the taxpayers to fund its development.  The workforce in RTE have not been paid any productivity increases and wages have been tied to national agreements. Profits have been reinvested to provide a substantial increases in home produced programmes.  State of the art production equipment was acquired and the regional network of studios expanded.</P>
      <P>That is not to say that there are not shortcomings in the service or that RTE should be exempted from criticism. Industrial relations have often been difficult and the prolonged dispute early last year lost it viewers and listeners.  Home produced television drama of any description is missing from RTE services with the exception of soaps such as &ldquo;Fair City&rdquo; and &ldquo;Glenroe&rdquo;.  The scrapping of &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; was a mistake, and the patchwork quilt range of programmes designed to replace it have not made the same impact.</P>
      <P>There are times when RTE's responsibilities as a public service broadcaster seem to take second place to its need to compete with the purely commercial sector.  This dual role creates difficulties for RTE.  There are demands that it meets the highest standards of public service broadcasting, as is right, yet we also want it to be popular, commercially successful and to make profits.  We have rarely debated what we want RTE to be and successive governments, particularly Fianna Fáil Administrations, have been ultra-sensitive about a genuinely independent news and current affairs service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="778" /> I suspect that many Fianna Fáil Ministers have never moved beyond the view expressed by the late Seán Lemass in 1966 when he described RTE as &ldquo;an instrument of public policy and as such responsible to the Government.&rdquo;  The 1990 Act was the latest in a series of attempts to brow-beat or intimidate RTE into an acceptable level of subservience. The current Minister is well disposed to RTE and was one of the most vigorous opponents of the ill-conceived 1990 legislation. Nevertheless, I am concerned about some aspects of the Bill he has introduced.  The removal of the cap on advertising is welcome and I support, in principle, the fostering of the independent programme-making sector.</P>
    <P>A handful of people involved in the production of work for commercial film making have given this country a formidable reputation in regard to contemporary cinema, although it must be said that while the artistic inspiration has been largely Irish, the money to back up productions has come mainly from abroad.  Producing for the commercial cinema normally requires multi-million pound budgets, but television productions can be mounted for more modest sums.  We have a corps of talented young independent film and programme makers who at present have very restricted outlets for their work.  Greater use by RTE of the independent sector will foster that talent and provide revenue which will hopefully contribute towards the development of a wider Irish film industry. I take issue with the Minister's use of the phraseology &ldquo;exploitation of talent&rdquo; in the area of film-making.</P>

      <P>I appreciate what he is saying but I have grave reservations about the idea that either talent or people should be exploited in the commonly understood meaning of that term.  I accept that it was probably a slip of the pen but nevertheless it is important to bear in mind that the language we use <Col N="779" /> in relation to broadcasting and arts and culture generally has tended to become suffused with this idea of exploitation, the idea that the only reason for having it is to create a few low paid jobs.  I know the Minister will agree that the role of broadcasting in regard to arts and culture has a much wider implication for the quality of citizens' lives generally.  That is one of the reasons the arts squads that have developed around Dublin, in particular, are important because they help people to develop their talents in areas which are normally not considered to play any role in regard to arts and culture.</P>
      <P>Clearly there are problems involved for RTE.  Twenty per cent of its television programme expenditure, most of which goes on in house productions at present, will now be spent in the private sector. What are the implications of this for jobs in RTE?  Will the Minister indicate if that matter has been examined?  Will RTE have to make staff redundant?  Has the Minister discussed the contents of this Bill with either RTE management or the trade unions?  What will be the purpose of the exercise if it simply means that programme makers directly employed by RTE lose their jobs and have to seek employment in the private sector?  The staff currently employed in RTE are concerned about those issues.  I hope we are not on our way to seeing RTE becoming merely a transmitting and commissioning agency for programmes produced by others &mdash; the role Channel 4 fills in the United Kingdom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill place rigid and inflexible obligations on RTE in regard to the amount of money it has to allocate for programmes in the independent sector, although the Minister has indicated that they are not inflexible or absolute because of the use of the words &ldquo;where practicable&rdquo; in the legislation.  I would like that to be teased out on Committee Stage.  RTE is doing well at present and will probably be able to bear the cost.  What will happen if RTE hits a difficult patch and there is a collapse in advertising revenue in the next few years?  Would it be in a position to come <Col N="780" /> up with, for example, £10 million in 1998? Surely there should be some qualification of this obligation and some provision made in case RTE hits unforeseen difficulties.</P>
    <P>In the very week in which the Government published its response to the Cullition report and indicated its acceptance of the recommendation that State enterprises should be able to pursue agreed strategies and business plans without excessive bureaucratic controls or interference, the Minister is taking powers in this Bill which will greatly circumscribe RTE's commercial flexibility and give him considerable powers over the operation of the station.  I recognise that, as the Minister stated in his opening speech, he is putting back in place what existed previously, but that is not an argument for doing it.  I ask him to indicate his thinking in this regard.</P>
    <P>I hope this Bill will not turn out to be a Trojan horse which will create problems for RTE without producing the desired stimulus for the independent production sector.  I am on the record of this House as congratulating the Tánaiste for appointing Deputy Higgins as Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, which covers broadcasting.  I have no doubt he will approach those briefs with the best of intentions and with most enlightened views.  However, Ministers come and Ministers go, but legislation tends to stay forever and, although certain constraints would apply, it can be used in whatever way a Minister of the day chooses.  We are not passing legislation to fit the Minister.  We should be passing legislation to ensure that the area with which we are dealing is properly regulated and that the regulation is as invisible as possible.</P>
    <P>While it is not a matter covered by this Bill, it would be dishonest to debate the position of RTE without making some reference to section 31 of the Broadcasting Act, which comes under the responsibility of the current Minister.  It is important that we refer to that, especially in the light of the recent Supreme Court judgment regarding the <Col N="781" /> interpretation by RTE of the ministerial directive.  I have tabled questions in this regard on a number of occasions and have been told that the Minister does not have responsibility.  He has responsibility for making the order but apparently he has no responsibility in regard to how RTE implements that order or the guidelines which it establishes.  I have pressed on a number of occasions for a full Dáil debate on section 31, but the ministerial order has been renewed year in and year out without any reference to the Dáil.  The issues raised by section 31 are far from straightforward, but it is simply unacceptable that an order which has such sweeping implications for broadcasting should be renewed each year by the stroke of a ministerial pen.  There is no provision for debating such regulations unless in Private Members' time.  Even then it would be doubtful whether decisions made in Private Members' time could be enforced.</P>
    <P>It is now more than 16 years since section 31 of the Broadcasting Act was amended and the order introduced in its present form.  It has been renewed in January of each year since then by ministerial order and the Dáil has never been given the opportunity to discuss the matter on any of those 16 occasions when it has been passed by this House.  Section 31 deals with an enormously complex area where there are few simple answers. It is not easy to balance the general right of free speech and freedom of information against the need to ensure that the airwaves are not used to promote or incite further sectarian violence or hatred.  Section 31, however, provides extraordinary powers for the Minister which have by default become a permanent fixture of broadcasting policy.  It would be useful if when replying to this debate the Minister indicated that he was prepared to provide for a debate on section 31.  Perhaps this could take place at committee level, now that a number of legislative committees are up and running. It may be possible to debate this matter at committee level prior to the matter coming up for renewal next January. The matter could then be dealt with <Col N="782" /> by the Minister in the light of the debate that takes place.</P>
    <P>I have indicated outside this House &mdash; I have not had the opportunity inside the House &mdash; that the situation today is not the same as that which obtained in 1976. The current amended form of section 31 was introduced shortly after the murder of the British Ambassador in Dublin by a massive bomb detonated by the Provisional IRA.  There was a fairly ambiguous attitude among the public generally towards the activities of the Provisional IRA at the time.  I can well understand the fears of the Minister of the day in relation to giving their representatives a free run of the airwaves.</P>
    <P>However, two matters have come about over the years because of this. First, RTE has tended to engage in self-censorship as a result of the operation of section 31.  Second, because the RTE authorities or individual producers felt that certain views should be expressed, rather than getting a spokesperson from Provisional Sinn Féin to express those views they tended to get people who had similar views but who were not publicly or openly associated with Sinn Féin to express those views on the airwaves.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In general it would be better to have spokespersons who are clearly identifiable as members of Sinn Féin substantiating their position on radio or television rather than allowing people who are at least nominally seen as spokespersons for them express those views. Therefore to some extent the public is <Col N="783" /> being misled by those views and the source of them.</P>
    <P>This is not a simple issue to resolve. We must have a debate on the matter among the Deputies of this House.  I would appreciate if the Minister could provide an opportunity for such a debate either in this House or at committee level.</P>

      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for affording me the opportunity to contribute to this debate and I congratulate the Minister on bringing forward this legislation.  It is at least an indication of his consistency in this matter.  He has been active in the area of broadcasting dating back to 1978 and 1979 when Labour Party policy on broadcasting was formulated.</P>
      <P>During the passage of the 1990 Bill the Minister was one of the more vociferous opponents of the cap on RTE which, in effect, indicated to the RTE authorities that they were allowed only so much funding from advertising.  This was a strange decision.  If we were to direct any of the other State commercial organisations that they could earn only a certain amount of money we would meet with strong resistance from them.  There was resistance from RTE, but unfortunately it was not sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To put this debate into context it is necessary to refer to the debate on the 1990 Bill.  I have in my possession a copy of an amendment tabled by Deputy De Rossa and the former Deputy Pat McCartan regarding the definition of &ldquo;advertising&rdquo;. Deputies spent three days teasing out the precise definition of &rdquo;advertising&rdquo; and what constituted advertising.  We debated whether RTE would be in breach of the cap guidelines if, for instance, it were to advertise its own programmes. It was an unusual debate, to say the least.  At that time people seemed to be set on the demise of RTE despite the service it had provided down through the years.  Regardless of the restrictions of the cap RTE has proved beyond doubt that it can be viable and profitable. However, there is a need for RTE to <Col N="784" /> examine its position.  This is not a new idea.  I will now quote from a document known as RTE's Free Press Access. There is a quotation in this document from the late Deputy Frank Cluskey to the effect that RTE needs to be shaken up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <P>The date of publication is 21 February 1985.  It states:</P>
      <P>While it is supportive of the concept of public service broadcasting, there is a feeling within the Labour Party that RTE needs to be shaken up and become an outward-looking and independent-minded broadcasting service.</P>
      <P>At that time the late Deputy Cluskey stressed the need for independence within RTE.  I do not believe that the Minister in this legislation is trying to interfere with that independence.  The fears that have been expressed here are unfounded.  If one were to carry out research and refer back to the 1990 debate one would see that some of the amendments tabled in my name were intended to ensure the quality, independence and impartiality of programmes produced and transmitted by the Authority.  That still prevails today and I have no doubt that is precisely what the present Minister is trying to achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now intend to quote from two recent newspaper extracts to obtain a clearer picture in regard to this matter.  There is a fear on this occasion that the reports of RTE will have to be debated in this House.  That is a legitimate view.  Reports should be tabled here and made available to this House.  If that had been the practice <Col N="785" /> in other sectors of commercial State enterprises some of the scandals of recent times could have been avoided.  If it had been possible for Ministers and Deputies to debate those issues I have no doubt that some of the events of recent times would not have occurred.</P>
    <P>On 4 January 1993 <i>The Irish Times</i> said that RTE is said to expect a shortfall of £5 million this year if the Government does not lift the limit on advertising revenue imposed about two years ago.</P>
    <P>Like the Minister I am somewhat surprised at a recent article attributed to an unidentified special correspondent in that newspaper.  The big news in broadcasting is that RTE will witness steady privatisation of the production of television programmes.  RTE will increasingly become a transmission and commissioning agency for programmes produced by others.  A few years ago concern was expressed by people in the private film producing sector who feared they might lose their jobs.  It was thought that the many talented people who were ready to produce programmes on behalf of RTE would no longer be available to the Authority.  The Minister is endeavouring to address the problem in this Bill, yet we are being criticised, which is unjustified.</P>
    <P>As a result of the cap on RTE's advertising it is broadcasting programmes which are not up to the standard of those produced in the past by Cathal O'Shannon, Muiris MacChongaill and Louis Le Brocquy.  Those programmes were produced by RTE and raised the standard of broadcasting.  They gave us a place in the world market but they have gone.  We now broadcast chat shows and panel games, an easy fix as it were.  We should give talented people the scope to contribute to RTE.  The threat that existed to RTE in 1990 in regard to the third TV channel no longer exists and RTE receives the full licence fees.</P>
    <P>Some of the points made by Opposition Deputies, particularly by Deputy De Rossa, were very constructive. Deputy Quill, expressed concerns in regard to this area but she was a member of the Government in 1990 who introduced this legislation.  Our party has been <Col N="786" /> in office a very short time and is now taking corrective measures in regard to this legislation.  Deputy Quill stated that there is a need for substantial legislation in this area.  The 1990 Bill, instead of setting the foundation for good broadcasting policy, has created a monster. Having been in office for a few months the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht is charged with responsibility for correcting that legislation.</P>
    <P>Fears have also been expressed by the independent radio stations.  I was critical of setting up local commercial stations, I still have some reservations in regard to them but they are a group of stations well organised and produce good programmes. The standard of broadcasting of Radio Kerry and Radio Clare exceeds that of national broadcasting.  They produce documentaries and news programmes and so on.  They do not broadcast pop music all day like other local stations, though I admit there is an audience for it.  However, that is not the type of programme it was envisaged local radios would be licensed to broadcast. We must discourage such broadcasts as we want to improve standards.  It is similar to telling people that castor oil is good for them even though they may not like the taste.  It is our duty to improve the quality of broadcasting.  I hope that measures taken by the Minister will provide for such improvement.  The independent broadcasters consider that they should be entitled to a section of the licence fee but I have a difficulty in accepting that.  Would it be legitimate for garage proprietors to claim they are entitled to a portion of the road tax to allow them to continue in business?  The independent broadcasters make their case based on the fact that RTE enjoy a monopoly because, since the foundation of the State people were reluctant to invest their money in broadcasting; perhaps there was justification for that.  RTE filled a void and they have done an excellent job.  It is important for RTE to be aggressive in its approach to broadcasting. I learned with dismay that RTE's listenership figures have reduced and that it has come under pressure from private <Col N="787" /> broadcasters.  If RTE wishes to remain in the market it will have to compete with others.</P>
    <P>Arising from the 1990 Act there is another void, that of democratically controlled local community broadcasting which did not develop.  I regret that the Independent Radio and Television Commission did not grant licences to many community stations around the country. Some of them were set up as pirate stations but provided a good service for their community.  They broadcasted on a narrow wave band and did not cause interference to existing services.  I hope the Minister will address this problem and advise the Commission that it should give favourable consideration to some of the applications.  It should grant licences on the basis that local radio stations, are accountable and will be democratically and community controlled.  The danger is that we could create a monopoly. People in the newspaper industry who feel under threat by broadcasting stations are endeavouring to control some of the stations and that is another fear I have in regard to broadcasting.  If we could distinguish between the community, as distinct from the commercial community we would provide an opportunity for people to participate.  We should bear in mind that many of the stations which were granted a licence previously were not successful.</P>
    <P>I was one of the first people who made representations to the then Minister, Dr. Conor Cruise O'Brien, who had responsibility for Posts and Telegraphs and the setting up of a Cork local radio station.  As a result of my efforts Cork local radio was established but it has not been allowed to develop to its full potential. I agree with Deputy Quill's point on this matter and I hope the Minister will make more time available to Cork local radio.  It is a highly professional, proficient organisation, but is hampered by restricted broadcasting hours.  Fears have been expressed by the newspaper industry in relation to broadcasting but they are not subject to any form of cap.  If they wish to run supplements or advertisements <Col N="788" /> they may do so; there is no limit to the amount of advertising which may be placed in newspapers.  I fail to see why they are so apprehensive of the electronic media because an IBEC survey has proved beyond doubt that there has not been a decrease in newspaper advertising in recent times resulting from local radio broadcasts or the cap on television advertising.</P>
    <P>Before I hand over to my colleague, Deputy Kemmy, I wish to make one brief point.  This Bill will be to the advantage of RTE in that its provisions will be made retrospective to September 1992.  This will be of huge financial benefit to RTE to the tune of approximately £8 million. This is to be welcomed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I belatedly congratulate my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, on his appointment.  His promotion was long overdue.  I believe Members on all sides of the House were delighted at the announcement of his appointment.  The Labour Party rejoiced that the Minister's talents had at last been recognised and that he had been given an appropriate ministry in which to exercise those talents.  As chairman of the Labour Party, I was delighted at the Minister's well deserved appointment.  I wish him a long and happy tenure of office.  He has a long involvement in the areas of arts and culture.  The Minister is an artistic person &mdash; he is a writer, poet and historian &mdash; and he has been given an appropriate ministry.  It is a sad reflection on our society that more people like the Minister have not become involved in politics.  I hope his appointment will herald a new era when artistic people like him will be given a role in future Cabinets.  I salute the work the Minister has done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately in the time available to me I can give only a brief history of broadcasting in this country.  By and large RTE, which was previously known as Radio Éireann, has given a good account of its stewardship; it has been a good station.  RTE had to deal with difficulties from the very beginning.  When the <Col N="789" /> station was set up during the thirties it was inevitably compared with the BBC, a larger station which has more resources, a worldwide network of correspondents, contacts throughout the Commonwealth and a larger audience. RTE had to compete with the BBC from the start, which was a good thing.  The BBC is the best broadcasting station in the world; it provides great variety in terms of stations and programmes.  When it was set up initially, RTE was far too cautious and conservative.  It had a Civil Service mentality and was very much part of the Civil Service.  Maurice Golden, an RTE historian, has written about this mentality.  Mervyn Wall, the secretary of the Arts Council, also referred to the mentality in the Civil Service in his book <i>No Trophies Raised</i> and many other novels.</P>
    <P>We all grew up with Radio Éireann. I have fond memories of documentary makers such as Norris Davidson, Proinsias Ó Conluain and Pat Feeley, who is still making programmes with RTE.  We need more documentaries.  The local radio stations have made very few documentaries &mdash; they have wall to wall music programmes and talk shows but not enough documentaries.  Tommy O'Brien, a great broadcaster from Clonmel, John Skehan, Andy O'Mahony and many other broadcasters have given their audiences many years of delight as natural broadcasters.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, I cannot say the same about film-making.  RTE has often been bedevilled by individuals who have tried to use the trade union movement for perverse reasons.  They have distorted the performance and image of RTE.  I will not go into this point in detail.  Deputy De Rossa would know much more about this issue than I do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">

    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">

      <P>Unfortunately, I do not have the time to do so.  The Ceann Comhairle who is watching me may give me an extra minute or two but I do not want to exceed my time.  As Deputy Deasy <Col N="790" /> knows, I am one of the most biddable Deputies in the House.</P>
      <P>Irish film-making has been bedevilled by what I call &ldquo;The Quiet Man&rdquo; syndrome &mdash; long, lingering shots of green fields, cliffs, rocks, etc.  There is nothing wrong with this &mdash; that film was followed by &ldquo;Ryan's Daughter&rdquo;.  There have been good Irish film-makers such as John Ford, a man who had a conservative outlook but who knew about film-making. He started as a labourer on film sets and eventually became a great film-maker in his own right.  He was one of the best film-makers in the history of film-making. John Heuston, who became an Irish citizen, was another great film-maker.  He lived near the Minister in County Galway.  We can learn from those people.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to films made in Ireland in recent times, for example, &ldquo;The Field&rdquo; and &ldquo;My Left Foot&rdquo;, a very important film.  Some of our actors and directors lack experience. If our films cannot be sold throughout the world, then the Irish film industry will not be successful.  Film-making is about money.  The Minister is being brave in setting-up an Irish language television station.  This station will cost money to operate.  Television and film-making are about making money and one needs to have the necessary skills, experience and training.  We can ensure that young students have these requirements by giving them the proper opportunities to learn their crafts.  However, they must also be talented.  They must be able to take a gamble and recognise good material.  There are good and bad film-makers.</P>

I know people who have been exploited by local broadcasting stations. Perhaps there are too many local radio stations.  These stations are doing their best to provide a good service, and it is important that broadcasters and documentary makers are not exploited.</P>

      <P>It is a great pity Deputy Kemmy was not allocated more time &mdash; he has probably one of the most relevant points of view of any Member in this House.  His views on a subject such as this are valued by people like me.</P>
      <P>I am somewhat confused as to why the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht is dealing with this Bill.  I thought the Bill would have come under the ambit of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.  Having said that, I am delighted that the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins, is taking this Bill as he is probably the most qualified person in this House to do so.  I am sure many Members look forward to his allocating time for himself on television to read some of his poetry.  He is not just an accomplished politician, he is also an accomplished artist in his own right.  It is fitting that he has been appointed to this ministry.  I am sure he will make an enormous success of this task &mdash; he will be like a duck in water.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am critical of some sections of the Bill.  I sympathise with the national newspapers in their battle against the television networks in that they do not have access to dual funding, as RTE has.  They have a genuine complaint about the difficulties they experience in competing with the national television service which is allowed dual funding.  When I say &ldquo;dual funding&rdquo; I mean the revenue from licence fees and advertising.  In Britain the BBC get their revenue from licence fees and the ITV from advertising, but RTE has the benefit of revenue from both sources.  Therefore newspaper proprietors here have a genuine complaint. I suspect that the quality of our newspapers is suffering as a result of their revenue being reduced because of unfair <Col N="792" /> terms of competition with RTE.  The result is that what should be quality newspapers here are becoming less so, are tending toward being tabloid.  Papers which formerly were very responsible and objective are being reduced to being frivolous resorting to the cheap gibe, particularly at politicians but at members of our society in general.  They are also resorting to what they regard as the type of publicity that will sell their papers &mdash; for example, the girl on page three &mdash; or over reliance on frivolous stories which are not really newsworthy for the people who buy the papers in order to get meaningful information.</P>
    <P>In the early stages of the Minister's introductory remarks he refers to &ldquo;Provision for access to broadcasting for the independent sector ....&rdquo;  I really do not understand what is meant by that reference.  Is the Minister referring to a third television channel under the aegis of RTE, or to a third television channel which will be independent along the lines of ITV in Britain?  It is strange that in all of the Minister's statement there is not one comment on illegal television broadcasting, which is very prevalent here. When replying perhaps the Minister would clarify the position regarding the proliferation of illegal transmitters here. I should like him to tell us &mdash; other Ministers have been evading this question in this House for years past &mdash; whether the Government is still committed to licensing the MMDS system, or will it turn the blind eye to the illegal transmitters at present in operation and allow that practice to continue?  We should like to know one way or the other what is the Government's attitude to broadcasting, legal and illegal.  It does not appear to matter that much in Dublin where all the channels are available, but it is a major issue in rural areas where most people can view foreign channels only by recourse to illegal methods, erecting illegal aerials taking signals which are poached.  That is an unsatisfactory position.  The overall position should be legitimised.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa referred at length in the course of his contribution to section 31 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, <Col N="793" /> 1960, amended by section 16 of the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1976.  The recent decision of the courts to allow members of Sinn Féin to refer to items which are not contentious, either in regard to violence or the undermining of the authority of the State, was a prudent one.  If a member of Sinn Féin is a member of a local authority and has a point to make about a local issue, that type of comment should be permitted.  It would appear that over the years a number of people in RTE have been stirring up the pot on that point with a view to getting section 31 in its totality removed from the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960.  Therefore I am glad to observe a modicum of commonsense enter the overall debate, allowing people to make a contribution which does not reflect on the authority of the State.</P>
    <P>I am puzzled by another phrase in the Minister's introductory remarks: &ldquo;Measures to ensure that commercial local radio broadcasting remains viable ...&rdquo; This demonstrates that the Minister is anxious that local radio stations remain viable.  Can the Minister give us some analysis of the performance of local radio stations?  I would have thought that some local radio stations were extremely viable and had proven to be an enormous success. Waterford local radio, WLR, is probably one of the best nationwide.  I wonder whether the Minister will give blanket assistance to all local radio stations or merely those that are in dire difficulty.  Such is not apparent from the Minister's introductory remarks.  For example, are there some local radio stations experiencing difficulty in comparison with others that are not?  The advent of local radio stations has been one of the outstanding successes in this country in recent years.</P>

      <P>Indeed, the former Minister, Deputy Ray Burke, is entitled to engage in some crawthumping, having introduced the appropriate Bill.  They have been an enormous success and have <Col N="794" /> proven to be of great assistance to local communities.</P>
      <P>Of course, there is a corresponding difficulty in that, with the success of local radio stations, provincial newspapers contend they have suffered enormously because of reduced advertising revenue. I do not know what is the answer to that, but undoubtedly it is a problem.  I think it was Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan who said they should engage in more advertising to boost their finances.  Obviously, they do not want to engage in greater advertising unless they can be assured of a greater readership.  If the listenership of local radio stations is very high then the readership of provincial papers may be reduced correspondingly.  The amount of their advertising revenue is correspondingly reduced, because an advertiser believes he will get a better return on his money by advertising on local radio.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kemmy made a vague reference to the influence of certain trade unions in RTE.  I find it alarming at times to observe the slant put on certain news items in RTE.  I strongly suspect that elements which are not representative of the population at large have an undue influence within RTE.  I should like some senior politician, preferably a Government Minister in charge of RTE, to take steps to ensure that everything is above board, and that minority groups do not have undue influence.  We should ensure total proportionality and impartiality in broadcasting since it is our most important opinion-forming medium.  I should hate to see it in the wrong hands.  I suspect that to a degree it is at present in the wrong hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will give the House a simple example. Some six or seven weeks ago, in a debate in this House on Northern Ireland, Deputy Michael Bell was speaking about certain activities on the Border and made a reference to Deputy De Rossa.  Deputy De Rossa was in the Chamber and refuted the statements made by Deputy Bell.  Lo and behold the following morning I heard, in &ldquo;Today in the Dáil&rdquo; segment, broadcast at approximately 8.50 a.m., Deputy Bell's comment and Deputy De Rossa in the background <Col N="795" /> denying what Deputy Bell had said.  At approximately 9.10 a.m., after &ldquo;What it says in the papers&rdquo; a statement was made that because of technical difficulties, it was regretted that Deputy De Rossa's comments were not audible.  This was untrue.  I am sure that if someone on this side of the House or indeed on the Fianna Fáil side of the House had been involved, such a statement would not have been made.  Deputy De Rossa's comments were not supposed to be audible because he was not speaking at the time; Deputy Bell was and his microphone was switched on.</P>
    <P>Because Deputy Bell had made some serious allegations about Deputy De Rossa certain people within RTE used their position to falsify the situation.  This shows that undue influence was exerted by some people involved in programme management and making.  This is undesirable.  Such a correction would not have been broadcast if I or any of my colleague had been involved and we would have been told &ldquo;that is tough&rdquo;. This amounted to a blatant attempt to distort the true position which was quite normal.  I ask the Minister to ensure that this imbalance is corrected as it amounts to media manipulation at its worst.  If this can be done on a simple item our worst fears about the activities of a minority within RTE, who have considerable power and control are justified.  All we want is fair play and for many years I and many others have suspected that there is no such thing when it comes to certain elements in RTE.</P>
    <P>I now refer to the question of programme content on RTE.  Valid points have been made about RTE moving away from making excellent programmes to programmes which are easy and cheap to produce but which do not make for good television.  It is not sufficient to say that there is much imported trash on RTE because the fact is that some of the best programmes of RTE are imported.  Some of the worst programmes are also imported.  We have to be discerning. &ldquo;Coronation Street&rdquo;, &ldquo;Home and Away&rdquo;, a variety of serials and films are <Col N="796" /> among some of the best programmes, according to the TAM ratings.  &ldquo;Glenroe&rdquo; is probably the best of the home produced programmes; it is outstanding and compares favourably with any of the imported material.  Most imported programmes are good but some are terribly bad.</P>
    <P>Given that there is a possibility of increased funding we should have more home produced programmes of substance which would have a wide appeal. These would be programmes about our wild life, heritage, history and folklore. The number of such programmes on RTE has decreased dramatically.  I suspect this is because of the cost involved but that should not be a factor.</P>
    <P>I also advocate that the Minister should encourage RTE to televise the proceedings of the Dáil live.  While I do not want to engage in the copy-cat syndrome, I believe Question Time should be broadcast live.  One of the best programmes on RTE is &ldquo;Today in the Dáil&rdquo; which is excellently produced but it is too short and shown at off peak viewing time, with the result it is not watched by the number of viewers which it could attract if it were shown at a different time.  I ask the Minister to discuss with RTE the possibility of broadcasting the Order of Business and Question Time live.  If the proceedings of the House were broadcast live the public would have an opportunity to see Members of this House in a better light.  Because people are so cynical about politicians and hold such a low opinion of them they should see us in action and not just pictures which make it seem that there are only one or two Deputies in the Chamber.  At present there are four Deputies, including the Ceann Comhairle, in the Chamber but this is not indicative of the true position.  When there is something meaty, vital and interesting in the Dáil it makes for good television viewing and I ask the Minister to bear this in mind when he discusses his brief with RTE.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>Much has been written and said about the 1990 Broadcasting Act.  A great deal of it has been mischievous and <Col N="797" /> nearly all of it is misinformed.  I do not propose to offer an apology so much as to remind the Members of this House of a set of policy objectives which I still believe are valid and to recall the pitfalls for any legislator who dips his toes in the dangerous political water of broadcasting and publishing.</P>
      <P>In order to put in perspective the policy objectives of the 1990 Broadcasting Act, in so far as it related to RTE and the commercial broadcasting sector, one has to turn to the broadcasting environment that the then Fianna Fáil Government inherited on coming into office in the spring of 1987.  In that environment between 60 and 70 pirate stations were operating, openly flouting the laws of the land, allowing substandard working conditions, paying slave labour rates, ignoring copyright payments, VAT, PRSI and PAYE obligations, causing serious interference in the radio communications environment and giving listeners little by way of choice and even less by way of quality broadcasting.</P>
      <P>The pirate phenomenon did, however, tell us that the people craved for broadcasting choice.  They wanted more than monopolistic State-run broadcasting services.  In pushing two Bills through the Oireachtas in a little over 12 months after coming into office we tackled the problems head on.  We put in place the necessary legal framework to subject the illegal broadcasting environment to the full rigours of the law while at the same time establishing a regulatory machine to give the public the broadcasting choice they desired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The concepts of a new, independent national radio service, an independent television channel and an independent local radio network became cornerstones of the new broadcasting structure created through the Radio and Television Act, 1988.  Sadly, the independent national radio service failed and all the efforts to create an independent television channel ultimately came to nothing, but the independent network of local stations which exists throughout the country is a testament to the wisdom reflected in the 1988 Act and, as Minister responsible, I <Col N="798" /> am very proud to have been involved in creating a sector which today is recognised for the excellence of its quality and the opportunity it provides to new broadcasters.  As this debate progresses. I am gratified to hear Members on all sides, some of whom were very critical at the time local radio services were established, praise the independent stations in their local areas for their performance and the quality of their programmes.</P>
    <P>Other elements were central to the Government's broadcasting policy.  We wanted to ensure that Irish broadcasting becomes a growth industry in line with the growth in broadcasting in other European countries.  We wanted to ensure that Irish broadcasting remained the mainstream Irish viewers' and listeners' choice.  We wanted to see new investment and higher productivity in Irish broadcasting in order to create additional secure employment in that sector and to provide a seedbed for the growth of an independent audio-visual industrial business.</P>
    <P>The 1988 Act paved the way for new entrants into the broadcasting sector.  In order to ensure that the listening public would get more than wall to wall music from the new entrants we imposed on them a number of public interest obligations in terms of type, quality and range of programmes as well as being very specific about what was required in terms of news and current affairs.  In return we, as legislators, needed to establish a competitive environment that was fair to all in the broadcasting sector and this in effect meant that we had to tackle the factors that enabled RTE to have an excessively dominant competitive position in the market.  The major element which created a considerable disadvantage for competing services was identified as RTE's dual funding.  While the primary purpose of State subvention through the TV licence was to enable RTE to meet certain public service obligations, it also in effect enabled it to sell its advertising time at rates below cost relative to the levels of service provided and thereby artificially dominate the <Col N="799" /> market.  If there are any doubts about this, I will confirm the position by quoting from a submission to the Minister from AIRS, the association representing the independent local radio stations, which most Deputies received this morning. The quotation reads:</P>
    <P>While the cap limited RTE's revenue from advertising in any year to the same amount of funds received from the licence fee, it also reduced the advertising minutage available to RTE.</P>
    <P>As a result RTE immediately increased its rates because of the reduced minutage available.  This meant the &ldquo;cost per thousand&rdquo; on a quarter hour basis increased to approx. £2.25, a level which all local stations could compete with.  Most stations cost per thousand (CPT) on a quarter hour basis is £2.12 at present...</P>
    <P>The removal of the cap provisions have increased RTE's advertising minutage by 45 per cent from five minutes per hour to seven minutes per hour.  This means the Minister has created 45 per cent more product for RTE.  This will enable RTE to reduce its radio rates by 45 per cent and still maintain its present income.</P>
    <P>To remain competitive local radio would also have to reduce its prices by 45 per cent.  This is of course impossible from a commercial point of view. When the scenario existed in 1990, RTE used predatory pricing to aid Century's demise, AIRS believes they will do so again, in this case, at the expense of local radio, unless parallel provision is made to compensate this sector, simultanously in the planned legislation.</P>
    <P>The independent stations were losing out on two counts: first, they did not have the benefit of a licence fee income to meet their public service obligations, which are relatively as onerous as those on RTE; second, they had to compete with the artificially dominant position of RTE in the advertising marketplace.</P>
    <P>There were a number of avenues open <Col N="800" /> to me at the time to address this anomaly. One could have taken the route of making some of the licence fee revenue available to the independent sector.  The case for doing so to enable them to meet their public service obligations is every bit as solid as making the funds available to RTE for public service broadcasting purposes.  However, few Members will forget the reaction this proposal received when I first broached it in a reply to a debate in the Chamber.  There were howls of derision and I was accused of every motive imaginable.  There was a hue and cry from the then socialist Members that public money was being given to private businessmen while they were conveniently forgetting that the wholly appropriate 20 per cent public service element required by the 1988 Act placed a very onerous burden on the fledgling industry which had to compete against a well established publicly funded institution which would offer rock bottom advertising rates on both radio and television.</P>
    <P>Because of the violent reaction I sought other means to redress the inherent imbalance which existed. Having put forward some proposals and duly gauged the informed and reasoned reaction I decided to take the course of placing some constraints on RTE's role in the advertising market.  The constraints to be placed on RTE's role are set out in section 3 of the 1990 Broadcasting Act which came into force on 1 October 1990.  There was a statutory limit on advertising on RTE service of 7.5 per cent of total daily programme transmission as against the previous limit of 10 per cent and a maximum of five minutes advertising in any one hour as against the previous seven minutes and 30 seconds. There was a limit on the revenue that the Authority may derive annually from advertising sponsorship or other forms of commercial promotion in broadcasting equal to the amount of the grant paid to it in respect of the licence fee in the preceding financial year, that amount having been adjusted by the increase in the consumer price index in the preceding year as published by the CSO.  In the <Col N="801" /> period before the commencement date, 1 October 1990 until 31 December 1990, there was a ceiling equal to 120 per cent of the sum that would be payable to RTE in respect of the grant equivalent to licence fees in the same period.</P>
    <P>It was expected that these measures would lead to the diversion of advertising revenue to the benefit of both independent broadcasting and, very importantly, to the print media.  It was up to the different media, including the print media, to earn their share of this diverted revenue by proving their worth and relative cost attractiveness.</P>
    <P>There was much ado during the passage of this Bill through the Oireachtas about the supposed damage these proposals would inflict on RTE.  This talk of doom and gloom was completely without foundation and did not do justice to the spirit of enterprise and initiative in the RTE organisation.  Essentially what the Act proposed was that RTE would return to its 1988 level of income, a year in which the Authority turned in a handsome surplus of £5.3 million, in spite of incurring considerable costs in expanded broadcasting hours, hosting the Eurovision Song Contest at that time, providing exhaustive coverage of the European soccer championship in West Germany and, of course, the Olympics in Seoul.  That was not to be, simply because the Act was more recognised in its violation rather than in its observance. RTE's reaction was, in my view, to abuse its national role by entering every home in the country during entertainment programmes and whingeing about job losses, which were never called for and which were never to happen.  It raised the cost of advertising rates thus enraging the advertising industry and proceeded to place £17 million profits in bank accounts &mdash; I am glad to see the Minister for Finance will make excellent use of it this year.</P>
    <P>In the meantime RTE proceeded to starve the independent film industry by saying that all its considerable reserves were required to maintain the integrity of its own organisation, in spite of the fact that it had £17 million profit in the <Col N="802" /> period.  I remain convinced that the Broadcasting Act, 1990 if it had been observed in the spirit it was intended, should not have lessened RTE's position as the primary broadcaster in the State and its continuing with the tradition of broadcasting of which it can be proud, and we as a nation can be proud of its achievements.  Ireland's viewing public would today have the benefit of choice of an independent television station and our local radio network would have a more solid financial base.</P>
    <P>Although the passage of the Bill through the Oireachtas must have taken almost 100 hours of debate, the then Opposition failed singularly to identify and address the fundamental objective which the legislation intended to achieve, which is of creating conditions of fair competition in the Irish broadcasting domain.  Indeed by trying to mount a filibuster they never got beyond considering the early sections on Committee Stage.  Instead of dealing constructively with the Bill the then Opposition to my mind were in dereliction of their parliamentary duties when some of them walked out of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>My objective was not to attack RTE but to ensure fairness and feasibility right across the whole broadcasting sector. These goals are as valid today as they were in 1990, perhaps even more so. Today many local radio stations are simply making ends meet by winning the loyalty of their regional listeners and all but one of our national newspaper groups are in financial difficulties.  These areas demand the Minister's attention.  I regret these concerns are not addressed in the legislation before us and I urge the Minister to give them his most urgent and dedicated attention.</P>
    <P>The greatest difference between this Bill and the 1990 Act is that the former is less officious and therefore has a greater chance of success. I am often asked what I would do differently if I were able to go back and reintroduce the 1990 Act.  I am not closed to the idea that some means other than a revenue cap might achieve the desired objectives.  I foresaw <Col N="803" /> from an early stage that this revolution in Irish broadcasting would require a considerable degree of fine tuning and adjustment.  This matter was commented on as we debated the 1980 and 1990 legislation in this Chamber.  With regard to the cap, I am generally opposed to State interference in a free market but the underlying principles governing our actions in this area were very sound.  We cannot allow a publicly funded enterprise to undercut independent private sector activity.  We have the potential to provide a global voice in the audio visual field and to enjoy the prosperity and employment it will bring.  Private sector involvement is necessary to bring about that position.</P>
    <P>The Irish public is entitled to the best quality of broadcasting and widest possible degree of choice that can be offered. This is surely the most important requirement of any legislation on broadcasting and I wish the Minister the best of goodwill in providing for that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane:</NameTxt>
      <P>When the cap was introduced on RTE advertising there was much concern about the potential loss of jobs.  Under this legislation the cap is being abolished and RTE will be free to increase its advertising.  It is obvious that, despite the establishment of local radio stations in 1989, RTE still has a monopoly in broadcasting.  This is due in part to the fact that the television licence goes towards RTE funding.  People who do not pay their television licence on time receive very trenchant reminders that they are guilty of an offence.</P>
      <P>Let us contrast the position of RTE with that of local radio stations which were established in 1989.  Public representatives appreciate these stations and wish them success.  It is with a certain degree of sadness that we see many of them running on a shoestring.  Quite a few are running at a loss, with overall losses amounting to about £10 million. Since these losses occurred during the period of the imposition of the cap on RTE I would pose the question: what is likely to happen now that RTE is free to increase its advertising?  Will that have a serious impact on local radio stations?  I believe it will.  The body representing local radio stations has requested a meeting with public representatives next week to highlight the effect on local radio stations of the abolition of the cap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation will also have an impact on provincial newspapers, who find it very difficult to compete for advertising space, and in many cases advertising is <Col N="805" /> the lifeblood of these newspapers.  Local radio stations and provincial newspapers provide an effective service for local communities. In hindsight perhaps too many local radio stations were set up in relation to the size of the country and the market for broadcasting.  In County Limerick, which is not a very large county, people have access to Clare Radio, Kerry Radio, Limerick Radio and Cork County Sound. Depending on one's geographical position one has access to a wide variety of services.  All these stations are competing for their share of the market.</P>
    <P>I welcome the considerable increase in market penetration by local radio stations in the last few years.  These stations have brought politics to a higher plane in that politicians and local authority representatives use local radio as a vehicle to present their ideas and policies.  This has helped to enhance the status of public representatives, whose work in many cases does not receive true recognition. This Bill will have a profound impact on local radio stations and provincial newspapers unless some new method of financing is introduced for them.  Perhaps they should be given a certain amount from the television licence fee.  It is wrong that this revenue goes exclusively to RTE who increased their advertising space and continued to make a good profit in spite of the cap on advertising.  The Minister should address the consequent effects of this legislation on provincial newspapers and local radio stations.</P>
    <P>The introduction of broadcasting of Oireachtas debates has enchanced the status of the Dáil and the Seanad.  The number of people who watch the Oireachtas proceedings is surprising. Even though this programme has been broadcast for only a short period of time, it is a very good, balanced programme. As my colleague, Deputy Deasy, quite rightly stated earlier, the cut and thrust of political debates is sadly missing from RTE broadcasts.  &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; is a succession of statements.  If anybody watches reports from the House of Commons or the House of Lords, the proceedings are projected by the media in a far more exciting way which generates <Col N="806" /> interest.  As Deputy Deasy said, there should for instance be a little more broadcasting of Question Time in order to capture the excitement and vibrancy of the Oireachtas and enhance its status among the general public.</P>
    <P>RTE has been criticised because of its high preponderance of people linked to certain parties.  I do not know how that impacts on providing a television service and what sort of bias it gives to political parties.</P>
    <P>A positive aspect of the Bill is that the Minister has directed RTE to make specific amounts available to commission programmes from independent television producers.  The Minister has been known for his interest in arts and culture, so I imagine that stipulation is his brainchild to try to generate more interest and make that sector more profitable, because independent productions are up against a potential giant in RTE.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to look at the impact the changes envisaged by this Bill will have on local radio and provincial newspapers.  These sectors are finding things increasingly difficult.  The national newspapers, who are competing for advertising space, are equally concerned. Television advertisements during prime time are bound to have more impact than advertisements in the national newspapers. The loss of revenue to newspapers was highlighted recently by the increased cost of the national newspapers. One now must pay £1 for a Sunday newspaper and soon the dailies and local newspapers will cost as much. That encourages the importation of small tabloid newspapers from England which might not be as newsworthy for the Irish public.  Sales of these papers are increasing because of the price.  We often think that our political message is getting through to the people, but that may not necessarily be the case.  Many of them cannot afford to buy a daily Irish newspaper and are buying English newspapers, which do not necessarily highlight Irish news.</P>
    <P>The direction of the Bill with regard to commercial productions is welcome. Although this Bill may appear small, it <Col N="807" /> will have a profound impact on many other areas of the media such as local radio and provincial and national newspapers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Like my colleagues, I am pleased that the Minister is here.  This is the first time I have spoken here in the presence of the Minister fulfilling his function as Minister.  I am delighted that he got this portfolio and I have no doubt that other speakers are right about him. I join in the sentiments expressed in congratulating the Minister and wishing him well.  I hope his work as a Minister will not diminish his activities as a poet.</P>
      <P>I particularly welcome the removal of the cap from RTE.  Its introduction was a disaster and there is little doubt that jobs were lost in RTE as a result of that foolish move.  Money which would have been spent on advertising in RTE was spent elsewhere, particularly in advertising on Ulster Television.  It was a pity that in 1990 the Government did not listen to the Labour Party.  I can still clearly see the expression on the face of the Minister for Communications as he sat in the Seanad, his eyes fixed on the clock over the door, pondering his imprisonment there until the end of the debate, which went on and on.  The cap was introduced against the wishes of the people.  If the cap had not been removed, about 500 more jobs would have been lost as a consequence of persisting with this policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposals in this Bill will mean that money spent on independent production by RTE will increase from £2.75 million in 1992 to £5 million in 1994 and will reach a figure of £12.5 million in 1998, or 20 per cent of television expenditure in that year, whichever is the greater. Nobody can have any doubt that this marks a significant change in the way in which resources available to RTE are managed.  The foreign companies from which RTE buys programmes are excluded from the definition of independent television production in the Bill. That in effect means that as far as RTE <Col N="808" /> is concerned there is no backdoor way around the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The effects of the proposals on RTE are not at all clear.  Last year RTE made a fairly modest profit in the order of £3 million or £4 million.  The proposals in the Bill have to be considered in the context of the likely development in Irish television broadcasting in the next few years.  There is now a clear commitment to provide a television service for Irish-speaking people at an initial cost of £20 million with a subsequent cost of the order of £15 million a year at present day prices.  By any standards this is a large sum of money.  The provision of this amount of money will inevitably have consequences for RTE.  The source of this money is somewhat unclear.  It appears that some of the money will be obtained from the European Community, some from the lottery and some from RTE.  The detail of the amounts of money from each of these agencies has not been spelt out.  One way or the other, there will be an increased drain on RTE resources for the provision of this service. While it is a worthwhile service, it has implications in relation to how RTE will operate.  It will undoubtedly increase the pressure on the capacity of RTE to make programmes within the service.  I do not share the views expressed to the effect that RTE will just be a transmitting service, but the provisions of this Bill will create some pressures on RTE's capacity to produce programmes within the organisation. The effect of all this in relation to standards has not been determined. Undoubtedly the provision of Teilifís na Gaeltachta will create an added burden on the station.  It is difficult to define standards because in many ways they are in the eye of the beholder.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in the Bill which provides for an annual review of how it is working.  This means that if changes need to be made then the capacity is there to highlight them and set the basis on which they can be made. There is no doubt that this Bill presents significant challenges for RTE and a number of challenges for the local radio stations.  These stations say that the effect <Col N="809" /> of the Bill will be to enable RTE to compete more effectively against them and, indeed, many of these stations are struggling to survive.  I doubt if anyone would want to make the case that these stations do not provide an excellent service, at least in some aspects of their activities, with limited resources. Obviously much of their activity is made up of the straightforward playing of music, which anyone could do.  In relation to their news coverage and some community functions they provide a very useful service.  They also provide the type of service which RTE simply cannot hope to provide because of the diversity and the size of the audience which RTE caters for.</P>
    <P>Stations such as Clare FM can interrupt music programmes to provide the results of junior football matches in which there is considerable interest.  Certainly it would not be possible for RTE to provide that type of service.  Similarly, Clare FM can provide detailed coverage of proceedings in the local county council and in the urban district council.  RTE would not be able to sustain that type of facility because it would have only a minority interest concentrated in one small part of the country.  I am sure the other local stations provide a similar type service. Indeed, some of the Dublin local radio stations provide a very useful forum for debate.  Even when debates take place late at night many people ring up these programmes to air their point of view on various controversial topics.  Nobody can argue that these stations do not provide a public service broadcasting facility.  Some recognition must be given to that fact.  It could be argued that if public service broadcasting is provided and if it is worthy of support, then that support should be available regardless of the source from which the broadcasting facility comes.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the Minister is engaged in discussions with the local radio stations and has made some proposals. I understand the stations have made some counter proposals to the Minister.  I look forward to a fruitful conclusion to that debate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="810" /> The neglect of community radio by the Independent Radio and Television Commission is no longer defensible. There is a case to be made for providing communities with the capacity to go ahead and establish community radio stations.  That would be a worthwhile development and I hope some progress will be made in relation to this matter in the near future.  Problems will arise for the newspaper industry arising from increased competition for advertising and so on.  I am not sure whether there is any easy answer to these difficulties but it is true that some of the provincial newspapers are experiencing much difficulty in trying to survive.  In part, those difficulties are related to the fact that the population in many rural areas is diminishing. When that happens the capacity to generate finance from advertising diminishes which in turn creates difficulties.</P>
    <P>Many of the local stations experience difficulties because of the size of the audience they serve.  I recall a debate on this topic in the Seanad, during the last Government, when Senator Donie Cassidy referred to the minimum audience size of a viable local radio station being of the order of one million people.  I have many disagreements with Senator Cassidy but I would defer to his expertise in the area of broadcasting and communications. I sincerely hope he is wrong but I would be cautious about saying that, given the success he has had in that business over many years.  If that is true, it raises very serious questions in relation to the viability of many of the stations which are now up and running.</P>
    <P>RTE faces very significant competition from Ulster Television.  The introduction of the cap diverted something of the order of £2 million to £3 million in advertising revenue away from RTE to Ulster Tele-Television. I understand Ulster Television has in the order of one million viewers in the Republic.  That is a very important market and it amounts to about two-thirds of the RTE audience. We need to be very careful in relation to the effect of any changes made in our broadcasting legislation and how they will affect the balance of audience size <Col N="811" /> between Ulster Television and RTE. RTE is obliged to provide programmes for minority interests and so on and in many ways that is a worthwhile and desirable service.  At the same time we have to bear in mind that there may well be a side effect which will diminish the total audience available to RTE, diminish the advertising pool and create a number of very serious knock on problems for RTE. One of the great success stories of RTE is the extent to which it has survived competition during the past 15 to 20 years.  Since Ulster Television, BBC and so on became available to most people in Ireland RTE has met that challenge very well.  Sky Television presents a very significant challenge, even if it is centred on some minority audience.</P>
    <P>A few points were raised by other speakers to which I should like to allude. Deputy Deasy referred to the desirability of televising all the proceedings of the Dáil live.  In many ways that is a desirable suggestion.  I would remind the House that we experienced this phenomenon for three hours in the Seanad when television broadcasting of the Seanad was introduced. It gave rise to a unique change in behaviour of the Senators.  Out of the 60 Senators, as many as 47 rose to address the Cathaoirleach and ask whether it would be in order, on the Order of Business, to raise the question of their favourite pothole, housing scheme or whatever else they were involved in locally at the time.  I would hope if this House is televised live that we would not go down the road followed in the Seanad on that afternoon.</P>
    <P>The whole phenomena of broadcasting and media has very important consequences for the way politicians behave. Politicians now do media courses to improve their presentation.  In many of these courses the emphasis is on presentation rather than on content and that is understandable.  A considerable amount of what is said by politicians is, to use the cliché, &ldquo;media driven&rdquo;.  Politicians now speak because they sense an opportunity for media coverage.  In many ways that gives rise to distortion because <Col N="812" /> what is being said is designed, to some extent, for media coverage rather than because it has an intrinsic merit.  That is an unfortunate distortion that we will have to live with.</P>
    <P>Deputy Finucane is right when he speaks of the absence of the cut and thrust of politics in the Oireachtas reports.  This is not a reflection on the way the Oireachtas report is presented. What we see is very much set piece stuff. Politicians come in and read scripts which have been written by third parties.  What we are seeing is the concept of the politician as an actor, and this gives rise to questions about ethics.  In many other spheres of life that sort of behaviour might be regarded as something approximating to plagiarism.  I do not know that it is correct to go quite that far.  However, if somebody is to read a script which has been written for him and which, in some cases, has been handed to him on his way into this House, it might not be out of place to make some acknowledgement of the person who wrote the script.  It is only fair that the public be aware of what is happening rather than be given the impression that politicians think these speeches up themselves, when in some cases they are reading what has been scripted for them by somebody else.</P>
    <P>The Bill is limited in its scope.  I do not mean that as a criticism of it.  It sets out to address a certain topic.  I welcome the fact that the cap on advertising has been removed from RTE.  However, I want to sound a note of caution as to the effect this Bill may have on programme making and jobs in RTE.  I am happy there is scope to study how this Bill is affecting these matters and to make changes if necessary.</P>

      <P>Like the previous speaker I wish to congratulate Deputy Michael D. Higgins on his appointment as Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht <Col N="813" /> and I wish him well.  I have no doubt he will make a tremendous sucess of it. I also welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, and congratulate him on his reappointment to this portfolio.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on bringing forward this very important Bill.  I would like to quote from his opening statement which was:</P>
      <P>The Programme for Partnership Government on broadcasting states:</P>
      <P>Our policy will be to ensure that Irish TV and Radio Programming is of the highest quality and that it remains the preferred choice of a majority of Irish viewers by:</P>
      <P>&mdash;Repeal of the &ldquo;cap&rdquo; contained in the 1990 Broadcasting Act, thus enabling RTE to improve the range and quality of the public service broadcasting that it can offer to the Irish public;</P>
      <P>&mdash;Provision for access to broadcasting for the independent sector, thus enabling them to increase output and jobs in the audiovisual industry and giving them a firm home base to enable them to compete internationally;</P>
      <P>I also welcome the fact that the Minister is in discussions with local radio representatives. I wonder how this Bill will affect independent local radio.  Legal local radio only started in 1989.  Since then stations have progressed steadily to a position where today local radio listenership has surpassed Radio 1 listenership, and it has almost twice the listenership of 2 FM.</P>
      <P>This success is due to hard work, commitment and considerable financial investment.  Success is also due in no small part to their ability to deliver community broadcasting in every sense.  They have shown how local radio services can enable people to communicate with their community and we, as public representatives, will appreciate this more than most.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They now have a difficulty.  The industry has losses of £10 million and they are deeply concerned that their problems will <Col N="814" /> worsen after the passing of the Broadcasting Bill.  This could deal a crippling blow to the young local broadcasting sector with the loss of jobs and maybe the loss of local stations.  They are at a crossroads and need help.  They are asking that a proportion of the licence fee should be diverted to provide services which would assist independent local radio.  This could be administered through a separate authority or through the Independent Radio and Television Commission.</P>
    <P>Some of the services they are seeking include a full national and international news service, and the taking into public control of local radio transmission services. I have no doubt that the Minister will take this on board.</P>
    <P>Our national broadcasting organisation, Radio Telefís Éireann, has a very important role to play in the social and cultural life of our nation.  It should inform, stimulate and reflect the concerns of this country.  It should hold up a mirror to the nation showing us who we are and where we are going as we head into the twenty-first century.  It offers us a lens through which we can view the development of our country.</P>
    <P>RTE is not the only such forum in Ireland and we must ensure that the correct balance is maintained between our national media and our local and provincial media.  Ideally the relationship between them should be complementary. This is the balance to which we should aspire.</P>
    <P>I am keenly aware of the importance of the provincial media to people in the various regions.  Local newspapers in particular have an invaluable role to play. They chronicle the growth and development of the regions they represent and in doing so help bind these communities together, providing them with a forum for communication.  These papers provide a variety of important functions. They act as marketplace, social forum and most important as a source of news and views concerning the region and its communities &mdash; news and views that do not concern the national media.  Essentially the provincial newspapers have a <Col N="815" /> vital role to play in maintaining and reflecting the special and separate identity of the regions of Ireland.</P>
    <P>These provincial papers have to exist in an increasingly difficult commercial atmosphere.  They face aggressive competition from a variety of sources for the advertising revenue they need to sustain themselves, not least from the national media.  I would be greatly disturbed if the coming years saw the gradual erosion of our provincial newspapers.  For this reason I would like to place on the record my reservations concerning some of the provisions of the new Broadcasting Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister has outlined his reasons for removing the advertising cap on RTE. However, I would like to sound a note of caution.  In doing so he may well cause considerable damage to our provincial papers.  In an increasingly competitive atmosphere these papers will struggle for advertising revenue with rivals who command considerable power.  Principal among these is RTE.</P>
    <P>RTE has the national broadcasting monopoly in Ireland.  To a large degree it is protected from the rigours of competition by its monolithic position and the fact it is supported by a public licence fee.  No such subventions are available to the provincial press and for that reason I believe that the Minister has adopted a somewhat one-sided approach.  In doing so he has ignored the very real difficulties faced by local papers.  Regrettably he seems to be somewhat insensitive to the great social, commercial and cultural contribution made by these papers to communities all around the country.  I would press on him the need to ensure that these papers are not muscled out by larger competitors and that he take this factor into account in all his future considerations in this area.</P>
    <P>I would like to give a cautious welcome to the new Bill's provisions regarding the independent broadcasting sector.  These provisions have the potential to generate much needed employment in this area. This sector has tremendous growth potential.  There are far too many bought-in foreign programmes on our screens, <Col N="816" /> often of shoddy quality.  If we are to replace this with quality national programming then our independent broadcasting companies need a guaranteed domestic base, through RTE services, in order to prosper and develop.  Therefore I welcome the Bill's provision that RTE must make specific amounts of money available in each financial year for programmes commissioned from the independent television production sector.</P>
    <P>My reservation about this provision is not in regard to the principle behind it but what its implications might be.  I would not like to see an independent sector that is Dublin-centred.  Independent broadcasting should reflect the diversity of views and beliefs that make up our country.  For that reason I look forward to an independent production sector that is widely spread geographically &mdash; a video production company in Tralee, a film editing company in Drogheda etc.  In this way the independent sector can contribute to the broader social life of this country.  This is a healthier situation than the creation of another Dublin-based media concentration.</P>
    <P>Essentially, this Bill is a curate's egg. There is much to welcome, but at the same time I have reservations about some of its provisions, particularly the lifting of the cap on RTE.  The Minister should watch the progress of this Bill and I have no doubt he will.  He should not hesitate to reform it at some time in the future if it has the negative effects on the provincial newspapers to which I referred.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister for the alacrity with which he presented this Bill to the House and I congratulate him on his elevation to Cabinet status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted the Minister made provision for the expenditure of specific amounts on the commissioning of programmes from the independent television sector.  The cap on RTE introduced in the 1990 Bill did not have the effect envisaged and its removal at this stage is inevitable.  In regard to the commissioning of independent television <Col N="817" /> programmes, it is encouraging that section 5 of the Bill clearly defines an independent television programme.  The suggestion from some Opposition Deputies that this provision and definition are in some way a slight by the Minister on RTE is extraordinary.  The expenditure of up to 20 per cent of programme finances on those productions cannot be interpreted as an attempt to reduce RTE to a Channel 4 type station as suggested, a station which would merely broadcast bought-in programmes. That is totally unwarranted.</P>
    <P>It was heartening to hear the Minister state that people want intelligent, high quality programmes and a choice of services. This is borne out by the extraordinary success of local independent radio and the role of the former Minister, Deputy Ray Burke, in that success should not be overlooked.  It behoves all his successors to bear in mind Deputy Burke's experiences and the manner in which his legislation was undermined.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to proceed with alacrity in addressing the problems which beset the independent radio stations.  I am aware that the stations have made a joint submission to the Minister and that he is <i>au fait</i> with the difficulties in the sector, which I understand has losses in the region of £10 million.  In many cases those stations are far more than independent projects.  Some are, in the very best sense, community radio.  Clare FM, my local station, provides an extraordinary level of service to the community and enjoys over 60 per cent listenership.  The large number of community stations contribute to the fact that some of them are in financial difficulties, but this has a major advantage from a community prespective in that it allows the stations to deal with issues in a fairly limited and geographic area and allows them to be more responsive to the needs of the community.</P>
    <P>Deputy Finucane outlined the effect community radio has on politics and his belief that in some way it helps to improve the image of professional politicians, none of us could argue with the need for that.  It also makes the politician <Col N="818" /> more readily answerable to his electorate. It provides him with an opportunity to outline his views and forces him to be more responsive to the community. As Deputy Upton stated, local radio provides news on local sports and community affairs and in the case of Clare FM provides excellent programmes on the culture, music, song and writing of the community in Clare.</P>
    <P>The cost of setting up a network of community stations and their broadcasting facilities in a sparsely populated area is enormous.  In contrast, unfortunately the non-national stations in Dublin have virtually no community input and are not community stations.  I urge the Minister to consider criteria which would give an advantage to genuinely community responsive stations when he is considering further legislation to assist those stations which are currently in the independent sector but which are, in effect, directly responsive to the community needs and are community broadcasting.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated yesterday that there are few immediate measures available to him which would allow him to help the independent sector.  Perhaps the Minister would consider removing the 3 per cent levy on the Independent Radio and Television Commission, a body which does not provide any developmental assistance or resources to the stations and a cost which, in many cases, is a burden to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Ray Burke, as Minister for Communications, deserves the heartfelt thanks of the Irish public for setting in train local radio which is proving extremely successful.  It would be fair to say that local radio does not talk down to the people, it is making a singular contribution to communities throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While many aspects of this Bill are extremely welcome, certain criticisms must be voiced.  This is a small island country and the argument has often been made that it would not be possible to have a number of television stations. Nevertheless, it must be accepted that <Col N="819" /> Radio Telefís Éireann occupies a dominant position, indeed has a monopoly in the marketplace.  That is not to say that its contribution to society over several years has not been enormous or that it is not a station of the highest quality. Monopolies and dominant positions in the marketplace are undesirable, that was the case in many member states, leading to the express regulation of dominant positions and monopolies in the Treaty of Rome.</P>
    <P>The paramount question is whether it is fair that RTE should be allowed to take all the licence fees and be allowed to enter the marketplace in relation to advertising revenue in a way which places its competitors at a severe disadvantage. This legislation will require follow-up legislation because, unless that is done, local radio stations will be placed at a severe disadvantage.  There is only so much advertising revenue in the market and, if this Bill is allowed to stand on its own, it will be possible for RTE to engage in predatory pricing and to undercut its competitors, making it impossible for them to survive.  That would be a great tragedy.</P>
    <P>Those who argue against sharing the licence fee between local radio stations and RTE say that the State cannot, should not and must not aid private enterprise in this way.  In order to create prosperity in this economy it has been the practice of Government agencies, such as the Industrial Development Authority, the country development teams, Údarás na Gaeltachta and others, over the years to grant-aid private enterprise in order to stimulate employment and buoyancy in the economy.  There is no valid reason why that should not apply in relation to the licence fee.  There is a misconception in some quarters that the licence fee is the property of RTE and that it is collected by An Post for RTE. The truth of the matter is quite different. The licence fee is not the property of RTE but rather is channelled to RTE by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.  It is not a contribution <Col N="820" /> to RTE but is a contribution to RTE made at the Government's discretion.</P>
    <P>There was much talk a few years ago about levelling the playing pitch.  It could be said that experience has shown that the previous legislation while meritorious in many respects did not level the playing pitch.  However, this legislation if allowed to stand on its own merit will change the goal posts in a major way.  It will place the print media and local community radio at a severe disadvantage.  RTE's monopoly of advertising revenue will be increased dramatically to the detriment of the print media and local radio stations.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht has stated that it is his intention to introduce follow-up legislation at a later date.  In this respect I would ask him to give serious consideration to the distribution of licence fee revenue in such a way as to give the local community radio stations an opportunity to compete on a level playing pitch in the advertising revenue marketplace.</P>
    <P>The problem concerning the print media is more complicated and difficult to resolve.  There is little doubt that one of the major disadvantages facing the print media today is the importation of cheaply priced British newspapers which sell at a high rate here.  The concept of VAT on Irish newspapers must be addressed.  We can be proud of our high quality print media at national and provincial level, quality media which deserve the support of Irish Governments. Unfortunately, we have been neglecting to assist the print media here and VAT on newspapers is an issue which must be examined seriously in the future.  I realise that is not a question for the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht in the context of the present Bill.</P>
    <P>In this Bill the Minister attempts valiantly to assist independent film producers and those involved in that sector of the media.  I question the efficacy of the section dealing with that because there is little to prevent people currently employed in RTE transferring their communications or media companies or the shares therein to members of their own families, thereby circumventing the <Col N="821" /> section which is intended to prevent what can only be described as favouritism by the RTE Authority.  It is important that the Minister ensures in the context of this Bill that producers who work for RTE are independent in the true sense of the word.  In the past the situation has fallen short of what one would hope and expect.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision by the Minister, as initiated by the former Taoiseach and Minister for the Gaeltacht, Mr. Charles Haughey, to proceed with the establishment of Teilifís na Gaeltachta.  It is not often realised that the Irish language has taken on a new sense of meaning for Irish people.  The integration of Europe is feared by many because they feel that we might lose our identity in such a framework.  The use of the Irish language is increasing here, which I welcome. There is a growing awareness of the language and it is a testament to the traditional resilience of the Irish people in the face of adversity.  The establishment of Teilifís na Gaeltachta will stand as a monument to the Minister because it will help to continue the growth of interest in the Irish language throughout the State and will lead to a greater understanding and belief in our own traditions and culture.</P>
    <P>This is an important Bill which addresses one of the cornerstone's of our democracy, namely, the question of communication. It requires detailed examination. My reservations in this regard relate to the issue of fair competition in the marketplace and to the possibility that the independently produced films and programmes will not fall into independent hands.  I strongly believe that the measures I have already mentioned need to be addressed.  I am confident that the next Broadcasting Bill, which I hope will be introduced at the earliest possible date, will provide an opportunity for local community radio to compete on a level playing pitch.  Our failure to do that will mean the end of the tremendous initiative put forward by the former Minister, Deputy Ray Burke, when in 1988 he introduced the Broadcasting Bill dealing with this matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="822" /> Unless it is recognised that local radio cannot compete with a monolith there will be unfair competition in the market place.  There is no valid reason why licence fees should not be divided out in a fair and equitable manner and I hope the Minister will address this issue.  I would stress that I am in no way critical of RTE, I understand its unique position in Irish society and the contribution it has made and continues to make.  Dominant institutions and monopolies throughout history have proven to be temptations that have led to abuse.  They are counterproductive ultimately and rarely if ever achieve the noble objectives for which they were established.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to a point raised by Deputy O'Donoghue in relation to the removal of the cap on RTE's advertising and the growth of the independent broadcasting sector.  I am sure all Deputies welcome the Minister's intentions with regard to the independent broadcasting sector.  It is an important industry, it has a role to play and the Government must support it.  Deputy O'Donoghue referred to RTE staff and their connections outside RTE and with the independent broadcasting sector. People who are part and parcel of RTE have independent production companies outside RTE.  The Minister must review this area.  Is there any impediment to a staff member of RTE establishing an independent company and obtaining contracts through the backdoor method? There is a danger that by allocating money to the independent sector we are bolstering such people who are working on that sector and not contributing to the growth of the independent sector.  It is ironic that the media call for politicians to declare their interests, but perhaps the Minister might address this concept in regard to RTE staff.  It might be appropriate for those in RTE who have independent companies, and those acting in a consultative role, to declare their interests.  What applies to us should equally apply to them.  The provision in the Bill in respect of the independent broadcasting sector is good, but, I hope <Col N="823" /> when we review this area in perhaps two years we will have achieved our objectives.</P>
      <P>The Bill did not address the issue of local radio stations.  Politicians welcomed the growth of independent radio stations. It is appropriate to mention the former Minister, Deputy Burke, who grasped the nettle by addressing the problems caused by the operation of pirate radio stations.  We now have a thriving independent local radio network around the country.  Such stations are a great asset to rural Ireland because they bring communities together and highlight local events.  They involve the local people and provide a social service that many thought would never be achieved.  The Minister should give some consideration to supporting the independent network in the next Bill.  Given the monopoly enjoyed by RTE, how can the independent sector survive?  Now that this Bill provides for the removal of the cap on RTE's advertising I would ask the Minister to level the playing pitch for the independent sector.</P>
      <P>I will be parochial and refer to another arm of RTE in Cork, 89FM and the restricted hours under which it operates. Since the emergence of the other local radio stations in Cork, 96FM and 103FM, the ratings for Cork About, as it was known, have dramatically fallen.  The people working in that radio station are extremely competent but they feel aggrieved because they have no opportunity to compete on any level playing pitch with the local radio station.  I am aware the Minister met people from 89FM.  I would ask him when the next Bill is introduced, to grant an extension of hours to his station so that it can adequately compete.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  Some speakers have suggested that provisions in the 1990 Act were incorrect and that this Bill has been introduced to correct that.  I do not consider that the 1990 Act was necessarily wrong.  An attempt was made in that Act to divert moneys away <Col N="824" /> from RTE which is in an advantageous position, by putting a cap on its advertising revenue by limiting the time it could broadcast advertisements in each hour.  This Bill provides for new ways of diverting moneys from RTE.  The provisions of the 1990 Act were perhaps not as successful as might have been expected and the Government have reacted in that regard.  Perhaps the 1990 Act was not successful because of Century Radio, though the provisions in the Act did not help Century Radio because it has now closed down.  It is time to change procedures in this regard and I am glad the Government are addressing that problem.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that a possible reduction in the fees charged by RTE, due to an increase in its advertising time, will mean less advertising on local radio stations.  As we are all aware, local radio stations have been very successful.  I am sure that, like me, other Deputies have noticed that more and more national companies have tended to advertise on local radio stations over the past number of years.  I hope that these companies will not decide to revert to advertising on RTE.  I am sure this will not happen, but one should sound a note of caution in this regard.  We should strive to help local radio stations to the greatest extent possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a particular interest in new programmes. There is a need for more comprehensive coverage of national and international news on local radio stations.  There is also a need for more Irish language news programmes.  The great demand for the Sky News station indicates the interest Irish people have in news programmes.  I should like some help to be given to local radio stations to enable them to provide a more comprehensive news service.  Too many local radio station licences may have been given out initially and some stations have amalgamated.  I believe more and more stations will amalgamate in the future. Some local stations are extremely successful &mdash; they are ahead of RTE1 and RTE2 &mdash; but unfortunately other stations are not so successful.  If the service provided <Col N="825" /> is good enough local stations will succeed.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to be seen to be knocking RTE, which does a tremendous job. Before multi-channel television was available in my area, people used to talk about how great the BBC and ITV were. However, when one looks at these stations on an individual basis one can see that RTE is better than any of them. It is very important that this legislation is being introduced at a time when there are so many developments in the broadcasting area.  In addition to the 1990 Act and this Bill, more legislation in this area will have to be introduced in the future to cover the growth in satellite channels.</P>
    <P>This Bill is like a curate's egg &mdash; good in parts and flawed in parts.  In time these flaws may mitigate against some of the objectives of the Bill.  This is particularly so in regard to the provisions dealing with the independent broadcasting sector. While the Bill is committed to the development of independent broadcasting, it may in its application stifle this growth.  I welcome the thrust of the Bill. We are all aware of our unemployment problem and any measure which generates employment is to be welcomed and encouraged.  The Bill proposes to create employment in the independent broadcasting sector.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to untapped potential in that sector.  There are many creative and enthusiastic young people working in this area who can make a major contribution to make to the future of Irish broadcasting. There is an unexploited reservoir of talent and ambition in this sector. However, it has been exceedingly difficult in recent times for the independent sector to make its mark, given the market dominance of RTE.  RTE has had a protective monopoly in this area and is supported by public licence fees.  Therefore, it is exceedingly difficult for small independent companies to compete with this corporate muscle.</P>
    <P>If one wishes to see what the independent sector can achieve one has only to look at Channel 4 in the UK.  The encouragement and acceptance of independent programming is an integral part <Col N="826" /> of this channel's remit.  This has resulted in considerable growth in the independent broadcasting sector in the UK. It has also led to a richer diversity in terms of available programming and, ultimately, greater consumer choice.  It has offered an outlet for a new generation of programme makers and generated valuable employment in this sector.  This is the model to which we should aspire. Unfortunately, I do not think this Bill is capable of achieving this.  People in my area receive the Welsh service from Channel 4.  I should like more Irish language programmes to be broadcast on our airwaves to cater for the increased interest in the Irish language at present.</P>
    <P>There are a number of reasons this Bill fails the independent sector.  While the Bill goes part of the way towards encouraging development, its seems to have the primary aim of copperfastening RTE's dominant position.  Section 4 deals with the independent sector and provides that RTE must make specific amounts of money available in each financial year for programmes commissioned from the independent television production sector.  The amount to be set aside in 1994 is £5 million, rising in stages to 20 per cent of television programme expenditure in 1999.  On paper this provision seems more than adequate.  However, there are serious loopholes in the legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 4 (5) provides that any moneys not spent under the independent programming account must remain in the account and be added to the following year's allocation unless the Minister authorises RTE to withdraw this money.  I am concerned that RTE will be able to create an artificial situation and make a case to the Minister for the diversion of the money not expended into the general running of RTE.  I do not believe the Bill is sufficiently rigorous in its construction to avoid such a situation.  I ask the Minister to reconsider this provision with a view to ensuring that no money destined for the independent sector can be diverted into any area of RTE under any circumstances.  I have no doubt that at some future date financial difficulties will <Col N="827" /> arise and RTE will prevail on the Minister of the day to divert this funding.  I do not think the Bill possesses sufficient safeguards to prevent this happening. This is a fundamental weakness in the Bill which does not bode well for the independent sector.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not contain many other necessary safeguards.  There is no certainty that independent producers will be given access to the airwaves.  The Bill does not contain any guarantees in this regard.  As a result there is every possibility that RTE may for its own reasons stand in the way of the broadcasting of these programmes.  I accept that there has to be some type of quality control over programming, but from my experience I know that there is no shortage of quality and talent in the independent broadcasting sector.  I am concerned that this Bill does not copperfasten the right of independent producers to have their programmes broadcast.  This is the most fundamental right of all, it is the <i>raison d'être</i> for any broadcaster.  At the end of the day RTE holds all the trump cards and the independent sector has not been given the legislative back up it so badly needs.</P>
    <P>I do not see anything in the Bill &mdash; maybe I am wrong &mdash; which will prevent RTE personnel involved in the production business from transferring their assets to family members, thereby giving them no apparent financial interest.  The main reason for developing the independent sector is to introduce new blood into broadcasting and to allow for greater diversity in terms of programming.  I am afraid the provisions of this Bill may perpetuate or copperfasten the <i>status quo</i> of the present closed shop.  Its provisions comprise a mixed bag.  There is much on which to commend the Bill but it is flawed in certain respects.  I should like to see these defects rectified as soon as possible if the true potential of broadcasting is to be effectively tapped.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MattBrennan" hpid="Mr. M. Brennan Mr. M. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill.  In particular, I very much appreciate local radio.  In this <Col N="828" /> respect I want to refer to North West Radio and Mid-West Radio in Sligo and Ballyhaunis.  Local radio has provided news coverage in addition to comfort to local communities and is one of the greatest things that ever happened in rural areas.  It has been of enormous benefit to local communities providing locally-orientated programmes, chat shows, Irish music and other types of entertainment.</P>
      <P>We are sometimes critical of RTE but we must remember that it has done tremendous work in broadcasting and television over the years.  However, I noticed recently that RTE people appear to be very cynical about politicians and politics.  For example, when the Maastricht Treaty was being negotiated and our former Taoiseach was involved I noticed that RTE considered it more important to devote time to discussion of Carysfort College on the relevant morning than to the Maastricht Treaty.  I was not happy about that.  I was in Dublin and switched to see the BBC's coverage of the Maastricht Treaty, which was far greater than that of RTE.  I was not very happy either about the discussion on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; on that occasion.</P>
      <P>We are aware that local radio began to operate legally in 1989 and since then they have made steady progress to the extent that their listenership today has surpassed that of Radio 1 and has almost twice the listenership of FM2.  That is an enormous advance by local radio, which has brought enormous comfort to listeners in rural areas, young and old, who can listen to reports of local events.  They provide news items and information on what is happening locally, which is a great service.  That is why I want to give them credit on their achievement.  Local radio should be financed from our licences.</P>
      <P>While RTE 1 and 2 have a monopoly <i>vis-á-vis</i> the licence fee, local radio should receive part of that revenue to keep it going.  It is not easy for them as they have invested large amounts of money for which they should be compensated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>RTE gives great sports coverage to local and national games, gaelic football, hurling, soccer, the World Cup and the <Col N="829" /> Olympic Games.  I want to give credit where it is due.</P>
    <P>I am happy that local radio has done so well since its legal initiation in 1989.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Is Bille tábhachtach é seo mar tá tionchar an-mhór ag RTÉ ar gach seirbhís raidió agus ar gach nuachtán ar fud na tíre.  Tá tagairt déanta cheana don tionchar atá ag RTÉ ar mheath na Gaeilge, agus b'fhéidir nach bhfuil dóthain déanta ag RTÉ mar a dhéantaí tráth.  Bhí seans acu cláir Ghaeilge a chraoladh ach is dócha go bhfuil deacrachtaí ann maidir le meascán cothrom bheith ann mar tá daoine ann nach bhfuil Gaeilge ar a dtoil acu agus dá mbeadh an iomarca Gaeilge sna cláir bhainfeadh sé sin go mór den líon éist-eachta agus féachana.  Ach, os a choinne sin, is stáisiún náisiúnta RTÉ agus ba chóir go mbeadh Gaeilge le cloisteáil ar an raidió agus ar an teilifís.  B'fhéidir go bhfuasclófar an fhadhb seo nuair a bheidh teilifís Ghaeilge againn, agus tá súil agam go n-éireoidh leis an mbeartas nua seo.</P>
      <P>Ach b'fhéidir gur fearr an meascán. Más clár iomlán Gaeilge atá ann beidh lucht féachana ann, ach beidh daoine eile ag breathnú ar chláir eile seachas iad, b'fhéidir ar stáisiúin ar nós an BBC. Nuair a bhíonn an meascán ann, fiú an cúpla focal Gaeilge, má fhítear seo isteach sa chlár go nádúrtha músclaíonn sé seo spéis na n-éisteoirí sa teanga.  Sna stáisiúin áitiúla ach go háirithe, bíonn antionchar ag craoltóirí nuair a labhraíonn siad as Gaeilge mar ghnáthdhaoine ar spéis leo Gaeilge a labhairt.</P>
      <P>I compliment many people in local radio who, when introducing their programmes, use the &ldquo;cúpla focal&rdquo; in a natural way, thereby allowing people to understand that our native language is not something reserved for fossils, museums and intellectuals nationwide.  It is great to hear an ordinary person &mdash; who may not be a teacher or public representative &mdash; using the &ldquo;cúpla focal&rdquo; in cluasíní, when everybody knows exactly what he or she is saying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The removal of the cap on advertising by RTE is a double-edged sword.  I am <Col N="830" /> sure RTE are delighted that they will be enabled to earn as much advertising revenue as they wish.  On the other hand, if they earn unlimited revenue through advertising, such revenue will be correspondingly reduced through the other sources of advertisement.  Newspapers are often forgotten in the overall world of communications.  We should remember that newspapers constitute the historians of our times in that the printed word will remain long after radio programmes have been forgotten.  Therefore, newspapers should also be protected in this respect. We should remember that local newspapers must compete with the nationals, RTE and perhaps with local radio.  It may be difficult to divert money from licence fees to newspapers but they are the people who, through private enterprise, produce daily newspapers.  I have often thought that the production of a newspaper containing so much news is the nearest thing to a miracle every time it comes off the press.  All of us think that the statements we issue are the most important statements they receive and wonder why they are not included.  Given the amount of material they receive it is a marvellous achievement to publish a newspaper which is up to date.</P>
    <P>The newspapers are not appreciated enough, given that they have a lasting impact.  They are a valuable source of information for historians long after the screen has gone blank, unless of course one stacks up video tapes.</P>
    <P>I join others in paying tribute to the local radio stations which should be protected and defended.  I would have no qualms if some of the revenue raised by way of the licence fee was diverted to these stations.  At the beginning some members of the public foolishly thought that individuals would jump in and invest in local radio to make a profit.  It is now realised the profits will be limited. Indeed, I admire those who are prepared to invest in local radio.  It should be remembered that even those local radio stations which are doing well are in financial difficulty.  I ask the Minister to take the financial position of local radio stations into account, given the service <Col N="831" /> that they provide.  Indeed, they are much more than radio stations in that they issue warnings about the danger of flooding, oil spills and so on in local areas.  They even annouce death notices.</P>
    <P>I compliment local radio stations for the programmes they produce which are of an extremely high standard.  The listenership figures prove this.  In this regard I should mention the local radio station in my own area, CKR, which is among the top stations in the country and can hold its own with RTE.  In relation to advertising, however, it is not competing on a level playing pitch having regard to the fact that big companies want RTE to carry all their advertising.</P>
    <P>I also compliment local radio stations for carrying Irish language programmes. This is exactly what we want; the language should not be reserved for special State occasions.</P>
    <P>I sound a word of warning on the question of programmes produced by independent film-makers.  Many people within RTE have a direct line to the Authority and if some of them set up their own companies we may not know who we are helping.  Perhaps when the Minister comes to reply he will outline what the position will be in this regard. While we should encourage independent film-makers to produce drama programmes and so on people should not be allowed to use inside information to gain access to those at the top.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I ask the Minister to examine seriously the role newspapers and local radio stations play in our society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Deputies who have contributed to the debate on Second Stage, in particular for the constructive approach they have taken.  In relation to the concerns voiced there was a commonality of expression. I will deal with these in a few moments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my introductory speech I said that this was but the first critical step in my approach to broadcasting.  In developing my response to the Bill I was particularly <Col N="832" /> anxious about the jobs situation.  Let us be clear about some matters.  Section 3 of the 1990 Act put jobs at risk.  When I met the RTE Authority they made it very clear that they had prepared notices for individuals in case the cap would not be removed.  In addition, the advertising industry presented clear evidence that jobs were at risk.  I found myself in a situation, therefore, where jobs were under immediate threat and I had to act. If I had decided to wait to encompass what is included in this Bill in more general legislation I would have been playing with those jobs and livelihoods.</P>
    <P>All of the Deputies who spoke expressed concern about local radio stations.  Officials of my Department had a series of technical meetings with the Independent Radio and Television Commission and AIRS prior to my substantial meeting with the representatives of AIRS which lasted for over two hours.  This has been followed by a further series of technical meetings between my staff and that organisation.  I was presented with a series of proposals not unlike those made in the House today.  In return, I made a number of proposals to see how I could be of assistance to them.  I can assure the House that I take the commitment contained in the section of the joint programme for Government dealing with the viability of local radio stations very seriously, like the other commitments contained in the programme.</P>
    <P>A number of points were raised during the course of the debate which, with respect, improved as it progressed.  I believe that Deputy Frances Fitzgerald was confused in that she accused me of interfering with RTE by removing the cap while at the same time she wanted me to reach in to the editorial function of RTE.  While I wish her well it seems her script had been issued before she heard my speech because, for example, she also accused me of not developing a concept of public service broadcasting. In my speech I drew a distinction between an approach built around the communicative order as opposed to market segments.  That was probably the clearest statement on broadcasting policy offered <Col N="833" /> in this House for some time.  I am not asking everyone to agree with me but I have stated explicitly that I regard broadcasting as a part of the communicative order of society and I am approaching it from a rights perspective.  Therefore the rights of minorities and genders have to be balanced.  One would arrive at a different set of conclusions if one began by looking on the population as being divided into a series of market segments.</P>
    <P>On reflection, I think the Deputy will want to think again about her decription of my actions as &ldquo;a liked, liked Bill&rdquo; which is somewhat similar to the use of double adverbs by Mrs. Thatcher for which she became infamous when she lectured the miners for being &ldquo;very, very silly&rdquo;.  She was also being unfair in using the words &ldquo;interference&rdquo; and &ldquo;ad hocery&rdquo;.  The need for a policy was developed in my speech.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald's contribution also contained a number of buzz words, including &ldquo;freeze frame&rdquo;, &ldquo;pay-offs&rdquo;, &ldquo;unravelling&rdquo; and a complicated image about knitting which I found to be rather unusual.  She pointed out that the Bill would lead to a fabric which was distorted and jangled.  This was an unfortunate mixed metaphor at best.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the points she made about local broadcasting.  Let me repeat, I will address the issue.  Deputy Fitzgerald did make a very good point when she spoke of the importance of music.  I share her concern.  She correctly describes tradition as a tool of local democracy and an important cultural contribution.  She is correct, as were other Deputies, in stressing the important role of drama and that it should be assisted.  In the cut and thrust of politics she is right to describe my legislation in whatever way she likes.  I will be concentrating on the positive suggestions she made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Quill spoke about the need for a more comprehensive Bill.  I have addressed this issue already.  I said I had <Col N="834" /> to deal with the immediate threat to jobs, which is very important.  I will address these issues in the more general legislation to be brought forward.  The Deputy said that most of the Bill was laudable; this was courageous of somebody who did not join with me in opposing the cap in 1990.  Her change of mind is welcome and I respect it.  It is not easy for somebody who votes for a measure to say simply that it has not worked.  I will take on board the points she made, including the importance of vigorous current affairs, music, drama and the other cultural contributions in broadcasting.</P>
    <P>I found all the contributions very positive in that regard and I certainly will be looking at all these areas.  I will facilitate a broad debate.  In my introduction speech I said I hoped when I would introduce general legislation to give people an opportunity to discuss a broadcasting regime that will last past the end of this century.  This will give us a great opportunity to debate broadcasting within a culture.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy De Rossa for his very complimentary remarks.  He is correct in saying that the use in my script of the word &ldquo;exploit&rdquo; is verbal abuse and I take his correction in the spirit in which it was offered.  One always develops creativity and allows it to flower and one does not, in fact, exploit creative talent.  It is very good to correct the use of language.  I will be, as he suggested, reviewing section 31. He has hit on a very important point: people have concentrated their attention on the orders made under section 31 but the best way of looking at it may be to move back from the order itself and ask how the section is functioning in relation to other sections of broadcasting legislation. If we are introducing fundamental legislation on broadcasting we need to look at the corpus of legislation that exists and question the intent of section 31 and ask how it related to other duties and responsibilities which are specified in the existing legislation and how they are being fulfilled &mdash; for example, to section 18 which places obligations on the Authority. I will be carrying out a comprehensive review.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="835" /> Deputy O'Sullivan has a long interest &mdash; indeed he spoke to me about it some time ago &mdash; in a subject that Deputy Quill raised, the extension of RTE's broadcasting hours in Cork.  I am examining this at present and in the course of preparing my total review of broadcasting legislation which will lead to substantial legislation I will be looking at the operation of the 1988 Act.  I would be very foolish not to take this opportunity and in doing so we will address a number of the issues the Deputies raised.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Kemmy for his kind remarks.  He rightly stressed the importance of local radio.  The 1988 Act set up a regime for local commercial radio and it also brought the Independent Radio and Television Commission into existence. I again state my dissatisfaction with the provision made for community radio. What people thought they were getting into in 1988 and 1989 has changed.  The public wanted stories, drama and documentation as well as news and current affairs and they voted with their ears. People who thought the public would be satisfied with a diet of less had to change and many stations that began with one idea came around to a different view through talking to their listeners.  Their programmes now include current affairs and news.</P>
    <P>The fact that I am bringing forward legislation to deal with television in the independent sector does not mean that I am neglecting anything else.  I have spoken already of the meetings that took place before I finalised this legislation.  I am very well aware of the views of the different lobby groups.  I cannot put the newspapers right but I am certainly aware of the arguments they are making.  One cannot speak of an easy migration of advertising revenue from the visual to the print medium as it simply does not work like that.  They have difficulties that I addressed in my opening speech.  I like to see local radio and local newspapers as part of the communicative order.  I may be more concerned than some of the newspapers themselves about tendencies towards monopoly in the ownership and <Col N="836" /> editorial structure.  Very often monopolistic structures are tending to reach out from the national arena into the local provincial press.  I met the representatives of the local press and held a very good and positive meeting with them.  I am looking forward to a meeting with the members of the national newspapers of Ireland.  I had a meeting with the RTE Authority as well as the RTE group of trade unions.  I have met the members of the RTE Authority as well as the RTE group of trade unions.  I have met the members of the Independent Radio and Television Commission and AIRS.  I have been practicising a process of consultation.  I find if difficult that those who say they welcome the removal of the cap will vote against the Bill.  Is this as a result of my proposals on the independent film sector?  My proposals are both specific, tightly defined and accountable.  In response to the many points raised on the &ldquo;stand alone&rdquo; distance between commissioning and the actual ownership of production, I have gone to the trouble of defining it.  I have also ensured that all commissions have to be reported on and the report comes back to the Oireachtas.  I will be monitoring the situation.</P>
    <P>I will be also monitoring predatory pricing.  Deputy Deasy raised many points which I have covered already but he may need to be assured that I will not be allocating time for my own poetry as I have not the slightest intention of reaching into the commissioning decisions of RTE.  My responsibilities essentially are to introduce and provide the best broadcasting regime that will accomplish the objectives stated in the Government programme.  I intend to do that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke made an interesting speech in which he outlined his thinking at the time he introduced the Broadcasting (Wireless Telegraphy) Act, 1988, and the Radio and Television Act, 1990. With respect, I have not changed my own view and I appreciate the vigorous defence he made of his, which I think was a mistake at the time.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with one or two specific <Col N="837" /> points because I would like to respond to Deputies in the same spirit of generosity with which they prepared their contributions.</P>
    <P>We all recognise that local radio has a number of set costs which range from the high cost of news and current affairs, transmission costs, the costs involved in producing documentaries and the costs relating to the running of special projects. I think it was Deputy Deasy who asked whether I had looked at the profile of local radio.  That was where I began.  I realised that some stations are viable and doing well but others are in difficulty. This breaks down in turn to stations that are seeking mergers and those that are in difficulty and resisting mergers.  There are also other divisions we could make between stations whose origins are loosely in the community and who have now turned commercial or the many more that began in a commercial vein and have now become community.</P>
    <P>I have spent a great deal of time assessing the degree of their investment, their initial capital costs and their present capital requirements.  At a meeting with the executives of AIRS which lasted more than two hours I discussed with them not only the list of proposals they put to me but also a set of proposals which I put to them.  That meeting has been succeeded by contacts with my Department on how best to advance their position and I intend to follow that through.  There is a clear, unequivocal commitment in the Programme for Government to make local radio viable and I will address that matter with the same degree of commitment and urgency as I am addressing other matters.  In this legislation I am trying to protect and create jobs.</P>
    <P>In making proposals for local radio I will bear in mind all the points raised by Deputies.  I have met not only the representative organisations dealing with stations but also individual station owners, one of whom told me yesterday that they simply want me to provide a regime that will last for a period of time rather than respond quickly to particular demands.  They would prefer me to take <Col N="838" /> time with the matter in the way I am proposing rather than to respond to each individual proposal in the short term.  I am not going to lose time on this matter but I will give it the consideration necessary to provide a regime for local and community radio which will last.  In preparing this fundamental change in broadcasting I will consider the total structures of broadcasting.  It is past time for us to consider Radio na Gaeltachta, Teilifís na Gaeltachta, local community radio and RTE, and I will be considering all these appropriate structures.</P>
    <P>The Irish people have a great interest in the story telling and narrative and they welcome story telling in forms of drama and documentaries.  I am pleased that the public have been able to communicate this wish to the many broadcasting practitioners. I remind Deputies who commented on my proposals for the independent sector that I have taken a great deal of time considering this matter in terms of the independent person and the commissioning body.  I have set up procedures that are transparent and Deputies will have an opportunity, on an annual basis if they so wish, to question these procedures.  I give the same advice to those who are concerned about predatory pricing.  I would refer Deputies to my opening speech on Second Stage when I said I will be keeping a close eye on this matter.  I will exercise my powers in the event of abuse of the system so as to prevent an unacceptable predatory pricing regime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the gaze is directed in a slightly different area. Deputy Kemmy said that in the early days, before the introduction of regulations in relation to independent broadcasting, many of the work practices and conditions were unacceptable, and that is a good point.  The viability package for local radio must include conditions and procedures that will be acceptable, which will in turn lead to the making of a professional contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="839" /> I particularly thank those Deputies who welcomed the contribution made by broadcasters in relation to the use of the Irish language.  Tá súil agam go mbainfear i bhfad níos mó úsáide as an Ghaeilge ar an raidió áitiúil agus i gcúrsaí cralta i gcoitinne, go háirithe chun cúrsaí reatha agus mórimeachtaí na linne seo a phlé, agus go mbeidh béim ar leith ar nuachtchláir agus nuashaothar scríbh-neoireachta, agus mar sin de.</P>
    <P>Is iontach an borradh is féidir leis na meáin chumarsáide a thabhairt do chur chun cinn na teanga.  Glacaim leis an tuairim a nochtadh inniu go bhfuil i bhfad níos mó suime sa Ghaeilge, i litríocht na Gaeilge, i saol na Gaeilge agus sna Gaeltachtaí faoi láthair ná b'amhlaidh roimhe seo.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh ar chumas lucht cumarsáide ag leibhéal an Stáit agus ag an leibhéal áitiúil agus príobháideach a thuilleadh a dhéanamh, agus beidh fonn orm cabhrú leo.</P>
    <P>On the whole question of commissioning of independent film production, there is an enormous creative resource in this country in the whole area of film and television.  I propose that the independent film sector should have access to RTE.  In my introductory speech I said there is no reason that a national station should not be used as a starting point for our young film makers and I intend to ensure that this is done. When I make specific provision requiring a sum of money I am accused of interfering with capacity within the station. Let me make this point clear.  In my meeting with the RTE group of trade unions and the RTE Authority I stressed that RTE's greatest asset is in the creative capacity of its workforce.  It is my wish that this creativity be used in the station to make programmes.  I am not saying what programmes should be made but simply giving my views on broadcasting. I do not see a creative workforce as being locked into a kind of regime which would be market segment led.  It should be used to produce new products and to create new and exciting initiatives.  I hope that the creativity that will result from the <Col N="840" /> interaction between the independent sector and RTE will be of benefit to both.</P>
    <P>Deputies raised the question of the impact of this Bill on various areas of broadcasting and communications generally. I will have an opportunity of reviewing the legislation if necessary.  I believe I have come up with the best definitions possible and the best mechanisms for transparency.  Most of the concerns raised were about local radio, which I have addressed.</P>
    <P>It is very important that people realise what is at stake in the history of this argument.  When the independent sector first approached elected representatives some of them made an uncritical demand for a share of the licence fee.  The more recent submissions are very well thought out and do not make such a simple demand.  They do not ask for a single measure or that money be expended in a blanket way.  These people have responded positively to my request for information about their practical problems of operation, which differ from one case to another.  My approach will be to respond with respect for the complexity of the matter.  I have told this sector that while no decisions have been made, of most value has been their identification of precise levels of costings and how they might best be assisted.  Deputy Finucane raised that point, as did Deputy Pat Upton who was concerned that the effects of this Bill within RTE would lead to a lack of creativity.  I have addressed that issue.</P>
    <P>Deputy Foley raised the question of my approach to this matter.  I do not agree that my approach is one-sided or insensitive to local papers or local radio. In the past I have been more defensive of local newspapers than many others.  I saw good local newspapers fall to hostile bids for ownership.  If there are not conditions of employment with regard to competing products and another media locally, the newspaper which is paying union wages under good conditions is at a disadvantage.  By improving conditions in local radio one indirectly creates a level field in relation to employment and <Col N="841" /> conditions.  The proprietors of local newspapers indicated to me that they did not oppose lifting the cap.  There were other matters which impinged upon them much more, of which I took a detailed note and am addressing.  Deputy Killeen made a point with which I agree, with regard to Clare FM, which he claims is one of the most successful stations.  He raised an interesting question about the levy on the Independent Radio and Television Commission.  Any fundamental review of broadcasting must review the 1988 Act.  Even Deputy Burke acknowledges that conditions have changed since 1987.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe spoke about the independent sector.  The House has just two issues to decide, the removal of the cap and my proposals for the independent sector.  Taken with the revival of the film board, the changed regime on taxation on film production, the provision on Telefís na Gaeilge and my support for small production units within the Gaeltacht, all I am doing in this proposal is putting together perhaps the most favourable atmosphere for film and television production that has prevailed for some time because I know the creative capacity of the people involved, the immense job potential and that if we create good jobs in this area they will not be vulnerable to a decision taken at a distance.  One is talking about intelligence products with low transport costs, over which one has so much control and something for which we have a recognised genius.  With regard to recognition, a 24 year old man competing against 4,100 products won a gold medal last week in Houston, Texas, for his arts production &ldquo;Blood on the Canvas&rdquo;, a film completed in Telegael in Spiddal.  We also have the success of Neil Jordan and the wonderful woman who won her second Oscar for make-up.</P>
    <P>All these proposals are very positive. This small measure is a critical first step directed towards job protection.  I was not talking about an abstract threat to jobs in the future.  There was a real threat to jobs in RTE in the advertising sector, a real flight of advertising revenue from <Col N="842" /> this country.  There was negativity in relation to the independent sector.  First it froze, then it shrank and a number of jobs were lost.  I have turned this around. I will be coming back to the Dáil with comprehensive legislation, without undue delay, and that will follow the philosophy I outlined in introducing the Second Stage of this Bill.  It will be derived from arts, culture, Gaeltacht, broadcasting and heritage.  It will be a democratic theory of culture and within which there will be an approach which sees citizens as part of the communicative order with rights.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford):</i> The budget was framed with a view to creating and protecting jobs. High interest rates created a major problem. I welcome their reduction over the past few months but I am concerned at the delay in passing it on to mortgage holders.  Some of the lending institutions only passed on the benefits from 1 May. This delay is unacceptable as people were under severe pressure to meet mortgage repayments.</P>
      <P>This year's public capital programme increased by 27 per cent to £2.340 million and the share of the programme financed from the Exchequer will be up by £170 million.  No less than £143 million of this increase will be applied to housing, roads and sanitary services.  The capital provision for my Department's programme has increased by nearly £177 million or by a 38 per cent increase on the 1992 outturn.  This is a clear indication of the Government's priority in regard to essential social and economic services.  The allocation of nearly £90 million of the Cohesion Fund to roads, sanitary and environmental services will bring spending in these areas to a record level in 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our construction industry is of great importance.  Investment and employment in construction is determined, to a large measure, by the general economic climate at any given time.  The Government plays a significant role in encouraging activity in the industry through the financing of a diverse range of projects. The total public capital programme expenditure on construction is estimated <Col N="844" /> at £1.367 million this year, an overall increase of over 22 per cent on last year's outturn.  The increased investment will generate jobs in the industry direct and indirectly.  This year 3,500 new houses will be constructed in the local authority area.  This is a substantial increase over 1992.  At this stage every local authority would have received their 1993 allocation. As has been pointed out by the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Smith and the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, it is important that each local authority ensures the construction of these houses without delay.  Obviously this will be advantageous to those seeking housing and it will create jobs and ensure a vibrant construction industry in the coming year.</P>
    <P>The 3,500 housing starts represent a three and a half fold increase on the number authorised in 1992.  On average, each house start will provide one additional job with a further job being provided in ancillary services.  When the expanded programme is fully underway an additional 4,000 jobs, direct and indirect, will be created in 1993.  There are many different schemes of local authority housing construction at present, the shared ownership scheme, direct local authority housing and voluntary housing. Through a combination of these schemes there should be a substantial reduction in the number of people on our housing lists during the lifetime of this Government. The Programme for a Partnership Government gives a commitment to build as many local authority houses as possible through shared ownership and voluntary schemes, thus ensuring that as many people as possible thoughout the country have the right to a house.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Government provides for an accelerated programme of remedial works in bathrooms for people who still require them.  In various parts of the country, there are houses, and particularly in urban areas, built in the thirties and forties which do not have bathroom facilities.  It is important that the Government give a commitment in this area.  During the past number of years we have seen tremendous progress <Col N="845" /> in this area and in excess of £80 million has been spent in upgrading many substandard local authority dwellings.  An increase of £1 million was announced in the budget which means that £17 million will be available in 1993 for such remedial works.  I hope this will make major inroads in regard to the provision of bathrooms in local authority dwellings in 1993.  I hope this programme will be continued over the next few years to ensure that this problem is resolved once and for all.</P>
    <P>One of the largest and most important items of expenditure in the local authorties' annual programme of works is road maintenance.  In 1993 the Department of the Environment will contribute £20.7 million in grants for national road maintenance and £65.3 million in discretionary grants for non-national road maintenance and improvement.  With this level of investment, supplemented by large amounts from local resources, we must ensure we are getting value for money.  The Minister for the Environment has set up in the Department of the Environment a new &ldquo;value for money&rdquo; unit.  This unit will work with local authorities in ensuring that maximum efficiency and effectiveness is achieved in all programmes in 1993.  I hope this &ldquo;value for money&rdquo; unit will ensure that moneys are spent properly, that the works carried out are performed to the highest standards and that we will not see a wastage of funds in any area of road building during the coming year. With the support of funding committed under the operational programme on peripherality and new funding anticipated under the Cohesion Fund, investment in the improvement of the national primary and secondary road network will total £242 million in 1993.  In 1992 the expenditure was £167 million.  The introduction of the Cohesion Fund is responsible for £40 million of the increase of £74.5 million.  The new funds will help the local authorities and the Department of the Environment to accelerate the pace of construction and improvement works on our national road network throughout the country.  As we have <Col N="846" /> heard so often, the Cohesion Fund will level the playing pitch and I hope every county will benefit substantially.</P>
    <P>Despite very severe financial difficulties, the Government are again providing substantial funding for non-national roads in 1993.  Local authorities will also devote much of their resources to this area.  We have emphasised on many occasions the need to ensure that the greatest possible value for money is secured from this investment.  In the past four years the Exchequer has provided over £250 million for works on regional and county roads.  Returns to the Department indicate that local authorities invested almost the same amount in that period.  We are also aware that the county roads are still a major bone of contention. I am glad to see my colleague from Wexford has arrived.  I hope she will not call a quorum today to spoil the party.</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> The case has been made on a number of occasions from all sides of the House that some of the funds from Europe should be made available for county roads.  The Minister for the Environment, Deputy Smith, the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, and I have had a number of meetings with the Commissioners with a view to seeing how this can be achieved.  The suggestion has been made that 10 per cent of the funds should go towards county roads to bring them up to the required standard.  While it is important to build ring roads and upgrade our national and primary roads, it is important also to maintain a standard on our county and secondary roads.  I hope we can succeed in securing a level of funding from Europe to assist in this area.  There is a certain reluctance to make moneys available for county roads. In the counties which depend on tourism, <Col N="847" /> agriculture and other areas of economic activity it is important that the road structures are up to the required standard.  We will fight tooth and nail to ensure that some moneys will be made available from Brussels for county roads.  Obviously increased funding is important.  It is important that the next tranche of funding from 1994-99 is spent in the proper fashion and that we get value for money.</P>

Obviously housing construction will be of major importance to those on the housing lists but it will also ensure that jobs are created and maintained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulvihill:</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me time to speak on the budget.  I know that interest in the budget has now decreased. It is, unfortunately, a one day debate as far as the general public is concerned. There are a few items I would like to speak on today.  Given the present chronic housing shortage, I welcome the Government's commitment.  In my constituency there is an enormous waiting list and I know that, to a certain extent, the Government's commitment to housing will relieve it.  The allocation of £20 million to relieve hospital waiting lists is also welcome.</P>
      <P>An issue that very much concerns me is the plight of widowers.  Being a widower I know what it is all about.  My wife died approximately five years ago and I was left with four children to raise.  When my tax assessment form came the following year I learned, to my amazement, that I was taxed as a single person which added enormously to my problems.  A number of people are compaigning in this regard. I appeal to the Minister to do something for them because they are under enormous pressure, having been left on their own.  One person who comes to mind is a man with five children, a schoolteacher by profession.  He cannot afford to employ a housekeeper and has been forced to give up his job.  I appeal to the Minister to look into this very important matter.</P>
      <P>Another issue that concerns me is VAT on clothing.  I hope the Minister will do something to relieve the pressure on small businesses, particularly the man with the corner shop who employs three or four members of his own family and who will be under enormous pressure in keeping his business going because of the extra VAT on clothing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose:</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to contribute on the budget, even at this late stage.  As a member of a local authority I welcome the increased allocation for local authority housing. Having been reared in one of those council houses, I have a special grá for that area.</P>
      <P>To be parochial, the housing situation in Westmeath County Council has been critical in the last few years and a three and a half fold increase, although welcome, should be perceived as the beginning because it only makes a dent in the problem.  I urge the Government to continue its planned programme and to build at least 5,000 local authority houses next year.  The assessment of housing needs is based on those of March 1991. Further assessments have been carried out and about 300 people are awaiting housing.  Things have changed in the last decade and we must take cognisance of this change.  Otherwise, we will have failed the people who sent us here to represent them.  The Minister should note that moneys put into housing consitutes not only a welcome relief to those on the housing list but is critical to job creation.  Many small builders are now eagerly watching each financial statement emanating from the Department of Finance to see if they will get an allocation for house construction or capital programmes. These are vital to their survival and that of the people they employ.  I hope the building of 3,500 houses will generate 8,000-9,000 jobs in the current year.  If we continue on those lines it will give some hope to people who are languishing on the unemployment list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The area of health is close to my heart. I certainly welcome the proposals to provide £20 million specifically to reduce the waiting lists in our public hospitals.  It is one area where I would have no problem about borrowing £25 million or £30 million to speed up orthopaedic treatment, hip replacements and other elective surgery. We should make an all out attempt to ensure that the waiting time for operations is cut from its present scandalous level of up to two years to six months. <Col N="850" /> That is the minimum we should aim for and it is vital that we continue along this road in the area of health.</P>
    <P>The extra £8 million to provide additional services for the mentally handicapped will go some way towards helping those in need.  The Governments's commitment to handicapped people and their families is borne out by this extra allocation on top of the £6 million already given.  I am not in agreement with the increase in hospital service charges and I hope the promised reviews will mean the end of such increases.</P>
    <P>It seems to have been overlooked that, despite stringent financial circumstances, social welfare benefits have been maintained and kept pace with inflation.  Some of the increases announced were beneficial. As the eldest of a family of ten, I can tell the Minister that the child allowance was a very important part of the family income.  The increase of 27 per cent in child benefit is especially welcome and was mentioned quite frequently in the housing estates where I canvassed in the November election.  I am glad, therefore, to see this commitment honoured.  Some people are disappointed that it will not be given until September. Nevertheless, September is a crucial period for parents and this extra money will be welcome to clothe children and finance books, etc.  This 1 per cent levy is a cause of great concern to many people, including me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. T. Kitt):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 13, 14, 19, 37, 39, 43, 52, 53, 59, 65, 73, 77 and 81 together.</P>
      <P>The acceptance of the Vance-Owen plan by Bosnian Serb leader Karadzic in Athens on 2 May offered the hope of a resolution to the dreadful conflict which has brought so much suffering to the people of Bosnia.  Its rejection earlier this morning by the Bosnian Serb Assembly is a major setback.  Nevertheless, the fact that the authorities in Belgrade are now actively supporting implementation of the plan is an important and encouraging development.</P>
      <P>The vote by the Bosnian Serb Assembly is an arrogant and dangerous development.  It is a further challenge to the international community and to the United Nations.  The Security Council will meet later today to consider what action needs to be taken, including the pressure to be exerted on the Bosnian Serbs.  I hope that it will be possible for the Security Council to build upon the more co-operative approach demonstrated by President Milosevic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must not be deflected by the decision of the Bosnian Serb Assembly. The Security Council must continue, <Col N="855" /> actively and urgently, its consideration of the preparations for the implementation of the plan.  This is an enormous challenge and would require the deployment of a very large peace-keeping force under UN auspices.  Ireland has not to date been requested to supply personnel to this force.  Any approach from the Secretary-General on this matter will be considered carefully by the Government.</P>
    <P>I share the view of the UN Secretary-General that the peace package provides the only mechanism available for the re-establishment of peace, with justice and respect for human rights, in Bosnia-Hercegovina and that the rapid implementation of the plan offers the best prospects for improving the situation there.  The Vance-Owen plan requires the Bosnian Serbs to withdraw from large areas of Bosnia which they acquired by brutal and indiscriminate force.</P>
    <P>The Government has been actively pursuing a policy involving a combination of increased pressure on Serbia through sanctions, while underlining the determination of the international community to ensure that continued defiance, by the Bosnian Serbs and by Serbia and Montenegro, of the decisions of the UN Security Council would not be tolerated. This view was expressed very clearly by the Irish representative in the debate in the Security Council on 20 April.</P>
    <P>It was the view which the Tánaiste expressed at the meeting of EC Foreign Ministers in Denmark on 24-25 April. At this meeting, Ministers considered a range of options for additional measures to bring about peace in former Yugoslavia. They agreed that the policy of isolating Serbia and Montenegro, through the strict application of the provisions of Security Council Resolution 820, offered the best hope of obtaining implementation of the Vance-Owen plan.</P>
    <P>On the basis of an Irish proposal, Ministers also considered the possibility of establishing additional safe areas in Bosnia so that protection could be afforded to the Muslim population.  I very much hope that, if implementation of the <Col N="856" /> Vance-Owen plan proceeds, it will not prove necessary to establish further safe havens or areas.  However, it remains an option that may need to be considered, particularly in the light of the Bosnian Serb Assembly's decision earlier today. Additional UN peacekeeping troops would be required in Bosnia to establish such areas.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that the Bosnian Serbs can, even at this late stage, be brought to co-operate with the peace process and implement the Vance-Owen plan, thus obviating the need for further enforcement measures.  Should this not be the case, should the killing continue, it would be necessary, as we said in the Security Council for the council to consider all the options open to it under Chapter VII of the Charter.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay tribute to the UN peace-keeping forces and the humanitarian aid personnel on the ground in Bosnia.  Hundreds of thousands of Bosnians would have perished last winter had it not been for their efforts.  The European Community and its member states have been the main contributors to the international relief operation in the former Yugoslavia, since the start of the conflict in 1991.  The Community and its member states have, to date, covered 58 per cent of the expenditure by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, which is the lead agency in the operation, and 73 per cent of the cost of the food distribution operation being carried out by the world food programme.</P>
    <P>Since 1991, the European Community has committed a total of 350 million ECU in emergency assistance to victims of conflict. In view of the seriousness of the humanitarian situation in Bosnia, a further allocation of 150 million ECU was agreed on 29 April, 1993.  The precise breakdown of this extra expenditure is still under consideration.  However, it will include further substantial contributions to the UNHCR, to the world food programme and to other agencies involved in the delivery of emergency food and medical assistance to over 3.8 million refugees and other victims of the conflict.</P>
    <P>We will continue to stay in very close <Col N="857" /> liaison with our EC partners.  Bosnia will be discussed by EC Foreign Ministers at their next meeting in Brussels on 10 May and at the European Council in June. Proposals are also under consideration for a full meeting of the International Conference on Yugoslavia.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the recent report of the world food programme which indicated that no additional pledges were made in respect of a food programme to the former Yugoslavia up to March 1993?  In the light of what the Minister stated regarding a recent decision by the European Community that 200 million ECU will be allocated in respect of food donor countries to this fund, will he acknowledge that this is far short of what is required having regard to what is contained in the world food programme report and that £365 million is what would be required to compensate for the food shortages arising from the conflict?  Will the Minister indicate what other steps he will be taking at EC level to improve the food supply at the earliest possible opportunity?</P>

      <P>Will the Minister indicate what action the Government proposes to take in view of the collapse of the Bosnian/Serb Assembly in relation to this agreement and their failure to agree the Vance-Owen plan?  What contribution will the Government and Irish Army personnel make to a UN peace enforcement plan?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to food distribution, the increase in emergency assistance agreed by the European Community and by individual member states has been designed to ensure that the UN relief operations can continue to provide essential humanitarian assistance to victims of the conflict in the former Yugoslavia in the coming months.  I am aware of the points made by the Deputy but I pointed out the contribution that has been made by the European Community.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's second question was about Irish troop involvement and the role that Irish troops might play in a possible UN peace-keeping force.  The Government has not to date been approached by the Secretary General regarding a possible contribution to the force.  Indeed, the mandate for the force has not yet been established by the Security Council and our policy is to examine all requests from the Secretary General on a case by case basis.  We will do so should he seek our support in this instance.  It is important that we take each country case by case and the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste have already been questioned on the situation with regard to Somalia.  This would involve a Government decision, as the Deputy is aware, and it would also involve changing our Defence Act, 1960 which contains a specific peace-keeping dimension.  The request has come in relation to Somalia, as the Deputy knows, and yesterday the Taoiseach in a reply to a question, said that the Government has yet to consider the request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any dispatch of a contingent of troops would require a motion to be brought <Col N="859" /> before the Dáil for approval.  It involves a specific procedure.  However, no request has yet been made but it is our policy to examine each request made to us by the Secretary General.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that Ireland's views on this matter must be devalued by the present state of our defence legislation?  It is worthwhile putting on the record that this legislation prohibits the deployment of Irish troops under a UN mandate except for policing role in the context of peace-keeping operations. Therefore, peace enforcement or peace-making roles are excluded.  Would the Minister agree it is not enough for the Government to say they are considering whether our Defence Act should be amended to permit such a role for Irish soldiers?  Would the Minister agree that we cannot legitimately urge others to use force in circumstances where we legally proscribe ourselves from using such force?  This House could not pass a resolution for intervention in Somalia or Bosnia in a peace-making role without a pre-condition that the Government would have to amend the Defence Act, 1960.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister further agree that in the meantime it is not sufficient to simply express dissatisfaction with the decision of the Bosnian Serb Parliament in this matter?  There is a clear chain of authority and responsibility which goes to the Belgrade Government in this matter. The tanks and artillery being used in the campaign of genocide in Bosnia is equipment which is the property of the Yugoslav national army and could be recovered by them from the people who are abusing them to kill others.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will conclude now. Would the Minister agree that Mr. Milosevic and Dr. Karadzic, even though they have distanced themselves from this decision, are not doing enough to enforce it and that Dr. Karadzic's commitment <Col N="860" /> to resign if he was defeated on this matter by the Serbian parliament has already been torn up in that he is retaining his office as Head of the Bosnia Serb Government.  This is in complete contradition of his undertaking that he would resign from that position if he was defeated on this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has consistently supported a negotiated solution to the Yugoslav crisis.  It holds the view which is shared also by our EC colleagues that the council will have to consider all the options open to it under the Charter should the peace process fail.  The pressure of sanctions, and the knowledge that the international community will not tolerate the continued defiance of the Security Council decisions, has brought about a change of policy in Belgrade.  The Deputy has referred to the role of President Milosevic and the Leader of the Bosnian Serbs, Dr. Karadzic.  It is significant that there has been a change of policy in Belgrade, but we should concentrate on ensuring the full and prompt implementation of the Vance-Owen plan.  That is the basis of our approach, but the position there is changing on an hourly basis. We are convinced that the promotion of the implementation of the Vance-Owen plan is the correct one.  The Deputy referred to specific aspects of the Defence Act, 1960, and in an earlier reply I referred to the procedures involved.  In relation to Somalia, there is a specific request to which the Government will respond.  However, it is very premature to inquire about the Government's attitude to a potential peace-keeping role in Bosnia when we do not know what such a peace-keeping role would involve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa:</NameTxt>
      <P>That highlights the inadequacy of this form of discussion on such an important issue.  Will the Minister <Col N="861" /> give an undertaking that there will be an early debate, not only on the position in former Yugoslavia but in regard to the proposed changes to the Defence Act, 1960?  I am aware there will be an Estimates debate tomorrow but that will not be the same as a general debate on the defence issue.</P>
      <P>The Vance-Owen plan, which was rejected by the Bosnia-Serbs was reductantly signed by the Croats and others. The Serbs only agreed to it on the basis of threats of military action and increased sanctions.  If that plan fails it does not automatically mean that military intervention will be the only option.  Perhaps another approach by way of a political solution, might be considered.  In some circles it has been proposed that an international civil authority should be put in place in Bosnia and that that would be a more productive long term development than seeking to enforce the Vance-Owen plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Vance-Owen plan is a response to a highly complex and tragic problem and its implementation would be extremely difficult following the brutal war and destruction.  As the Secretary General stated, it represents the best hope for restoration of peace with justice and human rights in Bosnia.  In addition to the constitutional provisions central to the plan is the requirement that there should be a complete cessation of hostilities, military disengagement, the return of ethnic military units to assigned <Col N="862" /> provinces and the freedom for displaced persons and refugees to return to their homes in safety.  The alternative is more fighting, destruction and the <i>de facto</i> partition of Bosnia.  It is the Governments view that the Vance-Owen plan is feasible but it requires enormous international support at this stage.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2, 57, 66 and 67 together.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware, I visited Sudan from 22 to 25 April 1993.  I had meetings in Khartoum with representatives of the Government of Sudan and of donor agencies and Governments. In the South, I visited Nimule, Ashwa and Kongor, as well as the operations base of Operation Lifeline Sudan at Lokichokio in Northern Kenya.  In Nairobi I met Dr. John A. Garang and Dr. Lam Akol, representing the different factions of the Sudanese People's Liberation Army, the SPLA.</P>
      <P>The humanitarian situation in southern Sudan is very bad.  Many people have died in recent months and many more, in particular young children and mothers are at risk.  The exact figures are not known.  The principal cause of the crisis is the continuing conflict between the Government of Sudan and the SPLA, and between the different SPLA factions.</P>
      <P>I raised with the Government in Khartoum and with the faction leaders the issue of access for humanitarian aid workers to reach southern Sudan and for their security.  An agreement has been worked out by the UN with the Government, the factions and the relief agencies. I was given every assurance that this agreement would be faithfully implemented. I am aware, however, that the agencies continue to face problems in getting access, in particular from the north.  The alternative routes, from northern Kenya and northern Uganda, are easier, but cannot, of course, service the northern part of southern Sudan.  In March last an allocation of £500,000 was made from the Emergency Humanitarian Relief Fund to a number of agencies working in Sudan.  As a result of my recent visit, an additional allocation of £500,000 has been made to GOAL, CONCERN and UNICEF, bringing to a total of £1 million the amount allocated to Sudan for emergency humanitarian assistance this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="864" /> Ireland has taken up the issue of Sudan with both the European Community and the United Nations, both as regards the need to increase the humanitarian effort and as regards the need to resolve the political issues.  We shall continue to urge all necessary action in order to ensure that the present appalling situation is brought to an end.</P>
    <P>I emphasised to the Sudanese Government representatives and to the SPLA leaders whom I met that they must work for a lasting ceasefire and a long term peace effort.  Only these factors will ultimately solve the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  I am sure he does not need to be reminded that Sudan is one of Ireland's bilateral-aid countries.  Therefore, it is crucial that Ireland continues to play a front line role in bringing about peace in that country.  How optimistic is the Minister that his intervention at UN level will bring about the necessary ceasefire to bring about peace in that country, given that a further 500,000 Sudanese people were displaced from their homelands in 1992?</P>

      <P>With regard to the peace process, Nigeria is currently hosting talks between the Sudanese Government and the Garang factions of the SPLA.  We continue to urge both parties to maintain their commitment to the peace talks and to agree, as a matter of urgency, to a lasting ceasefire.  Unfortunately, the fighting between the different SPLA factions is largely responsible for the current displacement and suffering of the civilian population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had a dual mission: I first had to visit the Government in Khartoum and then talk to both factions.  As I said, I met Dr. Garang and Dr. Lam Akol.  To be honest, I was quite pessimistic after my meeting. I hope that Governments in other countries will do as I have done.  On my return I met the Dutch development Minister who has a particular interest in this area.  I have also written to the Danish President and Mr. Jonah at the UN.  The international community needs to do more to <Col N="865" /> resolve this problem, and not only on the humanitarian side.  The head of the Lifeline operation is an Irishman, Mr. Philip O'Brien.  He said that while it is too late for intervention in many cases, we should try to do as much as we can in the coming months through the provision of more planes, food and medicine. There is a need for the international community to do much more and I have already begun this process at both UN and European level.</P>
    <P>With regard to the overall problem, the international community needs to put more political pressure on those engaged in the fighting, especially on the factions within the SPLA, to stop.  If there was a straightforward process of negotiations between the north and south I would be much more hopeful of an end to fighting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 17, 24, 32, 46 and 64 together.</P>
      <P>It is clear that a certain measure of change in European Community institutions will be required to accommodate the accession of the four EFTA countries currently involved in enlargement negotiations &mdash; Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway.  For example, it will be necessary to adjust the membership of the Council of Ministers of the European Parliament and of the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of whether any wider institutional change would be needed in connection with enlargement was considered at the Lisbon European Council in June 1992.  The European Council concluded that that enlargement of the Union to include the EFTA applicants was possible on the basis of the institutional provisions contained in the Treaty of European Union and attached declarations.  The European Council did not envisage any major innovation in the institutional framework of the union. Ireland shares that view.  I would see the basic institutional balance and structure established under the Treaty on European Union as catering adequately for a <Col N="867" /> membership of 16 or 17.  Limited adaptations will, of course, be necessary to take account of the increase in the number of member states.  This will happen in areas such as the number of MEPs, the number of Commissioners and voting strengths in the Council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister state what impact the announcement by the British Government yesterday in regard to the Social Charter and the difficulties being experienced by the UK Parliament in ratifying the Maastricht Treaty will have on the process of enlargement within the European Community?  Does he envisage that this decision will lead to a setback in terms of enlargement?  What impact would the rejection of the Maastricht Treaty for a second time by Denmark have on the process of enlargement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the position in the United Kingdom, I would not like to speculate on an internal British matter.</P>
      <P>We can expect that the British Government will proceed because they are committed to getting the legislation through and to ratifying the Maastricht Treaty; there is no doubt about that. With regard to the Danish position, the most recent opinion polls show 51 per cent in favour of voting &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, 30 per cent voting &ldquo;no&rdquo; and the remainder do not know.  I do not envisage any problems emanating from that quarter.  With regard to the overall question of enlargement, that will simply proceed as planned. I would perceive those two areas as being separate.  I am convinced that they are as committed as ever to getting the legislation through and to ratification of the Treaty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>An Intergovernmental Conference is scheduled for 1996 which will examine a range of institutional issues concerning the operations of the provisions of the treaty.  In the meantime, the Lisbon European Council concluded that the round of discussions on enlargement to include EFTA countries was possible on the basis of the institutional provisions contained in the Treaty on European Union, a position that Ireland supports.  Deputy Owen asked about the position <i>vis-à-vis</i> future Commissioners. At present we are allocated half the number of Commissioners compared with Germany and a quarter of the number of MEPs from the larger member states.  Under the present institutional provisions, set out at the Lisbon European Council, Ireland is doing quite well. We are anxious to proceed with the debate on enlargement and to be involved in the run-up to the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference.  It goes without saying that it will be important for the new Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs to be involved in that debate.  Some time ago my Department sent a report on enlargement to the former Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities, which will be replaced by the new Joint Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs.  That report covered a range of issues dealing with enlargement, including the implications for the institutions of the European Community.  I hope this committee will address this issue without delay and I look forward to having the benefit of their deliberations before long.</P>

      <P>On the general question of enlargement and the future of the European Community, would the Minister say whether the Government intends producing any discussion paper, Green Paper or otherwise, containing their views on how the EC will evolve over the next four to five years, given the <Col N="869" /> difficulties being experienced in relation to the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty and the likelihood that, even if it is ratified by all of the current member states, significant sections of it are unlikely ever to be implemented, and also given that there are increasing signs of a developing security problem worldwide needing to be addressed by the European Community?  Are any or all of these matters being considered by Government and will they let us have the benefit of their thoughts on these issues?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my understanding that there is a debate continuing, not just at Government and departmental level, on the issue of institutional reform within the Irish Council for the European Movement and the Institute for European Affairs.  It is my opinion that the views emanating from these fora will contribute substantially to that continuing debate. They are important fora within which to discuss the overall question of institutional reform.  It is also my view that the new Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs will have a considerable amount to contribute in this area.  It is obvious that I, as Minister of State with responsibility for European Affiars, and the Tánaiste will be closely involved in that debate.  Certainly it is an issue the new Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs should take on board immediately.  I can assure the House there will be an open debate in preparation for 1996.</P>
      <P>All of the questions raised relate to whether we should move forward on institutional reform now rather than wait until 1996.  My spontaneous response would be that we should await the enlargement of the Community to put in place any new structures since Ireland, because of its size, has done quite well at European Commission, European Parliament and other institutional levels.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the very point I was raising, that we must be very vigilant on how Ireland may fare in any new institutional arrangements.  That is central to our considerations of and debate on this issue.  I would suggest that, across party lines, at the level of the new Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, we could and should explore these issues in depth, evaluating how we fare at present at institutional level, comparing our thinking with that of other EC member states.  It is also part of my brief to meet other Ministers of those countries wishing to join.  For example, I had meetings recently with my counterpart in Sweden and, within the term of office of the previous Government, I had meetings with my counterparts in Austria and Norway.  It is important that we ascertain their thinking but we must also be very vigilant in assessing how Ireland would fare institutionally within an enlarged Community.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Minister of State's remarks in relation to the new Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and his hope that that committee would consider the document prepared by his Department, would he make sure that people like myself, who have just been appointed to that committee, actually see this document if we are to give it immediate consideration? In the same vein, would he say whether he would devise a system within his Department to service that committee with all these briefing documents, with material which could be useful to its members, on a back-issue basis?  There would be very little reason to expect that the committee could give immediate attention to a document circulated to a former committee now defunct.</P>

At times, Members receive three or four documents together.  There is a case to be made for a proper back-up service, which I can assure the House I will take on board.</P>

      <P>The cost of attendance abroad by Cabinet members and Ministers of State is charged to the votes of individual Departments concerned.  The Tánaiste did not travel outside Ireland for St. Patrick's Day events this year.</P>
      <P>The St. Patrick's Day period is a time when there is a traditional focus on the Irish links or Irish heritage of various countries or communities around the world.  Many of these areas are of very considerable political or economic interest to this country.  Government representatives at St. Patrick's Day celebrations very properly seek to avail of these opportunities, and of the extensive media interest in Ireland in this period, to promote Irish trade, investment, tourism and other interests and a better understanding of Government policy in relation to Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be widely accepted that such representation is beneficial to Irish interests and it is appreciated by people of Irish origin overseas even though no formal cost-benefit analysis has been undertaken to assess investment, trade <Col N="872" /> and tourism benefits.

Will he also agree that we should not depend on Amnesty International and other groups, which are doing excellent work, to highlight such issues or on individual countries to make representations to China in relation to human rights abuses?

      <P>We have touched on a crucial point with regard to the recognition of Tibet.  Is the Minister of State confirming or denying Government support for the following Irish sponsored Resolutions at the United Nations: No. 1353 (XIV) of 1959; No. 1723 (XVI) of 1961 and No. 2079 (XX) of 1965 in which the Government accepted the right of the people of Tibet to self-determination and to be independent from China?  Is the Government saying that we have changed our policy in relation to those Irish sponsored motions?  The Minister of State seems to be saying that we have.</P>

      <P>Yes, the position has obviously changed from that in 1979 when we established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China.

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 21, 38, 51 and 58 together. Article N (2) of the Maastricht Treaty on European Union provides that an Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) shall be convended in 1996 to examine those provisions of the Treaty for which revision is provided, in accordance with the objectives set out in Articles A and B.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Treaty provisions for which revision is provided comprise: the scope of the co-decision procedure between the Council and European Parliament &mdash; Article 189b (8); the Common Foreign and Security Policy &mdash; Article J.4 (6); introduction into the Treaty of <Col N="878" /> provisions/or/Articles on energy, civil protection and tourism &mdash; as set out in a Declaration attached to the Maastricht Treaty and review of the classification of Community legislative Acts &mdash; as set out in a declaration attached in the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    <P>Article N (1) also provides that the Government of any member state or the Commission may submit to the Council proposals for amendment of the Treaties on which the union is to be founded and goes on to lay down the same Intergovernmental Conference procedure to deal with any such proposals as is set out in Article 236 of the Treaty of Rome.  On this basis, it is open to Governments or the Commission to raise other matters for discussion at Intergovernmental Conference in 1996, in addition to those specifically provided for in the Maastricht Treaty.  Such proposals would be in line with the objectives of the Treaty as set out in Article B.</P>
    <P>It will be desirable to have a broad ranging debate in Ireland on the matters likely to arise at the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference, including questions such as the Deputy may have in mind in his reference to &ldquo;the constitutional options for Europe&rdquo;.  The Government will be making its own contribution to this debate in due course.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, I would welcome the new Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs taking an interest in issues which could be considered by the Intergovernmental Conference and this is an aspect of Community policy to which, I hope, the committee will give a priority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan:</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect to the Minister, he stated in answer to a number of questions today that the Government is giving careful consideration to matters or is taking a particular course of action but he has not outlined the Government's policy or its views in advance of discussions on these matters.  In respect of this question the Minister has clearly indicated that the Government will be entering discussions but he has given no indications of Government policy or views on the constitutional options for Europe <Col N="879" /> in the run-up to the intergovernmental conference in 1996.  One of the major problems facing Irish people at present is their political alientation from Europe and the lack of information about the options that are likely to be on the table in the run-up to 1996.  Will the Minister indicate how and when he will present his views to the other member states? What information will be given to this House and to the general public in respect of the constitutional options for Europe and what public debate will take place in respect of these important issues?  I suggest that we should learn from the experience of the Danes in not taking for granted important issues such as these.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has raised a number of issues.  The Maastricht Treaty is not yet in force and any wide-ranging debate on these matters would have to follow on from a period of consolidation after the Treaty comes into force.  The Irish approach will be positive and pragmatic. First we should seek to strengthen the elements in the Maastricht Treaty as the need arises.  Second, we should seek to ensure that the Treaty bases for cohesion policies are strengthened if that is considered necessary.  Third, we should seek to strengthen the democratic legitimacy of the institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy referred to the need for information, and this is a matter in which I am particularly interested.  I expect that the issues to be dealt with at the 1996 conference will be debated against the backdrop of the information campaign which the Government hopes to conduct closer to that time.  The objective of the Government's strategy will be to educate and promote understanding, open communication, confidence, trust and a sense of involvement and participation on the part of the public in the community and the Government's policies on EC matters. The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs will report to the Oireachtas on the issues to be dealt with at the intergovernmental conference.  The Government envisages that the committee will play an <Col N="880" /> extremely valuable role in this regard and I urge the committee to maintain a constant review of developments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty:</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intervene in the earlier round of questions on the EC but can the Minister reassure me that the Government does not expect the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs to take entire leadership in the debate on this matter?  The Minister's response to this question as well as to earlier questions placed great emphasis on this committee. Will the Minister assure us that the Government will not abdicate its responsibility in this regard and that debate will not be delayed, as was the case in advance of the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty?</P>

      <P>Despite the criticisms, 70 per cent of the Irish people voted in favour of a united Europe.  From information I have received from colleagues in Europe, compared with other countries we have undertaken an indepth analysis of these matters.  Much more has to be done.  I assure the Deputy that we are not relying totally on the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  I stress that we favour the involvement of all parties in this matter.  We also favour the involvement of bodies such as the Irish Council of the European Movement, a body with which I worked closely during the Maastricht debate, and the Institute of European Affairs, an organisation in which there is great potential.  The Deputy can be assured that the Government will be a very pro-active player in this debate.</P>

Does the Minister think the Maastricht Treaty will be ratified by 1996?  Its present rate of progress does not indicate that will be so. I understand that a meeting of presidents of the national parliaments of the European Community is to take place in Dublin on 27 May.  I do not know whether <Col N="881" /> this Parliament has received an invitation to that meeting &mdash; I only heard about it on the grapevine.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>Members will recall the general delay in publishing information on the Maastricht Treaty and that houses were blitzed with information only three weeks before the referendum.  In order to stimulate public debate, will the Minister consider issuing consumer friendly information that is easy to read on the further constitutional changes that will come about and options that will arise as we move in 1996 so that we can have a real public debate instead of high level Euro-speak?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the Deputy's suggestion on board.  I chair an interdepartmental committee called the European Affairs Committee every month which comprises representatives of all the key Departments trying to ensure there is co-operation and cohesion at European level.  One of the issues we have looked at is the question of information and I will bring back proposals to the Foreign Affairs Committee as soon as possible.  I assure Members that any suggestions they make will be taken on board to take the best possible approach to information campaigns.  The single lesson I learned from the campaign was the need to break down jargon into layman's language. People do not want to hear the terms &ldquo;subsidiarity&rdquo;, &ldquo;cohesion&rdquo; and the other terms that were used but want to know very clearly what their options are.  This falls within my remit.  I certainly hope it will be part of the remit of the Committee of Foreign Affairs.</P>

    <P>Will the Maastricht Treaty be ratified by 1996?  In replying to the question, <Col N="883" /> will the Minister outline the timescale of events?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, I see the Maastricht Treaty being ratified before the end of this year.  I would be one of the many Ministers at European level who see the need to give a new momentum to the European movement.  There has been a certain lull over the past few months and to some extent we are waiting for the Danes and the British to ratify the Treaty.  We have to leave it to the individual countries to deal with their own problems but the European movement would receive a tremendous boost if the Maastricht Treaty were ratified.  This would then lead to the question of enlargement.  If Deputies are asking me to look into the crystal ball, I believe the Treaty will be ratified before the end of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa:</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Ceann Comhairle's indication that a meeting is being planned.  Perhaps the Minister does not have information on it to hand.  Will he circulate the Deputies with whatever information he has on the meeting of the European Parliament.</P>
      <P>Perhaps his optimism on the upturn in enthusiasm following the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty is misplaced.  I believe that view is a recipe for going nowhere.  There must be a total rethink on where the European Community is going once the nonsense about ratification is out of the way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the meeting the Ceann Comhairle has just informed the House about because the Inter-parlimentary Union is involved.  Certainly I will circulate any information I have to Deputy De Rossa and any other Deputies who are interested.  I disagree with Deputy De Rossa's statements on the process of European union.  We have seen positive trends with regard to interest rates and an initiative for growth, which the Danish Presidency has taken up with some vigour.  In my view the only option we have, as a strongly dependent <Col N="884" /> trading nation, is with Europe.  We are highly committed to it.  Our monetary system and interest rates are linked to European monetary union.  It is certainly in our interest that we pursue actively the unity of Europe.</P>
      <P>I am predicting a favourable outcome to the ratification process before the end of the year and I feel that is the best option for this country and for Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>I visited Somalia on 22 and 23 March and the Sudan from 22 to 25 April of this year.  My principal purpose in going to Somalia was to see what I could do to help improve the security of Irish aid workers there, in the wake of the killing of Valerie Place and of other aid workers.  While in Somalia, I had discussions with Admiral Jonathan Howe, special representative for Somalia of the Secretary General of the United Nations, the Officer Commanding UNITAF, the special representative of the President of the United States, and representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross, the UN agencies, and non-governmental organisations. I have also met Somali elders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In all of these contacts, I emphasised the paramount importance of the security of all relief workers and in particular of NGO staff, on whom the whole humanitarian effort depends.  I had previously made the same point to representatives of the US Government in Washington and to UN representatives in New York. The importance of the issue was accepted by all those whom I met.  I made a number of detailed proposals for improved security which I had previously discussed with representatives of Irish non-governmental organisations.  From subsequent correspondence with Admiral Howe, I <Col N="885" /> understand that these proposals are being integrated into UNOSOM's efforts regarding NGO security.</P>
    <P>While my visit to Sudan was not principally concerned with security questions, I availed of the opportunity to emphasise to the representatives of the Government of Sudan and to the leaders of the different factions of the SPLA, whom I also met, the importance which the Government attaches to the security of Irish aid workers.  I stressed the need to ensure that there be no repetition of the events of last year, in which a number of aid workers and international journalists in southern Sudan were killed.  I underlined the point that people in Europe would find it impossible to understand why the lives of aid workers, whose motivation was purely humanitarian, should be put at risk in this way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan:</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears the Minister met a great many people on his visits to Somalia and the Sudan.  He stressed that he discussed improvements in security arrangements for the voluntary personnel who work in Sudan and Somalia. Will he outline the arrangements that have been agreed and whether these include volunteers being accompanied by UN military personnel?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>NGOs made particular reference to the need for a routine system of flights around Somalia to avoid long road journeys.  They were also worried about the dangers involved in large cash transactions in which they were engaged at the beginning of the rehabilitation phase.  I discussed these two issues with Admiral Howe and secured his agreement to using UNISOM facilities for the movement of NGO staff between centres and the storage of their cash reserves.  I tried to improve relations between security forces and aid workers.  Security forces had made the point that aid workers, because of their commitment to humanitarian causes, are not geared to security. I made that point to the aid workers without being critical.  The security people should be there to facilitate the aid effort.  I hope the suggestions I made <Col N="886" /> were helpful and that there is now a better liaison between the security personnel and the aid effort.  The situation in Somalia is obviously quite tense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware if aid workers want a vehicle with a driver, that a brigand or bandit will provide it? Were there discussions about the possibility of providing drivers for the humanitarian convoys from UN personnel so that volunteers would not have to hire people who are brigands?  Is the Minister aware of the concern that the killer of Sean Devereaux has still not been apprehended and brought to trial?  I realise that the structures there have pretty well broken down.  However, despite the fact that the killer is known nothing has happened and this is giving rise to further concern among Irish and other aid workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>In my discussions with UNISOM and UNITAF I made the point that if at all possible, security should be provided from those quarters.  The dilemma is that members of aid agencies want to move quickly and they have had their own form of transport and security. President Robinson and the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, made the point that there were guns &mdash; and a gun culture &mdash; everywhere and in Somalia.  By the time I got there things had changed considerably but there was still that element of local protection being provided for the aid agencies. I discussed this at length with the aid workers.  The matter has not been finally resolved but I requested that, where possible, there should be security corridors and that proper notification should be given to the security forces for transport for aid workers.  The security authorities made the point that notice was needed to provide proper security. It is difficult to get it absolutely correct in an environment where aid workers must move quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A similar problem is developing in Sudan.  The aid is coming in from a place called Lockichokio in Northern Kenya where there is a UN compound, Operation <Col N="887" /> Lifeline is the anchor security operation there.  Aid agencies are flying in from Lockichokio to places like Ashwa and Kongor, doing their work and getting out before nightfall.  It is risky for all concerned but they are doing their work under difficult situations.  In the last 24 hours I received a report from Mr. John O'Shea of GOAL, that fighting has broken out some 20 miles from Kongor.  I immediately faxed my concern to the SPLA through Operation Lifeline and said that they must not put the lives of Irish aid workers at risk.  The Irish Government is taking a very particular interest in the safety of our aid workers in both countries.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 22, 29, 41 and 50 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland is providing 40 members of the Garda Síochána, 12 members of the Irish Army and a number of civilians to the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia.  The security of Irish personnel with the UN in Cambodia is kept under continuous review.  We have had no reports to date that the lives of any Irish personnel have been threatened.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to express the condolences of the Irish Government and people at the recent killing of Bulgarian and Chinese members of UNTAC who gave their lives in the cause of international peace.</P>
      <P>The Secretary General of the United Nations has recently reaffirmed that the elections provided for under the UN peace plan will be held in Cambodia as scheduled from 23 to 28 May.  In spite of attempts by different groups, including the Khmer Rouge, to disrupt the elections, the Secretary General and the entire international community are determined that the people of Cambodia should exercise their democratic right to decide their own political future.</P>
      <P>The full resources of the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia, UNTAC, are being deployed to ensure that the elections take place under peaceful conditions and to provide the maximum possible security for all those involved in this democratic exericse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware from today's papers that there are reports that the Khmer Rouge have bombed Chinese engineers in this area?  Is the <Col N="889" /> Minister further aware of a recent television programme made by the Australian journalist, Mr. John Pilger, which indicates clearly that the Khmer Rouge, irrespecive of UNTAC attempts to bring democracy to this country, will attempt by every means at their disposal to return to the rule which operated under Pol Pot a number of years ago?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the reports which have strengthened our resolve to ensure that the people in Cambodia get an opportunity to decide on their own future on 23 and 28 May.  We all condemn the horrific atrocities.  We are in regular contact with our Community partners &mdash; a number of whom are also sending polling station officers to Cambodia &mdash; and with the UN in New York to ensure that the full resources of UNTAC are deployed to guarantee the safety of our polling station officers.  We are very concerned about the developing situation and about security.  The actions of the Khmer Rouge only strengthens the resolve of the international community to ensure that the elections proceed and that the Khmer Rouge are not allowed to disrupt the elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that when the Khmer Rouge were involved in negotiations about these elections, many members warned that this leopard did not appear to be making any attempt to change his spots?  Unfortunately, we have reached the stage where we can almost say: &ldquo;we told you so&rdquo;, be that as it may, the elections are going ahead.  In view of post election results in Angola, which were declared free and fair by UN observers, is the Minister aware of any efforts being made to ensure that they will be implemented and that the Khmer Rouge, when all the UNTAC organisations disappear, will not be able to return to its policy of genocide?</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>I recall that both of us were deeply involved in the debate on Cambodia.  The fact that the Khmer Rouge are in breach of their obligation as a signatory of the Paris Agreement is deplored.  Nevertheless, I agree it is important that there would be a strong and firm follow-on from the elections. One aspect of the UN peace plan is a repatriation of refugees and displaced persons from Thailand.  Over 300,000 of the estimated 360,000 refugees have been repatriated under UN auspices without any major incident.  It is important to have a steady programme of back-up activity from the international community after the elections.  The situation is volatile and reports from the area, as Deputy Kenny said, are worrying.  Nevertheless, Ireland has had an interest in this country for some time and I will continue to keep Deputies informed of developments and the Government's plans as the situation develops.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the members of the Garda Síochána on duty there at present are safe?  Is it envisaged that there will be a continuation of support and assistance from the Garda Síochána in the post election period, when the United Nations have overseen the election process?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred earlier to the fact that a Bulgarian, a Japanese and a Chinese member of UNTAC had been killed.  These people have given their lives in the cause of international peace. In that environment it is obvious that I am concerned about the welfare of the Garda Síochána, the Irish Army and a number of civilians from Ireland who are involved in the United Nations Transitional Authority.  We are in constant touch with the situation, in co-operation with our partners in Europe, and I assure the Deputy I will keep him informed of developments.  It is my intention to continue our involvement in Cambodia after the elections.  Irish personnel in <Col N="891" /> Namibia have demonstrated their capacity to reach across the divide and have also demonstrated that they are acceptable in very difficult situations in trying to deal with groups of people of conflicting views.  My wish is that the Garda Síochána will continue to participate in Cambodia post elections.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>At the press conference following presentation of the 1993 budget, I said it was <Col N="949" /> the Government's intention to proceed with the disposal of certain State assets, including its residual shareholding of 30.4 per cent in Greencore Plc.</P>
      <P>Before plans had been completed to conduct the sale of the Greencore shares by way of an institutional placing, a proposal was received from Archer Daniels Midland to acquire the shares.  A number of Irish food companies also expressed interest in acquiring the Government stake.</P>
      <P>The Government decided to afford time to all interested parties to put forward proposals and I announced on 2 March that such proposals should reach my Department by 24 March.</P>
      <P>I said that the criteria on which decisions would be based would include price and compatibility and the long term strategic development of Greencore as a major Irish food company which could consolidate and expand employment in the Irish economy.  I retained Davy Stockbrokers to advise me in the matter.</P>
      <P>On 5 April I advised the Government of the proposals which had been received by my Department by 24 March.  The Government authorised me on 6 April to enter into immediate negotiations with Archer Daniels Midland Inc. for the sale of up to 25 million of the 25.4 million shares in Greencore plc. currently held by me for the highest achieveable price, and to dispose of the balance of the shareholding by way of an appropriate market placing.  It also authorised me, in the event of the negotiations with Archer Daniels Midland not resulting in a selling price acceptable to me, to proceed with disposal of the shares by way of an institutional placing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The articles of association of Greencore plc. set an upper limit of 15 per cent on the shareholding which any one person may hold in the company.  The acquisition by Archer Daniels Midland of 25 million shares would have involved a holding in excess of 15 per cent.  The Government therefore decided that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry should approve an amendment to the Greencore articles of association to increase the 15 per cent limit to 30 per <Col N="950" /> cent.  In the event this amendment was not made since the original purpose of the amendment had gone because Archer Daniels Midland decided not to proceed with the acquisition of a shareholding in Greencore.</P>
    <P>I announced early on the morning of Friday last, 30 April, that the discussions with Archer Daniels Midland had terminated at the wish of that company and that I understood that its decision not to continue further with the discussions was due to their long duration and public nature.  I announced that, as authorised by the Government, I was proceeding with an institutional placing of my holding in Greencore.  Davy Stockbrokers acted as my agents in arranging that placing. Davy Stockbrokers at that stage informed me that they proposed to enter into an arrangement with S.G. Warburg in London under which Warburgs would be prepared to take any balance of the 25.4 million shares to be placed which Davys had not placed with other holders, subject to a maximum Warburg uptake of 10 million shares.  Warburgs would receive a commission of £550,000 for this. This commission would be deducted from the proceeds of sale to arrive at the net proceeds accuring to the Exchequer. Davys advised me that this arrangement, which was designed to help secure the overall success of the placement, was acceptable.  They did not indicate that any legal or Stock Exchange problems could be associated with it.  Acting in good faith on this advice I did not dissent from the proposed arrangement.</P>
    <P>At noon on 30 April, I was advised by Davy Stockbrokers that my total shareholding had been placed with institutions in Dublin and London at a price of £2.75 per share and I made that knowledge public by announcement.  My information from Davy Stockbrokers at that stage was that the placing had been successfully completed and that no questions of any kind arose in relation to it.  Greencore announced on 30 April that I had informed them of the placing and said that the sale had followed consultation between the company, the Government and their advisers, and proceeded with <Col N="951" /> the active support of the company.  The company's chief executive officer, Mr. Gerry Murphy, stated that the company was pleased at the successful placing of the Government's holding which removed the market overhang on its shares.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, Wednesday 5 May, further information was made available to me by Davy Stockbrokers.  They stated that the information they gave to me at 12 noon on 30 April was on the basis that by then, they had placed over 17.5 million of the 25 million shares and that they had made the arrangements with Warburg to take up shares in the placing up to a maximum of 10 million shares.  They informed me that they subsequently revised the arrangements with Warburg's to include certain other purchasers.  On Monday, 3 May, 1993 Davy Stockbrokers sought legal advice in regard to both the original and revised arrangements.  That advice to Davy Stockbrokers is to the effect that both arrangements give rise to a number of difficulties due to the possibility of Davy Stockbrokers and parties connected with them being regarded as having an interest in certain of the placed shares in some circumstances.  This could have led to difficulties in regard to the provisions of the Greencore articles of association which restrict holdings to a maximum of 15 per cent.  I understand that this possibility arose for the following reason.  The Investment Bank of Ireland, a member of the Bank of Ireland Group, already held, at the time of the placing, a 15 per cent holding.  Davy Stockbrokers is also part of the Bank of Ireland Group.  Any holdings by Davy Stockbrokers or any other part of the Bank of Ireland Group could, appearently, count in calculating whether the 15 per cent limit has been breached.  Davy also received legal advice that there was a requirement to make disclosure to the market and to the other places of the situation that had developed.</P>
    <P>All of the above information was also made known yesterday to the company and to its advisers, AIB Capital Markets. I arranged that it be made available to <Col N="952" /> the Stock Exchange prior to the commencement of trading this morning.</P>
    <P>I was not at all informed until yesterday on the revisions which Davy Stockbrokers made to the arrangements with Warburg which I have already described. Some information was given to me yesterday by Davy Stockbrokers.  This was to the effect that 2.4 million shares were placed with Warburg's and that shares were also placed with individuals or bodies associated in some way with Davy Stockbrokers.  Davy Stockbrokers informed me that they had given some form of assurance of comfort to Warburg that they would not lose financially as a result of taking up shares.  I would stress that yesterday was the first time I received any notification that such arrangements existed, or were contemplated. As will be clear from what I have said, I have not got full information on these arrangements.  I do not know the identities of the parties having some form of association with Davy Stockbrokers who agreed to take shares.</P>
    <P>This afternoon Davy Stockbrokers supplied my Department with additional information on these arrangements.  I understand that they intend making this information available to the Stock Exchange also.  In the case of Warburg's, there was originally an arrangement that the commission fee of £550,000 would be shared between them and Davy Stockbrokers. Furthermore, Davy Stockbrokers would share any profits or losses arising from a shareholding that might pass to Warburg in order to complete the placing.  However, ultimately, when Warburg participated in the placing for 2.54 million shares, the arrangements were revised on the basis that profits or losses would be for the account of Davy Stockbrokers and that the fee to Warburg's would be reduced to £100,000.</P>
    <P>I was also informed this afternoon that 4.45 million shares were placed with Irish investors which of whom was connected in some way with Davy Stockbrokers.</P>
    <P>I am informed that Greencore has obtained from the Stock Exchange a suspension for 24 hours in trading in the shares.  The company did this, I understand, <Col N="953" /> because of the opinion that orderly and properly informed trading in the shares would not have been possible today in the circumstances that have developed.  In the circumstances I have decided to consult with the Attorney General on the legal aspects.</P>
    <P>I would stress that I and my Department have at all stages acted in good faith and that I have taken every step that I was aware of to ensure that the placing was done in a way which met all Stock Exchange and any relevant legal requirements. I relied on Davy Stockbrokers to advise me on this aspect.  As will be clear from what I have said, I informed the public, including shareholders in the company, of all significant developments as they arose.</P>
    <P>Before the placing there was no indication to my Department from Davy Stockbrokers that any question arose as to the appropriateness, under Stock Exchange or any other requirements, of the pre-agreed arrangement it had made with Warburgs to take up shares.  Davy Stockbrokers have informed me that the changes they made to the pre-agreed arrangement, which I became aware of for the first time yesterday, were made solely to ensure the success of the placing and that they were not done with the aim of securing a financial gain for any party having any association with them.  They have also informed me that their decision to seek legal advice was taken totally on their own initiative and solely to clarify the matter and was not prompted by any questions raised by any other party.  I am nevertheless seriously concerned and disappointed that important steps were taken by Davy Stockbrokers without either my knowledge or agreement.</P>
    <P>The shares in Greencore are at present suspended and the Exchange authorities are examining the situation today to see if any of the rules of the Exchange have been infringed.  I understand that Davy Stockbrokers have been asked to provide the Exchange with a full account of events.  The initial task for the Exchange will be to clarify the facts concerning recent events so that the market in shares <Col N="954" /> can be safely restored and the suspension lifted as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>In the event that any infringement may have taken place, it will be for the Exchange authorities to decide what action should be taken by them in relation to market participants.  I cannot anticipate the outcome of that investigation. It may, or may not, give rise to further action by the Exchange authorities concerning possible breaches of rules or procedures.  I expect that the Exchange will carry out a through investigation and that the authorities will take all necessary steps to satisfy the markets that the events have been fully examined. It is vitally important that no doubts or reservations will remain regarding the placing.  I will, of course, ensure that my Department will cooperate fully with the Stock Exchange in its investigation.  I expect that the Exchange will treat this matter with the greatest urgency.</P>
    <P>The expected receipt from this placing totals over £69 million.  This is due to be lodged to the Exchequer on 17 May.  In view of what has arisen I am not in a position now to say categorically that these moneys will be received in full on schedule.  I am awaiting legal and other advice on this.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I would say that while these developments are most unwelcome to me and to Greencore they do not in any way detract from the economic worth of Greencore.  The fundamental reality that Greencore is a very attractive investment with huge growth potential remains unchanged.  The difficulties that have arisen in relation to this placing in no way whatever reflect on company performance, on the company management or on my Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if the Minister has come to terms with this fiasco but throughout his entire handling of the Greencore matter he has shown the hallmark of gross incompetence, negligence and ineptitude on an unprecedented scale.  The Minister succeeded at one stroke in creating a position whereby Greencore stock could go into freefall and the reputation of the <Col N="955" /> Irish financial services market is flashing across the world as a dodgy one.  That was some achievement by the Minister last Friday.  It is appalling that we have come to this state and, at the end of the day, the Minister for Finance, as owner of the shares and the Minister responsible, must take full responsibility and culpability for this disaster.</P>
      <P>It now transpires that a series of appalling errors of judgment has been made by the Government and its stockbrokers in the sale of 25.4 million Government shares in Greencore.  The Minister for Finance must explain his handling of the entire affair.  In hindsight it has proved a grave error of judgment to have sought to raise so much capital so soon after raising £105 million through the flotation of the shares in Irish Life.  It was overly optimistic to expect that there was the level of capacity in the Stock Exchange to raise £175 million in two flotations in a few days.</P>
      <P>I am advised &mdash; and I heard a recording of it today &mdash; that the Minister and Deputy Rabbitte were on radio at lunch time last Friday.  The Minister expounded this excellent deal, its value to the taxpayer and he commended Davy Stockbrokers. At the very time he was speaking some of the morning deals were being unwound.  A shareholder would be very incompetent not to know what is happening to his own block of shares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the original early morning purchasers of up to 17.5 million shares declined their positions in the afternoon. It appears a London merchant bank had undertaken, in the view of Davys, to buy some ten million unsold shares.  During Friday it became clear that the amount of unsold shares was in the order of 7.5 million, 9 per cent of Greencore.  When they were offered to Warburg in the afternoon it refused to take them and the stock was dumped.  It seems incredible that Davys were under the impression that Warburg would take up to ten million shares yet when it was offered them it stated that the agreement was to take up to five million.  That goes beyond incompetence.  Somebody was not telling <Col N="956" /> the truth.  Somebody must have asked what would happen if Warburg refused to take all the shares.</P>
    <P>The subsequent placement of the unsold shares was such that there must have been question marks about their suitability.  Why did Davys of their own volition, telephone their solicitors, Fry and Sons, on Monday to find out if there was a dubious element to the deal?  They must have known.  Did it not appear strange to the Minister when he got the list of the purchasers that there was a clear breach of the 15 per cent?  Did he not even check the names of the financial institutions?  When the stockbrokers sought legal advice it subsequently became clear that the holdings were in breach of the articles of association of Greencore, namely, that no single shareholder could have within their sphere of control a 15 per cent stake.  Hence, we have the crisis today where Greencore stock was suspended at 8.30 a.m.</P>
    <P>The Minister must state the full details of all these transactions and whether he is satisfied as to the truthfulness of the information he received at all stages from the stockbrokers.  He must clarify what stock remains unsold and the Government's intention as regards taking it back. Once the 24 hour period has elapsed, what will happen to Greencore?  It is the innocent victim in all of this and it now finds that its share value could be in freefall. It must also be announced whether those who bought the 17 or 18 million shares in the morning now want to unwind the position or whether they are still happy to buy at £2.75 a share.  My understanding is that the biggest financial institution agreed, if the Government would buy the balance back.  However, there has been a shift in the position since then and the clearing price would be much lower, at £2.50 or £2.60 a share. We all know that in dealing in stocks and shares, the dealers' word is their bond. We are now in the position that we do not know if a false or a fair market existed in Greencore stock last Friday.  Clear, unequivocal answers must be given to those questions.</P>
    <P>The explantions rendered thus far by <Col N="957" /> the Minister and by Mr. Davy have been wholly inadequate.  Why was it only on Friday afternoon in the middle of the share sale that it struck the stockbrokers that seven million shares, or 9 per cent of the holding held by Warburg, would be excessive?  Why was that not thought of in advance?  The question must be raised as to whether there was a full or a false market for the shares.  Why was the contingency plan to sell the seven million shares introduced so late in the day which, possibly, was in breach of the articles of association?  The Minister must give clear answers.</P>
    <P>My understanding is that the bank involved was Warburg and the Minister has confirmed that.  It offered to take up five million shares.  When it was asked to buy eight million shares, it declined.  The Minister must clarify if this is true and, if so, the allegations of incompetence must be replaced by ones of improprietry.</P>
    <P>The damage to Greencore by the Minister's appalling handling of this entire matter is inestimable.  It was obvious from the outset that Greencore favoured the sale by private placement, not by flotation, to a strategic, minority stake-holder, namely, Archer Daniels Midland. Due to the internal Government paralysis, whereby Labour and Fianna Fáil could not agree and the Minister could not convince his Labour colleagues of the merits of this deal that he and the bosses in Greencore favoured, he was not able to deliver.  We had the bizarre incident where one office of ADM in Chicago denied it made a bid while its European office said it had made a bid. The Minister announced that there was a firm bid and it subsequently transpired that there was a letter of offer faxed at the request of Davys.</P>
    <P>The loss of a strategic partner to develop and grow its export business was bad enough, but to find its shares suspended and a cloud of incredibility hanging over the company is simply unforgiveable.  The effect on the share price when trading recommences is as yet unknown.</P>
    <P>Investment Bank of Ireland owns 14.9 per cent of Greencore stock.  I understand <Col N="958" /> that they were not involved in any share purchase.  The relevant fact here is the 15 per cent limitation on any one shareholder in Greencore under its articles of association.  The Minister must clarify how the question of exceeding the limitation within a sphere of control arose and what legal advice he obtained in that regard.  He must state the financial institutions relating to the Bank of Ireland which were involved in share purchases instead of Warburg.  In any system of accountability somebody must take responsibility for this catastrophe.  The Minister for Finance and the Government's stockbrokers have acted so incompetently that I fear enormous damage will be done not only to Greencore but to the entire Irish financial services sector.  I have spoken to brokers already who travel to London on a weekly basis in an effort to sell Irish stocks.  They are afraid that on top of the Telecom scandal and the previous troubles regarding Greencore, we will be known as the dodgy market of Europe.  That is an incredible situation, despite the best efforts of Greencore to expand their fine business.</P>
    <P>The Minister must clarify to what extent the articles of association and/or the Stock Exchange rules have been breached by transactions of these shares in Greencore.  Competitors and opponents are already citing this débâcle on a par with the Blue Arrow financial scandal in the United Kingdom.  The central question is whether there is a full market for those shares.  In other words, the people who bought at £2.75 a share did so on the understanding that there was a full demand for the shares.  It subsequently transpired that at that price there was not.  The realm and depth of this scandal will greatly deepen if it transpires that there was never a full purchaser for those shares.  That question must be answered by the Minister today.</P>
    <P>The unavoidable conclusion from this entire sorry saga is that the Minister must take responsibility and take the only honourable course of action open to him by resigning his office.  If this happened in another parliament in Europe the Minister would have resigned already.  It <Col N="959" /> is unacceptable that due to a combination of circumstances, so many people were intentionally or otherwise misled by the Minister.  The Minister's statement this morning fails to respond adequately to the gravity of the situation.  The Government must act swiftly to take back any unsold shares in order to sustain a price of £2.75 per share.  An immediate statement to this effect is the only way to restore order to Greencore's stocks.</P>
    <P>This débâcle is without precedent.  It is now obvious that the Minister for Finance should not have sought to unload so many Greencore shares simultaneously. In the case of Irish Life, the Minister unloaded only a little over half of the total stock.  Why did the Minister insist on dumping Greencore's entire stock at this time?  He should not have taken this action so soon after the Irish Life flotation. The Minister should have opted, as he originally intended, for a private placement.  He and his Department took for granted assurances and made assumptions which have now proved to be invalid. There is no indication in the Minister's speech that throughout the share sale he or his officials scrutinised &mdash; as any shareholder would &mdash; every aspect of the process of selling 25 million shares.  All of this resulted in the Minister making an ass of himself last Friday on the national airwaves.  Even he must realise that his credibility is at an all time low.  Lame excuses are not enough.</P>
    <P>It is important, given the gravity of the matter, that we have a constructive debate because Greencore must work its way out of this mess.  There is a number of options open to the Government.  This matter is so important to the taxpayer and to the credibility of the Irish market that it is imperative some skilful control is now taken.  I call on the Government to offer the unsold portion of the shares &mdash; whether that is 15 million or 10 million of the 25 million &mdash; to ADM in the first instance.  I understand they were prepared to offer a price of £2.70 per share. Negotiations should commence on this immediately.  Alternatively, to avoid an overhang of these shares on the market, <Col N="960" /> the Government should negotiate a market clearing price of say £2.60 or £2.50 per share because it cannot be left in limbo with the unsold stock.  The balance in terms of the loss on the sale should be borne by the stockbrokers. Lucrative gains can be made when things go well but when they go wrong a penalty should be paid.  That premium should be paid in this case by the stockbrokers, given their culpability in the matter.  It is only reasonable that they should make good to the taxpayer by penalty for their errors.</P>
    <P>What happened here was very similar to that which occurred in GPA.  Any stockbroker can come to the Minister and say that he will get £3, £2.90 or £2.80 for his shares.  However in this case the shares seem to have been over-priced.  I find it incomprehensible that it took almost a week for the Minister to realise how far he was out of line.  It is management by remote control.  The sums involved and the credibility aspects for the financial services sector are so serious I cannot understand how the Minister was so negligent and so complacent in his handling of this matter.  He should reflect on all that has been done to set up the financial services sector, to build up the official listings on the stock market and to move away from our dependence under the shadow of London.  That credibility has been destroyed at the stroke of a pen.  Greencore is a fine company with 18 per cent net return on its sugar business, with a profitable malt and barley business.  Gerry Murphy and his colleagues have done an excellent job, yet the Minister has succeeded, by his ideological paralysis within Government, his botched handling of ADM and now his hamfisted dealings with Davy Stockbrokers, in converting what should have been a profitable move into a nightmare. At the end of the day the Minister must accept responsibility, do the decent thing and resign.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox:</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate which we sought in this House this morning gives no one here cause for pleasure.  If those in whose trust this matter has been placed had <Col N="961" /> done their job competently and properly we would have had no need for this debate.</P>
      <P>I wish to focus my comments on two areas.  One deals with the business aspects and the other deals with the political aspects of this affair.  It is important to put the background of events into perspective. This is not a problem which crept up on the Minister for Finance or his appointed advisers.  From the week of the budget late in February, when the Minister for Finance first confirmed in public the Government's intention to dispose of its remaining shares in Greencore, we have witnessed an unending series of unforced errors, poor judgment and gross incompetence.</P>
      <P>The situation appeared to resolve itself last Friday with the reported sale of the Greencore shares by the Government stockbrokers, Davys, at a valuation of £2.75 per share.  The Minister was quick in that context to acknowledge his role in the matter and declared himself happy with the outcome.  Indeed, he went on to express his thanks and congratulations to his brokers in this House last Tuesday during the course of the Adjournment Debate.  Not to be outdone in this regard, his colleagues in Government, the Labour Party, last week rushed to print that it was their negotiations behind the scenes that had forced the price up to £2.75.  Where are all the Labour Cabinet Ministers today with the egg on their collective faces for this failure of partnership, failure of nerve and failure of policy?  They were quick to claim that they had held the day and caused the improvement in share prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That improvement in share prices brings me to the most unpleasant aspect of this débâcle.  In all that has been revealed during the past 24 hours no member of Government, no one in the Irish business community, the Stock Exchange or the company involved comes out on top.  Unfortunately for Greencore, it is now embroiled in further unnecessary controversy, an innocent bystander of political nonsense which has been at the heart of this Government from the first day the suggestion to dispose <Col N="962" /> of the assets was made.  That is a failure of this Government and Greencore carries additional misfortune not of its own making.</P>
    <P>The Irish Stock Exchange has been sucked into this highly negative and injurious publicity.  This negative publicity arises directly from failures on the part of the Minister for Finance and his advisers to conduct their affairs with due discretion and decorum in relation to the disposal of assets held in trust by him on behalf of the public.  It is unfortunate, too, for what it reveals about the behaviour and standards at the highest echelons of blue-chip Irish business &mdash; a topic I wish to return to.  It is most unfortunate for our political process which, in this most straightforward matter of the disposal of State assets, has revealed through inter-party points scoring in Government, gross incompetence on the part of the Minister for Finance.  They are not up to the task.</P>
    <P>Today at lunchtime in the course of a passive, poor, incomplete and inadequate explanation given by the head of the Government's stockbrokers, Davys, we were informed of an unspecified arrangement with an unnamed London merchant bank, now named by the Minister as S. G. Warburg.  According to that interview this arrangement was to take up a significant tranche of shares in Greencore in advance of the general placing of those shares on the market.  It would appear from the comments made that the stockbrokers are, or were, of the opinion that it was not in the best interest of the placing to go to that London bank as it would, according to Mr. Brian Davy, not normally be perceived as an investor in Greencore, and the market might feel that the holding was therefore not &ldquo;in firm hands&rdquo;.  What did the Government's key adviser on this matter mean by that phrase?  If that was his view as broadcast on the radio &mdash; and I am sure it was his view last Friday &mdash; why did the Minister for Finance, whose agent he is, know nothing of this affair?  The Minister has pleaded ignorance but he should be held accountable and made responsible for this matter.  In plain English, outside <Col N="963" /> stock exchange speak, will the Minister elaborate and clarify the detail of these arrangements?  The Minister stated that he learned the details just before he came to the House today.  Surely the Minister has a duty to be informed of these matters? He is entrusted by his colleagues in Government to dispose of this matter in the public interest and those of Greencore and the State.  The Minister failed to discharge his duties.</P>
    <P>Specifically if the deal with the bank was perceived by the Government to be unfair, the Minister and his advisers consider that S. A. Warburg took up the expected number of shares on Friday? Did they regard it as merely a short term holding operation which would immediately take up shares from the market while potentially disposing of them at an early date?</P>
    <P>Mr. Brian Davy went on to say that he as the Government's adviser had chosen, instead of the London bank, to introduce &ldquo;additional placees close to us&rdquo;.  Is the Minister prepared now to name those people?  Surely the Minister or officials in his Department must now be in possession of knowledge of which he said he was in ignorance for so many days?  It is incredible that the Minister can come here and say he does not have the information which he is obliged to have.  He should have received the information from his agent whom he has been appointed.  That agent would have made sales on behalf of the Minister and he should know who those placees are?  Who were those people on the inside track? The public have a right to know.  This matter will be unravelling at a public cost and the Minister is the person ultimately responsible for imposing that cost.  The Minister must inform this House of the names of those in the new golden circle who have been discovered in the past 24 hours.</P>
    <P>Staggeringly, the senior adviser to the Government went on to comment on the débâcle which has now emerged in a manner that suggests he had not quite realised or anticipated the problems which would arise.  He stated he did not <Col N="964" /> realise the implications of the 15 per cent limitation in Article 11 B in the articles of association of Greencore.  I cannot accept that observation.  It is a pathetic excuse from a quarter which, far from being ignorant or innocent in this regard, advised the Government on this matter and in respect of the appointment or warrant issued by the Minister.  The Minister sits here with his head bowed in shame at what has happened here in his name in the past seven days.</P>
    <P>The disposal of shares now in question has been on the Government's agenda for so long that neither he nor his advisers have any excuse for failing to know the conditions attaching to all sales.  Those basic errors are inexplicable after such a long gestation period.</P>
    <P>I have an uneasy feeling that between the arrangement with the London merchant bank &mdash; which was not proceeded with in full &mdash; or the placing of shares with placees close to the Government stockbrokers &mdash; which are still not fully accounted for &mdash; from the present position would cause any reasonable observer to ask the most serious questions as to whether a false market has been created in regard to the shares.  This is in addition to the problems which have arisen in relation to what the Stock Exchange rules describe as &ldquo;connected persons&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>From contacts with the Dublin market today, I am satisfied that there is unparalleled outrage among many of the investors who believe that, by paying the share price last Friday morning, they were plainly duped.  People must answer questions in relation to that and the Minister is responsible for answering them and for the behaviour of people he appoints as his advisers.  It is not good enough for the Minister to say he will await the report of the Stock Exchange.  The Stock Exchange will report on this matter but the Minister is accountable and he cannot slide out from underneath it by waiting for reports from other agencies in this regard.  The State has powers under the Companies Act to investigate such matters. There are other powers open to the State but I want to know what the Minister will do.  The Government conferred <Col N="965" /> responsibility on the Minister to deal with this matter in public trust.  We do not want to hear what the Stock Exchange, or people outside the House are doing, we want to hear what the Minister will do in this regard.</P>
    <P>This matter is of such import and gravity that it must be investigated using the fullest panoply of investigative procedures open to the State.  I am convinced that the Minister for Finance has no other option but to give this matter top priority. I agree with Deputy Yates, my soundings indicate that the price of £2.75 per share will most likely, in any event, collapse under the weight of the revelations.  The public, the taxpayers and the Exchequer are the losers.  That is not a matter to be fobbed off by using terms such as business golden circles or blue chip companies outside this House.  The Minister claimed credit in this area but now that the matter has come full circle the Minister must accept full responsibility.</P>
    <P>To reassert some control and authority in this regard, the Minister must clarify whether the Government intends to recall its shareholding in Greencore and relieve those institutions who believe, in some instances, they paid over the odds last Friday because of the market price then prevailing.  Will the Minister relieve those institutions of their burden in the light of the information now available? Will he deal with this as a matter of urgency so that the share trading in Greencore may resume at a reasonable level?  It would allow a good Irish company, which was already damaged by policy failure, as Culliton suggested to link up with the market access, good technology and market intelligence of a foreign partner like ADM.  The Minister failed the shareholders on that count and he has failed them again because of the advice given by his advisers and the lax attitude he displayed towards this issue. The Minister must do all in his power to ensure that a company which deserves much better from the Minister and his well heeled advisers, will obtain a better deal for its employers, employees and the public.  There is an unwholesome stench from this whole affair which is not good <Col N="966" /> for Irish business.  The people involved must be named and rooted out in the public interest and that of proper conduct of public and business affairs.</P>
    <P>The buck does not stop with the advisers.  Less than 48 hours ago the Minister assured me that following a decision of the Government he was conferred with the authority to conclude discussions with ADM or, failing that, to place the shares with institutions.  There is no point in the Minister seeking to walk away from that responsibility or to read a script with his head down and tell us he had not known of this matter.  It is the Minister's job to know about such matters.  The Minister has been operating in trust for the public. The Government stockbrokers were appointed on the authority of the Minister as he confirmed today.  The Minister stated that he retained those people to advise him, those people have let the Minister down and, in turn, the Minister has let down the public, conclusions must be drawn from that.</P>
    <P>From one sorry episode in this saga to the next, the Minister failed to protect the public interest and the common good. The buck stops with the Minister and he must account for his stewardship here today.  What he has stated falls short of an acceptable mark for a stewardship that smacks of such gross incompetence as to border on the negligent in terms of the Minister's trust and duty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a few remarks about the politics of privatisation and who benefits, a subject not touched on so far.  I also wish to make a few remarks about what this affair tells us about the conduct of Irish business and the standards which are applied.  The Minister cannot claim that this is the first time since we started selling-off the family silver that we have cause for concern in respect of the State's dealings with stockbrokers.  There were a number of such examples during the declining days of life under the Kinsealy regime which gave cause for concern in this House and which were discussed in this House. There was the famous letter revealed on a Sunday news programme by the Leader <Col N="967" /> of my Party, Deputy De Rossa, where the principal in a major firm of stockbrokers in the city gave as a reason for seeking £2 million that he had the ear of people in high places and as a result won favours he might not otherwise have got. This is not the first time we have been confronted with this situation.</P>
      <P>The Minister has to tell the House who made the decision to retain Davy Stockbrokers. How was that decision made? How can he explain the decision having been made, that there was apparently no contact between the day they were asked to handle the flotation and now?  Despite the things we now know were happening and the knowledge at the disposal of Davy Stockbrokers, the Minister has asked us to believe that there was no contact between that date and now.  The Minister's speech is not very helpful in this regard.  Notwithstanding the notice he was given of this debate, it was hurriedly pieced together and different typists typed different paragraphs; it is a stitched together explanation that is not worthy of this House on a matter as serious as this.</P>
      <P>Many Members of the House will remember the late John Kelly saying here that the AIB-ICI affair, where the State had to ride to the rescue in the machinations of a major financial institution, constitued a free kick for the Left.  If that constitued a free kick for the Left, the Davy Stockbrokers-Greencore saga is a penalty try against Irish business, its practices and standards.  It is a political nightmare for the Government and, in particular, the Minister for Finance.  A significant indigenous Irish corporation, a rare enough feature of the Irish industrial landscape, has been damaged and our international credibility as a country with which one can do business has been put at risk.  This raises fundamental questions about the conduct of Irish financial, commercial and business affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This afternoon's explanation by Mr. Brian Davy is entirely implausible.  He said that an overseas investor, a London merchant bank &mdash; which the Minister has now confirmed to be Warburg &mdash; was <Col N="968" /> sought out by Davy Stockbrokers for the disposal of ten million shares and that was subsequently revoked in favour of placing the shares &ldquo;with a number of placees close to us&rdquo;, Mr. Davy's words. This falls far short of the transparency required in this affair.  Having sought out the overseas investor in the first place, why did the stockbrokers suddenly conclude that it would be &ldquo;damaging to place so many shares not in firm hands&rdquo;, his words.  It is simply not believable that the placing of shares with an overseas institution sought out by the stockbrokers in the first instance would be regarded by them as damaging, unsuitable or inappropriate. Mr. Davy's coy description of a &ldquo;number of placees close to us&rdquo; is even less satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Who are these placees and precisely how close are they to Davy Stockbrokers? It is totally unacceptable at this late stage in the day for the Minister to come into the House and tell us that he still does not know the identity, or has not been told the identity, of these placees which are close to Davy Stockbrokers. To say that he retained a company of stockbrokers to handle this flotation in the State's name and he does not know, at this stage of the day, the placees close to that company seems to be utterly absured, unacceptable and a dereliction of duty.</P>
    <P>Was IBI one of these placees close to us?  Since it owns both IBI and Davy Stockbrokers 100 per cent, did the Bank of Ireland stand to benefit from this transaction? Did any senior staff in Davy Stockbrokers, associated with Davy Stockbrokers or associated with any company connected with Davy Stockbrokers, stand to benefit from this transaction? Because of the controversy surrounding the Greencore affair from day one, the dogs in the street were aware of the 15 per cent ceiling enshrined in the articles of association.  Whatever the true reason for the unravelling of this deal, it most emphatically is not because it belatedly dawned on Davy Stockbrokers that the 15 per cent ceiling was there.  I cannot believe that any Minister would sit behind his desk and accept that kind of <Col N="969" /> lame, timid, manifestly implausible explanation from a company retained by him and his Department.</P>
    <P>To put it mildly, the Minister for Finance has been dogged by bad luck on the Greencore affair from day one.  His decision to sell off a valuable State stake in a major indigenous company deprived him of any strategic influence over the future direction of that company, its expansion and diversification.  I remain convinced that this decision to sell for short term budgetary gain was the wrong decision.  His subsequent surrender to the kneejerk response from the Labour back-benches &mdash; opposition, let it be said, not to the sale but to the nationality of the buyer &mdash; was a damaging decision which deprived Greencore, if one believes in privatisation, of the opportunity of linking up with a major international food company which would have given it market access, etc.</P>
    <P>It is important to point out that in normal circumstances it would have been perfectly understandable for the Minister to rely on the professionals whom he employed to do this job.  It is time for the mystery and secrecy which surrounds the machinations of the Stock Exchange and stockbrokers to be swept away by action of this House, if necessary.</P>

      <P>The Minister would have been wiser to hand over the handling of the flotation to Deputy Upton and Deputy Kemmy who would have done a far better job for him.  I am sure Deputy Bree would have ensured that the shares remained in Irish hands.  After the Goodman, Greencore and Telecom affairs and the other scandals which haunted the twilight days of the Kinsealy regime, it is unthinkable that the tax compliant citizen must helplessly watch the parade of naked greed and deceit involved in this affair today.  We must sit back and watch the naked greed and abuse of position which has been exposed in the case of the building societies.  It seems that a Government which promised openness and change has presided over the sale of <Col N="970" /> the State's assets in an inefficient manner. The Minister has not told us exactly the fee and other payments that Davy Stockbrokers might have expected to get had their hand not been forced in this affair.</P>
      <P>There is an extraordinary paragraph in the Minister's speech which states:</P>
      <P>I understand that they intend making this information available to the Stock Exchange also.  In the case of Warburgs, there was originally an arrangement that the commission fee of £550,000 would be shared between them and Davy.  Furthermore, Dávy would share any profits or losses arising from a shareholding that might pass to Warburgs in order to complete the placing.  However, ultimately, when Warburgs participated in the placing for 2.54 million shares, the arrangements were revised on the basis that profits or losses would be for the account of Davy's and that the fee to Warburgs would be reduced to £100,000.</P>
      <P>What is the man in the street expected to make of that?  Do I understand that these guys were conducting themselves as some kind of high class bookies' runners that were in for a share of the action?  Is this the way business is conducted?  The taxpayer is entitled to an answer.  Whatever else has been said about the Minister for Finance &mdash; after serious damage has been done to a major company and to our international reputation &mdash; at least it can be said of him that he did not participate in any cover-up, that he called a stop to what was under way on the part of a company in whom confidence was reposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is intolerable that this position should be allowed to continue.  During and after this debate we still will not know the identity of the people who presumably were to benefit if this transaction had gone ahead, like so many other transactions that were accidentally flushed out.  If there had not been a falling out among the reputable executives&mdash;I hesitate to use the term &mdash; that were entrusted with this company when it was in State hands we would never have <Col N="971" /> known, but for the work of a certain journalist, what might have been covered up during the birth of Greencore.  From that stage right up to the present there has been cause for concern about the handling of Greencore's affairs.  Only recently they were engaged in spring cleaning preparatory to the flotation of the State's remaining shareholding.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his unabashed and engaging way, told this House only a few months ago that he did no even know they were intending to sell off this stake-holding. Despite all of these reasons for concern, there was no monitoring, no assessment or anything else of the handling of the flotation by the company concerned. It puts an entirely new light on the comments of some of these economists, posing as independent commentators, who go on public programmes and on the media arguing for privatisation.</P>

      <P>I regret that, Sir.  At the next Whips' meeting I will support Deputy Yates' suggestion that we need longer.</P>
      <P>It seems quite clear that those so-called independent commentators can very often have a vested interest.  Any assessment undertaken of privatisation in Britain or here has shown that the big winners are the managers, those who purchase the shares, not the workers, not the country.  It is short term, budgetary advantage for the Minister against the long term interest of dividend to the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed, one really wonders about Irish business.  It used to be said, in the wake of last year's scandals, that this was a very unfair image of Irish business, that this was the exception to the rule.  I am now beginning to wonder what is the exception to the rule and what is the norm.  It is not the first time in the history of the Irish Sugar Company that somebody entered into a joint venture which ended up shutting down the Irish company and <Col N="972" /> making a fortune for himself on the international stage.  One wonders whether that is under way again.  One wonders whether one can repose any confidence in those charged with the future direction of Irish business.</P>
    <P>It is a sad, sordid saga and the Minister has not told us the full story.  The least people are entitled to as this deal unravels and the future of a major company is damaged and put at risk, is to be told who stood to benefit from these transactions, how this clandestine operation could have continued while the Minister participated in a programme on Friday last, praising and thanking Davy Stockbrokers for their handling of the affair.  In this House on Tuesday he thanked them for the way they had handled it.</P>
    <P>Does anybody in the Department of Finance, if the Minister himself does not have the time to do it, keep their finger on the button and mind the shop while the Minister is minding his constituency?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>There were many questions asked.  I take it that the arrangement still applies to have a question and answer session later, when many of them can be answered.</P>
      <P>The statement I made at the outset of this debate was in keeping with everything I did in relation to the sale of these shares from the very beginning in that, at every opportunity, on every occasion, I informed the public, the taxpayer, of the position or gave information on where matters stood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will attempt to answer direct questions put to me.  Deputy Rabbitte asked whether I had had contact with Davy Stockbrokers.  Naturally I had; I discussed with them a number of times last week the timing, the day, the arrangements, how they, Davy Stockbrokers, would handle the issue.  I discussed the matter at great length with them again yesterday when they informed me that there were aspects of the sale and placing about which difficulty was being experienced. Therefore, Members will realise that my statements today, on what I was aware of and was not aware of, were <Col N="973" /> based on the outcome of those discussions. I want to make that absolutely clear.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates contended it had been ill-judged to go to the market so quickly after the flotation of Irish Life.  The fact of the matter was that, on the day we went to the market with Irish Life, there was an over-demand for shares.  We could have sold all of the Irish Life shares, and many more, on that occasion two weeks ago.  It was the considered judgment of the market last week that it was the time to go.  At 12 o'clock on the day, I was informed that of the order of 17 million to 20 million shares would be taken up, that Davy Stockbrokers had the arrangement, which would be the usual arrangement &mdash; I do not want to accuse Davy's in any way &mdash; that one would always endeavour to find a significant shareholder, somebody who would take a large placement, which is what they did.  If, however, Warburgs were to take ten million shares, that would create the very circumstances we were endeavouring to change &mdash; in that the ten million shares comprised 40 per cent of the transactions, which was considered to be much too high.  To put it absolutely clearly to the House: I was not told that they had moved from the ten million shares.  When I asked a question late on Friday last I was informed that they had not got to use much of the Warburg take-up, which I was glad to hear because I did not want to see that being taken up.</P>
    <P>I recognise that some Members present would not be familiar with what happens in such cases.  One does not get the list straightaway of who takes up the shares; the contracts would not be completed for another ten days at least.  It is when the contracts entered into have been completed one receives the full list.</P>
    <P>To answer Deputy Cox's question as to the final break-up between the United Kingdom institutions and our domestic ones, I have still not received the list, but I will receive it shortly, of what I believe to be five companies directly associated with Davys which, when the shares did not go to Warburgs, went to those five <Col N="974" /> companies.  To the best of my knowledge, gleaned from the legal discussions which have been continuing all day, I believe these companies may not necessarily have had any kind of sweetheart arrangement. By that I mean that it was not a question of, if they lost, receiving comfort from Davys.  I think the position was that they were directly linked to Davys. Both the Stock Exchange and I will examine that matter fully to get to the bottom of it.</P>

      <P>It was in the best interests of the company to sell all the stock and this was done with the full support of the company and its directors.  The company has made it clear that it had a contingency plan, which was that if it could not sell all the shares on the market the shares that remained unsold would be offered to Warburg.  Furthermore, Davy Stockbrokers were in order in sharing the fee; this is usual when a large number of shares is taken up.  I have no objection to this.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte raised the question of fees.  I would have had to pay £175,000 for the advice received and £550,000 on the sale of the shares.</P>

      <P>Because, ultimately, I am responsible for this transaction I am prepared to accept criticism but misleading comments should not be made as they would not be of any help to Greencore. Practically all the institutions and individuals involved confirmed to the company today that not only will they hold the number of shares which they <Col N="975" /> offered to purchase last week at £2.75 per share but will increase it.  I cannot say all but most of the major institutions are still behind the company.  I can assure Deputy Cox that I will do all in my power to ensure that the shares that are in the wrong place will find their way to the right place.</P>
      <P>Deputy Yates said that he has been informed that Warburgs refused to take up its shares but this is not correct.  To respond to the point raised by Deputy Cox, I am receiving legal advice from the Attorney General while a number of other senior counsel are involved acting on behalf of the company, Davy Stockbrokers, and others.  I will do my best to resolve this matter.  I believe, in regard to the placement, that I have contracts that are in order and that I will be entitled, on behalf of the taxpayer, to collect my money on the due date.  If the legal position changes, having regard to the investigation that is being carried out by the Stock Exchange, alternative arrangements will be made as quickly as possible.  I have been assured by the Stock Exchange that its investigation will be carried out simultaneously.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister one direct question.  He said he was informed by Davy Stockbrokers that Warburgs would take up the remaining ten million shares and that this was not unusual.  At around 3.30 p.m. on Friday afternoon 7.5 million shares remained <Col N="976" /> unsold.  What is the reason the sale of those shares did not go through?  The reason, according to Mr. Davy, was that 9 per cent would have been added and that the figure of seven million shares was too high.  Given that it was prepared to take up ten million shares what is the reason that all of a sudden the figure of seven million shares was too high?  Was the Minister told the truth about what Warburgs would do with the unsold shares?  It is my understanding that it never promised to take up ten million shares.  I would like to know what happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Yates is correct when he says that Warburgs offered to take up ten million shares.  It is my understanding that it did not refuse to take up that number of shares because it was never asked to do so.  Later that afternoon when everybody believed, including myself, that the sale had been a success &mdash; I had been informed directly by Davys that this in fact was the position &mdash; Davys changed track and offered only two million shares to Warburgs with the remainder going to other companies and individuals associated directly, apparently, with Davys.  I only became aware of this yesterday.  Having received legal advice Davys informed me of this matter as they were concerned about the way in which the placement was completed.  I do not believe that the motive was money as I am not sure what was to be gained.  On being told that a substantial number of the shares had found their way to individuals and companies apparently associated directly with the Davys group I decided to make this information public. There was no disagreement about this. Mr. Brian Davy held a similar view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister to expand on the relationship that exists between the internal advisers in his Department and agents, such as Davys, when they are appointed.  The explanation that we have been offered so far today reeks of pacivity &mdash;&ldquo;I was informed after the event&rdquo; and so on.  Do the Minister and his Department not <Col N="977" /> adopt an active hands-on approach given that they are acting in the public interest? Can the Minister tell us what procedures are in place or are we just learning after the horse has bolted that we should start to close the stable door in the future and that there is a need to adopt an active hands-on approach because the procedure in place has not worked?</P>
      <P>Given that the Minister's partners in Government appear to exhibit extraordinary political sensitivity when there is a prospect of attracting a non-Irish investor, for example, ADM, in regard to take up the Greencore shares, how is it that they were blindly indifferent and ignorant, as the Minister himself admitted today, on the question of who was taking up the shares in this case? Does the Minister mean to tell me that despite all ADM had going for it the attitude adopted was &ldquo;we do not want them, they are foreigners; we do not care who else buys the shares&rdquo;?  I would like to know if they and the Minister were interested?  This is not the first time there has been controversy surrounding dealings in the State's shares in this company but it is the first time it has come in this way.  Is the Minister very disappointed with his agents in the conduct of his business? Will he sack them; demand the return of fees and, if there are losses, sue them?  What will he do about his own position?  Will he stand here passively and say &ldquo;go bhfóire Dia orainn&rdquo;?  There is nothing I can do, I am only the innocent victim of bum advice?  The buck stops with the Minister.  Will he have the matter investigated throughly?</P>

      <P>When the Government or a Government Department is involved in something in which it has no direct expertise &mdash; naturally the Department does not have a team with expertise in stockbroking &mdash; it brings in outside agents.  This happened when we were dealing in the shares of Irish Life, Greencore and in many State agencies over the years.  Davys has acted successfully for the Government over many years.  It is <Col N="978" /> the biggest and most reputable stock-broking company in the State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>In the recent past, shares in Irish Life were placed with both NCB and Davys and it acted jointly in the success of that project.  Davys has acted over a number of years both on its own and jointly with other companies. Up until now the system has worked extremely well.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cox asked to whom we were selling.  I was also asked the names of the big agents dealing with this, Warburgs is one and was prepared to take a balance of the shares up to a maximum of ten million.  I was also advised that another big company was involved.  The others were smaller and it would not be usual, proper or necessary for Mr. Davy or any other stockbroker to outline in advance which shares individuals would buy on the day.  Naturally they would be working from a list and the stockbrokers would be ringing around.  I am sure Deputy Cox knows how the system works, normally three brokers check through their list and confirm to one broker the price they had achieved, that continues until the matter is finished.  That is precisely what happened this time.  Naturally, I am disappointed that at no time on Friday, when I was there all day because I was concerned that the matter would be tied up, nobody rang me until I was informed yesterday at 2.30 p.m. that Davys had moved the shares, for whatever reason, into companies and individuals associated with them.  Naturally, I am disappointed at that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister tell the House the reason?  Were the terms of the share placings with the favoured clients the same as the terms made available to the normal investors?  Was the matter of staff having an option on shares for, let us say a period of two weeks, discussed with him?  Does he know if this happened? Was the Minister's assent sought <Col N="979" /> for the preparatory measures in the spring-clean prior to flotation whereby, for example, some of those involved in ripping off the Irish Sugar Company got their golden handshake?  In addition, why did the preparatory work on the flotation not include Greencore's involvement in a company called Tipperary Candy, where 65 jobs are now at risk?</P>

      <P>They did not have to get the Minister's assent and they did not seek it.</P>
      <P>On the issue of whether some of the individuals in the company &mdash; I believe it is five but I will confirm whether it is five or six &mdash; made arrangements to take an option on shares for a period of two weeks or one month, that is something about which I have no details whatsoever.  Last night I thought Davys had made separate arrangements with some of the people with whom it places shares but from the statement issued by Davys today, which I am sure other Members have, there is no reference to it.  From reading Mr. Brian Davy's statement today it seems that the companies were directly related to the Davy group.</P>

      <P>What reason did Davy Stockbrokers give for not selling the shares to Warburg?  This is the missing part of the jigsaw.  Is the Minister not being told the full story?  Could it be that Warburg was not prepared to take up so many shares?  What will happen to Greencore stock now?  How long will trading in it be suspended?  What steps is the Minister taking to ensure that it can be traded at a normal price?  Will the Minister clarify the position and the legal advice he has had on the sale of these shares?  Who owns the Government's 30.4 per cent stake in Greencore?  Does the Minister still own it, is it sold, or is it owned by Davy's?</P>

      <P>I appeal for brevity so that I can call as many Deputies as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be as brief as possible. The legal advice at present &mdash; which is subject to a number of legal discussions with the individuals I mentioned earlier &mdash; is that placing was properly made on the day and that the shares are with those people.  However, the stock market also has a say in this issue.  Greencore put forward the position it would like to see and the Government is guided by what it would like for the company.  In the three or four points Greencore made, it states: first, written contracts were issued in respect of all the shares which were the subject of the placing; the purchasers without exception should settle their share purchases in the normal way; there is no reason in contract law for not doing so and the Minister will receive the full <Col N="981" /> consideration for the shares.  Second, on the basis of information made available to the company yesterday that will have the effect that 9.5 million shares will be in the hands of client accounts connected with Davy Stockbrokers.  To the extent that this raises the issues of the limit of 15 per cent shareholding in the company's articles of association, the company as a matter of policy would not propose to exercise its right to disenfranchise the affected shares.  If the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry simultaneously chooses not to exercise his right to force the excess shares to be sold, this would effectively remove any potential obstacle posed by the company's articles of association.  With the consent of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry the company would proceed immediately to convene an extraordinary general meeting of its shareholders to amend its articles to increase the 15 per cent limit to 30 per cent.  Third, at that point it would be a matter between the investing institutions, possibly with the involvement of the Irish Association of Investment Managers and Davy Stockbrokers, as to whether and at what price some or all of the investing institutions would be prepared to buy some or all of the shares in Davy's connected accounts.  Finally, it would be a matter for the investing institutions and Davy Stockbrokers to agree between themselves the voluntary restrictions to which Davy Stockbrokers would agree in respect of any such shares not purchased from it by the institutions.</P>
      <P>The company believes that Davy Stockbrokers might undertake not to sell any of the remaining shares in connected accounts for a period of two weeks.  This is the advice I have from Greencore management, based on the legal advice of two senior counsel which includes both its own legal counsel and the legal counsel for AIB Capital Markets.  It is also the advice of NCB Stockbrokers who are the stockbroking firm for the company.  It is on that basis we will continue the discussions this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>In his script the Minister <Col N="982" /> says that Warburgs could take up to ten millions shares, they would &ldquo;receive a commission of £550,000 for this,&rdquo; that he in &ldquo;acting in good faith on this advice&rdquo; and &ldquo;did not dissent from the proposed arrangement&rdquo;.  That is fair enough.  The Minister then went on to say something that is at variance with that.  He said: &ldquo;In the case of Warburgs, there was originally an arrangement that the commission fee of £550,000 would be shared between them and Davy&rdquo;.  Did the Minister know originally that this fee would be shared between him, Warburgs and Davy?  The Minister went on to say:</P>
      <P>Furthermore Davy would share any profits or losses arising from a shareholding that might pass to Warburgs ...However, ultimately, when Warburgs participated in the placing for 2.54 million shares, the arrangements were revised on the basis that profits or losses would be for the account of Davys.</P>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that Warburgs were not taking up the shares at all.  They were purely the nominal purchasers and the beneficial ownership was in Davys.  Is the Minister not aware, as I am sure are Davys, that the Investment Bank of Ireland already owns 15 per cent of shares, so that shares bought by any Bank of Ireland company, including Davys, would be in breach of the very important provision in the articles of association? Did they not go into this deal with their eyes open, knowing they were breaking the law, and was the Minister not aware of this?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not aware of what the arrangements were with Warburgs. If there was an arrangement whereby if Warburgs were to take up a large amount of the shares they would share the commission, that would be normal practice. On the day before the placement when I heard Warburgs might take up shares I asked whether the purchase was being undertaken on an underwriter basis and I received a very clear answer that it was not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the 15 per cent rule, there <Col N="983" /> was public knowledge of that matter.  I said in every discussion in this House in relation to the 15 per cent rule, and in public interviews, that there was Government agreement that I would sell to ADM if they so wished and that the 15 per cent rule would be removed at an extraordinary general meeting.  I cannot answer the question as to why Davys, at the end of the day on Friday, deviated from the arrangement with Warburgs and instead opted to sell a large proportion of the shares.</P>

      <P>It is obvious that since the Minister has been informed of this matter he has acted in an impeccable <Col N="984" /> manner in relation to transparency and calling in the Attorney General.  He has informed this House of the matter to the best of his knowledge and within the legal constraints under which he is working, and I congratulate him on that.  However, underlying that is the disgraceful and shameful behaviour of the Minister's professional advisers and the unacceptable greed within the private sector.  I hope the Minister gets to the bottom of this problem so that we can proceed with privatisation, as was intended.  The Minister has always said in this House and in public statements that privatisation of Greencore would be to the benefit of the employees and the future of the company.

      <P>My main concern is to ensure that the company is not further damaged &mdash; Greencore has had more than its fair share of difficulties in the last number of years &mdash; and it is on that basis that I outlined the formula, backed up by the legal advice of AIB capital markets, NCB, acting as the company stockbroker and the company directors.  If we proceed on that basis we can successfuly sell the shares while allowing the company to continue to develop and expand.  I spent several hours last evening with the chief executive of the company, Mr. Gerry Murphy, who confirmed that it is their wish and that of their advisers that we proceed in this manner.</P>

Will the Minister say what was the role of his Department in monitoring the sale of these shares and the details of that sale? Will he say what was the practice in previous sales of Government shares?  Is he satisfied that the Department discharged its duty adequately?

      <P>I am disappointed with the outcome of the sale.  In a business such as this where one is informed that shares are successfully based one does not expect difficulties to arise.  It was Davys legal advisers who first pointed out to them that there was something wrong and, in fairness to them, they came to me.  When the issue was raised with me I had no alternative but to go to the Stock Exchange.  Until all the legal advice is available and the investigations have concluded, I will not know whether the deal was carried out illegally.  The outcome is different from that we expected.  As regards other sales, the Department of Finance and other Departments pay substantial fees to advisers and they do not second guess these advisers but rather work with them.  In the case of both Irish Life and Greencore the Department officials worked for hours planning how they would deal with the matter, but they cannot be answerable at the end of the day if changes take place about which they were not informed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan:</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been an ongoing debate in England and in America regarding the price of compact discs.  A special committee was set up in Westminster to examine this and various interest groups were invited to answer allegations about the price of these commodities. The questions put to the record industry were not answered satisfactorily. The campaign to reduce the price of compact discs to a reasonable level should be stepped up and that is why I asked the Government and the Minister to take up this issue.</P>
      <P>Some people might consider this a minority issue but that is not the case.  Vinyl records are on the way out and will soon become a collector's item.  Compact discs and tapes are the &ldquo;in thing&rdquo; and other new types of music are also coming on the market.  Most people buy tapes and compact discs and are being charged an exorbitant price for them.  I telephoned Tower Records in the US and found that CDs on the shelves there are selling for approximately £6 while they are selling here for £14 and £15.  There is the same differential in England.  There is no justification for it.  When the record companies were asked about the difference they said that that was what the market could bear but that people in America will not buy them for that price.  That is outrageous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another argument advanced by the record companies was their need to invest in new talent, but they are not doing that, which is a tragedy.  The charts are full of old records and CDs of old records are selling at between £6 and £7.  There is a blatant rip-off in this area.  The cost of a compact disc, plus the cover, is approximately £1.  The artists get another £1 and the manufacturer, the record companies and the retailer get the rest.  Retailers have tried to introduce competition in prices but, to a certain extent, they are tied by the prices at which they buy from the record companies.  This area should be examined and pressure brought to <Col N="988" /> bear to ensure that the price of compact discs is reduced.</P>
    <P>A lot of music now being released is no longer obtainable on records.  The number of CDs being purchased is bound to increase.  Record companies say that the sales of compact discs are increasing which shows that people are happy with the prices.  However, it is clear they are increasing because records are being done away with.  In HMV at present, the ground floor, which used to sell records, only stocks compact discs and tapes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing Deputy Ryan to raise the subject in which he has a very keen interest.</P>
      <P>The various points made by Deputy Eoin Ryan are of considerable interest. In bearing them in mind I know that the Deputy will be aware that in the context of the 1990 budget the Minister for Finance announced the abolition of the 40 per cent duty on the chargeable value of compact discs and gramophone records. In announcing this measure, it is of interest to note that the then Minister in his budget statement referred to this measure as one which would help the music industry generally, as it is labour intensive.  A further general reduction applied with the reduction in the highest rate of value added tax from 25 per cent to 23 per cent.  In the subsequent budget the VAT rate was reduced to the current rate of 21 per cent.  In general the result of the 1990 measure, coupled with the VAT decreases, was a reduction of around £2 in the retail price of an average compact disc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of concerns expressed, particularly in the UK, that the prices of CDs are high relative to both their cost of manufacture, and to prices prevailing in the United States.  The UK Office of Fair Trading is, I understand, considering whether the CD pricing structure merits an inquiry.  I should point out that I have not received any representations on the issue of CD pricing in recent years.  That is not to say that something should not <Col N="989" /> be done about it.  I am conscious that the price structure of a compact disc is complex, involving different elements such as cost of manufacture, royalties-copyright, marketing, packaging, wholesale and retail margins and so on and that it is not clear to what extent, if any, excessive profits are being made.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the higher rate of value added tax in the Republic, the retail price of compact discs in the Republic and the United Kingdom is broadly similar. To the extent that the price of CDs in Ireland is determined elsewhere &mdash; largely the UK &mdash; and to the extent that there is a perception in the UK that those prices are too high, any reduction of prices as a result of action taken in the UK, official or otherwise, will percolate to the Irish CD buying market.  That is not good enough.</P>
    <P>Implicit in the points made by Deputy Ryan are that action is warranted.  We are all aware that statutory price controls were dismantled in 1986.  We seek, through the Competition Act, to increase consumer awareness of prices, value and so on.  I am aware that there are very genuine concerns in this area and I will be glad to talk to Deputy Ryan afterwards if he has specific information on which I could work.  I will take up the issue with the industry.  I have asked the Director of Consumer Affairs to examine the matter as a result of the Deputy bringing it to the floor of the House.  I have asked him to report to me as the person with political responsibility for consumer affairs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have sought to raise this matter over the last few weeks and eventually I have been successful.  I appreciate the Chair facilitating me as I know there is a lot of pressure in regard to the Adjournment, particularly since the abolition of the grievance procedure. I had an opportunity recently to speak privately with the Minister regarding some of the schemes which have been a <Col N="990" /> cause for concern.  In fairness we are of one mind in regard to the urgent necessity to provide piped water schemes.  The scheme in Abbeyfeale is one of the largest schemes in County Limerick.  Over a period there has been increased pressure to provide water.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister has good news to announce on this issue.  I welcome the decision of the Department of the Environment to allocate grant funding for this desirable project.  It is extremely important for that hinterland because there is difficulty in relation to two adjoining villages of Mountcollins and Tournafulla who have an inadquate water supply. When this scheme goes ahead it will provide extra water for those locations.</P>
      <P>I hope the other smaller schemes of five and ten participants in County Limerick at Dromtrasna, Ballinamona, Tireagh Cross-Belville and Ballingarry will get the green light.  I would encourage the Minister when seeking EC funding to examine the overall group water schemes and try to secure as much finance as possible.  The allocation in this year's budget of £2.5 million, with a carry over in demand of £1.5 million from last year, means that £1 million is totally inadequate to meet demands.  As we approach the year 2000 everybody who wants a piped water supply should have it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne, Wexford) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne, Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford):</i> I thank Deputy Finucane for raising this issue.  The Abbeyfeale public water supply scheme was commissioned in 1988 with a design capacity to serve a substantial part of south-west Limerick. It currently serves Abbeyfeale and a large rural hinterland.  The Caher group water scheme is providing a major part of the distribution system for the Abbeyfeale regional scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Due to the need to cater for the water requirements of areas beyond the Caher catchment, such as Mountcollins and Tournafulla, Limerick County Council recommended the up-sizing of the group scheme distribution main to meet the additional downstream demand.  Phase <Col N="991" /> one of the group's water scheme is currently nearing completion and serves around 96 households and 38 farms.  A grant of approximately £260,000 was allocated to the scheme.  This included a special grant of £173,000 which was allocated some time ago to meet the cost of up-sizing the distribution main as recommended by the council.</P>
    <P>Phase two of the Caher scheme will serve the area known as the Hill.  It will serve an additional 70 households and farms and will go a long way towards completing the linkup with Mountcollins.</P>
    <P>Extra reservoir and water main capacity over and above immediate group water needs is required in order to serve the Mountcollins area.  This will add approximately £68,000 to the overall cost of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Having examined the group's proposal I am satisfied that the design changes recommended by Limerick County Council offer the best solution to the long term water needs of the region.  The Deputy will be pleased to know that approval has now been given for a group water scheme grant of £52,000 for this scheme together with a special contribution of £68,168 to meet the cost of the extra reservoir and watermain capacity as requested by the county council. My Department will be asking the group to commence work as soon as possible so that the bulk of the work can be completed before the end of the year. So far as the other issues raised by the Deputy are concerned, he can rest assured that we will make every effort to secure as much funding as possible, both from the Exchequer and from the EC, to continue with group water schemes.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Cavan Swimming Pool Project.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, and the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Browne, for coming in to deal with this matter.  It is in rather poignant circumstances we debate this subject this evening.  I have just returned from the <Col N="992" /> funeral of one of the prime movers of the project, the treasurer of the committee responsible, the late Mrs. Margaret Tully, mother of four young children, who died suddenly yesterday morning.  I am sure it is appropriate in this House to offer sympathy to her husband and young family.  She was a marvellous person and it would be a great reward for her efforts if the Minister had some good news for us this evening.</P>
      <P>The swimming pool in Cavan was first mooted 15 years ago and a committee was formed.  Like all good Cavan people, they were not going to depend on the State but set about fund raising.  To date they have the commendable sum of £300,000 to put towards this project.  A site is available and all that remains is for the Minister to give sanction.  Tenders were submitted to his Department as early as last February but to date there has been a deafening silence.  That is not good enoough.</P>
      <P>Our case is based on the fact that Cavan is the only county without an indoor swimming pool, despite the fact that it is an inland county.  Many other counties with these facilities are beside the sea.  We do not have that facility but we are renowned for lakes and rivers. Marvellous work has been done by many local committees in teaching children to swim in our lakes and rivers.  This is slightly dangerous but it is well supervised. Many children are taken by teachers and others to adjoining counties for swimming instruction.  If this facility was in Cavan it would be availed of.</P>
      <P>I can give the Minister of State categorical assurance that there would be no further cost to the State in relation to its upkeep because the project would pay for itself if properly constructed.  At this stage we will not accept a tank filled with water in a hole in the ground.  We need all the ancillary services that people expect when they go swimming.  The parents accompanying the children should be able to sit in a seated area and enjoy a cup of coffee or a mineral.  Those are simple facilities but they will be at a cost. It must be a place to which people are attracted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="993" /> We met the former Minister for the Environment, Mr. Flynn, over two years ago when he gave a categoric assurance that we were next in line for a swimming pool when the refurbishing of pools built by the State, which had fallen into dilapidation, had been completed.  It is not good enough that a county or a community provided with a pool should allow it to fall into disrepair and that we should have to await our turn until it was refurbished. We understood the Minister's position that for the sake of the safety of the children using them they had to be refurbished.  That project is now completed. It is not fair that the people of Cavan should have to wait any longer.</P>
    <P>The Minister is being given an assurance by a committee who have shown their commitment and interest by collecting a substantial amount of money. He has my assurance regarding its usage. If the Minister takes this project on board, a contractor can start work immediately, jobs would be created and an important facility would be provided for Cavan &mdash; the only county without such a facility.  I look forward to a positive response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I appreciate the Deputy's interest in this project and I thank him for this opportunity to set out the position in relation to the Cavan swimming pool.</P>
      <P>Before dealing with the Cavan project, however, it would be as well to outline briefly the various stages in my Department's assessment of swimming pool projects and how this assessment ties in with the commitment of funding to a particular project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department pays grants of 80 per cent of the approved cost of new swimming pools, with the remainder of the cost being funded by local contribution. To qualify for a grant, a pool must be built to Department's specification.  The commitment of funds to a particular project can only be considered when the project design has been approved and the local authority are in a position to accept a tender for the project.  The overall allocation for the swimming pool programme <Col N="994" /> and the competing demands of other swimming pool projects for the available funds must, of course, be taken into account.</P>
    <P>The first stage in the development of a swimming pool proposal is for the local authority to submit an outline proposal to my Department, comprising a site description, a description and outline technical drawings of the proposed works, an estimate of the costs and an indication of how the local contribution is to be provided.  If the Department is satisfied with the proposal and with the arrangements for the local contribution and accepts the need for the proposed swimming pool, approval in principle will be given.  The local authority may then proceed to prepare detailed drawings and specifications, normally called contract documents, and submit these for approval.  When the contract documents have been approved by my Department, tenders are invited and proposals for the acceptance of tenders are submitted to the Department for approval in due course.  It is only at this stage, when the acceptance of tenders is being sanctioned, that a grant is formally allocated to the project so that work can be undertaken.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Cavan pool, my Department wrote to Cavan County Council on 9 August, 1991 conveying approval to their outline proposals and gave a commitment in principle to provide funding.  Last September my Department approved the contract documents submitted by Cavan County Council. We are currently examining proposals for the acceptance of tenders for the civil engineering works, the mechanical plant and the electrical plant which were submitted by Cavan County Council on 24 February, 22 March and 29 March, 1993, respectively.  A decision on the tender proposals will be notified to the council as soon as possible.  The question of a grant allocation will be dealt with at that stage.</P>

      <P>Is Gaelscoil i gceartlár <Col N="995" /> Bhaile Atha Cliath le níos mó ná 100 dalta Scoil Chaoimhín agus tagann roinnt mhaith de na páisdí sin ón cheantar morthimpeall Sráid Mhaoilbhríde, ceantar fíorbhocht den chuid is mó de.</P>
      <P>Is í an tAire patrún na scoile seo.  Is leis an Roinn Oideachais an foirgneamh breá atá acu agus tá an Stát go hiomlán freagrach as.  Tá Gaelscoileanna ar an láthair seo ó 1927, an bhliain a bunaíodh Scoil Cholmcille, Scoil Mhuire agus an scoil ullmhúcháin.  Thug an Roinn an suíomh iontach seo dóibh beagnach taobh istigh de gheataí na Roinne.  Tá an scoil suite díreach treasna ó oifig an Aire. Is i 1983 a tháinig na Gaelscoileanna le chéile ar an láthair seo nuair a bunaíodh Scoil Chaoimhín.  Tugadh geallúint dóibh ag an am sin go mbeadh an foirgneamh sin acu i gcónaí.  Tá dóchas agam nach bhfuil sé i gceist an ghealliúnt sin a bhriseadh.</P>
      <P>There is a long and proud tradition behind Scoil Chaoimhín stretching back to 1927 when its two predecessors were Scoil Colmcille and Scoil Mhuire.  They were amalgamated in 1983 and called Scoil Chaoimhín.  The parents, teachers and pupils are rightly very protective of the tradition and ethos that they have built up and provide in the very splendid school building which they occupy.  Scoil Chaoimhín is an undoubted success story with 108 children at present and 40 new names on the enrolment list for September of this year.</P>
      <P>In recent years the number of local children, some from very disadvantaged backgrounds, has increased substantially. These children do not come from Irish speaking homes and it is a great tribute to their parents and to the children themselves that they accept the challenge of being educated through the medium of the Irish language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Minister has visited the school and I am sure she was impressed by everything she saw.  It would not be in the interest of a Gaelscoil such as Scoil Chaoimhín to be relocated into the midst of an English speaking environment. Such a move could prove very destructive of everything that the Gaelscoil has <Col N="996" /> achieved so far.  This is but one concern of teachers and parents alike.  On an even more practical level the existing school building has all the facilities which many more modern schools aspire to have. There is a school hall and gymnasium, a music room, kitchen-cum-diningroom, staff room and principal's office.  Indeed, the toilet facilities were recently refurbished at a cost of several thousand pounds.</P>
    <P>I am aware of schools which do not have any of these facilities.  I am sure the Minister has a long list of schools seeking grant aid for additional facilities such as I have outlined.  Certainly there is a huge demand for refurbishment grants throughout the country to improve dilapidated and substandard school buildings. The Minister is more aware than anyone of the scarce resources available to her and the acute inadequacy of the funding available to her to provide for the needs of many schools crying out for help with refurbishment.</P>
    <P>It is in this context in particular that it is quite incredible that between a quarter and half a million pounds can be readily made available to relocate Scoil Chaoimhín out of a sound school building, a building with huge potential against the wishes of everyone involved &mdash; parents, teachers and local public representatives. Ironically half a million pounds is precisely the amount of money that another Gaelscoil in another area of the inner city, Gaelscoil Coláiste Mhuire, needs urgently to refurbish its school building.</P>
    <P>I really do not see any sustainable argument for spending very limited and desperately needed resources to provide a new school building for a school that clearly does not need it, and more important, does not want it.  A very small amount of money could carry out the necessary repairs to the roof of the existing building and perhaps some interior decoration.  Perhaps the Minister would consider using the remainder of the money that is apparently available to grant aid Gaelscoil Coláiste Mhuire and in so doing kill two birds with the one stone.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="997" /> One other important aspect is the complete failure on the part of the Department of Education to consult anyone in the school, board of management, teachers or parents.  It was the parents themselves who heard rumours of the relocation plan in February of this year. They urged their board of management to write to the Department to establish whether the rumours were true.  The board of management wrote on 2 April 1993 and they received a reply on 5 April &mdash; significantly the reply was dated 2 April &mdash; informing the board that it had been decided to relocate the school.  A meeting was only held between the board and Department officials on 23 April.  I emphasise this because the written reply I received from the Minister yesterday seemed to suggest there was consultation. The facts are that the board of management of the school was told, and only after the decision was made, that the matter was not open for discussion.  I deplore that type of treatment of any school authority.  I again urge the Minister to reverse this ridiculous decision and allow Scoil Chaoimhín to plan ahead in full confidence of continued success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I am glad of the opportunity the Deputy has presented me with to clarify the position in relation to this project.</P>
      <P>The decision to relocate Scoil Chaoimhín in newly refurbished premises must be seen in the context of the overall development needs of the Department of Education campus at Marlborough Street.</P>
      <P>The site at Marlborough Street accommodates the main offices of the Department and three primary schools &mdash; the Central Model boys' and girls' schools and Scoil Chaoimhín, an all-Irish model school.  As model schools those three schools are owned, maintained and fully funded by the State.  The Minister for Education is the patron of each of the schools and boards of management operate the schools on behalf of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Major refurbishment of the central model school buildings is, I am glad to say, well underway.  This refurbishment <Col N="998" /> means the central model schools will at long last reoccupy their former premises. I am sure the Deputy will be pleased with this development as, over the years, he asked many questions as to when this potentially fine building would be restored and money made available for the purpose.  The same contract also provides for the refurbishment of the adjacent colonnade building as a new location for Scoil Chaoimhín.  The building at present occupied by Scoil Chaoimhín is in need of major repairs &mdash; a ceiling collapsed last year and the roof is in urgent need of repair.  Officials of the Department of Education met Scoil Chaoimhín school representatives and outlined their plans for the refurbishment of the colonnade building and its future use as their school.</P>
    <P>The Department's officials will continue dialogue and discussion with the school representatives so that excellent facilities will be provided for the school. Accommodation will be provided for the school of 110 pupils and staff of five teachers in the restored building which is only some 50 yards away from its present location.</P>
    <P>An overall view of the present arrangement of school and office facilities in Marlborough Street shows them to be unsatisfactory from a number of aspects. The central model schools are at present accommodated in prefabricated accommodation, much of which is in urgent need of replacement.  Scoil Chaoimhín is in premises which are in need of major repairs and which are centrally located within the complex of the headquarter offices of the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>Access of pupils, parents and general traffic to all three model schools is via the main gate and grounds of the Department of Education offices which, for obvious reasons of security and safety, is not satisfactory.  We are aware of the fire officer's dissatisfaction with the resulting congestion and attendant difficulties there would be in having proper access to the schools in an emergency.</P>
    <P>The necessity to rationalise the overall layout of both school and office accommodation at Marlborough Street, therefore, <Col N="999" /> in the light of the above led to the decision that the old central model schools' building would be restored for the central model schools and that the adjacent colannade building be restored for Scoil Chaoimhín.</P>
    <P>The two central models schools will have their own entrance from Gardiner Street and Scoil Chaoimhín will also have its own entrance from Gardiner Street. It is envisaged that a large and attractive play area will be provided for the three schools when the prefabricated classrooms which now clutter quite a large area on site are removed.  This will be a further very attractive feature of the newly refurbished schools complex.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Deputy will welcome the <Col N="1000" /> restoration to important everyday use of these two historic buildings in the heart of inner city Dublin and in the heart of his constituency.</P>
    <P>I am sure that when the buildings are completed he will be more than satisfied with the results and that the required allocation of expenditure towards these projects is fully justified.  These works constitute worthwhile inner city renewal which will enhance the area further and complement the other developments such as the new apartment blocks and financial services centre which have already been constructed in this immediate vicinity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Priority Questions Nos. 4 and 68 together.</P>
      <P>The situation which developed at the Passport Office last year was exceptional in that the postal strike coincided with the busy peak season for passport applications. Queues and delays on the same scale are not anticipated this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the months of April to July are always extremely busy for the Passport Office, with an average number of passport applications of around 1,200 per day.  Every effort is made to deal as efficiently as possible with this exceptionally heavy demand.  Each year, significant numbers of additional temporary <Col N="892" /> staff are recruited; at present there are about 65 additional staff members supplementing the permanent staff of the Passport Office.</P>
    <P>The passport application form states that six weeks should be allowed for applications to be processed during the peak season.  Currently, properly completed postal applications are dealt with in about four weeks.  By international standards, this is considered a reasonable waiting period.</P>
    <P>A special emphasis has been placed on trying to overcome the problems associated with seasonality of demand.  I would draw the attention of the House to the introduction last year of a special low-season fee, which was, I believe, very well received by the public.  The Department has over the past few years also conducted a publicity campaign with the aim of encouraging people to apply for their passports in good time.  As part of this campaign, the Passport Office has participated in the annual Holiday Fairs in Dublin and, as from last year, in Cork, at which it has dealt with several thousand inquiries.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Passport Office also ran an advertising campaign in the national press at the end of March aimed specifically at urging those intending to travel abroad to check that they had an up-to-date passport and if not, to apply in good time and to apply as far as possible by post.  A greater reliance on postal applications would help substantially to reduce queues in the Passport Office.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 40 and 69 together. Ireland and our partners in the European Community remain very concerned at the human rights situation in East Timor, which continues to be unsatisfactory. As recently as last March, at the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, together with our Community partners, we made known our strong views on the human rights abuses in the territory.</P>
      <P>At the same session, Ireland with the other EC member states co-sponsored a strongly worded resolution, adopted by the Commission, which was critical of the human rights situation in East Timor and which urged the government of Indonesia to invite the UN Special Rapporteurs on Torture and on Summary Executions and the UN Working Groups on Arbitrary Detention and on Disappeared Persons to visit East Timor and to facilitate them in their work.  Ireland played an active role in Geneva in support of this resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland welcomes and supports the negotiations on the status of East Timor which are taking place at ministerial level between Portugal and Indonesia under the auspices of the UN Secretary-General. The respective Foreign Ministers met in Rome on 21 April under the auspices of the Secretary General and have <Col N="894" /> agreed to meet again in New York on 17 September.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23, 31, 48, 49, 60, 74, 76, 80, 84, 85, 86, 87 and 88 together.</P>
      <P>The Government attach the highest priority to an early resumption of political dialogue on the future of Northern Ireland, aimed at reaching a comprehensive political accommodation between the two traditions in Ireland which will be conductive to lasting peace and stability.</P>
      <P>It is clear that people in both parts of Ireland and in Britain urgently want to see progress towards a resolution of the conflict and the ending of all violence and suffering.  The two Governments and the political parties in Northern Ireland have a duty to respond to this clear wish and to resume negotiations.</P>
      <P>The Government, for their part, have made clear their wish to enter such dialogue so as to address comprehensively all of the relationships involved in an open and innovative spirit, ready to discuss every issue and to incorporate all agreed changes.  The Programme for a Partnership Government sets out a clear and detailed approach to the Northern Ireland problem which is fully endorsed and shared by both Parties in Government.</P>
      <P>Since it is accepted by all that the final outcome of talks will need to be acceptable to the people North and South, it seems reasonable to envisage that this might be established by referendum in both jurisdictions.  The Government, for their part, are committed in their joint Programme to seeking any necessary endorsement in a referendum for an agreed package emerging from the talks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pending the resumption of formal talks, the Tánaiste had made clear his desire for direct first-hand contracts with <Col N="897" /> constitutional politicians and representative community leaders from both traditions in Northern Ireland.  There have been formal meetings with the SDLP and Alliance parties, and he is pursuing the question of contacts with other representatives to the extent that is constructively possible in present circumstances.</P>
    <P>There have been sustained contacts with the British Government, both at political and official level, to consider how best both Governments can achieve progress towards their common goal of seeing further talks take place as soon as possible on the basis of the statement of 26 March 1991.</P>
    <P>Both Governments have repeatedly made clear that they remain fully committed to the Anglo-Irish Agreement, unless and until it is transcended by new agreed arrangements.  The Government consider the vigorous and comprehensive implementation of the Agreement to be in the interests of both communities in Northern Ireland and the people of Ireland as a whole.</P>
    <P>Over the past two years there have been 11 meetings of the Anglo-Irish Conference. The number of these meetings reflects the prolonged &ldquo;gap&rdquo; which was agreed in 1991 to allow unionist leaders to participate in political dialogue.  These and all previous meetings of the Conference have been directed to serving the common purpose of the two Governments under the Anglo-Irish Agreement, in particular their commitment to &ldquo;continuing efforts to reconcile and to acknowledge the rights of the two major traditions that exist in Ireland&rdquo; and to &ldquo;a society in Northern Ireland in which all may live in peace, free from discrimination and intolerance&rdquo;.  The high level of security cooperation achieved by these meetings has been recognised on all sides.</P>
    <P>Article 4 (b) of the Anglo-Irish Agreement states that it is the declared policy of the United Kingdom Government that responsibility in respect of certain matters within the powers of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland should be devolved within Northern Ireland on <Col N="898" /> a basis which would secure widespread acceptance throughout the community, and also states that the Irish Government support that policy.</P>
    <P>While it remains open to the Irish Government, under Article 4 (c) of the Agreement, to put forward views and proposals on this issue, both Governments recognise that devolution can be achieved only with the cooperation of constitutional representatives within Northern Ireland of both traditions there.  The three-standed talks which took place last year which both Governments wish to see resumed, included one strand devoted to internal relationships within Northern Ireland.  The Government are of the view that his aspect can most fruitfully be addressed in a context which also deals comprehensively with all of the other relationships involved in the problem.</P>
    <P>A possible enhancement of the role of the Anglo-Irish Interparliamentary body is a question for the body itself to consider. The Tánaiste has previously indicated his willingness to consider, in consultation with his British counterpart, any proposals which the body might wish to put forward in this regard.</P>

      <Quest>if he considers the present structure of the Security Council of the United Nations to be satisfactory, particularly with regard to the permanent members which include three European States but no developing country or any country from the Southern Hemisphere; if he intends to bring forward any proposals for reform of the UN; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring):</NameTxt>
      <P>The provisions of the United Nations Charter relating to permanent membership of the Security Council were agreed after World War II. Since the end of the Cold War, a virtual consensus has emerged in support of the view that the new climate in international relations and the many demands being placed on the Organisation require a critical examination of the structures of the United Nations.  It is generally accepted that the United Nations must develop and adapt to current international realities if it is to deal effectively with the many challenges it now has to confront.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Secretary-General's 1992 report entitled &ldquo;Agenda for Peace&rdquo;, which addressed the issues of preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and peacekeeping, was one important response to the changes that have taken place in the international political landscape.  A number of measures of institutional reform have already been proposed and in some <Col N="900" /> instances implemented.  The Secretary-General, for example, has launched a reorganisation of the UN Secretariat and a thorough examination of the role of the General Assembly is in progress.</P>
    <P>Against this background, the question of Security Council reform has become the focus of considerable attention over the past year or so.  More than 40 countries, including Ireland, addressed the issue during the General Assembly debate of last year.  The discussion has been taken up in the Special Committee on the Charter, which met in March, and will continue at the autumn session of the General Assembly.  We support the principle of reform and are an active participant in the debate now underway.</P>
    <P>It is important however to recall that any proposal to alter the existing membership arrangements of the Security Council would require a two-thirds majority in the General Assembly and the support of the five permanent members of the Council.  It is essential therefore that proposals in this area be able to command widespread support if they are to have a realistic prospect of succeeding.</P>
    <P>With that requirement in mind, we have already proposed in the Special Committee on the Charter that the debate should proceed on the basis that the process of reform must aim to ensure that: the Security Council is genuinely representative of the UN membership as a whole; its authority and the legitimatacy, of its decisions are universally respected, and its effectiveness is not impaired.</P>
    <P>In view of the importance of the issue, we will continue to follow the debate closely and to consider more specific proposals at the appropriate time.</P>

It was raised most recently during the Israeli Ambassador's visit to Dublin last month.</P>
      <P>Proposals for the establishment of direct formal communications between individual UNIFIL contingents and Israeli forces operating in South Lebanon would not be in conformity with UN procedures. In accordance with longstanding UN practice, such communications are conducted at the level of UNIFIL Headquarters, located at Naqoura in South Lebanon, and not at battalion level.  The various battalions that comprise UNIFIL operate within an integrated military command structure.  In common with the Irish battalion, they do not maintain direct formal communications with the Israeli forces.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28, 30 and 54 together.</P>
      <P>The Atlantic Coast region of Nicaragua was granted autonomy in 1985 under the Sandinista regime.  Under the Chomorro Government the area was divided into two autonomous regions with a Governor for each.  The Miskito and Suomo indians are largely concentrated in this area; the Miskito spread over both autonomous regions and the Suomo mainly in the north.</P>
      <P>The area has always been poor and suffers from the economic difficulties common to the rest of the country including a very high rate of unemployment. My understanding is that the current Government has been taking steps to build up the area and improve prosperity, particularly through efforts to develop agriculture.  This has led to settlers moving into the area and there have been reports of difficulties between these groups and the indians of the region. However I am not aware of any deliberate programme of discrimination against ethnic groups or any deliberate undermining of the autonomy of the region by the Nicaraguan Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies are aware support for human rights and fundamental freedoms in developing countries as well as popular <Col N="903" /> participation in the development process is an integral part of the development co-operation policies of the Community and its member states.  The Community's Co-operation Agreement with Central America, to which the Nicaraguan Government is a party, and Community assistance towards the reconstruction of Nicaragua are explicitly based on these principles.</P>
    <P>If the Deputies have information concerning specific instances of discrimination by the Government of Nicaragua against ethnic groups in that country I would be prepared to have the matter raised within the Twelve and taken up with the Nicaraguan authorities.</P>

      <P>Arising from a discussion of the scope for North/South economic and social co-operation which took place at a meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference in November 1992, the Conference considered at its meeting on 3 February 1993 a joint paper identifying a number of topics in this field which might usefully be discussed at future meetings.  At its subsequent meeting on 23 March 1993, at which North/South trade and tourism were discussed, the Conference confirmed that arrangements had been made for the discussion of a number of further economic and social topics at forthcoming meetings: Enterprise and Employment; Science and Technology; Arts and Culture; Inland fisheries; Education; Transport; and Agriculture.</P>

      <P>Discussion of a revised management scheme for the regulation of commercial whaling are ongoing in the framework of the International Whaling Commission at present. The next round of talks are scheduled for later this month.  The Government looks forward to a new and satisfactory whaling regime being agreed without delay.  Both Ireland and Norway are members of the International Whaling Commission.  We are fully familiar with each others views as expressed in that forum.</P>
      <P>Concerning the second part of the question, Ireland welcomes the application of Norway to join the Community/Union and looks forward to a successful and speedy conclusion to the negotiations.</P>
      <P>Official negotiations between the Community member states and Norway opened on 5 April.

    <P>The negotiation has begun the process of examining in detail the Community legislation which Norway will adopt on becoming a member of the Community/Union.

In its opinion on Norway's membership of the union, the Commission <Col N="905" /> drew attention to Community legislation on whales and pointed out that the issue of whaling will require to be given careful consideration during the negotiation.  Ireland will be watching the outcome of the examination of the legislation in this area with particular interest.</P>

      <P>As I stated in a written reply of 23 March last, the Government are deeply concerned at the decision of the North Korean Government to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty which we regard as the most important international instrument for countering the spread of nuclear weapons.  The action taken by North Korea threatens to undermine the effectiveness of the Treaty as well as raising serious questions about the intentions of that country with regard to developing nuclear weapons.</P>
      <P>On 7 April last, I issued a statement calling on the North Korean Government to rescind its announcement of withdrawal from the Treaty and supporting the efforts of the International Automic-Energy Agency to implement its nuclear safeguards agreement with North Korea. This has been transmitted to the North Korean authorities.  Moreover, acting on behalf of the European Community and its member states, the Danish Presidency has conveyed the views of the Twelve to North Korea.  The Deputy can be assured that Ireland and its partners in the European Community will continue to impress on the North Korean Government at every opportunity the absolute importance of reversing the very dangerous course which they have taken.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 61 together.</P>
      <P>At my instructions, my officials have raised the instances of non-accompaniment referred to in the Deputy's questions with the British authorities, through the Anglo-Irish Secretariat.</P>
      <P>The Government attach very great importance to the application of the principle that the armed forces &mdash; including the Royal Irish Regiment, which subsumes the former Ulster Defence Regiment &mdash; operate only in support of the civil power in Northern Ireland, with the particular objective, as set out in the Hillsborough communique, &ldquo;of ensuring as rapidly as possible that save in the most exceptional circumstances there is a police presence in all operations which involve direct contact with the community&rdquo;. The Government hold firmly to the objective of ensuring that the principle of accompaniment is seen to be implemented fully in line with the commitment which has been made at the highest level in the Hillsborough communique, and on many occasions subsequently. Anything which falls short of that commitment cannot be regarded as satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The British Government have confirmed that they remain committed to the principle of police accompaniment of Army (including the Royal Irish Regiment) operations which involve direct <Col N="907" /> contact with the community and that it is their intention to maximise levels of accompaniment, particularly in sensitive nationalist areas.  They have pointed to increased levels of police accompaniment on the ground, despite a significantly greater number of military patrols necessitated by increased security threats from paramilitaries.  However, the British Government have indicated also that a number of practical, logistical or resource constraints continue to make it impossible to guarantee a continuous police accompaniment in all areas.</P>
    <P>While I have noted the reported improvement in accompaniment levels, I do not regard the current position as satisfactory and I have directly conveyed through the Anglo-Irish Conference our strong wish to see speedy progress towards the objective of full accompaniment as set out in the Hillsborough Communique.</P>
    <P>I indicated to this House, as recently as 1 April, that it is my intention to continue to press for meaningful, sustained and effective improvements in a number of areas pertaining to the creation of confidence in the security forces among the nationalist community in Northern Ireland.  I referred specifically in this context to the objective of full and effective police accompaniment of British Army patrols and I shall continue to pursure this issue within the frame work of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.</P>

      <P>It will not be necessary to hold another referendum in Ireland since the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty were not revised or amended.  What was agreed at Edinburgh clarified certain aspects of the Treaty in so far as they relate to Denmark but did not modify the Treaty in any way. No question of ratification of changes to the Treaty therefore arises.</P>

      <P>Mr. Hume's decision was taken by him in his capacity as leader of his party.  He has made clear that he was motivated solely by the hope that his actions would advance the cause of peace and lead to a cessation of violence <Col N="910" /> in favour to a general agreement that all political differences relating to the political future of this island can and must be settled exclusively by peaceful, political means.  Mr. Hume is a politician of great integrity and experience whose long record of opposition to violence and commitment to the cause of peace and reconciliation speaks for itself.  I believe he has considered very carefully the issues raised by these contacts and reached his judgment in the light of these objectives.</P>
      <P>In spite of the reluctance of some party leaders to resume dialogue at present (a reluctance which of course predates Mr. Hume's meetings with Mr. Adams), the Government remains committed to the urgent resumption of such dialogue to address comprehensively all of the relationships involved.  There is no logical reason why these talks, which explicitly set out &ldquo;to achieve a new beginning for relationships&rdquo; and to &ldquo;give adequate expression to the totality of relationships&rdquo; should in any way be threatened by an endeavour on anyone's part to persuade those who resort to violence to commit themselves instead to the political process.</P>

      <P>I am conscious of the difficulties caused by closed cross-Border roads, including the particular difficulties associated with the closure of Aghalane bridge.  Because of its importance <Col N="911" /> I have raised the issue of closed roads at each of the meetings of the Anglo-Irish Inter governmental Conference which I have attended since my appointment as Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I have emphasised in particular the negative social and economic impact of closed roads, including the disruption which they cause to the local communities most directly concerned.</P>
      <P>In the light of these discussions both Governments have agreed to keep the situation regarding road closures under close review, taking fully into account the wider social and economic factors as well as the security considerations involved. In this regard I will ensure that all of the factors relevant to the situation at Aghalance, including the impact of the planned reopening of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal, will be fully considered. I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to pursue this issue at future meetings of the Anglo-Irish Conference.</P>
      <P>With regard to the general question of road links between Cavan and Fermanagh I am aware that my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, has recently indicated that provision is being made for the reclassification and improvement of the Belturbet-Swanlinbar road, which has deteriorated due to the increase in traffic resulting from the closure of Aghalane Bridge.  While this may go some way in alleviating the negative impact of the closure of the bridge, I recognise, of course, that the reopening of this and other closed cross-Border roads remains the most desirable solution.</P>

President Tudjman has been informed that the European Community and its member states deplore the fighting between Croats and Muslims.  It was made clear by the EC Presidency at the time of the informal meeting of Foreign Ministers at Hindsgavl that the Community would find it impossible to proceed with negotiations on a Co-operation Agreement with Croatia in such circumstances.

      <P>I am not aware of the transactions to which the Deputy refers.  However, the British Government is one of the depositaries of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which prohibits assistance and encouragement being given to non-nuclear weapons states &mdash; such as South Korea &mdash; to acquire nuclear weapons.  The United Kingdom is also a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group, which controls the export of nuclear materials and dual-use equipment and technology which could be adapted for the development of nuclear weapons.  As these safeguards are in place, I do not consider it appropriate to take this matter up with the British authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 78 and 79 together.</P>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to the scope which the Tánaiste sees for co-operation between North and South in the economic and social sphere in particular.</P>
      <P>A very substantial amount of co-operation is already taking place between North and South.  There is no doubt that enormous potential exists for the expansion of this co-operation over the coming years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Among current cross-Border projects which will bring important future benefits to both parts of this island, I would mention the restoration of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal linking the Shannon <Col N="915" /> and the Erne; the natural gas pipeline which will link Scotland with both parts of Ireland and the project to upgrade the Dublin-Belfast rail link.  The work under way to upgrade the Dublin-Belfast road will also facilitate trade and market accessibility between North and South.</P>
    <P>The process of deepening mutually beneficial co-operation between North and South will continue to be taken forward at intergovernmental level, and under the intensified programmes of co-operation now under way between private sector interests on both sides.</P>
    <P>Beyond the considerable contribution it has made in promoting and developing cross-Border co-operation in recent years, the Anglo-Irish Conference has now mapped out an impressive programme of future work in the economic area.</P>
    <P>At its meeting on 23 March at which North-South trade and tourism were discussed, the conference endorsed a programme of work in those areas for the remainder of the year and agreed that a meeting on cross-Border trade and business co-operation, under the sponsorship of both Governments, should take place in 1993.</P>
    <P>Following discussions at previous meetings of areas offering particular scope for new or expanded co-operation, the conference held on 23 March also confirmed that arrangements had been made for the discussion, with the participation in each case of the responsible Ministers North and South, of the following economic and social topics at forthcoming meetings: Enterprise and Employment; Science and Technology; Arts and Culture; Inland Fisheries; Education; Transport and Agriculture.</P>
    <P>The Irish and British Governments also believe that, in the interests of maximising the benefits to North and South, it is vital that close cross-Border co-operaation is maintained in the European context. Accordingly, we intend to pursue a co-ordinated approach in our respective submissions to the EC Commission in relation to the Structural Funds 1994-1999. To this end, the two administrations <Col N="916" /> have had discussions in regard to developing a joint cross-Border element in both plans.</P>
    <P>There is also continuing co-operation in relation to the joint Ireland/Northern Ireland EC INTERREG programme which runs to the end of 1993.  The two Governments will also co-operate closely in relation to the INTERREG programme which, it is expected, will succeed the present one.</P>
    <P>In line with the lead being given at the level of Government and the official agencies on both sides, the private sectors and the professional, local authority, community, voluntary and other bodies, North and South, are continuing their efforts to increase co-operation between both parts of Ireland.  I welcome, in particular, the valuable work being done under the IBEC/CBI (NI) joint North/South initiative and the growing programmes of co-operation between the Chambers of Commerce on both sides. Moreover, the International Fund for Ireland is continuing to make an important contribution in the business development area through its support for a number of important cross-Border projects.</P>
    <P>In the new context of the achievement of the Single Market and the moves towards economic and monetary union set out in the Maastricht Treaty, enterprises North and South are increasingly conscious of the opportunities for increased business co-operation within the &ldquo;island economy&rdquo; of Ireland and of the advantages to be gained from combining their resources in availing of the new business opportunities at the wider European level.  The Government and its official agencies will continue to give every support to this process.</P>
    <P>As regards the identification of areas where additional co-operation between North and South is realistic and attainable, I would also mention that the Taoiseach, as a stimulus to taking matters forward, had published in June last the Study <i>Ireland in Europe: A Shared Challenge.</i> The study &mdash; copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library &mdash; contains a wealth of detailed recommendations <Col N="917" /> by independent consultants on areas offering opportunities for enhanced co-operation across a range of economic and social sectors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 82 and 83 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the problems arising from the heavy burden of debt carried by many Third World countries.  This is a major issue for the world community and needs to be tackled at global level.  The role which the Government can play is to support the efforts of the main agencies through which this problem is addressed, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.</P>
      <P>Within the European Community, we have also given our support to measures under STABEX, the Commodity Fund set up under the Lomé Conventions, to write-off debts of the poorest ACP countries, several of which are affected by food shortages.</P>
      <P>I am conscious that structural adjustment programmes often entail severe hardship for developing countries.  This is especially so when such programmes coincide with natural disasters like the recent severe drought in Southern Africa.  Ireland's bilateral aid programme which is concentrated on sub-saharan Africa is tackling some of the basic needs of these countries such as health and education. These are areas where some of the adverse effects of structural adjustment programmes can be felt most acutely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="918" /> Through its membership of international financial institutions, Ireland has consistently argued that the poorest sections of society must be protected from the harsh economic and social impact of adjustment programmes.</P>

      <P>VAT returns are not completed in a manner which would enable the yield from particular goods or services to be identified.  From available non-Revenue data, the gain in 1993 from increasing VAT on holiday accommodation, including hotels, guest houses and holiday homes, from 10 per cent of 12.5 per cent is estimated at £5 million.</P>

      <Quest>if, in the light of the speed and scale of interest rate reductions since the 1993 budget was formulated and announced, both in fixed interest rates on gilts and in variable interest rates on the money market, he will give an estimate of the additional savings arising to the Exchequer as a result of the change in interest rates compared to those estimated on budget day.</Quest>

      <P>It is correct to state that domestic interest rates have fallen faster than anticipated at budget time and if the current level of rates persists for the remainder of the year there is a good prospect of savings on the budget provision for debt service. <Col N="922" /> However, the eventual outturn for expenditure on debt service cost will also be influenced by international interest and exchange rate developments and the overall conditions on capital markets. Given the uncertainties which surround these factors it is not possible to state with certainly at this stage of the year that the higher than expected reductions in domestic interest rates will be in fact be reflected in a saving to the Exchequer on the 1993 debt service outturn.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, neither my Department nor the Revenue Commissioners have the necessary statistics to make the estimates sought by the Deputy.  Once the special saving accounts have been in operation for sufficient time we would hope to have more information on which to base an estimate.  Of course, in arriving at this estimate, it would be necessary to take into consideration not only what funds are in special saving accounts made also what assumptions should be made about money moving our of the country about these assumptions would clearly have to change as the rate of tax on special savings accounts approached the standard rate of income tax.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the period of disturbance in financial markets lasted from mid-September 1992 to the end of January 1993, and that special savings accounts have only been available since the beginning of this year.  While it is clear that a significant number of special <Col N="923" /> savings accounts have been opened, the Central Bank has informed me that, as yet, precise statistics for investment in these accounts are not available.  While a better after-tax return on deposits has a positive impact on capital flows, other factors such as market sentiment also affect the flow of funds in and out of the State.  It will not be possible to quantify separately the precise influence of each of these factors on capital flows during January 1993, even when full statistics become available on deposits in special savings accounts.</P>

      <P>The 1993 budget included a figure of £150 million in respect of asset disposals.  On 16 April last, the sale of 55 million shares of the State's shareholding in Irish Life plc realised some £104.5 million.  The Government has also decided to sell the State's remaining shareholding in Greencore plc and in this regard I would refer the Deputy to my press statement of 5 May 1993 a copy of which I propose to include in the Official Report.</P>

    <Title>Written Answers. - Greencore Placing &mdash; Statement of Minister for Finance.</Title>
    <P>At 12 noon on Friday 30 April 1993, I was informed by Davy Stockbrokers that all the shares that I held in Greencore plc <Col N="924" /> had been placed and a public statement to that effect was issued.</P>
    <P>I received the following information on Wednesday 5 May 1993 from Davy Stockbrokers.  The information they gave to me at 12 noon on 30 April was on the basis that by then, they had placed over 17.5 million of the 25 million shares and had a pre-agreed arrangement with a major overseas institution to take up shares in the placing up to a maximum of 10 million shares.  Davys subsequently revised the pre-agreed arrangement to include other purchasers.  On Monday 3 May 1993 Davys sought legal advice in regard to both the original and revised arrangements.  That advice has now been received by Davys and is to the effect that both arrangements give rise to a number of difficulties due to the possibility of Davys and parties connected with them being regarded as having an interest in certain of the placed shares in some circumstances.  This could have led to difficulties in regard to the provisions of the Greencore Articles of Association which restrict holdings to a maximum of 15 per cent.  They were also advised that there was a requirement to make disclosure to the market and to the other places of the situation that had developed.</P>

    <P>
      <i>Notes on Table:</i>
    </P>
    <P>1.  The main components of the Income-Poverty Trap &mdash; the apparent decline in net income as gross income increases &mdash; are the withdrawal rate of Family Income Supplement (60 per cent) and the operation of marginal relief for income tax (involving 48 per cent tax rate).  Both of the measures are designed to achieve desirable objectives in the area of incentives for unemployed persons to take up paid employment and this is the current policy priority.  However, for persons in employment, their operation can give rise to the possibility of an increase in their income being more than offset.</P>
    <P>2.  It is essential in interpreting this table that the mechanism for reviewing Family Income Supplement (FIS) is understood.  FIS is renewable on a 12 monthly basis.  Once awarded it will <i>not</i> be reduced - withdrawn until the end of the period regardless of any upward movements in pay.  Therefore, gross income from employment can increase significantly during the course of a year while any adjustment of FIS will not occur until after the end of the year.  Thus, the FIS withdrawal, represented above as coinciding with gross pay increases does not generally occur.</P>
    <P>3.  The numbers of people potentially effected by this trap are small.  In so far as FIS and marginal relief income tax are the main elements of the trap, the number of people affected by the trap is essentially a function of the numbers who both receive FIS and pay tax.  The numbers of people both paying tax and receiving FIS is of the order of 1,500 to 2,000.  The OECD has also concluded that this trap potentially &ldquo;applied only to a very small proportion of the employee workforce (0.75 per cent)&rdquo;.  On the basis of the OECD assessment this would suggest a maximum number of 5,000 to 6,000 persons <i>potentially</i> affected.</P>
    <P>4.  It should be noted that statistics of income distribution published by the Revenue Commissioners are not a valid measure of the number affected because (a) the data are not desegregated by family size; (b) they include categories such as widows, widowers, single people etc. which are not relevant to the table; (c) the figures are expressed on an annual basis and include people entering employment late in a year, working for short periods or leaving employment early in the year.</P>

    <P>The total figures in the table have been revised slightly since they were previously supplied.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that statistics relating to the number of jobs created each year by the business expansion scheme are not available. However, in late 1990 a general review of the scheme was conducted by my Department in conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners and the Departments of the Marine, Tourism and Transport and Industry and Commerce.  The review identified growth of approximately 4,240 jobs in some 347 companies which had received almost £95 million investment under the scheme at a cost of some £49 million to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The sectoral breakdown of the jobs was as follows:</P>
    <P>3,138 additional jobs were identified in 275 manufacturing and international services companies which had received £36.9 million in BES investment at a tax foregone cost of £20 million approximately and £24.9 million in direct State aid;</P>
    <P>1,000 additional jobs were identified in 63 tourism companies which had received £46.8 million in BES investment at a tax foregone cost of £23.5 million approximately;</P>
    <P>78 additional jobs were identified in four shipping companies which had received £7.7 million in BES investment at a tax foregone cost of £3.9 million approximately;</P>
    <P>28 additional jobs were identified in five special trading houses which had received £3.3 million in BES investment <Col N="932" /> at a tax foregone cost of £1.7 million.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 99 and 100 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The limited data available on employees and earnings in various sectors does not allow precise figures to be given in relation to the matter raised in the question.  It is tentatively estimated that each percentage point reduction in PRSI for the clothing and footwear sector would cost between £1 million and £2 million annually.  Having of employers PRSI for these sectors would cost between £7.5 million and £13 million. Halving of all PRSI (that is both employees' and employers' contributions, and including the health contribution <Col N="933" /> and levies) would cost between £12 million and £21 million.</P>
    <P>Social insurance contributions amount to over £1.5 billion annually, and meet a substantial part of the cost of a wide range of benefits, including pensions, for the workers covered.  Any changes to this system would need to take account of the need for a secure source of funding for social welfare benefits, and the need to ensure that workers concerned retain adequate levels of social insurance cover.</P>

      <P>Female employees who work for contract cleaners are covered for social insurance purposes in the same way as all other employees.  Prior to April, 1991, a considerable number of part-time employees would have been covered for occupational injuries benefits purposes only under PRSI Class J, by virtue of the fact that they would have worked fewer than 18 hours per week.</P>
      <P>In April 1991, I introduced new regulations covering part-time employment. They provide full social insurance cover (PRSI Class A) to all workers, earning £25 or more per week, irrespective of the number of hours worked.  The importance of this change is that such employees now have entitlement to the full range of social insurance benefits and pensions. Those earning under £25 a week are only covered for occupational injuries benefits.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn):</NameTxt>
      <P>Rates of pay, holidays and other conditions of employment of workers employed in contract cleaning in the City and County of Dublin are prescribed in an Employment Regulation Order made by the Labour Court on the basis of proposals from the Joint Labour Committee for Contract Cleaning (City and County of Dublin).  The Order applies to workers, both male and female, employed in contract cleaning who are engaged in the cleaning of the interior of offices, shops, hospitals, factories, stores and other similar establishments. I have arranged with my office to furnish a copy of the Order to the Deputy and to the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>The conditions of employment of employees in the contract cleaning industry who are not covered by the Employment Regulation Order are a matter for negotiation between employers and workers or a trade union acting on their behalf.  Such employees would, however, have the same statutory entitlements under protective labour legislation, including holiday entitlements, as employees in other industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Holidays (Employees) Act, 1973, provides a minimum, legally enforceable entitlement to 3 weeks annual holidays where the employee has worked 1,400 hours in the leave year.  An employee who has not worked the required number of hours is entitled to annual leave at the rate of ¼ of a week for each calendar month in which 120 hours were worked. <Col N="936" /> The Act also provides an entitlement to 9 public holidays.</P>
    <P>The Worker Protection (Regular Part-Time Employees) Act, 1991 extended holiday entitlement, on a modified basis, to employees who have been in the continuous employment of the same employer for not less than 13 weeks and who are normally expected to work not less than 8 hours per week.  Such employees are classified as regular part-time employees and are entitled to annual leave at the rate of 6 hours per 100 worked and proportionately less where fewer hours are worked.  They are also entitled to public holidays on the same basis as full-time employees.</P>
    <P>The 1991 Act also extended to regular part-time employees, a large number of whom are women employed in the services sector, the benefits of the legislation relating to unfair dismissals, minimum notice and terms of employment, redundancy payments, insolvency protection, worker participation and maternity leave.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of protective clothing, the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989 requires an employer, in circumstances where it is not practicable to control or eliminate hazards in a place of work, to provide and have maintained suitable protective clothing or necessary equipment to ensure the safety and health at work of the employee.  In addition, under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application) Regulations, 1993, which came into effect in February 1993, personal protective equipment, including protective clothing, must be provided free of charge by the employer and must be used by the employee in circumstances where it is not practicable to control or eliminate hazards in a place of work.</P>

      <P>Rate support grant paid to <Col N="938" /> Kildare County Council in 1978 amounted to £1,685,902 of which £1,088,075 related to domestic rates reliefs.

The total number of housing units on the valuation of which domestic rates relief was recouped to Kildare County Council in 1978 was 21,500; this has not been a factor in relation to the amount of the grant since 1983.</P>
      <P>The rate support grant paid to local authorities replaces in part the income from rates previously applicable to domestic dwellings and agricultural land as well as the former Bounty-in-lieu of rates on Government property.  The amounts of the grant have been adjusted arising from a variety of factors affecting local finances over the years, including the abolition of certain levies and the termination of liability for certain local loans fund repayments.</P>

    <P>The causes of suicide are complex. Changes in the cohesiveness of society, depression, an erosion of traditional values, lack of employment opportunities and social isolation are all factors which can contribute to individual distress.  In response to the problem of suicide the health services provide support to those immediately identifiable as distressed.</P>
    <P>Research into issues such as suicide is primarily a matter for the Health Research Board and that body has carried out a number of studies in this area. This research has tended to concentrate on suicide rates and on the accuracy of reporting systems.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may also wish to note that the Green Paper on Mental Health discusses issues relevant to suicide and attempted suicide.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the day to day running costs of primary and secondary schools are funded by means of the capitation grant scheme and the contribution from local sources.</P>
      <P>It is open to school authorities and parents to raise additional income for schools to supplement the State grants for the provision of equipment and for general running costs.  Contributions of this nature should be voluntary on the part of parents and there can be no question of a levy being imposed by the schools.</P>
      <P>The capitation grant for primary schools is not intended to meet the operating costs in full.  A local contribution equivalent to 25 per cent of the capitation grant must be lodged annually to each school bank account.  This contribution must be provided by the parish or other analogous community or body, and there should be no levy on parents of pupils attending the school.</P>
      <P>In order to improve the level of support to primary schools I secured an increase of £3.4 million in the 1993 provision for capitation grants.  This will enable me to increase the standard rate of grant from £28 to £33 per pupil with <i>pro-rata</i> increases for certain other categories of school, and to initiate further measures to assist those who are most disadvantaged. This is the largest single increase in the level of this grant.</P>
      <P>A study of recurrent costs, excluding teachers' pay, for first and second-level schools, is under way to identify a cost per pupil at primary and post-primary level.  The future financing of such schools will be reviewed in the light of the study's findings and available resources.</P>

      <P>Under the rules of the Primary School Transport Scheme, there must be a sufficient number of children in a distinct locality attending their nearest suitable national school, to ensure that the average daily number of eligible children conveyed each term is not less than ten, in order to warrant the establishment, or retention, of a transport service to a national school.  A transport service may also be established, if it can be done within reasonable cost limits, where at least five eligible children from a distinct locality reside at least three miles from the school.</P>
      <P>The service to which the Deputy refers was established under the normal conditions of the Primary School Transport Scheme.  However, Bus Éireann informed my Department, as it is obliged to do, that, during the Christmas and Easter terms, the number had dropped to six.  The chairperson of the Board of Mangement of Clonkeen national school was advised in December 1992, and again in March 1993, that the service would have to be withdrawn at the end of the Easter term.</P>
      <P>My Department would have been prepared to retain the service had the average number of eligible pupils risen sufficiently in the meantime to warrant its retention.  That did not happen.</P>
      <P>The two children to whom the Deputy refers are not eligible for transport to the school in question.  They live closer to another national school in the area.</P>
