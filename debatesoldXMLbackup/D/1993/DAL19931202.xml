      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 7, 9, 14 and 2.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders that (1) business shall be interrupted not later than 4.45 p.m.; (2) Nos. 7 and 9 shall be decided without debate and if a division is demanded on No. 7 it will be taken forthwith; (3) the proceedings on Second Stage of No. 14 if not previously concluded shall be brought to a conclusion at 4.45 p.m. today.</P>

      <P>In relation to item No. 7, having been rather critical last night of the Minister for Finance, today I pay him a compliment on how assiduous he has been in the Estimates in presenting, but not for debate, an Estimate for £10 of excess expenditure in the State Laboratory. The Minister's thoroughness is very commendable.</P>

      <P>As this is the last opportunity in the House before the Taoiseach <Col N="1314" /> undertakes the start of the process tomorrow, I wish him well.  Last night on television the Taoiseach said that the declaration he was looking for was self-determination, but with consent both North and South.  He then went on to say &mdash; and this concerns the legislative intentions of the Government &mdash; that the issue of amending our Constitution was entirely separate.  I cannot quite understand that because consent on the part of the North requires a change in our Constitution to underpin it.  Why, therefore, is the Taoiseach saying that constitutional change is entirely separate from the peace process as it is totally linked with the self-determination concept he is putting forward?</P>

      <P>Matters appertaining to Northern Ireland have been debated extensively in this House in a variety of ways and it is not appropriate to raise them on the Order of Business.

      <P>Without striking a sour note, I wish to indicate that I was disappointed that the Taoiseach refused to answer a specific question of mine yesterday and then went on to answer it to a journalist on RTE television.  That is insulting to this House and it is not good enough.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>During the debate last night I reiterated my opposition to the cruel and barbaric sport of hare coursing. However, that does not prevent me from recognising the validity and potential of the greyhound industry, which is a nice little earner for the economy.  It should be developed, but unfortunately in recent years there has been a definite downturn in the industry, which was at its height in 1970.  It is difficult to establish a specific reason for its decrease in popularity, but the variety of other sporting activities available to people and the lack of money in peoples' pockets are probably the main reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should foster and support the greyhound industry but I would draw the line at the barbaric activity of promoting coursing.  I want to express my objection to and scepticism about, the measures introduced at the behest of the Irish Coursing Club, who successfully lobbied a large number of Deputies from all sides of the House.  Statistics clearly highlight that the majority of people are revolted <Col N="1319" /> by the cruelty endemic in hare coursing. Many people are ashamed that we continue to turn a blind eye to that barbaric sport.  The majority of Deputies in this House have no experience of coursing, although I understand the Minister has a genuine interest in dog racing.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, some years ago I indulged in the awful sport of coursing and was so sickened by it that I put my dogs to sleep and never went back to witness the sport again.  Anybody who owns a small dog would not like to see it savaged by a rottweiler.  A small timid animal such as hare is a flesh and blood creature and feels similar pain to that of a dog who might be attacked by a savage rottweiler or mastiff.  That is why I fail to understand the indifference in this Chamber to the suffering of a little hare.</P>
    <P>The Irish Coursing Club obviously fed propaganda to Deputies.  Many justifications for the sport were given yesterday, such as the employment prospects.  If we built a munitions factory we could supply the terrorists of the world with ammunition and that would create employment, but would that justify the building of such a factory?  We are concerned about cruelty to animals. There are many laws in place to which we turn a blind eye, but if a dog or cat is cruelly mistreated those who inflict the suffering can be charged and sent to jail. Yet we turn a blind eye to the cruelty inflicted on a little defenceless creature such as a hare.  Deputy Gregory gave evidence that at a coursing meeting which took place some time ago hares drowned themselves in a desperate desire to escape from the jaws of death.  During the previous debate on this subject I stated that I witnessed small hares dying from heart attacks when hotly pursued by greyhounds.  The screech of a dying hare is terrifying, it is similar to a child crying.  I fail to understand how people can justify such ill-treatment of a hare, one of the most timid of animals.</P>
    <P>In court yesterday evidence was given about a rabbit having his back legs tied with baler twine by a top internationally rated trainer.  That is only the tip of the <Col N="1320" /> iceberg.  The Minister is well aware that dogs are given a taste of blood to make them run faster and win the race.  That is happening in every county.  It is appalling. In some cases cats are used if a rabbit or hare is not available and we in this Chamber are turning a blind eye to such cruelty.  Recently this House legalised the most obnoxious act in the world, that of homosexuality, but we are turning a blind eye to the suffering of timid animals. Such contradictions do not do our country any service.</P>
    <P>I am totally opposed to coursing in its present form.  I am not opposed to drag coursing, the successful adaptation that is used in Australia, where no cruelty is involved.  I do not want to see the Irish Coursing Industry totally destroyed and, some time in the future, public opinion here will force the ICC to look at the <i>modus operandi</i> in Australia, and the sooner the better.</P>
    <P>As to the Minister's proposal to nominate six people, I hope they will not be from the showbands, and that they will not be party hacks but will have a genuine background and interest in the greyhound industry.  I support the notion of coursing on Sundays, but I draw the line at holding meetings on Good Friday and Christmas Day.  There must be some standards, and I hope that will be upheld.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this important Bill.  For too long the greyhound industry has not been given the attention it merits. At present we are setting up a national plan for our economy with the twin aims of job preservation and job creation.  This Bill is especially welcome in that it addresses those objectives in the context of the greyhound industry.  The greyhound industry is small in terms of the Irish economy, but its smallness is entirely disproportionate to its potential which is considerable; there are 10,000 people engaged in this industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like the horse, the Irish greyhound is recognised world-wide as an animal of spirit and excellence.  Both the bloodstock and greyhound industries are an integral part of the fabric of rural Ireland. To urban Ireland this may seem fanciful, <Col N="1321" /> but it is part of what we are.  It is a deeply-rooted cultural pursuit.  To those families actively engaged in breeding and training dogs and horses and to followers of those sports this is not merely business or pleasure but an active part of their heritage. That is the historical context of the Irish greyhound industry and should not be forgotten.</P>
    <P>This Bill could be seen partly as a response to Deputy Gregory's Wildlife Bill.  That short-sighted Bill sought, with the zeal of the puritan, to throw out the baby with the bath water.  Although the Bill had many shortcomings, Deputy Gregory performed a most useful service by focusing the spotlight on the greyhound industry.  Reading the debate on his Bill, I was struck by how hysterical it was at times.  I hope this debate will be an altogether more calm affair, more in tune with reality.</P>
    <P>The aspect of this Bill which will attract most public attention is section 3.  This allows the Minister to make regulations for the muzzling of greyhounds at coursing meetings and, further, for the provision of veterinary inspection of all animals involved.  A penalty of £1,000 is provided for and I hope it will be rigorously applied.</P>
    <P>I favour the muzzling of greyhounds and deplore cruelty to animals.  Coursing with muzzled greyhounds is a great deal more humane than shooting, fishing or fox hunting.  It is certainly more humane than the ways in which the lives of most hares are brought to an end anyway. Romantic notions of animal life in the wild are unfounded.  However, I support the humane treatment of animals and I believe this Bill goes a long way to ensuring it.</P>
    <P>Coursing is an important and integral part of the greyhound industry.  It helps to develop the industry in a most productive manner.  It has helped to enhance the ability of greyhounds on the track.  It should be noted that American and Australian breeders are importing Irish greyhounds with coursing bloodlines to rejuvenate the chasing instincts of their existing bloodlines.  It is felt by these breeders that their hounds' chasing <Col N="1322" /> instincts have suffered since the outlawing of coursing in those countries.  It should also be noted that coursing bloodlines were present in the pedigree of 77 per cent of winners of major track events in England and Ireland in the past ten years.  That is an excellent record.</P>
    <P>Provision for veterinary inspection is also provided and I especially welcome that.  We must sincerely hope that these regulations, taken together, will greatly improve the image of coursing.  The Irish Coursing Club has done much to regulate itself but the public perception is that that is not sufficient.  I attach no blame to successive generations who have been involved in the management of the board.  As politicians we must acknowledge that if the greyhound industry is to develop the necessary action must be taken.</P>
    <P>In the recent past Bord na gCon's problems have been compounded by the fact that they are operating in an internationally depressed environment.  For the year 1991, the last year for which the board has published an annual report, key figures are down.  Betting with bookmakers and on the tote declined to £33.6 million in 1991 compared with £35.6 million in 1990.  There was a decline of 6.05 per cent in bets placed with bookmakers. In the case of the tote the figure for 1991 was £6.75 million, a decline of 4.05 per cent.  In comparison it must be observed that betting at greyhound tracks fared much better than at horse races where bookmaker betting declined by 18 per cent in 1991 compared with 1990.  Greyhound racing internationally fared much worse than in Ireland.  In the United States tracks reports a 12 per cent decline in turnover while attendances in the United Kingdom dropped by 9.6 per cent with a 10.9 per cent increase in tote turnover. In Ireland betting was down in 1991, as was attendance, by almost 3 per cent compared with the previous year. This is against a background of increased prize money and sponsorship.  Prize money increased by 4.3 per cent.  The total purse in Irish greyhound racing of £2,098,423 was an all-time record in greyhound sponsorship history which <Col N="1323" /> increased by 3.5 per cent in 1991 and represented a 27.9 per cent of total prize money payout.</P>
    <P>The underlying problem is under-funding and funding is vital if this sector is to achieve its potential.  Historically the industry was funded by a share of the tax on on-course betting.  This proved inadequate.  In 1990 the historic decision was taken that the industry would, for the first time, have a share of tax on off-course betting.  This business amounts to some £300 million a year.  In 1990 half a million pounds went to greyhound racing, £3 million went to horse racing and in 1991 the amount for greyhound racing was increased to £750,000.  The Department of Finance takes in about £30 million each year in taxes on betting on horses and dogs.  We must recognise the need to invest in and develop the business.</P>
    <P>Bord na gCon is responsible for 18 centres and the managements of many of these dog tracks are crying out for development which is necessary if the industry is to survive and become more profitable. In the long term we must dispel the penny wise attitude as this makes neither financial nor economic sense.  We should bear in mind that Ireland is the leading exporter of greyhounds.  Our exports business is worth £40 million a year and has enormous potential.  This must be tapped now.</P>
    <P>There is one other noteworthy aspect of the greyhound industry: it is drug free. Bord na gCon has its own drug testing centre.  As we are primarily involved in the breeding of greyhounds the board recognises that every greyhound in every major race is a potential breeding animal. Accordingly, every runner is tested.  In addition, there is random testing at less important race meetings.  The results are to the credit of all those involved in the industry.</P>
    <P>I call on Dáil Éireann to see what the future holds for the greyhound industry in an Irish and European context.  We must urgently examine the question of funding for Bord na gCon.  By under-supporting <Col N="1324" /> the greyhound business we are, in effect, depleting a vital national asset.  The effects of this are felt in rural Ireland where up to 6,000 small holders and others are actively involved in the industry.</P>
    <P>My fellow county man and chief executive of Kerry Foods, Mr. Denis Brosnan, who is also a member of the Racing Board, was quoted recently in the <i>Irish Field</i> as saying that success in business equates with strategy multiplied by capability mulitiplied by capital.  We need a viable plan if we are to secure sustained growth in the greyhound industry.</P>
    <P>At European level the Government and the European Union have formally agreed that the breeding of greyhounds should be regarded as an alternative enterprise.  Like any rural Deputy and as a former owner of greyhounds, on the coursing field and tracks, I am aware of the appalling problems associated with depopulation.  An entire range of agribusinesses is needed to sustain populations which may otherwise disappear. The breeding of greyhounds has the potential to be one such project.  We provide subsidies for products for which there is no demand, yet the greyhound industry which is a profitable and sustainable business remains unaided.  What is the reason, for example, we cannot introduce a headage payments scheme for greyhounds of a certain standard and class?  I have been advocating this for some time.  It is time that the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, in conjunction with the Department of Finance, looked at the industry in a positive light.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, on introducing this legislation which is timely, appropriate and badly needed.  It is my hope that it forms only one aspect of a broad and far-reaching plan for the greyhound industry.  I also compliment him and the Minister for proposing that the ban on greyhound racing on Sundays, Good Friday and Christmas Day should be removed.  I wish to share my time with Deputy Kirk.</P>

      <P>I am sorry if there was any misunderstanding.  I thank Members across the floor for their co-operation in this matter.  This Bill provides us with an opportunity to have a comprehensive debate on the greyhound industry which is long established and has considerable potential.  In recent times, however, the industry and hare coursing in particular, have been the subject of controversy and criticism.  Most people who have the future prosperity of the industry at heart will recognise that this criticism has impacted on the image of the industry. I sincerely hope that the provisions of this Bill will repair the damage caused, particularly to hare coursing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The coursing fraternity clearly accepts that there is a need for muzzling at coursing meetings.  It appears that the Minister's request that greyhounds be muzzled is being observed.  Yesterday a number of speakers dwelt at some length on the ongoing need for research and development into different types of <Col N="1326" /> muzzle.  It will be some time before the perfect product is available.  Several types are being used with considerable success. I hope this will allay the fears of those who have been critical of what has been happening at coursing meetings.</P>
    <P>On the question of the rearing and breeding of greyhounds, I think everyone accepts that this forms an integral part of rural culture.  Anyone who reads the speech by the Minister of State yesterday will readily appreciate that it is of significance to small holders and rural dwellers. Many were surprised by the statistics he quoted and to learn that so many people were involved in the industry in rural and urban areas.  It provides many small holders with an opportunity to top up their income.  This ensures that their holdings remain viable.</P>
    <P>By its nature, the industry is export oriented and its value to the economy cannot be under-estimated.  The figure of £40 million is significant.  However, there is an urgent need for investment in facilities across the country.  Track meetings are in direct competition with other social activities.  Between 1975 and 1992 there was a decrease in attendances at race meetings.  That is a pity.  If the managements of our greyhound stadia are to attract people, investment in facilities will be necessary to upgrade them.</P>
    <P>When I was in the Department of Agriculture, Food, and Forestry, I had regular contact with people in the industry and I know there is a great need for an investment programme.  Bord na gCon has a five year investment programme but, for any programme to be successful, adequate resources must be provided. The Department is considering the introduction of the Leader development programme, Mark II.  In that context I hope the greyhound industry will be considered with a view to its benefiting from the programme and the industry being developed at every level, not alone in the breeding and rearing of dogs, but in regard to customer comforts.  The latter is an important aspect in achieving wider participation in the industry and increased attendance at greyhound meetings. <Col N="1327" /> The industry has much potential which would be worth developing.</P>

      <P>This Bill is unsatisfactory. It is a dismal response to the problems of the greyhound industry.  This is disappointing, if not incomprehensible, considering that the Minister is aware, and has admitted, that the industry is in a poor state.  Unfortunately, he has wasted this valuable opportunity to present a proper and comprehensive response to the problems of the greyhound industry.</P>
      <P>It is crystal clear from the Minister's speech that his main ambition was to introduce legislation that would be uncontroversial.  That is an alarming approach for a Minister to adopt.  It displays a pitiful lack of courage confronting the problems within the greyhound industry.  In saying that the legislation is uncontroversial I take it the Minister is appealing to Members to understand that he cannot deal yet with all the problems he knows exist.  It is unfortunate that the Minister said this legislation is uncontroversial because it pinpoints clearly that, even in his view, it does not tackle all the problems within the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come from south Tipperary where the greyhound industry can be regarded as one of our indigenous industries.  I agree with Deputy Dukes that the Minister is misguided in saying that greyhounds are an alternative farm enterprise.  Deputy Dukes rightly disputed that claim and said that the majority of those involved in the industry are involved because they enjoy that activity as they enjoy other rural pursuits. We do not see many of those involved with greyhounds becoming millionaires. They are involved in the industry because they love the sport and the animals. However, those who keep greyhounds do not make substantial amounts of money <Col N="1328" /> from their enterprise.  Those of us who live among those involved in the industry know it is a family undertaking in which children are as passionately involved as their parents.  As a previous speaker said, the greyhound industry is part of our rural culture.</P>
    <P>I welcome the many improvements in coursing in recent times.  Speaking previously in this House, I stated that those involved in coursing were as interested and as concerned in improving the reputation of the sport as Members are in this House.  I said they were responsible people and that I knew many of them personally.  In recent months their commitment has been obvious in terms of the time, dedication and sense of urgency they have given to bringing about many changes in the industry.  These changes are welcome.  The dismal reputation of the coursing industry was shameful but we must recognise that those involved have made great improvements and deserve credit for that.</P>
    <P>From speaking with those involved in coursing, I am aware that they are satisfied that the muzzling experiment is working well.  Thankfully, very few hares are killed now during coursing meetings. The percentage of hares killed has reduced to nearly 1 per cent.  The change in regard to muzzling was necessary.  I am pleased the experiment is working well and that it has been undertaken in a sincere and passionate way by those involved in the industry.  Those people made many other changes, too, in an effort to improve the reputation of coursing. There is strict scrutiny at all coursing meetings and new regulations have been introduced to reduce from 88 to 72 the number of courses that may be run in any day.  There is provision, too, for a veterinary inspection to be carried out prior to and during coursing meetings and the industry has employed a number of experts in hare husbandry to call to clubs and advise members on such matters as feeding, medical conditions, hare paddocks and what should be done to ensure that the hares are healthy and well looked after.  I congratulate the ICC on the good work it carries out.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1329" /> At present muzzles are used at semifinals and finals only but I look forward to the day when, following the enactment of this Bill, that practice will be compulsory at all coursing meetings.  The ICC agree with this provision in the Bill and I welcome its support in that regard.  It has undertaken also to supply medication for the treatment of diseases common to hares.  The improvements to which I have referred prove the point I made during the previous debate on coursing in this House &mdash; that the ICC are anxious to ensure that hare coursing has a good reputation.  The club has undertaken a study into the type of muzzles used. Initially light leather muzzles were used, but they were found to affect the breathing of the greyhounds.  Plastic muzzles are used now and they are found to be satisfactory.  This proves that every effort is being made by the ICC to ensure that hares are not killed during coursing.</P>
    <P>I welcome the section of the Bill which extends greyhound racing to Sundays. This provides the industry with the same advantage as is enjoyed by groups involved in other leisure pursuits.</P>
    <P>We must recognise that families are interested in hare coursing and in the greyhound industry.  Any sport which a family can enjoy together is welcome. With the advent of Sunday coursing that will be possible so far as that sport is concerned.</P>
    <P>I have grave objections to the section of the Bill which deals with representation on Bord na gCon.  I object to it mainly for two reasons.  First, guaranteed representation on the board by members of the ICC has been excluded. Secondly, the Minister has not made any attempt to ensure that women are represented on Bord na gCon.  Greyhound racing is a leisure pursuit in which women not only participate but have been very successful.  We know from the Programme for a Partnership Government that the Government is committed to giving women a 40 per cent representation on State boards.  I am tired of Ministers talking of aspirations.  When will they have the courage to put those aspirations into practice?  The Minister <Col N="1330" /> had an opportunity in this Bill to include a section that would provide for at least two of the six members of the board being women.  Such a provision should be included on Committee Stage.  I know of women in my constituency who have been successful in this industry.  Mrs. Ann Heffernan and her family, for example, have had a long tradition of success and have given great commitment to the industry.  In case I am accused of being parochial, I should mention that women such as Mary Nolan and Marie Field are noted for their contribution to the industry. If the Minister fails to make provision for the appointment of two women to Bord na gCon, we must question the Government's commitment to the 40 per cent representation of women on State boards.  I plead with the Minister to include that provision in this instance.  It should be only a simple matter for him, but it is very important to those who are committed to equal representation, to ensuring that people who would be valuable members of a board be represented on that board.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why the Minister has excluded guaranteed membership to members of the ICC.  To date its members have proved excellent.  They have acted impartially and have represented not only the interests of coursing clubs but of the greyhound industry generally. The failure to give them guaranteed membership in this instance is a slur on their reputation given the efforts they have put into Bord na gCon in the past. There is no justification for excluding them.  Why treat Bord na gCon differently from the Irish racing authority on whose board the Irish Coursing Club is represented?  There is a total contradiction in the approach of the Government to the horse racing industry and the greyhounds racing industry.  Why is there one set of rules for the horse racing board and different rules for the greyhound board?</P>
    <P>The Irish Coursing Club represents not only coursing clubs but also owners and breeders.  It also operates greyhound racing in the Six Counties.  In recognition of the active and important role it plays <Col N="1331" /> in that industry the Irish Coursing Club should be represented on the board of Bord na gCon.  The Minister should seriously consider this matter.  I have serious reservations about representation on Bord na gCon.  If we want to bring about the many changes required in coursing and ensure it has a reputation of which we can be proud, surely the Irish Coursing Club must be represented on Bord na gCon.</P>
    <P>I look forward to a favourable response from the Minister in regard to the changes I have suggested which are necessary to improve the Bill.  I look forward to membership of women on the board and also on the Irish Coursing Club.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">

      <P>This Bill is being introduced as part of the wider review of the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958.  It would have been wiser to carry out the review first and then introduce a Bill to address the overall problem.  I am concerned that this Bill has been introduced in reaction to a sequence of events in recent times and that it may need further modification when the wider review is completed.  In recent times this industry has suffered from bad publicity and this Bill may drive a wedge between the Irish Coursing Club and Bord na gCon.  It is unfortunate that the Irish Coursing Club, which was previously represented on the board of Bord na gCon, will not now have the privilege of having three executive members on that board.  That may lead to a polarisation of the greyhound industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the recent contentious matters appertaining to the greyhound industry, that industry is trying to get its act together.  The greyhound industry is worth about £40 million to the country. A 1990 survey revealed that the coursing industry alone is worth more than £14 million.  Therefore, it is a significant industry.  The Minister and I were guests at the recent Irish St. Leger in Limerick which was very enjoyable.  The Blue Riband meeting in Limerick attracts a huge crowd and everybody seems to enjoy themselves.  From talking to executives of Bord na gCon, it appears they <Col N="1332" /> would like to see further improvements in the track in Limerick and indeed in other tracks around the country to attract more people and make the events a family occasion.  At present there are severe restrictions on finance for this purpose. That matter should be considered more favourably in future.  Much emphasis is placed, and rightly so, on the horse industry but the greyhound industry, due to lack of finance, has been the poor relation and that should be rectified.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is well aware, coursing has been held in my county for a long time.  More coursing meetings are held in Limerick county &mdash; in Glin, Newcastle West where I live, Abbeyfeale, Rathkeale, Kilmallock, Galbally and Clounanna &mdash; than in any other county.  The greyhound industry is a great source of entertainment for many people in the community.  In recent times people in the industry have been concerned, particularly about the bad publicity following the unfortunate incidents that took place in Clounanna, and the fact that this matter is being addressed in the Bill is welcome.  Prior to the introduction of the Bill the Irish Coursing Club, on its own initiative, tried to introduce changes, particularly in regard to muzzling, to deal with this problem which was an embarrassment to the industry.  I hope the modifications proposed in the Bill will be successful and will improve the industry.</P>
    <P>Statistics show that finances from the greyhound industry, particularly on the tote, have fallen considerably.  The industry should be made more attractive and positive incentives are needed to ensure its future success.  One stimulus to the coursing industry would be the introduction of coursing meetings on Sundays, as proposed in this Bill &mdash; the view has been expressed that they should be held on Christmas Day also.  This move would be welcome because in many cases meetings are held over two days and Saturday-Sunday meetings would attract larger attendances.</P>
    <P>A large number of women are interested in coursing and regularly attend meetings with their husbands. Therefore, it is important that women be <Col N="1333" /> represented on the new board of Bord na gCon.  I have been criticised at times, even by some of my colleagues within Fine Gael, in regard to the 40 per cent female representation rule on boards. This matter was raised in a recent debate here by the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, who said that heads would have to be knocked together to ensure that women are appointed to various bodies.  In this case the Minister, who will make the appointments to the board, has an opportunity to appoint women.  There is no point in talking about 40 per cent women membership and asking private bodies to ensure a gender balance if we do not give the lead.  The Minister has an opportunity in this legislation to give the lead and I support my colleague, Deputy Ahearn, in that regard.  In her capacity as chairperson of the women's affairs group she is very concerned about this matter.  The Minister should consider this question when making the appointment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> I am grateful for the opportunity to support the Bill.</P>
      <P>I refer to the comments by the two previous speakers about the need to ensure that women are represented on the board of Bord na gCon.  I do not think they have cause for concern in this regard.  One has only to look at the recent appointments to the commission dealing with people with a disability and the Independent Radio and Television Commission to see that Deputy Ahearn's aspirations are being put into practice.  I have no doubt that women will be represented on the board of Bord na gCon, which comes under the jurisdiction of the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Brian O'Shea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned about the remarks that the Bill is unsatisfactory and will not deal with the wider needs of the greyhound industry.  I do not recall either the Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, or the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Walsh, claiming during the debate on the Wildlife Bill earlier this <Col N="1334" /> year, or this debate, that this Bill will meet all the needs of the greyhound industry.  Both the Minister and the Minister of State have said that further legislation dealing with the wider needs of the greyhound industry will be introduced in the House next year.  The completion of a review should not impede us at this stage in addressing the very important issue of the killing of hares at coursing meetings.  If we try to long finger this issue by saying it is tied up with the review of the entire greyhound industry we will be totally disregarding the concerns which have been expressed by many people outside this House.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has taken immediate action to deal with this issue in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy Ahearn's suggestion that the Minister is showing a lack of courage.  I do not see how that charge can stand up.  Members of Deputy Ahearn's party held the Agriculture brief on a number of occasions over the past 20 years and none of them showed the courage displayed by the current incumbent of the office in addressing this issue. This Bill is timely.  I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Brian O'Shea, who has responsibility for the greyhound industry, for the speed and diligence with which he has applied himself to the task of improving the greyhound industry in its totality and eliminating the killing of live hares at coursing meetings, an issue which has caused much concern and disgust both in Ireland and other countries.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Gregory's Wildlife Bill was debated in the House earlier this year the Minister of State referred to the many technical defects in it, which could if implemented, have resulted in making the situation in regard to live hare coursing worse rather than better.  On many occasions through the years Private Members' Bills which may have much merit have been sidelined by various Governments with a promise of Government legislation, which very often was not introduced.  I am happy that the Minister of State has not allowed this to happen on this occasion and has tackled the problem.  Last Tuesday we saw ano-there <Col N="1335" /> examples of the Government's willingness to tackle issues when it accepted Deputy Shatter's Private Members' Bill. I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, on the speed with which he has dealt with this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister is to be commended on his approach, which was outlined by him during the debate on the Wildlife Bill earlier this year.  He stated:</P>
    <P>I have at all times been open to and anxious to hear the views from all sides of the industry, including views on coursing.</P>
    <P>I consider that the question of hare coursing must be handled sensibly if it is not to become a significant source of conflict and division in our society. There are many lines of division to this issue.  It is not, as some people suggest, a simple division between town and country, although there are elements of this in the debate, and there is a strong lobby in rural areas in favour of coursing.  It is not between animal lovers and animal haters... The divide seems to me to be placed more accurately between the extreme views which are taken at the margins at both sides of this issue and both sides are attempting to attract the middle ground in this issue through intensive lobbying and media attention.</P>
    <P>In conclusion he stated:</P>
    <P>A clearer approach to the problem would be to identify the specific element of the activity which it is sought to prohibit and then to proceed by legislation to prohibit that activity. Otherwise there is a serious risk of the measure resulting in unforeseen and unintended effects.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on the way he has listened to the arguments on all sides of this debate.  He has formulated a set of proposals which I believe will meet the needs of most of those who are concerned about animal welfare and those who are concerned about the greyhound industry. I also wish to acknowledge Deputy Gregory's work in this regard.  I am sorry <Col N="1336" /> he did not see fit to allow his Bill to proceed for further work by the Government. I am sorry that Deputy Gregory, who highlighted the issues, cannot accept the Minister's proposals which I believe will succeed in tackling the problem.</P>
    <P>No doubt there will be some people on both sides of the argument who will not be happy with this Bill.  However, we cannot allow ourselves to be influenced by extremists in any argument.  We have to look at both sides and try to formulate a commonsense approach which can be put into practice.  The approach outlined in the Bill is feasible, practical and, most importantly, it can be implemented.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned with the aspects of the Bill relating to the welfare of hares used at coursing meetings.  I think all people who claim to be interested in animal welfare will agree that significant steps are being taken in the Bill to improve the situation in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Bill will not only give the Minister power to make regulations providing for the muzzling of greyhounds participating in events, but will also allow him to make regulations providing for veterinary inspection of coursing meetings and of the animals taking part in such meetings. This represents a significant strengthening of the Minister's powers in this area.  The Bill provides for the supervision by vets of hares coursed in events prior to being run, during the event and after the event.  This will eliminate the appalling practice of hares being repeatedly coursed, a practice which has taken place at many meetings.</P>
    <P>The Bill will allow vets to prohibit the coursing of hares if they are not considered fit to be coursed in the first instance.  It will also give them powers to prevent either dogs of hares being used in coursing meetings if they are not considered suitable for the purpose.  The Bill will put in place a wide range of animal welfare regulations.  The most important provision in the Bill is the one dealing with the muzzling of greyhounds, which will eliminate the killing of hares at meetings. This will prevent a recurrence of the dreadful scenes at many coursing meetings, <Col N="1337" /> including the meetting at Clounanna earlier this year to which Deputy Finucane referred.</P>
    <P>Some people will argue that the Bill does not go far enough and that we should ban the coursing of hares altogether. Many Deputies have already made this point.  I believe that view is short-sighted and impractical.  The Oireachtas should never enact laws which cannot be implemented in practice.  If we simply try to ban coursing outright by way of legislation it will end up in the same fringe or shady area as dog fighting and cock fighting.  Both these practices are banned but, as we all know, they take place.  It would be much more difficult to ban coursing, which is much more widespread, than either of those two objectionable practices.</P>
    <P>Another reason coursing cannot simply be banned by way of edict or legislation is that it is tied up with the entire greyhound industry which plays a very important part in the lives of ordinary people, particularly those in rural Ireland.  It is often said that dog racing is the ordinary person's version of horse racing.  Many ordinary people of limited means can take part in the breeding of greyhounds and become involved in the greyhound industry.  These people derive much enjoyment from their activities and they are certainly not cruel to animals.</P>
    <P>When the Wildlife Bill was going through the House earlier this year I was walking down the street in my home town one evening when I was approached by an agitated young man who was concerned about it.  Given that he was young and that he was a town dweller I assumed he would be in favour of banning hare coursing completely.  However, when I outlined to him my views on the matter and what the Minister was proposing to do he breathed a large sigh of relief because he and a number of his friends were involved in a small way in the breeding of greyhounds.  The banning of coursing, as sought by the advocates of Deputy Gregory's Bill as well as some of the opponents of this Bill, would have deprived many of those people of the <Col N="1338" /> simple enjoyment of the greyhound industry.</P>
    <P>To drive this widespread area of interest underground simply would not work.  It is a far better approach to bring the greyhound industry into a better regulatory fram work which will be open to supervision by the Minister and by this House.  The provisions of this Bill are a very good means of achieving the objective of greater control, supervision and support for the industry.  It is far more appropriate to have a framework of law and regulation which allows proper supervision and improves standards in the greyhound industry, which allows for the inspection and the monitoring of the use of hares at coursing meetings and which recognises at the same time the importance of the greyhound industry in rural Ireland rather than to simply ban the practice or stick our heads in the sand and pretend that horrible things are not happening simply because we have passed a law in this House which says that they should not.</P>
    <P>I would ask all those involved on both sides of the argument to accept that this proposal is the most practical one available to us at the moment.  Those who are concerned with animal welfare should recognise that this Bill is introducing significant provisions to improve animal welfare, not only for hares but also for greyhounds and, most importantly, bans the practice of live hare coursing.  Those involved in the greyhound industry and coursing in particular should accept that the muzzling of greyhounds is necessary if the industry is to be preserved and promoted in the future and I would ask them to do their bit to ensure that the provisions of this legislation are implemented in practice.  I would ask them also to co-operate with these regulations and with the veterinary inspectors who will be supervising the meetings and to ensure that the greyhound industry, which is an important part of our economy and of life in rural Ireland, not only continues but prospers to the economic benefit of many people in the future.  I commend this Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;governmental imprimatur, but it provides for muzzling of the greyhounds.</P>
      <P>As Members of this House know from my contribution to Deputy Gregory's Bill and from comments made by me over the years, I favour banning live hare coursing. I think it is a cruel sport, in fact it is misdescribed as a sport.  I do not understand why in the interests of developing coursing, to which I have no objection, the Irish Coursing Club has not utilised the experience in Australia where they have drag coursing.  This has not simply been successful in the context of retaining coursing as a real sport but has subsantially increased the popularity of coursing in Australia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the emotions in the debates <Col N="1340" /> on live hare coursing, the Irish Coursing Club has not been sufficiently open-minded to consider an alternative approach which would be beneficial to many people who regard coursing as a real sport and which would attract people to coursing.  Sadly, they have not done that.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House addresses a number of issues I want to mention.  The first provisions contained in the Bill deal with Bord na gCon and its make up and Deputy Dukes, the Fine Gael spokesperson on Agriculture, spoke at some length on that at the commencement of this debate.  The Minister in his opening address acknowledged the problems within the greyhound industry.  As someone who enjoys the occasional attendance at the greyhound track in Shelbourne Park, one can see over the years the way in which the greyhound industry is retracting in the level of attendances and the age profile of the people attending.  It is quite clear the industry is in huge difficulties.  I understand why this Bill is before us.  It is a fire brigade measure to address issues that Deputy Gregory raised, but it is unfortunate that the major problems with Bord na gCon and the running of the greyhound industry are not addressed in this legislation.</P>
    <P>Those who are in favour of live hare coursing often refer to the importance of the greyhound industry.  I do not accept the importance of the link between the live hare coursing and the greyhound industry. The greyhound industry is a multi-million pound industry with great potential. Greyhound track racing has a real potential in the context of tourism and in the context of its potential domestic market if it is dealt with differently.  Bord na gCon has been an abject failure in the manner in which it has run the greyhound industry and it is bringing the industry to its knees.  I do not welcome that.</P>
    <P>I may dislike live hare coursing but it does not mean I want to see an end to the greyhound industry.  That should be a developing industry in an era when people have more leisure time, some of it forced on them by unemployment, and <Col N="1341" /> in an era when tourists coming to a country are looking for something unique or different in events they attend.  The greyhound industry has never been tailored to appeal to tourists coming to Ireland. It is fighting a rearguard action to try to retain those who have had an interest in the sport over the years and it is making little or no impact on the younger generation. Why is that?  Part of the reason is the lack of a business approach on the part of Bord na gCon and its failure in a number of areas.  I also believe that the association of live hare coursing with the greyhound industry has done the latter huge damage.  The overwhelming majority of people under forty have a dislike for live hare coursing and many want to see it permanently banned.  For too long the greyhound industry generally, greyhound tracks, those involved in racing greyhounds not at coursing meetings but at regular meetings in venues such as Shelbourne Park, has got a bad name because of its association with coursing.</P>
    <P>In so far as the provisions of this Bill seek to remove the special position of members of the Irish Coursing Club from Bord na gCon, they are welcome but, as Deputy Dukes said, there is no clear indication in the Bill as to who this or any future Minister many appoint to Bord na gCon.  What criteria will apply?  The Minister talks about there not having to be a vocational element for appointees to Bord na gCon.  It would seem to me there should be a vocational element, that it should not be perhaps in the context of the Irish Coursing Club, but the people appointed to Bord na gCon should be hard-headed business people who have a vision of how to develop the greyhound racing industry.  What should be irrelevant to the appointments to Bord na gCon are the political affiliations of those appointed.  Bord na gCon would want to sort out its operation because there is internecine warfare going on between the chief executive and the board.  In fact what is happening is a dêbacle.  This Bill is an indication of the failure of a political will to come to terms with that.  However, it provides at least a <Col N="1342" /> vehicle to try to address some of the issues.</P>
    <P>What concerned me about the Minister's remarks is that he seemed to say he will remove the provision whereby three members appointed to Bord na gCon need be members of the Irish Coursing Club &mdash; on the basis that that was not essential &mdash; and when he comes to making the appointments he may appoint more than three members.  That is the wrong approach to adopt.</P>
    <P>This Bill should set out some basic criteria or involvement in the business world other than membership of the Irish Coursing Club as being necessary for membership of the new board.  That would result in there being some merit in someone being appointed to Bord na gCon, some procedure whereby it will not be just a ministerial prerogative. There should be a procedure laid down so that when the appointments arise, every Fianna Fáil Deputy is not lobbying for some member of their local cumann to be appointed a member or that some member of the Labour Party is not lobbying for a member of their party to be appointed.  God knows, we know how good this Government, in particular the Labour Party element, has been in not simply getting Labour Party members into positions, but in getting in their friends and relatives.  Therefore, the likely criteria that will be applied the next time will be whether the applicant is a card-carrying member of the Fianna Fáil or Labour parties.  That is not the way that should be dealt with.</P>
    <P>In relation to the provisions on muzzling, I should like to see hare coursing banned.  It is clear that that will not happen bearing in mind the views expressed by Members.  I am something of a pragmatist in that I take the view that if you cannot kick a door open all the way, you kick it halfway open.  On the basis that there is no possibility during the lifetime of this Dáil of having hare coursing banned, at least muzzling dogs will reduce the number of kills but it is not sufficient to reduce, they should be eliminated.</P>
    <P>The Minister's approach to this Bill <Col N="1343" /> gives rise to great concern.  For example, section 3 (1A) (a) states:</P>
    <P>The Minister may make regulations providing for&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the muzzling of greyhounds...</P>
    <P>If this Minister and Government are unwilling to ban live hare coursing that provision should say: &ldquo;The Minister shall make regulations providing for the muzzling of greyhounds&rdquo; and there should be a time scale within which such regulations shall be made.  It is not good enough for the Minister to tell the House everybody is co-operating and it may not be necessary to make the regulations.</P>
    <P>In this coursing season there has been a substantial reduction in the number of hares killed at meetings.  The Minister gave statistics of four hares having been killed at meeting where dogs had been muzzled and eight having to be put down. It is sad to say that we regard that as acceptable because, as Deputy Gregory said, there is an inherent cruelty involved in coursing even if the animal escapes unhurt.  Whether it is necessary for any animal in a so-called sport, to be deliberately put in fear is a question I would raise.  I accept that wild animals are constantly in fear for all sorts of reasons and that when people go hunting animals are killed.  I do not have extreme views about those things.</P>
    <P>There is something unpleasant about crowds of people gathering to watch dogs set on live animals.  While muzzling has reduced the level of the kill it is quite clear from this Bill there is no certainty that muzzling will even be required by law.  It would also seem, in the context of the results so far, that 50 per cent of meetings using muzzles is not sufficient. I predict that if that remains the positions, we will have a repeat of what happened last time in Clounanna during the course of this season.  That would be unacceptable and would cause grave embarrassment to members of the Government.  As a matter of establishing that the experiment taking place in recent months has been successful, it should <Col N="1344" /> now be extended to all coursing meetings; I do not think any should be excluded.</P>
    <P>This Bill is imperfect for another reason.  It is well explained in the papers published this morning that one must address not only the issue of the behaviour on the coursing track but the issue of the behaviour of those training dogs for either live coursing or for the greyhound track.  An article in today's <i>Irish Independent</i> under the heading &ldquo;Dog &lsquo;savaged tied rabbit&rdquo; states:</P>
    <P>A rabbit was savagely blooded by a greyhound on the land of top Irish greyhound trainer Matt O'Donnell, Cashel District Court was told yesterday.</P>
    <P>The rabbit had its hind legs tied with bailer twine when killed by the dog, according to a team of wildlife rangers whose raid on the County Tipperary greyhound training centre resulted in O'Donnell, of Mounttaylor, Killenaule, being charged with permitting unnecessary suffering to the rabbit a year ago.</P>
    <P>One of the wildlife rangers was also assaulted during the course of a visit to this farm.  The perpetrators of this action were then charged with ill-treating the animal and, following legal argument over the delay in serving the summons, the case was adjourned to the High Court.  Obviously there was an attempt made here to apply the law.  I do not know what will happen in this High Court application.  I will not say anything about it because I would expect it is <i>sub judice</i> but that was just an incident that was uncovered.  How many other incidents of this nature that happened throughout the country are not reported or are not known about?  They are not addressed in the Bill</P>
    <P>The problem is that, even if we provide in law for muzzling for coursing meetings, there is a huge difficulty in supervising what happens behind the scenes in training dogs prior to coursing meetings.</P>
    <P>I would have liked to have seen Deputy Gregory's Bill being successful.  In the absence of that I, and I think many <Col N="1345" /> ordinary people, would acknowledge that muzzling at least provides additional protections to those that obtained heretofore. I say to the Minister also that we will be watching very closely what happens.  The Minister should not be tardy about bringing forward regulations and a provision on Committee Stage to change the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; to the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  We should be assured that those regulations will be brought into force before the end of this coursing season.</P>
    <P>All the Minister could tell us in the course of his remarks yesterday, was the following:</P>
    <P>These are enabling provisions which will give the Minister power to introduce the required measures without delay if the need arises.  Deputies will also observe that these powers are being given added teeth by the level of the penalties being prescribed.</P>
    <P>That is an apt phrase, &ldquo;added teeth&rdquo;. I suppose what we want to do is to take the teeth out of coursing.  There will be no &ldquo;added teeth&rdquo; if the regulations are not made. Even if they are made, since we are making it a &ldquo;may&rdquo; rather than a &ldquo;shall&rdquo; provision, who is to say that some Minister in some Government in the future will not rescind regulations made and create a situation where we will return to what was the position until this year when the experiment to provide for muzzling was inaugurated?  It is a pity that the Government, just as it took it on itself to persuade the coursing clubs to provide for muzzling, did not encourage them into drag coursing.  So far as the coursing clubs are concerned, my colleagues, Deputy McGahon, Deputy Flaherty and myself, as well as Deputy Gregory, are some kind of <i>bêtes noires</i>. We are supposed to be urban dwellers who do not have a feel for the countryside, who have an emotional view of animals not based on the realities of life and who are out to get people who have greyhounds and who engage in coursing. Nothing could be further from the truth. That is not what we want to do.  We have a basic humanitarian view of life, which <Col N="1346" /> is that life in the real world, not just for animals but for humans as well, can be an extremely cruel experience.  One does not have to add unnecessarily to the cruelty.  That says something about what we are when we do, to use the old turn of phrase used for advertising butter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Joe Jacob">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I would hope the Minister would take it on himself, just as he took it on himself to encourage the coursing clubs to provide for muzzling &mdash; something which to them was anathema two years ago &mdash; to encourage them to look at an experiment in the area of drag coursing.  I see no reason why they should not do that.  Many of them have taken it upon themselves to change their practices and are doing so in good faith.  Unlike some Deputies, I do not attribute motives to people which are not fair.  Perhaps they should now try drag coursing as an experiment, have a number of regular meetings run on that basis and see what sort of crowds they attract.  They may find that they attract many young people who currently have no interest in live coursing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I should like to refer briefly to section 4 of the legislation.  There has been a huge public demand to ban hare coursing or, at the very least, to get the coursing clubs to tidy up their act.  There is a need in the interests of the economy of this country to sort out the greyhound industry generally and have a body such as Bord na gCon, who can develop that industry in a dynamic way.  I have not heard a demand from anybody to provide for coursing on Christmas Day or Good Friday.  It is extraordinary, in a Bill that is so short on detail and which fails to address 95 per cent of the problems that need to be addressed in the greyhound industry, that we have a section which not only provides for greyhound racing on Sundays &mdash; once we have horse racing why not greyhound racing? &mdash; but makes special provision for Good Friday and Christmas Day.  Perhaps the Minister can <Col N="1347" /> tell me where the public demand for that came and also how many families he expects will be rushing off to the greyhound racing track to celebrate Christmas or Good Friday?  That is an aspect of the Bill the Minister should again address.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I should like to express my support for the Bill. While most of the debate is centred around section 36 of the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958, I would like to concentrate most of my comments on the overall greyhound industry and its importance to the country.  The proposal to muzzle greyhounds, along with the veterinary supervision of hares before and during coursing meetings, is exceedingly important.  I am also conscious of the reason the Bill is before us at this time, ahead of the more comprehensive legislation on this whole industry.</P>
      <P>In the controversy concerning coursing there has been a lack of detailed discussion about the importance of the greyhound industry as a whole and also the importance of the various improvements necessary to develop the industry.  I am one of the people in this House who comes from a family who has been very much involved in the greyhound industry down through the years in the breeding, rearing and training of greyhounds for the greyhound track.  While there has been much debate about coursing meetings, I have never been to a coursing meeting.  However, I support what needs to be done at this time in relation to muzzling.  My knowledge of this industry centres around the greyhound tracks and the improvements which have taken place there since we attended them as young children.  Of course more improvements are required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be concerned as I am sure the Minister is, at the reduction in attendance at greyhound tracks all over the country and also that Bord na gCon's main revenue sources &mdash; the on-course betting levy and the tote receipts &mdash; have been in decline.  These are worrying trends in this industry.  While Deputy Shatter talks <Col N="1348" /> about the urban side, the greyhound industry is an exceedingly important additional income in many family homes.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister referred to the 10,000 people who are dependent for part or sometimes for their sole income from the industry to supplement their livelihoods on small farms and so on.  Mostly it is the farming community who are involved in the greyhound industry.  This industry is a very important aspect of rural life and it needs attention at this time.  I am glad the Minister has promised more comprehensive legislation and that the heads of that Bill are being prepared.</P>
    <P>The greyhound industry, which is totally underexploited, has performed well. I acknowledge that there have been some improvements in the recent years and some notable improvements in some of the tracks.  There is also the new dope detection programme, the trap draw computerisation and the introduction of the computerised tote system.  I remember going to Shelbourne Park in the past. You went in under the stand to a very draughty area and stood on concrete. You would need to be dressed for the North Pole.  Yet we all went there, summer and winter.  Because of all the improvements, including the closed-in area and the carpeted area, it is now a very comfortable place for a family night out.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter was concerned as to whether families would actually go to a night at the dogs on a Sunday night, Christmas night or whatever.  It must be stressed it is a family night out, because one can go at 7 p.m. for the first race at 8 p.m. and be home by 11 p.m.  Especially for rural families, this is the place to take their children for a night out in an acceptable atmosphere.  Last night the Minister said the track is the shop window of the industry.  While some improvements have taken place, it is important that they are continued.  The structural improvements are very important but I would be concerned that on their own they might not lead directly to higher attendances at greyhound tracks.  There is a need to promote the greyhound industry, both as a tourist attraction and <Col N="1349" /> as a leisure sport and also to broaden the sport's appeal.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers have questioned the sporting and leisure aspect of the greyhound industry but in my mind there is no doubt about the great enjoyment people get from this sport.  Not only is there great enjoyment in racing the dogs, but in the breeding, rearing and training of greyhounds.  It is a source of great joy in many homes, including my own, to see a dog that you have trained winning on the track.</P>
    <P>It is also a tourist attraction.  Tourism and leisure activities are major growth industries.  By the year 2000 it is estimated that they will be the single largest sector in the OECD countries.  Tourism is an ideal mechanism for developing underdeveloped areas and rural regions. We constantly hear of the need for a more comprehensive approach to address the seasonality of tourism where everything shuts down come September.  Because of the seasonal nature of the industry, employment in the sector is confined to the summer months.</P>
    <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I should have indicated at the start that I wished to share my time with Deputy O'Donoghue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Joe Jacob">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that will be satisfactory.  Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be welcome if Bord Fáilte were to include Bord na gCon's programme of greyhound meetings in its promotions.  I suggest we concentrate on the many important activities in the winter months that attract tourists. Tourists would like a night out at the greyhound track.  Domestic promotion of the sport as a leisure activity would promote greater attendance.  It would increase revenue not only at the gate but to the tote and encourage increased sponsorship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All these factors will contribute towards higher prizes and this may attract new people into rearing and training dogs.  It is inter-related.  As one very wise person said to me, &ldquo;It does not matter what business or industry you are in, <Col N="1350" /> you only make money where there are people&rdquo;.  The important thing is to attract people into the industry and make the sport an attractive leisure activity and tourist amenity.</P>
    <P>I was glad the Minister established a task force to carry out a comprehensive review of the industry.  This Bill is being introduced as a result of the findings of the task force.  I welcome this decision to amend section 3 of the 1958 Act as I firmly believe that Sunday greyhound racing is important.  The Sunday ban does not apply to many other activities that compete with the greyhound industry.  It is important, therefore, that this industry gets equal treatment.  Greyhound racing is open to families and is an appropriate way for families to spend their free time. The decision is in keeping with measures to attract people to attend greyhound meetings.</P>
    <P>The greyhound industry can be compared to the horse industry.  It is important to our economy as it generates substantial revenues.  In Counties Meath and Kildare, in particular, we are very conscious of the importance of the horse industry.  I believe the greyhound industry should be developed in the same way. We should be encouraging more &ldquo;doggy people&rdquo; to produce, rear and train thoroughbred greyhounds for export to the UK and mainland Europe.  The importance of the export side of the business needs to be underlined.  It needs to be stressed also that this is a genuine alternative enterprise in rural Ireland. This must be underlined for the people who are not as familiar with the industry as those who come from areas where it is based.</P>
    <P>Greyhound breeding, training and management courses, organised by Bord na gCon with the assistance of FÁS, have been held in Limerick.  I hope that successful participants will be encouraged to use their knowledge and experience to exploit the potential of this industry.  On the question of the proposed changes in Bord na gCon, the previous speaker was concerned on the one hand that Bord na gCon should get its act together but he was worried about who would get the <Col N="1351" /> actual jobs.  You cannot have your cake and eat it and I hope the changes provided for in section 9 of the Bill will contribute to achieving the two goals that I am concerned about, namely, the promotion of the greyhound industry as a tourist and leisure amenity and, second, the encouragement of new people in the sector.</P>
    <P>Finally, I will comment on coursing meetings.  We all desire to see the elimination of the kill at coursing meetings. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, stated that in over 400 coursing meetings up to the past fortnight only two hares were killed and two others were put down due to injuries.  From these figures it certainly appears that muzzling and stricter veterinary controls have been a great help.  The promise that this Bill is just a foretaste of more comprehensive legislation to overhaul the 1958 Greyhound Industry Act is positive.  Yesterday the Minister said that the heads of the Bill were being drafted.  It is important for the industry to bring that legislation to the House as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Mary Wallace, for agreeing to share her time.  I am certainly not referring to Deputy Wallace's contribution when I refer to what I can only describe as a certain amount of &ldquo;Dublin 4-itis&rdquo; which is contagious.  I am saying nothing against the people of Dublin 4 but I am using this euphemism to describe what I regard as the complete demonisation of those involved in hare coursing. The demonisation is almost complete. There appears to be an attitude running through the debate that those involved in the sport are wild, bloodthirsty men who cannot be depended on to do anything other than to chase little animals up a field and kill them for their pleasure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot say for a moment that hare coursing is my favourite sport, because it is not, but I know the people involved.  I know them as well as I know you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and even better.  I know you could not meet more decent men on a day's walk.  That is the truth. <Col N="1352" /> To describe them in the manner in which they have been described by certain sectors, including the media, in the course of this long running saga as men who have no regard for wildlife would be the greatest mistake of all.  The truth is that few, if any, people in this country are as close to nature or wildlife as those who are brought up with it and learn to respect it because of their closeness to it.  It is their birthright.  It is important that this is put on the record.  We are speaking about sportsmen.  I do not agree with the killing of little hares running up a field and there is not a sportsman involved in hare coursing who was ever interested in the killing of hares.  The opposite is actually the case.  The genuine people involved in hare coursing are extremely disappointed when they see a hare killed. The muzzling of greyhounds is in all probability a good thing provided the sport can survive and prosper as it is of crucial importance to our economy.  We are talking here not of a small industry but about an industry which contributes considerably to our economy.  Sportsmen and those interested in hunting fear that the next Bill will prohibit hunting in the wild.  The message should go out from the Government that while it is willing to strike a fair balance fairness must come from every side.  I heard a lady on the radio some months ago state categorically that angling should be banned, that it was very cruel to the fish.  So far as I am aware saints fished.  St. Peter was a fisherman.  Hunting is in the order of nature, which laws passed here or anywhere else will not change.  While striking a fair balance here is important, it is also important to send out the message that laws passed in any Parliament of the world will not change the law of nature.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>As Members will recall I am not a member of the Dublin 4 set.  I appreciate my colleague's expertise in that area.  No doubt he has studied the species at close quarters and has come to a clinical conclusion and I have no doubt that there is some truth in what he has said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was born and lived most of my life in <Col N="1353" /> a rural area.  I have been a hunter and a fisherman and I still fish and see nothing wrong with it.  I chased hares with greyhounds and all sorts of dogs.  As time passes one's attitude changes and I have changed in that I do not regard that as a sport any more, although I have no difficulty with fishing.  In the middle ages coursing was the sport of kings and it was widely supported, as were boar hunting, bull baiting and other sports.  Whaling and other marine activities were also pursued.  Many of these activities have been stopped because of changes in public opinion.  As civilisation evolves, what was acceptable 200 or 300 years ago may no longer be acceptable.  I fully appreciate that.</P>
    <P>I do not have any antipathy towards the greyhound industry.  Although I do not attend meetings I know many people who do and I have no problem with it. I recognise the benefit it brings to the economy, but I fail to understand why it is necessary to have live hare coursing.</P>
    <P>Hunting in the natural habitat, from which this sport evolved, is vastly different from live hare coursing today.  When one hunts an animal or bird in its natural habitat, it has a greater than 50/50 chance of escaping.  It is when we remove animals from their natural habitat and put them on territory where their senses are disoriented and they are no longer in control that the problem arises.  It is at that stage that the distinct advantage is with the hunter and it is there that fair play comes into focus.  Those who shoot and fish love to see fair play so that the fish or the animal has as good a chance to get away as it has of being caught.  In enclosed live hare coursing the animal does not have a fair chance.  One should ask oneself whether or not this is sport.  When fair play ceases, it can hardly be described as such.</P>
    <P>People are for and against hare coursing and that is their entitlement.  After my last remarks in the House on this issue I had one or two letters from irate people who indicated that their first preference votes would not necessarily be coming my way in the future.  That is democracy but it should not inhibit me from saying <Col N="1354" /> anything in this House.  Such considerations should not inhibit anyone and nobody should be intimidated into thinking along the lines of a majority or a minority.  People should make up their own minds and not be hassled into a line of thought that is convenient on a particular occasion.  I hope Members of the House will recognise that in the future.</P>
    <P>I agree that this Bill is an improvement, although it is not as good as Deputy Gregory's Bill.  It is still possible for hares to be killed or to be injured so seriously that they have to be put down.  People might say that they are more familiar with the intricacies of the sport than I, but I would claim to know at least as much about it as anybody else, having grown up in that environment.  There is not a shadow of doubt that animals will be killed notwithstanding the muzzling, although muzzling is a distinct improvement on the practice heretofore.</P>
    <P>On the one hand I congratulate the Minister for introducing this measure, but on the other hand it may prove to be insufficient.  For that reason, I hope the Minister will reconsider the matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue referred to the lobbies campaigning for the abolition of various sports.  I have no difficulty with natural sports pursued in a natural habitat. At present in the UK problems have arisen in regard to blood sports, such as fox hunting and so on.  I do not regard stag hunting as a sport, even if it takes place in a natural habitat, although that is no longer the case.  During the Middle Ages the stag would have known every inch of the terrain because he would have roamed it on a daily basis.  At that time the stag would have been much more in command of the situation than is the case at present.  They are now taken out of a reservation and put into a field where they are pursued.  I have not seen that sport take place since I was a teenager, but even then I was not impressed by it as it involves the pursuit of a semi-domestic animal.  In the Middle Ages stag hunting was regarded as a royal sport, but very few people support it nowadays.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1355" /> While there are strongly held views for and against hare coursing on both sides of this House, I have some knowledge of both sides of the argument.  Nevertheless, times and attitudes have changed, civilisation has evolved and trends are changing. This means that rules and regulations must also change.  If that means abolishing something which was acceptable 300 or 400 years ago, we should do so.  That is par for the course and a natural progression of civilisation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the positive element of the Bill relating to muzzling.  Deputy Shatter referred to section 23 of the 1958 Act, which is being amended by this legislation, under which Christmas Day and Good Friday are excluded.  While there are obvious reasons for excluding those days, I fail to understand it.</P>
    <P>We should steer away from fanaticism in the context of this legislation.  There is an element of fanaticism in the debate taking place in the UK at present in relation to hunting generally in that one side will not yield to the other under any circumstances.  That leads to divisive argument, and society does not benefit from such argument.  I hope this debate will bring about an evolution of the arguments put forward previously and that Members will recognise each other's viewpoints with the result that we might view the subject matter in a less charged atmosphere in the future.  If one engages in a debate on this subject one is likely to be cast aside as being totally irrational, irresponsible, heartless, cruel and so on by one side or the other.  When people hold entrenched positions it does not lead to a constructive debate.</P>
    <P>At the outset I stated I was not a member of any grouping, such as Dublin 4, or any other socially desirable element and that as I come from a rural background I have knowledge of both sides of the argument.  I do not believe the enactment of this legislation will affect other sports.  A certain amount of revulsion will be expressed against any type of sport which is seen to be cruel, but the less bloody sports are not likely to be severely affected by this legislation. <Col N="1356" /> Deputy O'Donoghue stated that fishing will be the next sport to be abolished.  St. Peter and Fionn MacCumhail fished and I am sure many Members of this House have enjoyed that activity and will continue to do so.  Nevertheless, we cannot say that activities will not be reviewed in the future.  Circumstances and attitudes change and all activities must be considered as the need arises.  One cannot argue that we should not proceed with this legislation because it might encourage the introduction of legislation abolishing other sports in the future.  If that were the case legislation would have frozen in time several hundred years ago and society would not have moved forward.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision relating to muzzling but I would have welcomed the introduction of further restrictions in regard to this sport.  It might be ironic that a person with a rural background should adopt such an attitude, but that is my view.  I hope the Minister will monitor the operation of the legislation when it is enacted with a view to ascertaining whether further improvements are required which might, if necessary, eliminate any unsavoury or undesirable activities of a cruel nature.</P>

      <P>I welcome this important legislation.  For far too long the greyhound industry has not been given the attention it merits.  We are in the process of devising a national plan for the economy, the twin aims of which are job preservation and job creation.  In so far as this Bill addresses those objectives in the greyhound industry it is especially welcome.  In the context of the overall economy this industry is small but this does not detract from its importance to those involved or from its potential which is considerable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like the horse, the Irish greyhound is recognised worldwide as an animal of <Col N="1357" /> spirit and excellence.  The bloodstock industry, and the greyhound sector in particular, forms an integral part of the fabric of rural Ireland.  For rural and urban families who are actively engaged in the breeding and training of dogs and horses and for the followers of those sports it is a deeply rooted cultural pursuit. It is not merely a question of business or pleasure, it is part of their heritage.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill will attract most public attention.  Under the legislation the Minister will have the power to make regulations to provide for the muzzling of greyhounds at coursing meetings and the veterinary inspection of all the animals involved.  A penalty of £1,000 is provided for and I hope it will be rigorously applied.  I understand that at those meetings where greyhounds were muzzled there was a dramatic reduction in the number of hares killed and that the meetings were run to the satisfaction of all those present.  I hope this will allay the concerns of those who argued that coursing meetings could not proceed if greyhounds were muzzled.  It can now be seen that it has proved to be a success.</P>
    <P>Coursing with muzzled greyhounds is more humane than shooting, fishing or fox hunting.  Therefore those who have been complaining about coursing should remain quiet in the future.  I support the humane treatment of all animals, including hares.  This Bill will go a long way towards ensuring this.  People who do not live in a rural community have romantic notions about animal life in the wild and are not aware of what happens in the countryside.  I was reared on a farm but having listened to some contributions I think I must have come down from Mars.</P>
    <P>Coursing forms an important and integral part of the greyhound industry.  It has helped to develop the industry and enhance the ability of greyhounds on the track.  It should be noted that American and Australian breeders are importing Irish greyhounds with coursing bloodlines to rejuvenate the natural chasing instincts of their existing bloodlines. These breeders believe that their hounds' chasing instincts have suffered since <Col N="1358" /> coursing was outlawed in those countries. It should be noted also that coursing bloodlines were present in the pedigree of 77 per cent of winners of major track events in England and Ireland during the past ten years.  This is an excellent record.</P>
    <P>Along with the muzzling of greyhounds, provision is made for veterinary inspection.  I especially welcome this provision.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that the implementation of these regulations will greatly improve the image of coursing.  The Irish Coursing Club has done much to regulate the industry, but this has not proved sufficient. I attach no blame to those who have been involved in the management of the board.  We must acknowledge, as politicians, that if the industry is to develop the necessary action must be taken.</P>
    <P>In the recent past the problems of Bord na gCon have been compounded by the fact that it is operating in an internationally depressed environment.  In 1991, the last year for which the board published an annual report, the key figures were down.  The level of betting with bookmakers and the tote was down to £33.6 million compared with a figure of £35.6 million in 1990.  Bets placed with bookmakers declined to a figure of £26.8 million, a decrease of 6.05 per cent while the figure for the tote declined to £6.75 million, a decrease of 4.05 per cent.</P>
    <P>By comparison, greyhound tracks fared much better than horse racing tracks where the level of bookmaker betting declined in 1991 by 18 per cent over the figure for 1990.  Internationally, greyhound tracks fared much worse than tracks in Ireland.  For instance, tracks in the United States reported a decline of 12 per cent in turnover while attendances at tracks in the United Kingdom dropped by 9.6 per cent and tote turnover by 10.9 per cent.  In Ireland the level of betting was down in 1991 while attendances fell by 2.89 per cent over the figure for the previous year.</P>
    <P>This took place against a background of increased prize money and sponsorship. Prize money increased by 4.3 per cent giving a total purse of £2,098,423, <Col N="1359" /> an all time record.  Sponsorship, which increased by 3.5 per cent in 1991, represented 27.9 per cent of the total payout.</P>
    <P>The underlying problem is that there is a lack of funding.  Funding is vital if this sector is to reach its full potential. Historically, the industry was funded by way of a share of the tax take from on-course betting but this proved inadequate. In 1990, the historic decision was made that for the first time the industry would also receive a share of the tax take from off-course betting.  This amounts to approximately £300 million during the year.  In 1990, the greyhound racing industry received £500,000 while the horse racing industry received £3 million. In 1991, the figure for greyhound racing was increased to £750,000.  This is still not adequate.  Each year the Department of Finance takes in about £30 million from betting on horses and dogs.  We need to recognise that there is a need to invest and develop this business.</P>
    <P>Bord na gCon is responsible for 18 centres and the managements of many of these dog tracks are crying out for development which is necessary if the industry is to survive and become more profitable.  In the long term we must dispel the penny wise attitude as it neither makes financial nor economic sense.  We should bear in mind that Ireland is the leading exporter of greyhounds and that this business is worth £40 million a year and has enormous potential.  This must be tapped now.</P>
    <P>There is one other noteworthy aspect of the greyhound industry &mdash; it is drug free.  Bord na gCon has its own drug testing centre.  As we are primarily involved in the breeding of greyhounds the board recognises that every greyhound in every major race is a potential breeding animal.  Accordingly, every runner in every major race is tested.  In addition, there is random testing at less important race meetings.  The results are to the credit of all involved in the industry.</P>
    <P>I call on Dáil Éireann to see what the future holds for the greyhound industry in an Irish and European context.  There <Col N="1360" /> is an urgent need to examine the question of funding for Bord na gCon.  By under-supporting the industry we are, in effect depleting a vital national interest and not allowing it to reach its full potential.  The effects of this are felt in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>At European level both our Government and the European Union have formally agreed that the Irish greyhound industry be accepted as an alternative form of enterprise.  Like any rural TD I know at first hand the appalling problem of rural depopulation.  An entire range of agri-business is needed to sustain populations that will otherwise soon disappear. Greyhound breeding and racing have the potential to be one such project. We have subsidies for projects that there is no demand for, yet the greyhound industry, a profitable and sustainable business, remains unaided.  Consideration should be given to making a grant available to greyhound breeders to help sustain and improve that business.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider giving representation on the new board to members of the executive committee of greyhound owners.  There is representation on Bord na gCapaill for horse owners.  I commend the Minister for bringing forward this legislation which was badly needed.  This is only one aspect of a more far reaching plan for the greyhound industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is a man of his word.  During the debate on Deputy Gregory's Private Members' Bill he said he would bring legislation before the House by the end of the year and he has done so.  In so far as this Bill strengthens the Minister's hand and controls the industry, I welcome it.  I have strong views on this matter which are well known within and outside the House, but I understand how difficult it is to tackle the problem; it is not a simple black and white issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The coursing industry has a bad image. Greyhound racing has long been the Cinderella of the racing industry.  I understand the Minister went to look at greyhound racing in other countries, including America.  That was a good thing <Col N="1361" /> because, for too long, greyhound racing in Ireland has had a seedy down-at-heel image and we can learn from other countries, America included.  We can also learn from Britain where there have been attempts to clean up greyhound racing and make it a more family-orientated sport.  In Ireland greyhound racing has been usually a male-dominated sport with a not very good image.  That is the background against which this legislation must be considered.</P>
    <P>I listened carefully to the debate.  Many people spoke in favour of the Bill.  I was not very impressed by the contributions as many of them contained too much propaganda.  They were prepared in some sort of script factory by pro-coursing people.  We all have an obligation to filter and sift such scripts; they should not be read parrot-like.  Publice representatives have an obligation to use their intelligence and sense of justice and fair play and put their own stamp on them.  That did not happen.  There was parrot-like repetition of phrases which cut no ice with me.  The Minister attempted to widen the debate as did Deputy Durkan.  I agree with much of what Deputy Durkan said.  This is not a simple matter; it is not one that can be dealt with by way of simple majority.</P>
    <P>Muzzling is at the experimental stage and the jury is still out on that issue.  I made my reservations about that known during the previous debate and I will not repeat them.  However, I am willing to learn and to judge accordingly.</P>
    <P>The poor image of coursing was highlighted this year at Clounanna, just a few miles outside Limerick city from where I come, when 51 hares were slaughtered in three days.  I referred to that in the previous debate and I will say no more about it.  Much work needs to be done. In the past people got away with murder, if that is not too bad a pun to use in this context.  There was no control; people were not amenable to taking responsibility and were their own worst enemies in that respect.  They thought they could get away with uncontrolled coursing, with malpractice and abuses.  It has been said that man's inhumanity to man is <Col N="1362" /> terrible to see.  Man's inhumanity to man does not end with man alone.  Cruelty is often extended by man to animals and there are plenty of examples.</P>
    <P>Deputy Michael Ahern, and others, said much about the value of the industry to Ireland.  I am not one to turn my face against jobs and industrial development; we need both.  However, in the past human slavery was justified on the same grounds.  People could be transported from one country to another and sold like baggage.  That also was a valuable industry but one can never justify anything on the basis that it makes money and creates jobs.  Slavery did both but it was not necessarily good; it was a horrible business which went on for centuries.  It was justified by church and state and people looked the other way.  We live in a changing world.  Our perception of what is cruel changes.  It is important to see coursing in that context.  The Gregory Bill was a pyrrhic victory for the Government side, and I was on that side. However, it was a useful debate and made many people outside the House realise that coursing cannot continue as in the past, that the time has come to change it.  Coursing people know that.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed with the level of speeches in this debate.  They were a repetition of old folksy arguments and clichés that have no relevance to this debate.  The Minister must continue to study the subject and monitor it closely. He has the power to put in veterinary inspectors to monitor coursing events along with other powers.  I welcome that but the Minister must continue to work in this area and keep it under constant review.  He might come back to the House, perhaps next year, to give us a progress report because we do not have time to go around to coursing meetings and monitor them.  The proof of the pudding will be in the eating.  Unless the Bill is seen to improve the greyhound industry it will not be considered a success.</P>
    <P>It is important to admit that we have been wrong in the past and not try to justify past errors.  That is something we all do as politicians, particularly when we <Col N="1363" /> are in Government; we never admit that we were wrong.  It is good to admit that we may be wrong.  We had different attitudes one time about Northern Ireland, but our perceptions change.  Similarly, in regard to coursing, there is no harm in admitting that we were wrong about that; we grew up in a different time with our perceptions blunted, not understanding fully what we were doing and that coursing was a cruel so-called sport.</P>
    <P>We need further change in this area and I hope the Minister will be big enough to come back to the House with further legislation on this matter.  The passing of this Bill does not mean that the matter is resolved.  We are living in a changing world of industry, of greyhound racing and of coursing.  It is important that all legislation should reflect the change in human attitudes to coursing and greyhound racing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to share my time with Deputy Sargent.  I welcome the fact that some measures have been taken to improve and develop the greyhound industry.  It is a significant source of employment in rural Ireland and provides an important supplement to the earnings of 6,000 small farmers. However, I regret that the Minister did not take the opportunity to revitalise the industry and give it a new beginning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Minister's point that the estimated income of £16 million generated by the industry is a significant contribution to the earnings of small holders.  Deputy Dukes was out of line in dismissing that point and disregarding the suggestion that greyhound breeding could be a genuine alternative farm enterprise, especially in these days of CAP reform and GATT, about which the Deputy appears to be annoyed.  It is particularly appropriate for small farmers to consider alternative farm businesses. The reality is that farming is changing. People living in rural areas need to consider alternatives and this industry may be an alternative that would have limited application.  But for that to be the case it is essential that it is developed to its full <Col N="1364" /> potential.  At present the industry is in the doldrums.  Punters are staying away and they must be attracted back to the racing track if profits are to be made. Facilities must be upgraded.</P>
    <P>The image of the industry must be improved.  That issue has not been tackled in the Bill.  There is a half-hearted approach in relation to the controversy of live hare coursing, but it does not address that problem.  The controversy will not go away.  The legislation presented an opportunity to the Minister to face up to the controversy and to the large numbers of people who are concerned and angry about the status of live hare coursing and to address the problem.  The Bill does not address the problem and that is an opportunity lost. It is vital that the image of the greyhound industry be improved and this will not happen until live hare coursing is banned.</P>
    <P>The provisions in the Bill will not satisfy anyone.  During the years the ICC has opposed the idea of muzzling and its present response in that regard is less than enthusiastic.  People who oppose live hare coursing do not regard muzzling as the answer.  The Minister will end up falling between two stools and the people who will suffer are those who are trying to build up the greyhound industry in good faith; and, of course, the hares will suffer also.  On reading the documentation that presents the case for and against muzzling, there appears to be sufficient evidence to support the case that muzzling creates appalling cruelty.  The trials carried out to date support that evidence.  Hares are still dying and being injured.  As long as that position continues the controversy in that regard will continue.  The Minister is postponing the day he will have to make a decision in this regard.</P>
    <P>The confrontational element associated with coursing meetings is damaging the greyhound industry.  It is unacceptable that a public representative would be excluded from attending coursing meetings regardless of his or her view on coursing.  In a democracy a person is entitled to freedom of movement.  It is <Col N="1365" /> strange that when I should be defending the right of the hare to survival, I am defending the right of public representatives and Deputies to go about their business.  Deputies are being prevented from going about their business at coursing meetings because of the practice at those meetings and because of the secrecy and denial of what is happening at those meetings.  It is legitimate for people to monitor what takes place at those meetings and to see the evidence. Any serious TD making a statement on any political issue wants to see evidence in regard to that issue.  It is unacceptable that they should be prevented from carrying out such monitoring, particularly when the coursing club receives funding from the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputies like to leave the Chamber?  I am just trying to make a point here.  Public money is availed of in relation to coursing activities.  Taking that point into account and also the broader point in regard to public access and rights, people should not be prevented from seeing what is happening at meetings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the banning of live hare coursing a practical way to deal with this matter and to give the greyhound industry a boost and a new image is for members of the ICC to be represented on Bord na gCon.  The Irish Council Against Blood Sports should also be represented on Bord na gCon.  That would be a progressive move.  The point about gender balance was made.  The Minister has a <Col N="1366" /> responsibility to ensure that there is 40 per cent representation of women on the board.  Women will not accept a long finger approach in this regard.  The Government has given a commitment on gender equality and it must meet its commitment in regard to the filling of positions.</P>
    <P>Regarding muzzling, most people would not place a great deal of trust in the application of regulations.  The Minister stated that he will introduce regulations and that is relatively easy to do.  The difficult question is: how will those regulations be enforced?  The illegal practice of blooding still takes place.  Occasionally, such cases are brought to court. However, the fact that there is not a regulatory system in place which is 100 per cent effective in that regard is a matter of concern when dealing with the issue of muzzling.</P>
    <P>Whatever about the practice of blooding, muzzling would have to be enforced effectively throughout the country for that practice to be complied with.  I do not believe it is worth the effort.  The application of regulations on muzzling must be questioned.  This does not involve only the imposition of penalties. There should be direct encouragement to replace live hare coursing with the Australian style drag coursing events. People should be encouraged to take that track to develop the industry and make it an attractive supporting event and a family one.  It should be developed in a way that will not upset, distress or offend people because of its barbaric nature.  We should encourage drag coursing, which is not offensive but is very popular in Australia and has been proven to be successful.</P>
    <P>I referred to my opposition to live hare coursing during the debate on Deputy Gregory's Private Members' Bill.  I am not disturbed by the cruelty to animals as much as what the enjoyment of that sport says about us as human beings.  If we are willing to tolerate such cruelty, that says a great deal about how we tolerate cruelty among people in the larger arena.  Many people were shocked by the Jamie Bulger case.  They asked how could this happen <Col N="1367" /> in a civilised society.  Blame has been attached to video nasties, and I do not doubt that they may be an element in that case.  We need to consider how cruelty is practised in our society.  We must consider the effect on a young child of attending a live hare coursing meeting.  I have talked to people who remember very vividly the first time they attended a coursing meeting and they were horrified by what they saw as children.  We should not dismiss the impact of such meetings and place responsibility for cruelty on other people.  Coursing meetings are part and parcel of what we are, unless we change the position.  We had an opportunity in this Bill and, if amendments are accepted, the Minister will have an opportunity to provide for a much improved greyhound industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">

      <P>Aontaím leis an meíd atá ráite ag Deputy McManus.</P>
      <P>I support the Bill in so far as it develops the greyhound industry as a racing enterprise, and I have no problem with Sunday racing, although it may present a problem for some people who do not favour gambling on Sundays.  However, there is an element of deception in the Bill because it portrays the greyhound industry as a front for coursing and makes minimal change in this area.  For that reason, the Bill needs to be torn apart, as happens to the hares, and put back together again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bord na gCon operates under great difficulty and is not prospering.  Unlike Deputy Dukes, I believe there is a link between Bord na gCon and the Irish Coursing Club in terms of rules.  One such rule is that which requires a person who races greyhounds, perhaps somebody based in the city, to register with the Irish Coursing Club.  That is a distortion of people's interests and is similar to requiring a rugby player to register with a table tennis club or soccer club in order to pursue his activity.  The country also suffers as a result of the link between Bord na gCon and the Irish Coursing Club.  If we are to portray a good image internationally we should tackle coursing <Col N="1368" /> on an objective basis without pandering to an aggressive minority.</P>
    <P>The question of muzzling is of concern to many people.  Some people put on a brave face and say that at least it is better than banning coursing altogether.  Others such as John Martin, a respected correspondent, do not agree with muzzling. The muzzle in coursing can be compared with the silencer in terrorism or the toy gun in bank robberies.  The victim still experiences anguish and may be ripped apart in the end.</P>
    <P>In coursing, regardless of whether a muzzle is used, hares will be killed and injured.  This is not a numbers game and this issue should not be played on the basis of numbers or an acceptable kill.  It is a questions of terror.  Are we prepared to accept terror, particularly as part of a so-called sport?  To date, trials with muzzles have been closely monitored and obviously there are fewer kills in those circumstances.  However, I would not rule out an increase in kills in the future when there is less publicity in regard to muzzles.</P>
    <P>Coursing involves capture, training, trials and blooding.  There is evidence that blooding takes place, in spite of the fact that the Irish Coursing Club argues that it does not happen.  In tackling this matter, I would ask the Minister to consult with the Minister for Education and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment in regard to technological development. The Australian example needs to be considered in this regard.  When the Australian Prime Minister was here he did not dwell very much on the atrocities of East Timor.  He is more humane in his domestic policies which includes putting into practice coursing which does not involve the live hare.  That is the only way to take the cruelty out of coursing. Coursing without the live hare would be successful here and I might even be attracted to a coursing meeting.  The coursing industry would have nothing to hide in those circumstances and people could be proud of the industry.  At present, the vast majority of people are rightly ashamed of coursing, regardless of whether a muzzle is used.  The muzzle <Col N="1369" /> does not work as it injures dogs and kills hares.  I plead with the Minister to take into account the ultimate solution which is to ban the use of live hares in coursing.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to address the House on this important legislation.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or have available the proper details so that people will not be misrepresented and animals will not be maligned.  There are very few people available to give the correct statistics.  I was surprised at the comments of Deputy Dukes, a man who is of the land and of the country.  He almost insinuated that the Minister knows nothing about the industry, but that is untrue.  The Minister is a modest man and is not prepared to stand up in the House to defend his interests, expertise and experience in this industry.  Anybody who says that his actions are determined by his childhood interest in the industry knows nothing about the Minister, Deputy O'Shea.  Perhaps Deputy Dukes is just being negative in this regard.  He seems to believe that nobody but himself has authority or expertise to speak on these matters.</P>
      <P>I was surprised that Deputy Dukes, who has an interest in the agriculture industry and farming generally, is unaware of the importance of the coursing industry to part-time farmers and rural people.  It is matter of interest to many constituencies.  We are interested not only in the industry and the economic development of our constituencies but also in preventing cruelty to animals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister indicated in his speech that this legislation deals with only part of the industry and that a major Bill is in preparation to deal with the wider problem.  This legislation was introduced in response to the criticisms by many <Col N="1370" /> people about the killing of hares at coursing meetings.  This view was also held by the chairperson of the Labour Party, Deputy Kemmy, who was promised by the Minister of State that he would deal with this issue at the first available opportunity.  The Minister did not have to include a provision in the Bill dealing with the muzzling of greyhounds but he has done so to meet the concerns expressed by many people about the killing of hares.  Deputies who have an interest in the greyhound industry have endeavoured through their parties to have this industry tidied up.  I have been accused of using my position as the Labour Party Whip to bring Deputies into the House to support or oppose legislation for narrow political purposes.  I did no such thing.  I was acting in a positive way to ensure that the Minister would respond to the legitimate criticisms about the killing of hares at coursing meetings.</P>
    <P>The greyhound industry is a very important industry.  I make no apology to anybody, regardless of what party they represent, about referring to its importance. Approximately 10,000 people are employed in the greyhound industry, which is a national asset and of vital importance to our economy.  Total annual receipts from the sale of greyhounds amount to approximately £40 million while receipts for breeders, etc. exceed £2 million.  The greyhound industry and its sister industry, the coursing industry, are national assets which give much needed employment in rural areas.</P>
    <P>There is a strong tradition of coursing and other sports in County Tipperary. During previous debates I have refuted suggestions and allegations that coursing is a sleazy or substandard sport.  I know the people involved in this sport in County Tipperary and I refute any suggestion that they are in some way second class citizens.  I can say with all sincerity that the people involved in coursing in County Tipperary are proud and honourable people.  Coursing is an integral part of rural life in County Tipperary and the people involved in the industry abhor the killing of hares at meetings.  The greyhound industry is <Col N="1371" /> worth £3 million to the local economy of Clonmel, the administrative capital of my constituency and Ireland's largest inland town.  The greyhound industry is of major benefit to towns such as Clonmel which have strong ties with this industry.  I have the utmost confidence that the Bill will streamline the industry and allow it to grow, develop and create more jobs.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to introduce Sunday racing.  Some people of different political and religious persuasions have commented that very few people will be interested in attending meetings on Sundays, Christmas Day, St. Stephen's Day or other holy days.  I would say to them that people living in rural areas, who, unlike those working in the Four Courts and others enjoying extended holidays, work six and seven days a week, like to enjoy themselves in a fair manner, even on holy days.  I see nothing wrong with putting this sport on a par with other sports, including the bloodstock industry, or with holding meetings on a Sunday.  It should be remembered that people like placing bets on horses and dogs; it is part of their nature.  Perhaps Democratic Left thinks people do not have a nature and that we are all clones of the computer industry.</P>
    <P>The provision in regard to the muzzling of greyhounds at coursing meetings is a very important step in eliminating much of the cruelty involved in this sport.  This measure will lead to the proper control of hare coursing.  It is only right to eliminate any unnecessary cruelty in this sport. Nobody wants to see a repeat of the massacre in Clounanna last February when an unacceptable number of hares were killed because the greyhounds were not muzzled.  The number of hares killed at coursing meetings since the introduction of muzzling on a voluntary and experimental basis has fallen dramatically.  I am sure that the spectacular decrease in the number of hares killed as a result of the muzzling of greyhounds will be welcomed by all of <Col N="1372" /> us, including Deputy Sargent and Deputy McManus&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will do so in a moment. According to statistics which have been published, of the 1,029 hares which have been coursed since muzzling was introduced on a voluntary basis only four have been killed accidentally, not deliberately, and eight have been injured.  I have been advised that these injured animals were put down on veterinary advice.  During the same period thousands of hares, rabbits, foxes, badgers etc., have been killed by motorists&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;instead of giving unsubstantiated information to the House.  Reports of coursing meetings suggest that muzzling has not interfered with the natural instinct of greyhounds to pursue hares.  The link between the natural instinct of greyhounds and greyhound racing is well recognised.  The Minister's proposals in regard to the muzzling of greyhounds will not interfere with or affect the future performance of greyhounds.  The industry must be congratulated for accepting these proposals. It was consulted about the muzzling of greyhounds and it had no problems with this proposal.  It was stated today that the industry had unwillingly accepted this proposal, but this is totally untrue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The anti-coursing lobby is so opposed to coursing that it does not mind drawing blood from pro-coursing people going about their ordinary business.  This anti-blood sports lobby is opposed to coursing but it does not seem to mind drawing blood from humans.  This vociferous <Col N="1373" /> lobby does not want anybody to hold a view which is different to its view.  I hope this lobby will accept that the new measures proposed in the Bill, including the provision dealing with muzzling, will go a long way towards meeting its concerns.</P>
    <P>The Bill will give Bord na gCon the ability to increase the number of meetings, subject to rules which will have to be agreed by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  Bord na gCon will also be given responsibility for the breeding and registration of greyhounds. The Bill provides for the appointment of new members to the board of Bord na gCon so as to ensure that the greyhound industry will be better represented at board level.  The number of board members proposed in section 2 (2) (a) should be increased so as to ensure that the Irish Coursing Club, which enjoys automatic representation on the board at present, is properly represented. Increased membership would also allow other interests, such as women, to be represented on the board.  I have no doubt that women will play a major role in developing the industry, because many women have an interest in it.  Increased representation on the board would bring it into line with the board of the bloodstock and horse racing industry which is representative of the breeders, trainers and owners in that industry.  Six is very restrictive and I would respectfully suggest that the Minister examine this aspect of the Bill to ensure that he will be allowed the opportunity to adhere to the Government's proposals with regard to the gender balance and to ensure also that there is adequate and proper representation for the Irish Coursing Club and others.</P>
    <P>I refute any suggestion that someone who has an affiliation to either Fianna Fáil or the Labour Party cannot represent the greyhound industry.  It is utter balderdash to say that because the board is not comprised of people from other political persuasions it is in some way deficient. The Minister is perfectly entitled to nominate those whom he considers will make a worthwhile contribution to the board, <Col N="1374" /> irrespective of their political affiliations, and I would respect his judgment in that regard.  Nobody should be excluded from membership of this board because of political affiliation.</P>
    <P>With this new extended board all of those groups will play a vital and imaginative role in developing the industry.  The board will have the responsibility of examining the issues of breeding, marketing, racing and the development of the industry as a whole at home and abroad.  We must not forget the people who support racing events, the punters. They turn up faithfully, irrespective of the weather, simply for the thrill and excitement of coursing and greyhound racing.  We have a responsibility to ensure that the facilities available to those patrons of the industry are the best possible so that the sport can be enjoyed by families of all age groups.  In trying to put money back into the industry I hope the Minister will examine the sectors already supporting it.  I hope also that the improvements the Minister wishes to see in the industry, including the increase in the numbers attending race and coursing meetings and all the other aspects of the economic development of the industry, will take place.  The punters are entitled to first-class accommodation and facilities when they go out to enjoy themselves on whatever day of the week their religious beliefs allow.</P>
    <P>This is a good healthy rural sport and we apologise to nobody for the fact that this Minister is trying to eliminate the cruelty which was inherent in the past in uncontrolled courses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an <Col N="1375" /> opportunity to participate in this debate and I wish to compliment the Minister at the outset for bringing forward promised legislation with reference to the coursing of live hares.  This follows on from a major debate which took place on the Gregory Bill on which I made a fairly substantial contribution.  I will not repeat what I put on the record of this House in June, but I wish to make a number of important points.</P>
      <P>The arguments has been made that the economic aspects of the greyhound industry are important.  We all support the objective of improving and enhancing employment prospects and the opportunity for rural communities to generate economic activities which will sustain them.  Of course, we cannot give it a blanket approval.  The fact that there is economic activity deriving from a particular sport does not always mean that the sport is correct.</P>
      <P>I again put on the record that I am opposed to the coursing of live hares.  I have no great criticism to make of the greyhound industry and I understand and accept its importance in rural communities but I cannot accept that we must continue to use live hares in the sport. Muzzling is a first step and I applaud the Minister for making the commitment a few months ago and for honouring that commitment so quickly.  We have now before us a Bill which represents the first step towards dealing with what everybody in this House agreed was an unacceptable level of kills at various meetings around the country.  Members wish to see the elimination of wholesale killing of hares.  This Bill goes part of the way towards achieving that objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask those who support the industry so strongly to continue to examine ways of improving the situation regarding live here coursing and to be prepared, as the Minister was, to go abroad to see how greyhound industries in other countries are promoted.  Those who continue to support live hare coursing should also go abroad to see what has envolved from the original practice of live hare coursing.  I am referring to drag <Col N="1376" /> coursing which takes place in Australia and Germany with some success. Nothing is set in stone as far as this practice is concerned and I would simply ask those in the industry to examine other ways of achieving the same objective of ensuring that the sport and the industry survive and prosper.  That is the legitimate objective of those involved in coursing.</P>
    <P>In so far as the preparation for coursing meetings is concerned, this is an area on which we will have to lift the lid.  As recently as today I read in the newspaper of an individual case.  I accept it is probably not representative of the greyhound industry as a whole &mdash; involving misuse of an animal associated with the blooding of greyhounds.  This is not the first case of this kind and it will not be the last but it can no longer be allowed.  It is a problem that will have to be faced as the image of greyhound racing improves.  I would ask those in the industry to see how they can put that part of their house in order because it is a practice that would not be acceptable to the vast majority of Irish people if they knew precisely what was going on.  They can only find out from the cases that appear in the newspapers from time to time.</P>
    <P>Under section 3 the Minister may make regulations covering a number of matters.  The muzzling of greyhounds has been referred to in detail.  However, I am unhappy with the section dealing with the supervision by a veterinary surgeon of hares prior to, during and after coursing events.  I am not satisfied that one veterinary surgeon is sufficient and I would ask the Minister to consider providing for at least two, one of whom would not be involved in any way in the industry or in servicing it.  I am sure that is possible because many veterinary surgeons operate in an exclusively urban-area. In certain cases a particular event might be compromised because of a veterinary surgeon's close association with the industry.  Certain individuals may not live up to the spirit of what is contained in the Bill.  That is a point I should like the Minister to take into account &mdash; the deployment of two veterinary surgeons. <Col N="1377" /> I would also ask the Minister to make provision in the Bill for regular reports, at least on an annual basis, of what has transpired at various coursing meetings. Perhaps the same veterinary surgeons could be used to provide the Minister's Department or the industry with such a report, indicating precisely how the coursing meetings have been conducted and so on.  In that way the Minister himself would continue to contribute to the enhancement of the industry.</P>
    <P>Most of what I had to say on the industry I said in June last.  I compliment the Minister on the introduction of this Bill and ask him not to cease his efforts to clean up the industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>In replying to the Second Stage of this Bill, I must first say how delighted I was to observe so many Members contributing. It was indicative of the level of interest, across all party lines, in the greyhound sector.  That is only right, given the sector's important contribution to employment, farm incomes, tourism and our economy generally, and in particular to the lives of rural communities.</P>
      <P>I was pleased to observe a general consensus in the House that the greyhound industry is one with significant development potential.  The breeding sector can be extended and improved, while the racing, betting and entertainment aspects of the business warrant the adoption of a new approach.  General financing, both the sourcing of adequate funds and their targeted distribution for the development of facilities for punters, ensuring an adequate return for breeders and owners alike necessitates a new co-ordinated effort, which would focus on the medium and long term future of the industry. Controls must be not only effective but clearly be seen to be so.  Indeed, everybody involved in the industry must have confidence in that control regime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If all of these issues are tackled, the industry will have a bright future.  The first step to securing the industry's future will be the provision of a modern, legislative framework appropriate to the <Col N="1378" /> industry's needs.  As I said yesterday, the 1958 Act needs to be thoroughly overhauled. I might add that work on this front is progressing apace in my Department.</P>
    <P>This is a first short Bill, whose provisions cater for the areas in more urgent need of attention, such as the reconstitution of Bord na gCon, the removal of the ban on Sunday greyhound racing and a provision to empower the Minister to make regulations for the muzzling of greyhounds, in addition to the veterinary supervision of hares involved in coursing meetings.</P>
    <P>Members raised a number of questions in relation to all of those issues.  With regard to changes in the board of Bord na gCon, most Members who spoke seem to be concerned primarily with the removal of the requirement that three members of the board must be members of the executive committee of the Irish Coursing Club.  Deputies Dukes and Molloy were particularly concerned that this Bill merely constituted a mechanism to allow for ministerial favouritism in the manner of such appointments.  I reject that allegation outright.  I made my position clear yesterday.  It is my belief that the provisions of the existing legislation are too restrictive, especially in circumstances prevailing in which there is a chairman and only six ordinary members serving on that board.  Excluding the chairman and the Irish Coursing Club, there are insufficient places remaining for representation of all other sectors.  I believe there is need to include on the board somebody with good business and financial experience and expertise.  If sectional interests are to be catered for specifically, the number of members on the board would have to be increased.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies referred to the proposed board arrangements in the case of the new Horse Racing Authority, which, of course, will cater for a much larger industry and will comprise approximately twice as many members as Bord na gCon.  In the case of a board of such size it will be comparativley easy to cater for representation on the part of all sectors or organisations involved and <Col N="1379" /> still leave room for the appointment of people with special expertise.  This could easily prove too unwieldy in the case of Bord na gCon in that it probably operates at optimum effectiveness with a total of seven members.</P>
    <P>In the drafting of the more comprehensive Bill in my Department consideration could be given to increasing the membership of the board and providing for some limited version or counterpart of what is being proposed in the case of the Home Racing Authority. However, Members will be aware that under the provisions of the 1958 Act, as it stands, the current board must be replaced by the end of the year, so that without the provisions of this Bill being enacted, a new board would have to be appointed for a full five year term.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that the industry was in need of a new focus and that Bord na gCon was in need of new, wider experience and expertise in order to provide that focus.  In so far as is practicable, in appointing members of that new board the Minister will have particular regard to a balanced representation for all the major players in the field.  Those new arrangements would also provide that those new board members could be replaced on a phased basis, with two ordinary members retiring each year, thus providing flexibility and continuity. I put it to the House that we cannot wait another five years for these changes and that it would not be fair to appoint a board now whose terms of appointment would have to be radically changed next year.</P>
    <P>To those Members concerned about the position of the Irish Coursing Club, I would say to them that I have already in this House acknowledged the substantial role of the club, historically and in recent years, in the organisation and development of the greyhound industry as a whole.  Neither do I underestimate the contribution of members of the Irish Coursing Club who have served on the board of Bord na gCon over the years. However, this is not a case of retaining a <Col N="1380" /> statutory requirement that half of the board members must continue to be composed of a specific committee of that organisation.  It is not unlikely that several people who would be members of that organisation, even serving on their executive, would serve on the new board.</P>
    <P>Another factor raised in the House today was that there should be some women on the new board.  It is the Minister's intention to have a good, relatively small, effective board, representative of a cross-section of relevant interests and specific expertise, which will include women members and most likely will include members of the Irish Coursing Club.  We are seeking to provide the best forum for the industry's needs.  I would say that the provisions of this Bill, so provide.</P>
    <P>When I first assumed office my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Joe Walsh, has already established a task force to examiane the greyhound industry.  Their attention was directed to three specific areas.  The first was the declining attendance at greyhound meetings; second, the control of the industry; and, third, the matter of coursing.  On receipt of the recommendations of the task force the Minister and I examined its contents, which were subsequently examined at official level within our Department.  We then prepared a memorandum which the Minister submitted to Cabinet and was agreed by Government.</P>
    <P>There was criticism of the fact that we did not have ready the second more comprehensive Bill for introduction and that we were unable to incorporate the provisions of both Bills in this one.  The Greyhound Industry Act, 1958, which I understand had a very long passage through this House was compiled at a time when we did not have Teilifís Éireann.  The bottom line in what the Government is seeking to achieve is a legislative framework through which the board can operate.  We have got to provide the framework.  The board is the critical element and it is of the utmost importance that the best possible board is put in place by the Government and that the board operates in the optimum <Col N="1381" /> framework.  Many areas have had to be examined and legislation is progressing at a good pace.  It is our intention to have that legislation before the House as soon as possible.  Many of the issues raised by Deputies will be the subject of a wider and more comprehensive debate at that stage.  The important point is the employment which will be created and the income which will accure to people at all levels of the sport.  I dealt with this issue in my speech yesterday.</P>
    <P>We want to give this industry a solid base from which to move forward in a way that is in the national interest and in the interests of employment.  Those issues have yet to be dealt with in legislation. Deputies will accept that in the context of the new board we had to introduce this short amendment so that we can put in the place the most appropriate board.  We had wished to provide for Sunday racing for some time and this legislation afforded us the opportunity to do so.  The enabling legislation in relation to coursing and veterinary measures were introduced in response to undertakings given here earlier in the year.  No time is being lost in the preparation of the comprehensive legislation which is so necessary to turn around the fortunes of the greyhound racing.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Scripts of my speech are not yet available because of the short notice about the introduction of this Bill but they will be available later.  I have great pleasure in bringing forward the Bill and I will sketch some of the background to it.</P>
      <P>During the 1980s a decision was taken by the Minister at that time, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, which was implemented by Deputy Bertie Ahern, that there would be a change in the way apprenticeships were run here.  Arising from that, a consultative committee was set up, a White Paper was issued and all interested parties were asked to give their views.  Many hundreds of submissions were received on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board of FÁS, which has statutory responsibility for the delivery of apprenticeships, set up a sub-committee of the board &mdash; the FÁS apprenticeship sub-committee. They represent the viewpoints of industry, trades unions, the social partners in general and the Department <Col N="1383" /> of Education with whom the board of FÁS, under its legislation, has authority to interact and seek views on a consultative basis.  That board met for about two years and worked out, in consultation with trades unions, employers and others, the shape of the new apprenticeship system.</P>
    <P>The main thrust of the new apprenticeships is standards reached rather than time served.  I strongly applaud the use of apprenticeships in Ireland and the fact that for many years such high standards were reached.  There are records to prove that.  We have young people going to the farthest corners of the world and coming home clothed in honours having received medals of one kind or another in the field of apprenticeship.  Since assuming responsibility for apprenticeship and training &mdash; which dates from the time I was Minister for Education &mdash; I am particularly keen to have decent training and proper standards of certification. With those passports young people can travel the world or obtain employment at home.  However, if they wish to gain wider experience, they can go to Europe or elsewhere but they must have their certificates stating that they have not just spent a number of years learning a trade &mdash; because, clearly that would not suffice &mdash; but that they have attained the recognised standards.  That is the main point which came through by consensus.</P>
    <P>From time to time there are discordant voices from one section or another to the effect that we should have stayed with the old system.  I strees that the new system came about as a result of consensus.  What we are aiming for now are standards reached rather than time served in a trade.  For the present the time served will be the average duration of four years.  FÁS has employed two keen experts in that field who are making a study of the length of time it takes to learn various trades here and in other countries, taking into account standards reached both on and off of the job.</P>
    <P>This is a technical Bill, but I think it will give rise to much discussion about <Col N="1384" /> apprenticeship and training.  It provides for the introduction and collection of a payroll levy from 6 April 1995 in certain sectors of industry to fund the new FÁS apprenticeship system.  Lest Members fasten on the word &ldquo;levy&rdquo; and ask, &ldquo;What have employers to say about this?&rdquo;, this was discussed extensively during the negotiations of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and the scheme as worked out was agreed by the employers' representatives.  Rather than put a levy on certain large industries, this levy is linked to employers' turnover and PRSI payments and happens automatically.</P>
    <P>It may be suggested that companies which were not subject to levies because they were below the payroll levels will now have to pay this levy.  That is so, but they will benefit from the funding arrangements in that they will be relieved of meeting the apprentice's wage costs during the periods of off-the-job training. For example, a company with a payroll bill of less than £500,000 and with just one first year apprentice would save more in wages during the apprentice's 20 weeks off-the-job training than they would pay in the levy.  Clearly there are pluses and minumse.  Previously the levy was pitched at between 1 per cent and just over 2 per cent, but now it is 0.25 per cent, which is minimal.  The outcome will be that the young person so trained will contribute to the firm in which he or she is being trained and will go on to fill a valuable place in the workplace.</P>
    <P>Section 4 sets out how the proceeds of the levy may be used by FÁS: (1) towards wages, travel and subsistence expenses of an apprentice while undergoing off-the-job training; (2) for certain administrative costs;(3) for there expenditure in relation to apprenticeships to be determined by the Minister.  The levy will be set at 0.25 per cent of an employees' reckonable earnings, subject to the income limits set for employers' PRSI purposes.  The employers who are exempt from paying PRSI in respect of certain employees will, of course, be exempt from the levy in respect of the <Col N="1385" /> earnings of these employees.  The levy may from time to time be changed.</P>
    <P>At the start I referred to standards.  In spite of the very high standards reached under the system of serving time as an apprentice, a huge number of apprentices each year did not do the final craft examinations. While there were high fliers who succeeded in getting medals in their exams, others did not sit the final examination and therefore never got their qualification certificates.  In the world in which we now live decent training and recognised qualifications will be the passport to jobs both at home and abroad. The original changes go back as far as 1986, but the present changes were brought about by the process of consensus.</P>
    <P>I want to make an appeal to employers. In the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> negotiations, the employers representatives sat around a table and negotiated a change in the system of apprenticeships with the board of FÁS and with the subcommittee of FÁS, but I find that they are modest and in some instances tardy in following up on their obligations under the system of apprenticeship <i>per se.</i> In difficult times it is the weak and vulnerable who are most put out.  The same applies to apprentices. There are now many redundant apprentices and FÁS has set up a special fund to bring those young people back into employment.  I have met with IBEC, with the board of FÁS, with the subcommittee and with FÁS executives on many occasions.  Next week I will meet with the Construction Industry Federation.  I am clearly convinced that the new system of FÁS apprenticeships &mdash; 15 trades were introduced in 1993 and in 1994 we will have another ten &mdash; when it is operating fully will make a remarkable difference to young people entering apprenticeships. We aim also to extend the number of recognised trades into traineeships in other fields, such as a traineeship in the field of retail sales, hairdressing and butchering. Representative groups have been to see me and are very anxious to have their particular skill authenticated <Col N="1386" /> and, more importantly, properly delivered.</P>
    <P>The question of equity is increasingly being brought to my door in the constituency and also in the House.  Indeed, I remember Deputy Richard Bruton raising this issue in the very first question I answered in the House as Minister of State with responsibility in Labour affairs.  Deputy Bruton put it to me that it was becoming impossible to become an apprentice.  However, 2,000 apprentices have been taken on this year and there are 14,000 in the system altogether. Deputies from all parties have come to see me about this issue.  At that time I was new to the brief, but as I investigated the matter and discussed it in detail it became clear that there was a problem with equity.  Often getting an apprenticeship is dependent on whom you know and whom you can get to tweak an ear in the commercial field.  I am not prepared to stand over that.  I have made this an issue that has to be addressed.  In pursuance of that I met again with all of the groups about whom I spoke, and in particular with the employers and with the executive and the subcommittee of FÁS.  They are in the process of drawing up a short paper, which I hope we will tease out fully on Committee and Report Stages.</P>
    <P>There is a perceived inequity and that is not good enough.  This inequity means that young people do not have access to various trades in a system in which the Government is investing a considerable amount, between Irish and EC funding to the tune of £30 million per year.  Quite plainly, it is incorrect to decide that one person can be taken on while another cannot.  The employers have said to me that it is they who have to employ the person and therefore they should have the right to decide whom to take on.  We have to achieve a balance between proper access and the rights of employers to have a voice, but not the overriding voice, in chossing the apprentices.  I am putting down a market on that.  Even as late as yesterday I thought we would have had the considered paper from the FÁS board.  I expect it within the next few <Col N="1387" /> days.  They are working out equity arrangements which I hope will prove valuable as I am not prepared to stand over an apprenticeship system which is not transparent.  The biggest bone of contention among people who have spoken to me about the FÁS scheme related to the equity of the system.  I assure everyone in the House and people throughout the country that an equitable system of access will be put in place.</P>
    <P>I spoke about the need for high standards based on my experience in the Department of Education.  Deputy Quill who dealt constructively with me in that sphere will understand when I say that I am totally committed to high standards. I referred to the 1986 White Paper and the apprenticeship review group which was set up in 1988.  I referred also to employers who are not taking sufficient responsibility for training apprentices. The German system is constantly held up to us as the proper model for training apprentices.  Compared to the German system where employers must provide adequate on-the-job training and release apprentices for off-the-job training, Irish employers for the most part were not committed to apprenticeship training and systems were inflexible, provided too few opportunites for women, and did not facilitate late entrants.  Neither did the system reflect the fact that apprentices have higher education levels than in the past.</P>
    <P>The conclusions of the review group were published in December 1989 and then the question of a new apprenticeship system, including the proposals of the review group, was the subject of detailed discussions between the social partners during the negotiations on the current <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> in 1991.  The system was to be standard based.  To be recognised as a craft worker in future a person would have to have the national craft certificate. I spoke about the thousands of high fliers and the thousands who did not gain their final qualifications who had papers proving that they had spent four years doing something but not a certificate <Col N="1388" /> showing that they had reached the attainable standard and had qualified.  I hope that in the future such people will not fall away.</P>
    <P>We have made special provision for women.  FÁS has set targets for women plumbers, electricians, plasterers and brick layers and women are beginning to enter those crafts.  Hundreds of years of discrimination must be overcome in that area, including home conditioning, commercial market conditioning, environmental conditioning and so on.  In FÁS workshops which I have visited I have found one young female apprentice along with, perhaps, 11 men.  The young women assure me they are enjoying the course, that they are equal to their compansions but that they feel isolated.  ICTU developed a project which I launched some time ago to give peer help to young people or women in non-traditional training and employment so that they will not feel alone.  The entry of women into these profession is very slow and I exhort career guidance teachers to point out the possibility and potential in entering into non-traditional employment.  If women enter into apprenticeships in hairdressing, relating and finance, those areas will be opened up to provide more opportunites for them.  Of course there will be special provision for the disadvantaged, the disabled and mature entrants.</P>
    <P>The system will be based on uniform, pre-specified and industry agreed standards, on best international practice and on the needs of Irish industry.  Each apprenticeship will have seven phases, three off-the-job and four on-the-job. This modular structure allows for a certain degree of flexibility.  The rigidity of every trade needing four years training will go.  The higher minimum entry requirements reflect the general increase in education levels of school leavers.</P>
    <P>The apprenticeship system which incorporates best practice from our main European partners can be adapted for the extension of apprenticeship to further occupations.  Structured ongoing assessment will give more valid evidence of attainment during apprenticeship, getting <Col N="1389" /> away from the doggedness of time served.  Modular assessment makes it easier to up-date the system, which will be more transparent to users.</P>
    <P>The national crafts certificate will be a compulsory requirement for craftperson status as agreed in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> The new apprenticeship system will have nationally and internationally recognised certification which will provide for mobility.</P>
    <P>It is the intention that the training and assessment programmes in the new system should provide for progression to technical and other qualifications for persons who are able and interested in pursuing these options.  I have met people who have done certification courses in regional colleges or in the Dublin Institute of Technology who have gone on to do diploma and degree courses. At the degree awards ceremony in the Athlone Regional Technical College, I met a young person who had gone from being an apprentice to receiving his PhD. I have given a firm commitment to the ladder of progression for apprenticeships, so that there need be no barrier to a young person's learning curve. Apprenticeships in general are very fertile ground for people going into industry and for people starting up small industries.</P>
    <P>The new apprenticeship levy in the principal craft sectors of industry will ensure that the individual employer will not be directly out of pocket as a result of releasing an apprentice for off-the-job training or education, thereby providing an incentive to the employer to conform with the requirements of the apprenticeship curricula.</P>
    <P>Following discussions within the Central Review Committee of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> there was agreement on funding proposals in respect of the construction, motor, printing and paper, and engineering sectors, excluding electronics, which employ the vast bulk of our registered apprentices.  It is proposed to make apprentice payments while the apprentice is off-the-job and to contribute <Col N="1390" /> towards any associated travel and accommodation. The apprenticeship fund is to be created by the introduction in the four sectors of a new employer's apprenticeship levy under which employers will pay 0.25 per cent of payroll.</P>
    <P>We estatimate that the new levy will bring in approximately £4 million.  When the new levy is introduced the existing levy-grant system in the four sectors will be discontinued.  Under the existing arrangements, companies above certain payroll thresholds in the construction, engineering and motor sectors pay a 1.25 per cent levy and in the paper and printing sectors they pay a 1 per cent levy. Companies can recoup 80 per cent to 90 per cent of the cost of approved training programmes, depending on the sector involved.  Under the new regime, all registered companies will be subject to the levy of 0.25 per cent, thereby ensuring that all companies which stand to gain from the availability of a skilled workforce will be seen to contribute to the cost of providing that workforce.  The new funding arrangement is aimed at ensuring that there will be no direct costs to the individual employer in those sectors while the apprentice is released for off-the-job training or education.</P>
    <P>I have heard of a number of cases where new apprentices were taken on purely because of their relationship to or friendship with the owner of the company. Better qualified young people are ignored in that process and frequently have great difficulty in finding industry sponsors.  I want those involved in industry to know that we will not condone or allow the system to continue.  In conjunction with FÁS we are preparing a new system of equitable access to the apprenticeship schemes which I will submit to the House before the Bill concludes. I am keen to ensure that, in so far as possible, such favouritism is avoided and that there is equity in the recruitment process.</P>
    <P>I recognise, of course, that a proper balance must be struck, As taxpayers will contribute £30 million, they are entitled to know how the apprenticeship system works.  Therefore, I have asked the board <Col N="1391" /> of FÁS to submit proposals to address the issue urgently and effectively.  A sub-committee was established by the board and it will report to me shortly.</P>
    <P>In addition to seeking a new standards-based apprenticeship system for existing trades, the Programme for Government proposes to extend the trainee system to cover a greater number of occupations and to give certified training to those leaving Secondary education but not going on to third level.  This follows on the agreement in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> that additional occupations should be included in the apprenticeship system. The criteria which an occupation should ideally meet for this purpose have been agreed and an initial examination has produced 30 occupations which potentially meet those criteria.  Eight occupations have been evaluated in that regard and we hope to include some of them next year.  Those include gas fitters, operators of computer numerically controlled machine tools, operator-programmers, floor-wall tilers, print finishers, baker-confectioners &mdash; industrial or retail &mdash; hairdressers and retail sales persons.  We hope to recruit many more females to the system by expanding the number of apprenticeships.  We also hope to recruit women in the non-traditional occupations.</P>
    <P>This Bill is necessary to enable us to provide a mechanism to fund off-the job training of apprentices.  It is technical but straightforward and I hope it will lead to a thoughtful debate on the issue of apprenticeships.  While I will be outlining the details of the legislation on Committee Stage, I would like to summarise its main provisions.  Section 2 provides for the imposition of the levy on all employers in sectors which will be designed under section 3.  The section provides also that the employers shall not pass on the cost of the levy to the employee.  Section 3 gives the Minister power to designate the sectors which will pay the levy.  As I stated already, at the outset the agreed sectors will be construction, engineering, motor and paper <Col N="1392" /> and printing.  Section 4 provides that the proceeds of the levy will be used mainly to cover payment of off-the-job training allowances for apprentices.  Section 5 sets the levy of 0.25 per cent of reckonable earnings and section 9 provides for the collection of the levy by the Revenue Collector-General.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I will summarise the main reasons for the introduction of the apprenticeship levy.  Basically, it is designed to fund off-the-job training allowances for apprentices in the new apprenticeship system.  The new system will be a single national one and will be standards-based rather than simply on time served.  Standards will be based on best international practice.  Apprentices will be required to follow a specific course of training and to undergo a series of assessments to confirm the attainment of the required standards.  Training and assessment will take place both on and off the job.  A national craft certificate, which will be recognised nationally and internationally, will be awarded on successful completion of the apprenticeship. To be recognised as a craftsperson, a national craft certificate will be required.</P>
    <P>It is my aim to provide equitable access to the system and a report in that regard will be available before Report Stage. There was consensus among employers, employees, trade unions and the social partners on the introduction of the standards based system.  The arrangements for it were agreed over a period of years under the supervision of a committee following the introduction of the White Paper.  The levy will apply to all employers but many will pay less than they have been paying up to now.  It may be argued that small employers will be included but there is a certain dynamism in having a young person employed in any firm.</P>
    <P>I appeal to industry in general to take part in this scheme.  In difficult times people involved in industry should not move away from the idea of apprenticeships. In five or six years' time there will be a scarcity of skilled people in certain areas and we will wonder who is at fault and point the finger at certain <Col N="1393" /> agencies.  It is clear already that that will be the case by the year 2000.  People in industry can gain from this measure, but they are not putting their heart and soul into the apprenticeship scheme even though they have contributed to the ongoing debate on it.</P>
    <P>I thank the Chair for the latitude allowed to me and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears the Minister recognises that she is somewhat premature in presenting this Bill to the House when the key issue of concern to most Deputies has not been resolved, namely, the issue of fair access to the apprenticeship system.  She is aware that the State spends approximately £5,000 to £5,500 per annum on each apprentice in training.  That is a welcome opportunity for young people and is being financed in the main by the State.</P>
      <P>It is obvious from the brief document the Minister published some time ago that the system is totally unsatisfactory. That document states that FÁS will no longer sponsor apprentices, but will keep a register and bring it to the attention of employers on request.  That is the type of system that has brought FÁS into total disrepute.  It involves putting one's name on a list which will rot in some FÁS office. One's name can be identified by one's date of birth and can be called up on a computer screen at any time, but that does not benefit a person taking up an apprenticeship.  It is unacceptable that the system should continue to operate as it stands, where the sole responsibility for recruiting apprentices lies in the hands of individual employers.  There are alternative ways of recruiting such people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I welcome the Minister of State's statement that FÁS will present a paper on this issue as far as I am concerned the reform of the apprenticeship system has been on the cards for 20 years.  It is unrealistic to suggest two minutes before <Col N="1394" /> we endorse the new system that FÁS will achieve a major breakthrough.  They have failed to achieve this in the past 20 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 57 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1395" /> The Department of the Marine, at the beginning of October, wrote by registered post to every registered owner of a fishing vessel enclosing a copy of a discussion document on the management and development of the sea fishing fleet and setting out on a strictly provisional basis the fleet category into which his or her boat would be put.</P>
    <P>It was explained in the letter that the provisional categorisation of each boat is subject to review in the light of any appeal made or in the light of developments arising from the public consultations process.  Each owner was given a period of eight weeks to get back to the Department.</P>
    <P>I should explain that in the meantime a major consultation exercise has been undertaken entailing the following: as already mentioned, a copy of the document has been sent to every registered owner of a fishing boat; a detailed briefing has been given to representatives of the major fishing organisations; a series of widely advertised regional meetings have been held at ten locations nationwide at which the proposed policy has been explained in detail by senior departmental officials and local fishermen have had the opportunity of making suggestions and an overall input into the policy proposals; and written views have been sought on the document through advertisements in the papers.</P>
    <P>Further detailed discussions will be held with the fishing industry organisations early next year.  At that point there will be a full review of the proposals advanced in the discussion document with a view to meeting as far as this can be done all reasonable concerns expressed by fishermen.</P>
    <P>Pending the completion of the review process there is no change in the status of the provisional letters issued.  While the formal date for appealing this categorisation has passed, it has been made clear that a flexible attitude will be adopted to appeals received after the appeal date.  I would encourage any fishermen or women who consider that his or her boat has not been correctly classified to <Col N="1396" /> get in touch with the Department as early as possible.</P>
    <P>In drawing up the provisional categorisation lists the Department drew on all the information available to it on the recent fishing history of each boat.  It is probable that in the vast majority of cases there will be no dispute about this.  In some cases the information available to the Department may not be correct or there may be inadvertent administrative errors.  It is for this reason that every fisherman and woman has been advised of his or her boat's classification.  The appeals process involved is an administrative process and I can foresee no reason whatsoever why individuals should feel they would have to appeal to the courts to resolve any genuine claims that may be made.  In other words, I am suggesting that there are two other routes &mdash; they can appeal either to the Minister or the Ombudsman.  As fishermen have been hard done by they should not have to go to the expense of appealing to the courts.  That is the reason they should avail of the other option to resolve all genuine claims.</P>
    <P>I will deal in a more comprehensive manner with the general issue of an independent appeals mechanism in a reply to Question No. 54 on today's Order Paper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that it is unique to issue a discussion document to a group of fishermen or women and at the same time implement what is contained in that discussion document without consultation?  Does he agree that it was wrong to cause this scare among fishermen before the document was properly discussed?  Only then should he have taken the decision to categorise certain vessels.  Does the Minister agree that if there is to be categorisation the minimum we should do is put an independent appeals body in place so that the person who imposes the categorisation in the first place will not be asked to hear the appeal?  Will the Minister therefore withdraw these proposals until a proper discussion has taken place?  Irish fishermen are finding it difficult enough at present without being <Col N="1397" /> placed in the position where they will be confined to certain areas irrespective of whether this is economically viable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>In my reply I outlined the sequence of events.  A document was composed and produced.  This dealt with a number of issues, including decommissioning and categorisation.  In addition, a letter was produced and I think the Deputy has seen this letter in which the word &ldquo;provisional&rdquo; is used three times.  I realise that this letter was the cause of concern for some fishermen who saw it as a legal document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>However, that was far from the case.  A series of ten meetings was then held with various fishing organisations and communities.  I understand that a number of other communities have asked to meet the officials of the Department of the Marine who addressed those ten meetings.  This is in keeping with our obligations as members of the European Union.  For the first time in the history of a Government Department the process of democratisation is taking place.  As the Deputy said, the letter was the source of concern but there is no question of withdrawing it.  There will be flexibility in relation to the due date, 28 November. The discussions are ongoing.</P>

      <P>Regular liaison takes place between the Department of Defence, the Department of Justice and the Revenue Commissioners and work is in progress on proposals to co-ordinate and strengthen the co-operation between the various Government agencies involved in dealing with the problem of drug trafficking.  The Department of Justice, as the agency with primary responsibility for law and order, is taking the initiative in this regard.  The exercise will also address the level of resources required to tackle the problem, including the question of greater use of the Naval Service and Air Corps.  The question of whether legislative changes are necessary will also be considered.  My own opinion is that they are not necessary.</P>
      <P>In the meantime I wish to emphasise that the present level of co-operation, which has resulted in major seizures of illegal drugs off the Irish coast in recent months, is very satisfactory.  I would like to pay tribute to all the personnel involved in those operations including the ongoing operation which has resulted in the recovery of a substantial amount of cannabis resin from the seabed off Kinsale.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the Minister in congratulating those involved in seizing the cannabis.  Would the Minister <Col N="1400" /> agree that the Naval Service can only operate in aid of the civil power and that, therefore, there is a real weakness in the legislation?  If the Naval Service suspects a particular vessel of being involved in trafficking drugs, arms or explosives, they can telephone the Department of Defence which, in turn, will contact the Garda Síochána and, if necessary, a member of the Garda Síochána will be transported to the Naval Service vessel. In the meantime the suspect vessel may disappear from the scene.  Will the Minister, in conjunction with his colleague, the Minister for Justice, extend to the Naval Service in such cases the powers they now have to board fishing vessels which they suspect of being in breach of the law?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Deputy's point, but having seen modern marine technology at first hand I think that any vessel trying to disappear from the scene of a crime might find it difficult to do so. Nowadays it is very easy to pinpoint such vessels.  As to the need or otherwise for legislation, the main peace-time functions of the Naval Service includes fishery protection, sea search and rescue and aiding the civil power, which means assisting the Garda Síochána when requested.  Proposals designed to secure the best arrangement for achieving a cohesive and co-ordinated response to drug trafficking by existing law enforcement agencies are being formulated.  The Department of Justice, as the agency with primary responsibility for law and order, is taking the initiative in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Personnel of the Naval Service are empowered under the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959 to board, search and detain fishing vessels suspected of illegal fishing activity.  The Naval Service also provides assistance on request to other Department and Government agencies.  The Revenue Commissioners have power under customs and finance legislation to authorise members of the Defence Forces to act as officers of customs and excise.  I am not aware that the existing legislation is in any way insufficient. My personal view, which I would <Col N="1401" /> not like the Attorney General or anybody else to be bound by, is that legislative changes are not necessary.  However, that question is being addressed and any action required will be taken in the light of recent and anticipated events.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have made a submission to the Department of Finance for EU funding for maritime surveillance resources to combat the illegal importation of drugs.  Should the application for funding be successful, it is likely that some of the funds will be allocated to provide additional resources for the Defence Forces and for the Naval Service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarClohessy" hpid="Mr. Clohessy Mr. Clohessy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>Recently huge consignments of drugs were found off the coast.  I do not know if the authorities were aware that those drugs were on the seabed or if they were discovered by accident.  We had to find a boat from another country to help to recover them. It seems that our Naval Service is unable to deal adequately with the problem. That sea around our coast is now the centre of the drug business for the European market.  More vigilance must be exercised and an assurance given that this will be combated at the highest level.  I welcome what the Minister had to say in regard to funds for surveillance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the matter is being dealt with at the highest level.  It was an accident that the French trawler came upon the cannabis; it was a fishing vessel and had trawling facilities.  The three Naval Service vessels, <i>Deirdre, Aoife</i> and <i>Ciara</i> have been at the scene of the drug discovery in succession since Wednesday, 24 November. The reason the French fishing vessel was used to recover the drugs from the seabed is that it was equipped to manage such work and had a trawling facility.  Naval patrol vessels are designed for fishery protection duties and are not equipped for deep trawling work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 61 and 104 together.</P>
      <P>Under the Iberian Act of Accession the fisheries aspects of the Act fall for review by the end of this year.  Accordingly in June last the Commission submitted proposals to the Council of Fisheries Ministers to modify the terms of that Act in certain key respects.  The principal elements of that proposal envisaged:</P>
      <P> (i)  the abolition of the basic and periodic lists of boats entitled to fish in Community waters; and</P>
      <P>(ii)  the removal of all special controls on the Spanish and Portuguese fleets and their replacement in the meantime by unspecified measures applying on a Community wide basis. </P>
      <P>In addition, the Commission made no proposals for the renewal of the Irish Box which under the terms of the Act of Accession is due to lapse by the end of 1995.  Instead, the proposals tabled envisage full access for the Spanish and Portuguese fleets to all EU waters outside twelve miles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was no substantive discussion of <Col N="1403" /> this matter at the June Council but I did take the opportunity of indicating that any significant change in the present arrangements, including any changes to the Irish Box, would have major direct implications for control, conservation and territorial fishing patterns in the Irish zone and that I had major difficulties with the Commission proposal.</P>
    <P>The matter was considered in some detail at the Council of Fisheries Minister's on 22 November last.  The Commission proposal, as well as a tentative Presidency compromise, came up for discussion. I made it clear in the strongest terms that neither the Commission proposal nor the Presidency compromise was acceptable.  I explained to Council the importance and sensitivity of the issue to the Irish Government and Irish fishermen. I stressed that, from a control perspective, the track record of the Spanish fleet in the Irish economic zone was most unsatisfactory.  In particular I pointed out that (a) one out of every two Spanish vessels boarded is detained for serious fishery offences; (b) nearly three quarters of these vessels were in breach of the terms of the Iberian Act of Accession; (c) apart from these breaches, the vessels concerned also had serious infringements relating to log books and undersized fish; (d) since Accession, 40 per cent of the vessels on the basic list have been arrested for serious offences; and (e) recently, a new problem &mdash; secret holds &mdash; had come to notice and eight vessels have been detained over the last year. I also stressed that the capacity of the Spanish fleet far exceeded the resources available to that fleet.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the Presidency compromise proposal presented serious problems for me.  It envisaged (i) the repeal of the basic and periodic list systems, (ii) the provisions of alternative Community-wide measures, and (iii) the removal of the Irish Box.  It also failed to link the level and pace of the easing of specific controls on the Spanish fleet with the resolution of the serious over-capacity problem in the fleet.  In response I insisted that the list system and the Irish <Col N="1404" /> Box be retained pending the adoption of suitable alternative measures and that the possibility of applying measures which are specific to the Spanish fleet be maintained.</P>
    <P>This matter will come up for decision at the Fisheries Council on 20 and 21 December.  I can assure Deputies that I am fully aware of the gravity of the issues involved and that no effort will be spared in securing the best possible outcome. In advance of decisions to be taken at Council, I do not feel it would be prudent to speculate on possible actions in the EU Court although I should mention that I have placed a reserve on legal grounds on the proposals at present before the Council.</P>
    <P>For the added information of Members, I have been in touch with the President of Council of Fisheries Ministers since this parliamentary question was tabled and he has agreed to meet me next Tuesday to address the various proposals before the Council on 20 and 21 December.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by the Minister.  He should make a more challenging case to the Europen Union to ensure that access to Irish waters by Iberian fishing vessels will not be allowed from 1 January 1996. Access should be deferred for five years pending results of negotiations the Minister is seeking to initiate.  He should take off the kid gloves in his approach.  In view of the numerous violations of fishing regulations by Spanish boats during the past ten years, the Minister will have to take this matter to the European Court of Human Rights.  He will have to go to the end of the road to preserve our fishing stocks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I will place a reserve on the question of a legal challenge to the European Court of Justice.  I made one of the strongest interventions in the history of fish councils in relation to this <Col N="1405" /> problem.  I spoke for a period in excess of 30 minutes and set out the Irish case in a strong, deliberate and succinct way. There was dead silence during the currency of my intervention.  As a direct result of my contribution I believe it may have convinced a number of countries who have a common interest in the removal of the Irish Box that their interests may be contravened by the Iberian Act of Accession.  From this country's point of view the common fisheries policy was a bad deal and it continues to cause us serious problems.  I am fully aware of the seriousness of the position from the point of view of the Irish fisherman.  I am not certain there is much we can do about the Irish Box but in its place I can introduce the strongest possible conservation measures and other measures directed at the Spanish fleet which will indicate our concerns about its performance to date.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 90 together.</P>
      <P>The Curragh Camp is of considerable size, extends over an area of 700 acres and includes six separate military barracks. The adjoining rifle range lands comprise some 800 acres and the remainder of the Curragh lands, some 2,500 acres, excluding the racecourse, are subject to sheep grazing rights.</P>
      <P>The question of refurbishing buildings at the Curragh is one that remains under regular review in the light of the ongoing requirements of the Defence Forces. Since 1989, repairs and maintenance works costing over £3.180 million have been undertaken at the Curragh.  Much as I would like to see substantially more resources made available at the Curragh, the reality is that the problem has to be considered in the context of competition for scarce resources.  This also applies to the issue of establishing a military museum at the camp.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that I share his concerns and will keep his views in mind when decisions are made in relation to these matters.</P>

The staff of the hospital includes two medical officers, a pharmacist, a matron, an assistant matron, a staff sister and 12 ward sisters.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 9 and 25 together.</P>
      <P>The sole current involvement of Irish troops in UN peace enforcement missions is the provision of a transport company to UNOSOM II in Somalia.  This commitment will expire at the end of February 1994 and the question of its continuance beyond that date will be reviewed beforehand.  Moreover, as required by section 4 of the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1993, I shall be making a report to this House on the operation of the mission as soon as may be in the new year.</P>
      <P>There is at present no request from the UN for this country to contribute troops to any other peace enforcement operation. Any such request would receive due consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>In my question I asked the Minister if he intends meeting with the UN Secretary General to discuss the whole question of peace enforcement. Will the position of the Irish Government change as a result of the US decision to withdraw its 25,000 troops from Somalia in March next?  Would he agree that the whole concept of peace enforcement is in danger if a large country such as the US does not provide troops to carry out such a mission?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no plans to visit the United Nations Secretary General, but should the need arise in relation to any issues affecting Irish involvement in the operations I would do so immediately. As the Deputy knows, in advance of the 80 man transport unit going to Somalia I visited the area to see first hand the difficulties to be anticipated, and that would be my mind-set in relation to the question raised by the Deputy.  As regards non-participation by the United States, we are a sovereign nation and we must make our decisions independently of other countries.  I agree that United States withdrawal would leave a vacuum, but I understand from the contemporary literature on Somalia that there is a general trend towards what might be described as the Africanisation of the mission.  I am not sure that is a good principle but it is the general thinking at present.</P>
      <P>Section 4 of the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1993, requires me to report to the House on the up-to-date position of the mission in Somalia and I will do that.  The troops are doing an excellent job in Somalia and are performing exceptionally well, as have all our troops since taking up peace-keeping duties in 1958. I would like to think that our troops would continue to operate in Somalia for the foreseeable future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I recently had reason to visit the UN with the other members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and I got the distinct impression that the whole concept of peace enforcement is being very carefully considered in light of what has happened to date in Somalia. For that reason my question relates not only to Somalia but to the whole concept of peace enforcement.  Would the Minister agree that in view of the deserved reputation of the Irish in terms of involvement in UN activities, it would be a good idea for him to have the benefit, as we had, of discussing the whole concept of peace enforcement in the United Nations before coming back to this House in February with a recommendation?  Would he agree that the concept of peace enforcement <Col N="1410" /> cannot be pursued without involvement of a country such as the United States which has the military power and numbers to supply the troops, not only for transport reasons but, if necessary, for day to day combat reasons?  Therefore, this whole concept should be carefully considered.  I respectfully suggest that the Minister visit the United Nations to discuss this whole concept before reporting back to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter that I cannot dismiss lightly and I will certainly consider it.  My philosophy always has been that the Defence Forces should be seen primarily in a peace-keeping context. The 1993 Act was introduced to give effect to a request from the United Nations to become involved, for the first time in the history of our country, in a mission of a different type.  We responded to that request because I thought it was very important that we do so.  In relation to peace-keeping generally, the political direction is the one to take.  In Somalia the military option was taken, the pursuit of Adid and so on, and that was the wrong course of action.  If there is a political solution to the problem in a peace-keeping context we should pursue it.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 11, 18, 24 and 29 together.</P>
      <P>Over the past few years approximately 14,000 persons have applied for enlistment in the Permanent Defence Force. Details of recruitment to, and wastage from, the Permanent Defence Force since 1990 are contained in a tabular statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards recruitment to the Defence Forces, I expect to be in a position to make an announcement in this matter shortly.  The conditions of service for new <Col N="1412" /> recruits are at present under review, including that relating to the period of engagement.  The question of enlisting new recruits for a fixed period is under consideration, the main reason being to allow greater scope for regular intakes of recruits each year.  The Defence Forces need a regular injection of &ldquo;young blood&rdquo; in order to maintain operational effectiveness.  As Deputies will be aware the present age profile is unsatisfactory. Arising from the improvements in pay and conditions in recent years, the numbers of non-commissioned personnel leaving the force voluntarily has dropped substantially &mdash; from about 90 per month in 1988 to about 25 per month at present.</P>
    <P>The current basic rate of pay for a private 3 star, about six months after recruitment, is £215.52 per week.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the conciliation and arbitration scheme for the Permanent Defence Force, arrangements are being made to consult PDFORRA regarding the proposed criteria for enlistment.</P>
    <P>The following is the statement:</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm whether the report in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 13 November is correct, that it is intended to offer three year contracts to new recruits to the Defence Forces? Would the Minister agree that this suggests that as soon as people are trained they would leave?  This will cost more in the long term instead of saving money. Will the Minister agree that discipline and the concept of building a career will disappear if recruits know they are only being recruited for three years?  I respectfully suggest to the Minister that it would be disastrous if the Government, for short term cost saving purposes, destroyed morale and discipline in the Defence Forces by recruiting soldiers on a contract basis.  That would be the last straw.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>With the greatest respect, I would not necessarily agree with the Deputy, and I will tell him why. The morale of these young people, who would go through a system where there is decency, discipline and all the other necessary requirements to become part of the Defence Forces, would be greatly improved.  It has not yet been decided whether the period should be three or five years.  Neither has full consideration been given to the proposal.  It is at an embryonic stage at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">

      <P>As I said, the proposal is at an embryonic stage.  The question of enlisting recruits for a fixed period is under consideration.  In accordance with the conciliation and arbitration scheme for the Permanent Defence Force, arrangements are being made to consult with PDFORRA in that regard.</P>

      <P>After three years these recruits would be highly trained three star private soldiers.  Will such soldiers have the option of re-joining the Defence Forces after three years, at which stage they will be fully trained?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The main reason for the proposed fixed term contract is to allow greater scope for regular intakes of recruits each year.  The Defence Forces need a regular injection of young blood to maintain its operational effectiveness. Arising from improvements in pay and conditions in the Defence Forces in recent years, the number of non-commissioned <Col N="1415" /> personnel leaving voluntarily has decreased substantially from approximately 90 per month in 1988 to approximately 25 per month at present.  The proposed fixed term contract would enable a much larger number of young people to avail of valuable training and experience in the Defence Forces.  It is proposed that a limited number of personnel would be given the option of extending their service after the initial contract period had expired, presumably on the basis of their performance during the contractual period.  This proposal will have to be acceptable to PDFORRA&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Question No. 10 in the name of Deputy Eamon Gilmore asks the Minister to indicate the numbers currently on waiting lists for recruitment to the Defence Forces.  If the Minister gave that figure in his reply I did not hear it.  In view of the reports that the Department is expected to spend approximately £1.7 million on a recruitment campaign, may I ask him to indicate the rationale behind the spending of this amount of money if there are large numbers on waiting lists who have indicated their interest in joining the Defence Forces?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department is required to advertise for recruits in the ordinary way.  As I said in my initial reply, 14,000 people are on the waiting lists.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>In the event of a recruitment campaign going ahead, the Department would place an advertisement in <Col N="1416" /> the newspapers, to which, presumably, those 14,000 people would respond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>How much does the Minister think a recruitment campaign will cost?  The report in the <i>Irish Independent</i> by the security correspondent, Tom Brady, estimates that the Department will have to spend £1.7 million on a recruitment campaign. Given that it is intended to fill 500 places, this seems to be an extraordinary cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>A recruitment campaign <i>simpliciter</i> will not cost £1.7 million.  I think the cost covers the induction and payment of the personnel during the first part of their training.  The cost does not refer solely to the placement of advertisements in the newspapers.  The Deputy may be forgiven&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Having regard to the number of Naval Service ships tied up in port at present due to the lack of manpower, I ask the Minister to give special consideration to the recruitment of additional personnel to this service. As a former member of the Naval Service who signed a contract for nine years, I know the problems being experienced in this area.  Having regard to the large finds of drugs off our coast, it is not appropriate that these ships should be tied up in port due to a lack of manpower.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the Deputy has a special knowledge of the Naval Service.  As in the case of all sectors, recruitment to the Naval Service will be done in an even-handed way.  I hope the three arms of the Defence Forces will be accommodated in any recruitment campaign. The lack or otherwise of personnel in the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps will be examined in the context of any recruitment campaign.  No special consideration can be given to one arm <Col N="1417" /> of the Defence Forces over others but, having regard to the Deputy's question, I will look at the position in regard to the Naval Service.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The same principle is being applied by banks which are exploiting young people.  They take them in and then throw them out.  If the Minister is talking about providing a social service in terms of giving people training and discipline, will he not agree that it is important to bring the strength of the Defence Forces somewhere near the establishment figure before he starts recruiting personnel for three years? That is the point I was making.  Whether or not the Minister likes it, these recruits will be known as yellow pack recruits.  At present financial institutions, in an effort to avoid the legislation, are recruiting people, letting them go after a certain period and recruiting them again after six or nine months, thus destroying the career prospects of these young people. The Minister should not condone anything during his term of office which would in any way diminish the respect which exists for members of our Defence Forces, whether they are serving abroad or a home.  I am afraid that the recruitment of personnel on a three-year contract basis could destroy the sense of pride and discipline in the Defence Forces, which has been built up over a number of years.  It would be a retrograde step if this happened.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is being somewhat unfair to me in that since I took up responsibility for the Department of Defence I have tried to give the Defence Forces a status and create a new awareness of their contribution.  His criticism in that regard is a little unjust.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no problem with it one way or the other.  I just wanted to put that on the record of the House.</P>
      <P>On the question of the three-year contract, nothing has been finalised in that regard.  It is only a proposal but if it becomes a reality, people will know from the advertisement exactly what they are letting themselves in for and they can decide, through the use of their own free will, whether it is acceptable to them. To suggest that they are being given the king's shilling to go into the Defence Forces is quite wrong.  If my son wanted to go into the Defence Forces for three or five years, I would be very pleased and proud.  He would probably learn a trade that would be of advantage to him when he left the Army and he would return to Civvy Street a very well prepared young man.  I think it is a very good idea.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Andrews) Minister for the Marine (Mr. Andrews)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 31, 55, 64, 96, 97 and 103 together.</P>
      <P>Let me say at the outset, to allay any fears that might exist amongst the legitimate salmon fishing community, that there are no proposals to introduce a compulsory ban on salmon drift netting. I recognise, however, that in the longer term the balance of advantage on conservation, environmental and economic grounds will lie increasingly with redirecting salmon stocks away from commercial towards recreational fishing.</P>
      <P>Legal netting of salmon is a long established practice in many of the remote coastal areas in Ireland and the income from such fishing activity plays an important role in sustaining traditional fishing communities.  The management of any change, therefore, from commercial towards recreational fishing must, because of its socio-economic consequences, be carried through with great sensitivity, on a gradual basis and by consensus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To advance this a full review of drift netting policy is being carried out within the Department of the Marine.  On receipt of this review I intend to engage in a full consultative process with all groups interested in the management and exploitation of this resource.  The review will obviously consider the recommendations of all the various reports published, both nationally and internationally, including <Col N="1421" /> the salmon review group report published here in 1988.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to refer to the point commonly made that Ireland is the only country in the North Atlantic to allow this form of fishing.  In this regard it should be borne in mind that the United Kingdom still practices this form of netting in a number of locations along its coast with a substantial drift net fishery off the Northumberland coast.  I recognise that the United Kingdom has indicated its intention to phase out this fishery, but over a substantial timeframe.</P>
    <P>Negotiations on the cessation of fishing off the coasts of the Faroe Islands and Greenland were completed after considerable deliberations and are for a limited period of time &mdash; I understand five years.  It should be noted that most of the salmon taken off the coasts of the Faroes and West Greenland belong to us, the Canadians and the Norwegians.  They originated not in local rivers but in the rivers of countries like Ireland, the UK, Norway and Canada.  The salmon heading for Irish rivers that are taken in the Irish drift net fishery are mostly of Irish origin.  What we have, we hold.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister intend implementing the recommendation of the review group to allow the use of monofilament nets?  I understand that was one of its recommendations.  If that is the case we will need to have strict controls in relation to, for instance, the number of days allowed, the period in which fishing would be allowed, the length of netting and so on.  Will the Minister assure the House that certain rules and regulations will be put in place in this area and that whatever regulations are agreed upon will be enforced in the interest of the whole fishing industry and our tourism industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to monofilament netting, I find it anathema to the whole concept of fair play.  As long as I am Minister for the Marine I would like to assure this House and anyone else who cares to listen that monofilament net will not be part of my stock in trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1422" /> On the question of regulation and enforcement, I give an undertaking to Deputy Barrett and the House that in the event of the recommendations of the review group being acceptable, I will certainly have the regulations enforced very thoroughly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in some areas, at least during last season, salmon drift net fishermen fared very poorly, principally, it is alleged, because of drift net fishing by foreign trawlers on the northern part of our coast?  He did not indicate in his reply whether he intends taking any action in that regard and if he will improve the vigilance of the Naval Service with regard to salmon fishing.  I know that in other cases vigilance has been stepped up somewhat but salmon fishing in particular suffered very badly last year.  Will the Minister take any action in the future in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to be confrontational but last year the salmon had a good run down the west coast.  I understand the Naval Service has done a very good job in protecting the salmon run. There is a crossroads at the top north west of the island, at which salmon go in different directions and return to their native rivers.  The Naval Service is doing an excellent job in protecting the return of salmon to their native rivers.  I believe that is the reason we had such a good run of salmon this past year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">

      <P>Will the Minister indicate when his Department's policy review will be completed and whether he proposes to publish its outcome?  Will he confirm whether it is true that, as reported, that review does not include consideration of a ban, or even a partial ban, on commercial drift-net fishing even where such may be desirable to protect stocks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the publication of the review I can tell the Deputy, yes, that will be published but, in advance of its publication, naturally <Col N="1423" /> there will be consultation with the people most concerned, the drift-net fishermen.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>No, a ban is too provocative. I do not like banning things, nor do I like preventing people doing things.  I prefer to urge people to do things, through consultation or consensus, through the democratic process. There is no question of banning people. There may well be a number of issues considered in relation to existing licences, for example, licences which have not been taken up or used could be abolished.  I understand that altogether there had been some 900 licences which are now down to some 600.  The usage of those 600 licences could be examined within the context of the overall review but the question of banning or not banning does not arise in my vocabulary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat amused at the Minister saying, on the one hand, he would not ban anything while, on the other, saying he would not even legalise the use of monofilament nets.  If the Minister has his ear to the ground he must be aware that, over the past ten years, the only type of net used by drift-net fishermen here has been monofilament, that indeed this State allows the importation of such monofilament net.  I might remind him that the Minister for Finance collects <Col N="1424" /> value-added tax from such importation. In the interest of common sense so far as drift-net fishermen are concerned, would the Minister consider legalising the use of monofilament net provided that the season and the fishing week were shortened by the fishermen in question, which would be of greater advantage to the conservation of fish stocks than endeavouring to outlaw the use of monofilament nets which have been in use here for the past decade?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy said, of course, the use of monofilament net is illegal.  Therefore, the question of banning or not banning does not arise, except that I could introduce legislation in the House, make regulations or resort to whatever other legal methods would be required.  I am afraid I do not agree with the Deputy; I consider the useage of monofilament net anathema to fair play and justice.  Indeed, I owe it to this and future generations, to conserve salmon, that is <i>salmo salar,</i> which is like the white trout we are trying to conserve for our heritage.  The usage of monofilament net is simply unjust.</P>
      <P>I take the Deputy's point and have discussed this with the fishermen about whom he is speaking, people with small farms.  I know that these fishermen come from communities who, to a large extent, rely on this activity for their livelihood.  I have the greatest respect for them.  This argument and case has been made by them and on their behalf but I am afraid I do not agree with it.  If there was any other way I could help them I would be glad to do so.  If the Deputy has an alternative suggestion to the usage of monofilament netting, I would be glad to look at it and at as many suggestions he might care to bring to my attention.  I do not want to create pain among these peripheral communities.  My political philosophy, and that of the party of which I am a member, supports them, wants to support them; in fact wants to encourage people from urban areas to move to those places, to repopulate rather than depopulate them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>One must respect the Minister's view.  Without going into the agrument of whether it is a good or bad thing what bothers me is that, if their usage is illegal &mdash; and the Minister says there is no way he will render it legal as long as he is in office &mdash; the regulations and laws are not being enforced.  Would he agree that there is no point in having laws if they are not enforced because it brings the overall sense of adherence to such rules, regulations and laws into disrepute, which is what bothers me about the fishing scene?  We spoke earlier about the Spaniards not having respect for our laws.  As the Minister rightly said, half of those who are intercepted break the laws every day of the week, yet they expect us to give them access to our waters as and from 1 January 1996.  Since fishing is so important to these peripheral communities who have no other income, would the Minister agree that, whatever we do, the rules and regulations should be obeyed and respected, in the interests of tourism, fishing and of conservation? It makes me sad to read in the daily newspapers reports of one group having a go at another which all boils down to the fact that, whatever rules, regulations and laws obtain, they are being ignored because people do not accept them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy said, the laws are there but people would appear not to accept them.  I do not intend to go down the road of political correctness or of political purity.  We have our historic legacies and hang-ups about law, how it might apply to somebody else but not necessarily to mé féin.  I accept the Deputy's general principle, that if there is a law, it should be applied even-handedly, should work and be seen to work and, if it does not, or is not seen to work, then it falls into disrepute.  There is nothing more I can add.</P>

      <P>Ireland's investment programme under the Community STRIDE &mdash; Science and Technology for Regional Innovation and Development &mdash; Initiative 1991-93 amounts to £13.5 million.  The EU is providing some £10 million, or 75 per cent of the funding, with the balance being met from national contributions by the State and private investment.</P>
      <P>This co-financed programme has been directed at developing research, innovation and technological capacity in the four natural resource areas of marine, environment, forestry and food.  It has been undertaken under the overall lead of the Department of the Marine.</P>
      <P>The natural resource area was chosen as the theme of the Irish STRIDE programme in recognition of the considerable development potential of the sector.  Renewable resources offer immediate and genuine opportunities for sustainable economic development and job creation.  I am very pleased that the Commission, in approving and co-financing the programme, endorsed the natural resources approach and accepted the need to apply additional resources to secure and develop their potential.</P>
      <P>The expenditure to date under the programme has already strengthened the technological capacity of the resource areas concerned through the upgrading and equipping of research laboratories and facilities.  There has also been a significant mobilisation of the natural resource research effort which is helping to bring about a real level of technology transfer from research institutions out to the industries themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly pleased by the recognition given to marine research and development under the STRIDE programme by providing for a total investment of £8 million in the marine area over the period.  This investment has enabled us, for the first time, to address the need to build up the national capability <Col N="1427" /> in marine science and technology. The objective is to stimulate and encourage the growth of marine-related research activities and to support the development of the marine and fisheries resource.</P>
    <P>The funding has been spread through the key marine centres of expertise in the country.  The Department's Fisheries Research Centre, the Martin Ryan Marine Science Institute at University College Galway and the Hydraulics and Coastal Management Laboratory at University College Cork have each benefited under STRIDE.  In addition, there has been a substantial upgrading of the national research vessel, the &ldquo;Lough Beltra&rdquo; and the establishment of a new Marine Data Centre.  These developments have immediate, positive implications for the marine research community, related industries throughout the country and will enable Ireland to play a greater role in European marine science programmes.</P>
    <P>The economic effects and benefits of the Irish STRIDE programme in its totality will be comprehensively evaluated in consultation with the EU Commission, following completion of all project expenditure at the end of 1994.  In the meantime, the Department proposes to carry out an interim assessment of the economic impacts of the STRIDE investment to date throughout the four natural resource areas.  This will get underway shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree in view of the importance of research, particularly in the European context, that the sum mentioned is relatively small in comparison with other investment in research?  Would he accept that this is really a matter for the European Union, if we are to develop the whole fisheries area throughout Europe?  Since Ireland has 16 per cent of EU waters a considerable level of investment should be made in the whole area of marine research by the European Union.  This is one area where Ireland could benefit by being recognised as the marine research <Col N="1428" /> member state of the European Union. Would he agree that we have an ideal case in view of the fact that we have 16 per cent of EU waters?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy and the case he has made.  He has made a statement of fact.  As the Deputy may be aware, Ireland is due to receive £10.125 million out of a total European Union take of £400 million ECU or approximately 3.3 per cent.  The STRIDE Programme covers Objective I regions where the <i>per capita</i> GDP is less than 75 per cent of the European Union average and Objective II B regions where large industries are in decline.  Eleven member states are in receipt of the STRIDE funds.  The Deputy is right in saying we should try to gain more finance for this very important part of the marine programme.  To put a philosophy into practice we must have research and development.  The Deputy has made a very good point and I agree with him.  As Minister for the Marine I will try to follow up on his suggestions with a greater intake in this area.</P>

    <P>My objective now is to ensure, subject to planning approval, that Dún Laoghaire port will be ready to take this high speed vessel within that timetable. <Col N="1429" /> In this context I have appointed a team of consultants to design ferry terminal facilities at Dún Laoghaire harbour.</P>
    <P>The team is working closely with the Dún Laoghaire Harbour Board and is consulting extensively with harbour users and all other interested parties in preparing the design for the ferry terminal facilities at the port.  In all over 25 groups are being consulted.  These groups include harbour users, public authorities and environmental interests as well as residents associations and the chamber of commerce.</P>
    <P>Final plans for the proposed development will be submitted for planning permission to Dún Laoghaire Corporation in the not too distant future.

The consultation process is very important.  When the planning application is lodged I hope we can proceed with the full support of the community of Dún Laoghaire because this facility will add a great deal to the whole economy of the area.  I want to assure him of my support.</P>

      <P>I am deeply appreciative of Deputy Barrett's support in this matter.  He has been extremely co-operative and concerned about the whole issue.  He shares my concern about what has happened in the past and what must happen in the future so far as the constituency of Dún Laoghaire is concerned. This is a national project which happens to be in Dún Laoghaire, one of the important gateways to Ireland.  Coincidentally, we happen to be the Dáil Deputies for the constituency.

      <P>One of the difficulties that every ferry port experiences is the problem of keeping people who come off the ferry in the area of the port for a period once they land in the country. Not having been involved in the briefing, may I ask the Minister whether provision is being made for examining that issue in the development of this new facility?</P>

      <P>I have already addressed that issue, more particularly in the context of the Carlisle pier which the 20th century passed by.  It is now emerging from the 19th century into the 21st century.  A sum of the order of £600,000 or £700,000 has been spent.  As <Col N="1431" /> a result that pier has been given a face lift.  There is provision for a restaurant to give foot passengers the comfort of being able to have a cup of tea or some type of hot meal.  In that complex, small though it may be, I have made available a facility for the local bed and breakfast interests. Generally that is the thinking which Deputy Barrett and I are pursuing.</P>
      <P>Of course, the proposals to update the car ferry terminal and bring it into the middle of the 21st century at one fell swoop is a different question altogether. The moneys required for that project will run into millions because we have to take account of the high speed Stena, which is a substantial advance in ferry travel for passengers, cars and lorries.  We are talking about sums of money of that order for a car ferry terminal that we would like to see in place some time in 1995.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Reform of the apprenticeship system has been on the agenda for 20 years and it is not satisfactory that the Minister should tell us at this stage that one of the key issues, equity of access to apprenticeships, is still unresolved and expect us to take in good faith that FÁS will produce a solution in the course of the Bill's passage through the House. Frankly, I do not believe FÁS will be able to do so.  We should not be debating this Bill when such an important component is still not in place.  As I said before we adjourned, it is clearly envisaged <Col N="1498" /> in the draft scheme that FÁS will keep a register of people interested in apprenticeships.  That is the type of system that has brought discredit on FÁS.  The last thing people want to do is to turn up at FÁS offices to put their name at the end of a long list which everyone knows will not be used by employers when recruiting apprentices. The scheme makes it quite clear that recruitment of apprentices will be the responsibility of employers and it makes it equally clear that employers have no obligation to consult this so-called register.</P>
      <P>In the Bill it is stated that the register will be brought to the attention of employers on request.  Clearly that is not satisfactory.  It is not intended that FÁS will sponsor apprenticeships under the new scheme so that the traditional gateway for people who do not have a background in a particular trade or skill of going to FÁS and getting an opportunity to compete for a place on an apprenticeship is wiped out by this reform.  That is not acceptable.  I think FÁS should be doing the screening and shortlisting of applicants for apprenticeships, and it should then present a short list of suitable people for interview if the employers are going to recruit people to apprenticeships. FÁS would then be the main determinant of suitability.  This would allow FÁS to control factors, such as the 10 per cent intake of women, to which the Minister has committed herself.  There is absolutely no guarantee that employers on a random selection will meet any quota in regard to disabilities, gender balance and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent report of the Commission on the Status of Women lays it on the line that it wants to see a timescale in which the target will be achieved and that the target should be achieved step by step so that in each year we would set a target and know how we had performed against it.  The reality is that under this scheme the Government will have no control over meeting the target unless it decides <Col N="1499" /> to subsidise employers to discriminate in favour of women.  That will add to the cost burden of the scheme for which the taxpayer is already providing very substantial sums.</P>
    <P>My main point is that I find it very difficult to accept this Bill against the background of that issue being unresolved. Of course, I will listen to what the Minister has to say in the course of Committee and Report Stages. However, at this stage I am sceptical about the role of FÁS because this issue has been through committees and subcommittees of the social partners for the past 20 years and it is very hard to believe that a chief executive or any other inspired person in FÁS will produce a solution to this question which appears to have defied solution in the 20 years to date.</P>
    <P>I welcome the change of emphasis to the attainment of standards in place of serving time.  That is a positive change.  I welcome also that there will be specified period of off-the-job training phased throughout the period of apprenticeship. However, I question whether the envisaged period of off-the-job training of 40 weeks is adequate.  It certainly would not be adequate that ten weeks per year be allocated to off-the-job training.  One of the main advantages of moving to a system of attainment of standards is that there would not be an obligation on apprentices to serve for a period of four years as their performance would be judged on the attainment of standard.</P>
    <P>As we are reforming our leaving certificate programme to encourage students to take a vocational element for that examination, it is clear that in the future more young people will leave second level education with much of the prior work done to equip them to complete apprenticeships quickly and effectively.  How does the Minister propose, though, to gel the new leaving certificate qualification <Col N="1500" /> for a vocational stream with entry into apprenticeships?</P>
    <P>It was interesting to see the recent NESC report on education and training, which showed that currently only 20 per cent of our pupils take vocational options compared with 50 to 60 per cent in Denmark and the Netherlands.  In reforming the apprenticeship scheme we should look at the models in other countries where more people take vocational modules in their basic training.</P>
    <P>I can see what the Minister is driving at in proposing to extend apprenticeships to a wider range of trades, but are we unwittingly going to end up with loading more and more of our training occupations into an apprenticeship system which has proved to be inflexible and difficult to reform?  When the Minister has achieved her target will we perhaps in five years' time be trying to reform the system to get something which is flexible and will respond to the needs of the workplace? We all want to see certification so that qualified people can have a standard that will be useful to them in other countries, but it is wrong to reverse training opportunities in a wide range of occupations into a system where the employers are controlling the entry.  In a few years time we could find that there is even more social exclusion as a result of decisions taken now.  I challenged the Minister to produce hard evidence that we are not making errors which we will regret.</P>
    <P>I am worried that many of the apprenticeships are in industries which are in serious decline.  The furniture industry is in serious difficulties.  There has been a 10 per cent decline in the building industry in the last three years.  When the State produced figures on unemployment in the building industry, they were astronomical and indicated that 25 per cent of building industry workers were unemployed. The trends were so awful that the Government did not produce figures they would not like to stand over.</P>
    <P>Are we developing a very expensive system of training for skills that are in decline?  We must provide for people in these <Col N="1501" /> areas, but it raises serious questions about who will control entry into these skills.  When there is overcapacity in a skill and many people with the skill are unemployed, there could be significant pressure from employers, who want to recruit a family member or to do a favour for someone, to recruit such people into an apprenticeship opportunity in a sector which is already oversupplied.  Are we handing over to employers the decisions about the levels of intake for these different skills?  I did not hear from the Minister how decisions about intake will be made and that is critical.</P>
    <P>FÁS has projected that a growth of 7,000 skilled people in the building industry will be needed in the next six or eight years.  If we had proper data on the skill base of our unemployed we might find that considerable numbers have the skills which we are gearing our training system to provide.  The newly recruited apprentice will clearly be much more attractive to an employer than someone who has completed training perhaps 20 years earlier and has been unemployed for six months.  We must balance the numbers of entrants against proper information on the skill base of the unemployed.  It is an indictment of successive Governments that we have not compiled appropriate information on the skill base and capacities of the unemployed.  Up to 1988 we had limited information, but that has not been replaced.  We need to tailor commitments made in the training area to the people already there and to make appropriate decisions about the numbers who will be trained in different skills at the taxpayers' expense.</P>
    <P>The levy is the core of this Bill, and I have some difficulties about it.  We are adding another quarter of 1 per cent to employment costs.  I recently spoke to a prominent business person in the services sector who told me that when businesses have paid 21 per cent PRSI, 21 per cent VAT and 40 per cent profits tax, they find that they have only 3p in the pound left to keep the businesses going.  The <Col N="1502" /> Minister may say that a quarter of 1 per cent is not very much, but it is still a quarter of one penny out of the 3p they have to keep the business going.  In many businesses the quarter of 1 per cent can be critical.</P>
    <P>I recognise that Ireland has a problem in that our employers have not been spontaneously willing to make commitments to training, as has been the case in other countries, and we are short of instruments to encourage people to get involved in training.  The levy system, plus the apprenticeship, is a bit like the old levy and grant system which was discredited and abolished.  The principle of it was clearly attractive in that people paid the levy and then were encouraged to draw down the benefit by recruiting. The principle in this proposal is attractive and businesses should see the value in taking on apprentices.  I hope employers will respond in that way, but I have misgivings about the fact that it costs another quarter of 1 per cent on top of a series of levies already there and there is no threshold.  It will clearly be a heavier burden on employers who employ lower paid workers.</P>
    <P>The proposal has all the undesirable features of levies as a system of taxation. I am disappointed that something a little bit more imaginative was not put together to produce an equitable lvey which would get a commitment to this scheme from employers.  Given that the Minister has assured us that employers have signed on for this scheme, we will have to give it the benefit of the doubt, hope that it works out that we see a greater commitment to training as a result.</P>
    <P>The jury is out in regard to the success of this scheme.  The one quarter of the 1 per cent levy reduces the Minister's leverage in negotiating a fairer system of entry into the trade.  Employers will regard themselves as having paid the piper and should, therefore, call the tune. If the Minister is determined to have equitable recruitment the one quarter of the 1 per cent levy imposed on employers <Col N="1503" /> may run counter to her determination. Employers will believe they have rights which they purchased by their tax payment and can, therefore, decide who should be recruited to the apprenticeship system.  We will not know the credibility of this proposal until we see the Minister's final proposals about the system of recruitment and her negotiations with employers.</P>
    <P>The issue of multi-skilling causes me considerable concern.  The reports published by Culliton and Tansey and Roche highlighted the weaknesses in our training regime.  Many of their findings are irrelevant to this debate, but they highlighted the lack of multi-skilling as a feature of the Irish workforce.  Will reform of the apprenticeship system address that matter?  In my view the designation system based on traditional demarcations is heading in the opposite direction to multi-skilling.  The introduction of multi-skilling should mean the abolition of demarcations.  We should produce flexible apprenticeships with modules that major in one skill and at the same time, carry important modules in others.  That is not provided for in the Minister's proposal. Rather, it appears the old demarcations have rumbled on into this system and we will be lumbered with what existed for the past 20 years.</P>
    <P>Some people believe that system has served us well and, in general, employers believe that FÁS contributed to the success of the scheme and that should be acknowledged.  However, are we flying in the face of those we pay to recommend where we should go in the future and who have said that multi-skilling must become a feature in this system?  Perhaps this system has evolved because traditionally it required low standards of entry and the introduction of multi-skilling will mean people will require higher educational qualifications.  That matter must be addressed also.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that the apprenticeship scheme should be open to people <Col N="1504" /> from the age of 16 who have obtained five grade Ds in their junior certificate but most people would not encourage students to leave school after sitting their junior certificate.  Have we faced up to that issue in introducing this apprenticeship scheme?  Should we not encourage such people to sit the leaving certificate and tailor the leaving certificate programme to encourage them to do so?  In that way, when they enter the apprenticeship system they would have the multi-skilling requirements and the flexibility we are told they will have to embrace in their future working lives.</P>
    <P>There is a hint of the past about the reform we are being asked to take on board today which causes me a great deal of unease.  I accept we are only debating the levy and not the apprenticeship system, but we are making do with second best in relation to reform of the apprenticeship programme.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note from documentation published by FÁS that the representation of women in some skilled areas is not as low as one would expect. For example, out of a total of 86,000 employed in the skilled production area, 15,000 are women, much more than 10 per cent.  Perhaps we are setting a low target by aiming at 10 per cent.  I would like to hear the Minister's view on how she expects to attract more women into the non-traditional areas of employment. The pre-apprenticeship training programme plays an important role in that regard but girls do not have an opportunity to study some of those subjects at school.  In other words, they are closed off at an early stage.</P>
    <P>I am sure Members from all sides will welcome the fact that there will be independent certification.  I did not have an adequate opportunity to study the Minister's contribution in detail, but I hope she will not base those certifications on the British system.  Rather, we should base them on the European model as recommended in many studies.  Evaluation is critical.  Under this legislation we <Col N="1505" /> are imposing a tax on employers and a duty on taxpayers to pick up the balance. Equally, there should be a commitment in the legislation to evaluation in the public area.  It is frustrating that any significant evaluation by FÁS were carried out in private and public representatives, who are expected to debate the value for money of State expenditure were not allowed access.</P>
    <P>During the recent debates on the national plan, it was particularly frustrating that we did not have access to basic information on the success of existing programmes.  That is particularly apposite of FÁS because, as far as I am aware, the statistics on which the evaluation for the last round of Structural Funds spending by FÁS were carried out in 1989.  They were compiled before the programme was initiated and we were expected to accept the worth of programmes based on figures collected as far back as 1989.  A proper evaluation must be carried out in public involving the social partners, particularly employers, who are being asked to pay for this scheme.  It must also involve others with skills in the evaluation of programmes.  It should not be left up to FÁS to evaluate its work.  Nobody should be allowed to make judge and jury decisions about the value of his or her work.  This programme should be evaluated aginst pre-set targets.</P>
    <P>The Minister should tell us the targets she expects the apprenticeship programme to achieve in respect of, for example, multi-skilling, the number of placements, the access of women to courses, the standards reached and so on.  We must have pre-set targets so that we know where the money is being spent, following which there must be an evaluation to ensure we achieve those targets.  We must compare ourselves with other countries. A series of studies have been carried out in the past six months by NESC, the Culliton group and Anto Kerins which compared training here with that in other countries and, universally, we <Col N="1506" /> are not up to scratch.  We must continually evaluate ourselves against our competitors and that is critical in regard to apprenticeships.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and commend the Minister of State for introducing it in the House promptly, in fulfilment of the commitment in the Programme for Government.</P>
      <P>This is a small but key element in putting in place a properly funded, planned, supervised and certified apprenticeship system.  This is essential bearing in mind the high level of youth unemployment and the urgent necessity to provide a world class workforce which will enable us to compete with our competitors in an open and difficult market.</P>
      <P>It is no harm to remind ourselves that the current position in relation to the training of apprentices is unacceptable and unsustainable.  Large numbers of young people who wish to undertake apprenticeship training are finding it impossible to do so.  It is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain places on long term courses.  Short term courses are no substitute for properly designed apprenticeship training leading to certification and the prospect of a good job.</P>
      <P>In addition, large numbers of young people are finding it impossible to find suitable sponsors.  This is unjust and unfair and represents a poor investment in our young people and the next generation. For this reason I welcome any move to put in place a proper system of apprenticeship training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any new system it is essential that there are proper procedures governing entry to apprenticeships.  Currently there is a lack of transparency.  Parents constantly complain that young people are sponsored not on the basis of their aptitude, ability or capability but rather on the basis of who they know within the industry.  This is unjust and unfair and it must be remedied.  I hope this legislation will be referred to a select committee so that we will have sufficient time to discuss <Col N="1507" /> any amendments.  In this regard I advise the Minister of State to ensure that there will be proper procedures governing entry into apprenticeships.</P>
    <P>There should be an official register in which young people who wish to take part in an apprenticeship scheme could be registered officially by a body such as FÁS.  Employers who wish to take on or sponsor apprentices would draw them from this register.  This is important and I ask the Minister of State to accept this suggestion.  As I said, large numbers of people have complained that there is a lack of transparency and equity.  Many parents feel aggrieved and complain that there is a lack of fair play in the system. We should ensure proper criteria governing the admission of young people into apprenticeships.  Deputy Bruton also mentioned that there was a need for proper controls governing entry.  We do not want to control the number of entrants but rather argue that in an effort to be fair people of equal ability should have an equal chance.</P>
    <P>This new apprenticeship system which is evolving will be employer led and standard based.  This presents us with an interesting set of possibilities and challenges. I suggest to the Minister of State that she will have her work cut out in making sure she gets a commitment from a large body of employers to ensure that the system will work well.  In this regard she will have to confer with the umbrella bodies for employers so that adequate provision is made within industry for on the job training.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer in particular to the current position in the construction industry.  There was a time when one could look to that industry to take on young people but the position has changed dramatically in recent years mainly due to the changes that have taken place within the industry.  It is now more splintered and fragmented with big companies contracting work to subcontractors who in turn contract it to <Col N="1508" /> others, so that at the end of the day what is everybody's business is nobody's business.  As a result very few people within the construction industry feel that they have a social obligation to look after apprentices.  There is a need therefore to put in place a proper system of apprenticeship training for trades within the construction industry, which will continue to be a major employer.  In turn, the industry should be prepared to take on its fair complement of young people.</P>
    <P>I advise the Minister of State to enter into dialogue with the industry to see if the current position can be improved and if a better system can be put in place.  It would be a tragedy if we found ourselves in a position where there was a shortage of people with skills.  There is a possibility that this could happen if we do not take the necessary steps.  The Minister of State must enter into dialogue with employers, particularly in the construction industry. If this apprenticeship scheme is to be employer led employers will have to be convinced that it will be of direct benefit and to give a strong commitment.  It is possible, as Deputy Bruton said, that they may see this as just another levy and one more demand but this can be justified given the obligation on all of us to make sure that we invest in our young people, bearing in mind the high level of unemployment.</P>
    <P>I want to say a number of things about standards.  I understand that the curriculum is being redesigned and revised. I ask the Minister to ensure that there is a very strong input from education as well as from training.  That is fundamentally important for a number of reasons.  The nature of the basic education often determines how far a person with initial training can go.  I have found that people with a good basic education to begin with become the people who are not satisfied with just basic training but are prepared to invest their own time in upgrading and updating their skills.  That is fundamentally important.  We must get right the mix as between formal education and <Col N="1509" /> training.  I hope that in the development and overseeing of the curriculum there will be a strong input both from education and training.</P>
    <P>If we are to attain the kind of standards set out in this Bill &mdash; and I see no reason why we should not &mdash; it is important to train apprentices in such a way that they will have the kind of mobility that will enable them to work abroad; even while training, they could move about between member countries of the EC.  If that is to be our objective there will have to be a certain element of modern language learning in addition to off-the-job training. Simply put, if a good keen and skilled apprentice wants to do an exchange programme with a counterpart in Germany, Denmark or Holland it is most important to have fluency in the relevant spoken language.  We should not put barriers on young people's potential.  People who want to take up the kind of apprenticeship schemes that we have in mind ought to be offered some element of modern language training because the kind of certification we have in mind here will be of such a standard as to enable them to work on a par with their counterparts in other European countries. Giving them the narrow skills without the communication skills is not enough.  I ask the Minister to bear that in mind and make sure that modern European languages are included in the training of young people and that generally there is an emphasis on communication.</P>
    <P>I would like to see well-trained apprentices with the kind of motivation required to set up their own businesses and become employers themselves.  There was a time when we had the culture of the workshop or the cornershop.  People worked for themselves and offered their services to the general public.  Once qualified, they saw themselves not so much as employees but as people working for themselves who, in turn, would develop and become employers.  In working out the educational module for off-the-job training it is important to incorporate <Col N="1510" /> management skills so that people trained under the apprenticeship scheme will in ten years' time be able to work for themselves.</P>
    <P>This is the kind of sea-change that we need to bring about in this country, and we must aim for it at every level of education and training.  We must aim to put in place the kind of enterprise culture that we talk about.  Often the people who are attracted to the trades and crafts are very enterprising and creative people by nature.  They are the people who are prepared to experiment and go into business in their own right.  These are qualities that we must try to nurture in the next generation.  I see these as key qualities that must be built into any system of training of apprentices.  Our ultimate aim is to bring our apprentices up to the level of educational training that currently obtains in countries like Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands.</P>
    <P>Deputy Richard Bruton spoke about the age of intake, and 16 is what is recommended in this Bill.  Deputy Bruton said that perhaps nowadays apprentices should be taken on later.  I would like to see that area explored fully.  I know it was the subject of a very big argument in Germany about 20 years ago.  The argument then was that at an older age people had lost the flexibility required to do part of the work that would be demanded within an apprenticeship and that the ideal age was about 16.  That may now be changing.  I see changes, particularly as a result of the new three-tiered leaving certificate that is being put in place whereby there will now be a level of leaving certificate with a strong element of vocational training.  When that is in place and is seen to be working successfully we may be able to alter the age of intake for apprentices.  That is a point I would like to see borne in mind.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes being brought about now in the senior certificate curriculum in second level schools.  They will result in the creation of a good basis for providing young people who are already <Col N="1511" /> well-prepared, well-geared and well-motivated for apprenticeship courses.  In any new programme we must keep as much formal education as we can in addition to training.  I would point in particular to the Cork Regional College, which has an extremely high level of apprenticeship training.  I know that every apprentice in this country can or should aim to attain those heights. However, the level of attainment there is due to the very strong co-ordination there is between FÁS and education and is between education and training, including the co-ordination of ideas, of schemes, of programmes and the will to work together.</P>
    <P>Earlier this summer apprentices from Cork Regional College competed in a world apprenticeship competition in Taiwan and came out with gold, leaving behind their counterparts from every other European country.  I make that point to demonstrate the ability that young people in this country have if they are given the proper education, training and motivation.  The raw material is there.  It is up to us to put in place the system that will unleash their potential. It can be done.  We do not lag behind any country and we have no need to do so if we put in place better schemes, where the curriculum is properly prepared, where there is ongoing and continuous assessment to ensure that what is laid out in the curriculum is adhered to in every respect, both on the job and off the job, and whose certification at the end of the training is on a par with standards in every other country.</P>
    <P>There are one or two other points I want to make, particularly in relation to women in apprenticeships.  The outlook for women in apprenticeships is not as bleak as we thought it was.  There used to be a sense of surprise when one saw a woman in a traditionally male-dominated area but that time has gone.  Career guidance teachers in second level schools should place more emphasis on influencing <Col N="1512" /> young women to consider the potential of apprenticeships.  There is a need to develop apprenticeship courses in areas such as hairdressing, the retail trade and textile manufacturing.  Women employed in those areas often receive low pay because they have a low level of training.  Often those jobs involve a low level of productivity and that is costly in the long term.  I ask the Minister to raise the level of training for women, thereby raising the status of women and the level of productivity.</P>
    <P>Jobs are emerging in many areas which we have not addressed.  In Germany there are more people employed in the arts, crafts and entertainment media industries than there are in the motor industry.  That is an extraordinary development.  When one thinks of Germany one thinks of the home of the Volkswagon and the great manufacturing tradition of that country, but changes have taken place in industries there through modern technology.  We must consider where new jobs will be found for the next generation.  There is no point in training young people for trades that have become obsolete.  We must look to where the potential jobs are.  Jobs are emerging in arts, crafts and entertainment media areas.  We must ensure we have in place technicians, crafts people and trades persons who are capable of creating jobs in those areas of potential development.  We should design proper training and apprenticeship courses to develop that great potential.  We must train people for jobs which they may be able to create and for the real jobs that will exist and not for those that will become obsolete.</P>
    <P>We are making a major investment in infrastructure.  We are building better roads, improved bridges, improving our telecommunications and building interpretative centres.  We are investing a great deal of money in those developments because we will be able to create a better future for our country and compete on an even basis with competitor <Col N="1513" /> countries in the European Union and the wider world market.  If we are prepared to make that level of investment in the physical fabric of our country, how much more prepared must we be to make a similar investment in human resources in the education and training of our young people?  We will attain our full potential if our young people have the appropriate skills and motivation.  We must be prepared to make that level of investment.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for promptly introducing this Bill and I look forward to discussing it in greater detail on Committee Stage.  There are many areas in which we can aspire to put in place the type of system that will do justice to our young people.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Bank Charges.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this matter because of the widespread concern at the <i>ad hoc</i> way in which new bank charges were introduced.  There appears to be a lack of openness in regard to many of those charges and there was no consultation with customers.  Allied Irish Banks introduced a charge of £20 for bank customers who have an overdraft facility.  Modern technology is becoming more and more a part of the banking world, but there are many people who find cheque books and current accounts satisfactory.  Those people should not be penalised if they wish to continue to use a cheque book.  Many people are also concerned about the additional charge on credit cards.  Those charges appear to conflict with consumer rights.  A BBC television programme today revealed that an English consumer report found banks to be uncaring towards their customers. If a similar report was carried out in Ireland I am sure the findings would be the same.  I do not object to bank charges <Col N="1514" /> or to banks making money.  It is important for the economy that they do so.</P>
      <P>I find it difficult to understand why a customer should be charged for a bank manager's time.  A customer who calls to his or her bank to inquire about an overdraft or another matter will have to pay heavily for the manager's time.  It is like asking a customer who buys goods in a shop to pay for the shop owner's time while he or she serves the customer, in addition to the price of the goods.  I call on the Minister to incorporate a method of consultation and review of those charges in the consumer credit Bill.  Such a review should be carried out on an ongoing basis.  There is a great deal of concern about those charges.</P>
      <P>I would like to see a change in the attitudes of banks towards their customers. What happened to the maxim that the customer is always right?  That maxim has always been used by retailers and by business people, but in the case of banks it does not seem to apply any longer.  Customers feel they are bullied and intimidated when they call to the banks to collect their money.  Customers pay a good deal in bank charges, especially for an overdraft facility, yet they feel they are in a weak position in regard to a service for which they pay.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to criticise the banks.  I realise they are important to the economy. At present the banks are flush with funds and even though interest rates are very low they find it difficult to lend. People do not want to borrow because they do not want to have an overdraft. There is a lack of confidence on the part of bank customers.  When confidence in the economy increases people will borrow money from the banks and invest. The banks have not acted justly in the introduction of the new bank charges. There are very few businesses where money is taken from the customer before receiving the bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ryan for raising <Col N="1515" /> this matter on the Adjournment.  It was raised on the Seanad Adjournment a few weeks ago.  The Deputy specifically referred to the recent increase in Allied Irish Banks' charges and I will reply to that.</P>
      <P>My officials and I met with representatives of Allied Irish Banks on 28 October 1993 to convey disquiet at the adverse effects which the new level of charges it proposed to introduce would have for businesses and consumers.  My concern was based on the multiplicity and proliferation of charges which are now imposed on bank customers.  Such charges are becoming an increasing burden on business costs and household income, especially at a time of record low inflation.  I also expressed, my concern to the bank about the effects of the new charges on certain sections of its customer base.  It proposed that everybody move as quickly as possible to paperless transactions, but I pointed out that that would not suit everybody.  There are many people who have always done their business by way of cheque book and, in addition to charges for an overdraft, people will now be charged on the double for not moving to paperless transactions.</P>
      <P>The consumer is confused and befuddled by these changes, the effects of which only become apparent when they receive their statements.  They then observe with dismay and discomfiture increased and new charges for various services.  Deputy Ryan spoke particularly about the charge for a bank manager's time which is quite startling.  People pay for the product, which in this case is finance, but they must also pay for the person who provides the product and that seems very strange.  It is true to say that in implementing new or increased charges the banks are casual in explaining to their customers the purpose and justification for them.  The justification is often a complex web of explanation which, in turn, leaves the consumer even more befuddled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1516" /> Bank charges are regulated under section 28 of the Central Bank Act, 1989. Each holder of a banking licence is required to notify the Central Bank of every proposal to change or impose a charge, and the term or condition applying to the provision of a service.  In examining proposals to increase charges the Central Bank must take due cognisance of a bank's cost base.</P>
    <P>Following the recent debate on the new charges introduced by Allied Irish Banks the Minister for Finance and I, together with officials of our Departments, met with the Governor of the Central Bank last Friday to explore what action could be taken from a consumer protection point of view in relation to any future proposed increases in bank charges.  It was agreed at that meeting that consideration would be given to assigning a role to the Director of Consumer Affairs concerning bank charges in the context of the proposed Consumer Credit Bill now being finalised.  Such a decision was quite a step forward.  It is clear that the Director of Consumer Affairs, with his objectivity in many matters &mdash; we are well served by that office &mdash; should have a remit with regard to surveillance, consultation and monitoring of bank charges.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the Deputy raising this matter &mdash; indeed many other Deputies have spoken to me about the issue.  The concerns he has outlined have also been expressed by many members of the public by letter and telephone calls to my office in the past number of months.  I will be glad to come back in the context of the Consumer Credit Bill to address the issue in a more precise manner.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms F. Fitzgerald Ms F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise the question of the collection of data and information on HIV infection and the implications for <Col N="1517" /> future Government policy.  Yesterday was World AIDS Day, organised by the World Health Organisation, the theme of which was The Time to Act.  More than 12 million people worldwide have HIV infection and AIDS will claim the lives of several million before the end of the millennium.  Governments, unfortunately, around the world have been slow to act and this has cost lives.  Our annual HIV reported cases are growing at a rate of 10 per cent since 1989.  Many Irish families have to cope with the effects of this disease and many more will have to come to cope with them in the future. There are currently 1,421 reported cases of HIV infection, although the real numbers are probably far higher.</P>
      <P>I would like to congratulate the Minister on the initiatives he has taken to deal with the current situation.  I welcome the measures taken such as the appointment of a new consultant, the introduction of the family planning Bill and so on. However, I wish to raise one matter, the collection of data and information on HIV infection and the implications for future Government policy.  What is the current method of collection, what information is collected and is there information on age, gender and region?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first point to be established is that we need to focus on HIV statistics as opposed to AIDS diagnosis and AIDS-related death figures.  We have cumulative data on HIV infection but we do not have an age, gender or regional breakdown of that data.  I understand that the data collection forms have this information.  I look forward to the Minister's comments on this matter.  It is important that the Department not only reacts at a crisis level but considers the whole question of prevention.  The breakdown of HIV figures as outlined is necessary to inform the design and implementation of targeted HIV prevention campaigns.  That breakdown is crucially important to indicate in which population groups the virus is spreading most significantly.  This data would give <Col N="1518" /> a more comprehensive picture of the developing epidemic and we would be in a better position to respond to it.  If we have a real commitment to HIV prevention we would have this type of data collection system.</P>
    <P>More information is necessary on women in terms of this problem.  There should be a serious commitment to education programmes that target the needs of women, particularly in regard to negotiation skills and assertiveness training. For example, a staggering 77 per cent of the HIV positive heterosexuals attending St. James's Hospital are women.  The biggest increase in the past 12 months in the level of reported HIV infection in any group was among gay men.  All these facts point towards the urgent need for focused and targeted HIV information and prevention campaigns.  Clearly, immediate action is needed in these areas.  Strategic planning is necessary for the early management of the disease in terms of medical treatment, counselling and support.</P>
    <P>The Government should encourage at-risk population to test for HIV antibodies at frequent intervals.  If people know they are HIV positive they can access treatment regimes and can improve the quality and prolong the length of their lives. Advocacy to test must be given high priority.  It makes no sense to spend limited resources on the medical management and care of a disease if sufficient attention is not given to prevention of the disease.  In that regard we should start with a proper data processing system.</P>
    <P>Many services dealing with the epidemic are overburdened.  In the future increasing numbers of people will be infected.  At present £2 million per annum is being spent on the care of more than 700 people with symptomatic HIV illness.  What amount will we have to spend when this figure reaches 2,000 or more?  The World Health Organisation predict that there are between 5,000 and 10,000 people in this country with HIV infection.  When these people become <Col N="1519" /> symptomatically ill enormous demands will be placed on the Exchequer.  It makes perfect sense to act proactively in the area of HIV prevention.  This action must start with the breakdown of figures along the lines of age, gender and region.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope you will bear with me, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and allow me to respond in a comprehensive way to the issues raised by the Deputy.  I am pleased to respond to the issues so close to World AIDS Day.  I welcome the opportunity to place on the record of the House the position in regard to HIV-AIDS surveillance in Ireland and to correct some of the inaccuracies which appeared in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 1 December.</P>
      <P>The availability of information about the spread of HIV and AIDS is a fundamental component of the AIDS startegy and the surveillance of HIV and AIDS has been an integral component of the Department of Health AIDS strategy since the first case of AIDS was reported here in the 1980s.</P>
      <P>The Department's surveillance programme consists of four components: the reporting of cases of AIDS; the reporting of deaths from AIDS; the reporting of HIV positive tests on the basis of confirmatory HIV tests, carried out by the Virus Reference Laboratory, UCD, which commenced in 1985; and the monitoring of the spread of HIV in the population through anonymous, unlinked HIV surveillance programmes which commenced in October 1992.  Taken together, this surveillance programme is providing all of the information relevant to the planning, implementation, evaluation and development of programmes and services aimed at the prevention of HIV and for the care and management of those who have contracted the disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The surveillance programme provides the following information.  In respect of cases of AIDS and deaths from AIDS: the sex and age of the person; the country <Col N="1520" /> of residence of the person at the onset of illness; the person's nationality; the current county of residence of the person in Ireland; in the case of persons living in Dublin, the Dublin postal code; the disease manifestations present at the time of diagnosis; and information about the mode of transmission of the infection.  In the case of confirmatory HIV test results from the Virus Reference Laboratory: the area of residence, including the Dublin postal code; the sex of the person in the case of intravenous drug users and the classification of the category for HIV surveillance purposes to which the person belongs.  In the case of the unlinked anonymous HIV surveillance programme, very detailed and comprehensive information is being collected at present through the analysis of blood taken for routine clinical purposes at ante-natal examinations and which is surplus to requirements.  This information is classified under (a) six separate age groupings, from &ldquo;less than 20 years up&rdquo; to &ldquo;40 years and over&rdquo; and (b) area of residence as a basis for monitoring the spread of HIV in the heterosexual population.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in my annual report on HIV-AIDS, which I issued yesterday, I will be expanding the unlinked, anonymous HIV surveillance programme to include GUM clinics and hospital outpatients and in-patients.  The National AIDS Strategy Committee is currently working on draft Protocols to enable these elements of the programme to be put in place very quickly.  It is envisaged that the information under the extended programme will be as comprehensive as that being collected under the first phase, including data on gender, age and area of residence also.</P>
    <P>The surveillance of cases of AIDS and HIV and-or HIV demonstrate the following features of the epidemiology of the disease in Ireland: the greatest percentage, at 64 per cent, of cases of AIDS have occurred in the 20-34 year age groups; 85.5 per cent of cases of AIDS have occurred in male and 14.5 per cent in female, in all age groups.  Intravenous drug users continue to be the largest <Col N="1521" /> single, reservoir of HIV infection at 52 per cent of infected; of the intravenous drug users, a total of 75 per cent are male and the remainder female.  A total of 96 HIV positive children have been born to intravenous drug using mothers.  Homosexuals, at 18 per cent, are the second largest reservoir of HIV infection and this proportion has remained unchanged since HIV testing began in 1985; and heterosexuals represent 14 per cent of those who are HIV positive.</P>
    <P>The information available from the Department's HIV-AIDS database has facilitated the development and implementation of a rational AIDS strategy which is responsive to the evolving epidemiology of the disease in Ireland. We have been proportionate and relevant in our response, which has included both general programmes and services and those targeted at particular groups.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Deputy's kind comments in this regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald asked about the implications for future Government policy in relation to HIV-AIDS arising out of the collection of data and information. Clearly, we have been successful to date in implementing a comprehensive national AIDS strategy which is relevant to our particular requirements, on the basis of the date and information available through our existing database.  This has given us data and information about, <i>inter alia,</i> sex, age, area of residence and the at-risk groups and has enabled us to provide programmes and services aimed at particular groups in certain areas.  I am, therefore, confident that the HIV-AIDS surveillance programme is appropriate for the rational planning and evaluation of the national AIDS strategy both now and in the future.</P>

      <P>At present ten children from the western region are attending Baldoyle school for the physically and mentally handicapped. These physically handicapped children, who suffer varying degrees of physical handicap, have to face the trauma of travelling long distances every week.  I am asking the Minister to provide the necessary facilities for the education of these children in their own area.  Some of these children have to travel a round trip of 360 miles every week to and from Baldoyle.  This journey would be a problem for a normal healthy child but for a severely handicapped child confined to a wheelchair who cannot go to the toilet it is a severe strain.  It is a totally unfair burden on one of the weakest sections of our society.</P>
      <P>Some of these intelligent children cannot speak, walk or go to the toilet. This means that their lines of communication are limited and they cannot fully show how stressed they are.  The provision of educational facilities for these children within a reasonable distance of their homes is very important.  I ask the Minister to provide a regional centre in Galway for the education of these children.  When these children are so far away from home they feel isolated and can suffer stress.  It is impossible for the parents of these children to visit them on a regular basis.  I do not see any justification for letting this situation continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that there is no requirement for special equipment in such schools.  Most of these children have lived at home and one of them even attended the local primary school with tremendous help from the teachers and the local community. Apart from an initial outlay of capital, I do not see how costs could be a barrier to the provision of a regional centre in Galway.  Furthermore, it would seem to be cost inefficient in the long term to provide transport to bring children <Col N="1523" /> long distances when similar services could be provided nearer home.</P>
    <P>I would argue that normal cost considerations do not apply when one is dealing with the severely physically handicapped.  Obviously money is in short supply, but the money required has to be balanced against the service which will be provided.  It cannot be considered acceptable in this day and age for handicapped people to have to travel to the other side of the country to receive their basic right to education.  This would certainly not be acceptable in the case of people who are not physically handicapped, and I cannot understand why it should be acceptable in the case of people who are physically handicapped.  I ask the Minister to make provision for the education of these children in centres which are a reasonable distance from their homes.  I recognise that children with a more severe handicap would have to be grouped in a regional centre.  Nevertheless such children should not be expected to travel more than 50-60 miles to be educated.</P>
    <P>I understand that Baldoyle special school, which has provided a tremendous service, is no longer accepting students from outside the Dublin catchment area. The long term outlook for these children is very bad.</P>
    <P>Another issue which arises in this connection is the provision of accommodation for these children after school. I realise that is another issue but I believe this matter deserves the attention of the Minister and the various Departments involved.</P>
    <P>Arís ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghlacaidh leis an Aire as ucht teacht isteach chun éisteacht leis an gcás seo.  Bheadh súil agam go mbreathnódh sí chomh luath agus is féidir, in ainneon cuinsí airgid, mar tá fíor gá le rud éigin práinneach a dhéanamh sna chásanna seo.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the past 30 years in particular <Col N="1524" /> my Department has responded to the special education needs of children with disabilities by providing an extensive network of special schools and special classes in ordinary schools.  As one might expect, facilities have tended to be concentrated in the larger centres of population where, generally speaking, the greatest level of need exists.</P>
      <P>More recently the benefits of making provision for children with disabilities in ordinary classrooms in their local schools have been highlighted.  Indeed, this approach has been endorsed in the recently published report of the special education review committee.  In general, this must be seen as a progressive approach and my Department seeks to respond positively by allocating additional specialist teachers to assist ordinary class teachers in meeting the needs of these pupils.</P>
      <P>Among the factors that need to be considered in deciding on the location and type of special educational provision are the number of children involved and the nature and degree of their disabilities. In the case of physically handicapped children from the western region, a dedicated special school was established at Merlin Park Hospial, Galway, in 1955. This school catered for children who were long term hospital in-patients, suffering from such diseases as polio and tuberculosis. Resources for the operation of the school continued to be provided by my Department and the Western Health Board for as long as the need existed. However, by June 1991 there were only three pupils remaining in the school and none of these was an in-patient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the circumstances my Department and the health board concluded that a special school located in a hospital was no longer a suitable environment in which to educate these children on a long term basis.  Accordingly, arrangements were made to close the school in June 1991 and to establish a special class at Scoil Chaitríona senior national school, Renmore, Galway, from the following <Col N="1525" /> September.  The latest figures available to my Department suggest that there are six pupils in this class and I can assure the Deputy that my Department will continue to provide support for these pupils in Scoil Chaitríona for as long as the need continues.</P>
    <P>Regrettably, there will always be cases of special educational need where placement in a special school will be necessary. In many of these cases there may be additional disabilities accompanying the primary one.  As well as teachers, such children may require the support of medical, therapy and care personnel on a continuous basis.  Because the number of these children in each region is relatively small, it would be unrealistic to expect that this level of support could be provided on a local basis in each case.</P>
    <P>I am not aware that the level of need in the western region at the present time is such as to require the provision of additional facilities for children with a physical disability.  However, I would be prepared to consider any detailed proposals in this regard which the Deputy may wish to submit.</P>

      <P>I must begin by saying that I am delighted the Minister for Education is present here this evening.  In fact, I feel optimistic already, because just a few weeks ago, when I raised a problem about Ardfinnan national school, the Minister responded very positively. I take this opportunity to thank the Minister on behalf of everybody involved in that school for the help she has given us.</P>
      <P>However, the problems of education in South Tipperary extend in every direction and I am delighted to have the opportunity tonight to raise the urgent need for additional accommodation at Scoil Ruain in Killenaule, an exceptional school which provides an excellent education for the local students in what can be considered a rural area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1526" /> The need for additional accommodation in this school is evidence of the high standard and the quality of teaching carried out by the staff.  This request for additional accommodation is ongoing since spring 1992.  Unfortunately, now that the school is facing what I consider to be a critical overcrowding problem, as yet no commitment has been given by the Department of Education to provide the additional classrooms.</P>
    <P>The school was built for 325 students and now caters for 529 students, that is 204 above the number for which the school was originally intended.  At this stage it is imperative that we congratulate the principal, Mr. Michael Hassett, the vice-principal, his staff and the board of management for enduring this appalling space shortage for so long.</P>
    <P>The future of this school, however, will be impossible, considering that there is a projected increase of 20 in the enrolment for September 1994.  As it is the only school within its catchment area, the projected numbers for each year will decrease very slightly between now and the year 2000.  As a vocational school teacher, I have a close association with Scoil Ruain.  It is a very progressive school and it naturally wishes to provide all the additional educational facilities to its students.  It wants to provide a three year leaving certificate cycle and in that regard an additional 60 places will be necessary.  I believe the school is justified in wanting to provide PLC and VTOS courses.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister whether it is fair to ask the students and the staff of Scoil Ruain to endure this overcrowding indefinitely.  Is it wise to stifle the enormous commitment and dedication of all involved in education in Scoil Ruain by not giving a commitment to provide these basic facilities, without which every student cannot be assured of a place within the school from this year on?  We had hoped that the accommodation would have been provided for September 1993.  However, our disappointment has <Col N="1527" /> not and will not dampen our determination to ensure that this excellent school gets the recognition and the facilities it deserves from the Department.</P>
    <P>I am requesting the Minister, on behalf of the teachers, the students and the huge number of parents who have written to me over the past two weeks, to give a commitment in the House this evening to provide the necessary accommodation for Scoil Ruain for September 1994.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">

      <P>I thank the Deputy for putting on record her appreciation and the appreciation of all the community of Ardfinnan and I would say that that issue was probably a good example of partnership in education.  The Deputy, my colleague, Deputy Ferris, the Department of Education and, indeed, the parish priest and myself put our heads together and came up with a satisfactory outcome.  Of course, this has encouraged the Deputy to come into the House and raise another matter as a result of the quick response to the problems in Ardfinnan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to put on record what has taken place in Scoil Ruain, Killenaule.  Following an application for additional accommodation and an assessment of the school's needs, approval was given to the vocational education committee in July 1992 to proceed with the planning of an extension which was estimated to cost in the region of £135,000.  The proposed additional accommodation consists of three general classrooms, one science laboratory, toilets and some circulation <Col N="1528" /> area.  The architectural planning has been carried out by the vocational education committee's consultants and the tender documentation, which has been received from the vocational education committee and examined by my Department, has been found to be satisfactory, subject to some very minor amendments.</P>
    <P>The next stage, therefore, would be the invitation of tenders.  However, it has not been possible to include the project in the 1993 building programme because of other commitments and priorities which had to take precedence.  As with all such building projects, the placing of a contract and the timing of construction is inevitably dependent on the availability of capital resources.  While the necessary resources are not available at present to allow this project to proceed, I am nevertheless aware that the school requires the accommodation urgently.  Accordingly, the project will be considered in due course for possible inclusion in the 1994 capital programme in the light of the resources available and the demands on these resources.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that I will make every effort to ensure that new accommodation and resources will be provided.

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Priority Question No. 5 and Question No. 75 together.</P>
      <P>I fully share the Deputy's concern in the matter.  In the interests of safety at sea there is a paramount necessity for carriers to declare the nature of their cargoes to the appropriate authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can however advise the Deputy that procedures are already in place in relation to the declaration of cargo. <Col N="1432" /> Before any cargo is loaded on board a vessel, the shipper or other person entering into a contract of carriage of goods by sea with a carrier must furnish the Master of the vessel with details of the type of cargo, including its weight.  On the basis of this information a cargo plan is drawn up which enables the Master to ensure that the vessel is safely loaded.</P>
    <P>The carriage of dangerous goods by sea is governed by the International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code of the International Maritime Organisation which is amended at regular intervals. Current requirements are implemented in Ireland by the Merchant Shipping (Dangerous Goods) Rules, 1992.  In addition to regulating the packaging and stowage of dangerous goods, the rules prohibit the taking on board of such goods for carriage unless the shipper has furnished the shipowner or Master with a dangerous goods declaration.  The declaration must indicate the correct technical name of the dangerous or polluting goods, their United Nations numbers, the hazard classes in accordance with the IMDG Code, the quantities of such goods and their location on board and, if in portable tanks or freight containers, their identification marks.</P>
    <P>The rules also require the master of a ship carrying dangerous goods to carry a specific list, manifest or stowage plan on board giving details of the dangerous goods carried in the ship, in accordance with the information provided by the shipper.  The reporting of incidents involving the loss of dangerous goods is mandatory under these rules.</P>
    <P>Existing requirements for vessels carrying dangerous or polluting cargoes will be strengthened from 1995 by an EC Directive which will apply to vessels bound for or leaving Community ports. The Directive has as its main objective the prevention or minimisation of serious accidents at sea.  The provisions of the Directive are designed to ensure:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;that shipowners and masters are made fully aware by the shipper or his agent of the nature of any dangerous or polluting goods being offered </P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1433" /> for carriage whether in bulk or in packaged form; and</P>
    <P>&mdash;that operators of ships carrying dangerous or polluting goods notify the competent authorities in the Community port of destination of the nature of their cargo and provide a position report as soon as the ships enter the Member State's coastal zone.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that safety procedures in relation to dangerous cargo declarations are kept under review by the Department.  This is particularly so in the case of container goods where particular difficulties can arise through misdeclaration of contents or the incorrect labelling of containers.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions No. 12, 13 and 92 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Army Pensions Acts, compensation by way of a disability pension or a gratuity may be granted to a former member of the Permanent Defence Force who, on retirement or discharge from the force, is found to be suffering from a disablement due to an injury attributable <Col N="1434" /> to military service at home or abroad. Such compensation is payable whether the injury was accidentally or maliciously inflicted.  In addition to benefits under the Army Pensions Acts, <i>ex-gratia</i> lump sums compensation may, subject to certain conditions, be granted in respect of disablement due to injury attributable to service abroad with the UN.</P>
    <P>The Gleeson Commission examined the subject of compensation for injuries sustained by members of the Defence Forces in the course of duty and recommended that a compensation scheme similar to that provided for in the Garda Compensation Acts should not be introduced for the Defence Forces.  The Commission did, however, consider that there may be a case for extending to the Defence Forces the same limited occupational injuries cover as applies to members of the Garda Síochána and suggested that the provisions in relation to occupational injuries under the Army Pensions Acts should be examined in the context of the fundamental revision of the superannuation arrangements for the Defence Forces recommended by them.</P>
    <P>The Commission recognised that such a revision would be a task of considerable technical complexity and would involve detailed consultations and discussions with both the military authorities and the representative associations.  Thus, the revision is a long term project and will take some considerable time to complete. Preliminary examination of the matter has begun.</P>
    <P>No claim has been received from either RACO or PDFORRA in regard to the compensation arrangements for members of the Defence Forces.  Such a claim may be dealt with under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for the Permanent Defence Force.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 27 together.</P>
      <P>The composition of UNOSOM II in terms of participating countries was not a factor in the Government's decision to contribute a contingent to the mission and will not affect the question of our continued participation.</P>
      <P>It is clear to me from my recent visit to Somalia and from reports from the mission area that the Irish transport unit serving with UNOSOM II is performing a very worthwhile task and has established good relations with the local community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal duty of the Irish contingent is the provision of essential supplies (fuel, food, water, etc.) to the military components of UNOSOM II.  It also assists in the movement of the stores and equipment of units who are deploying or re-deploying in the mission area. In addition, the Irish unit assists the Irish <Col N="1437" /> Aid agencies Concern and Goal as well as other humanitarian agencies.</P>
    <P>The Irish transport company is the only independent logistics unit in the Baidoa region equipped to operate in all terrains and weather conditions.  From its location at Baidoa airfield, it services 4,000 troops in the region which covers an area of 80,000 square kilometres.

      <P>The Department of Defence has been working continuously on those recommendations dealing with the non-pay aspects of military conditions of service which are still outstanding.  In this regard, discussions are taking place between the Department and the Defence Force representative associations in the context of the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force.

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 34 and 66 together.</P>
      <P>Non-EC resident serving as deck and engineer officers on Irish flagged vessels are required to hold certificates of competency issued by the Irish authorities or, alternatively, certificates of competency from countries with whom the State has reciprocal recognition arrangements, which are currently the UK and a number of former Commonwealth countries.</P>
      <P>Ratings of all nationalities may serve on Irish flagged vessels provided they are qualified seamen and hold watchrating certificates as required by the standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping Convention, 1978.</P>
      <P>All deck and engineer officers on Irish flagged vessels must demonstrate proficiency in English in order to obtain certificates of competency.  A good understanding of the English language by all other crew members is always recommended by the Department in the interests of ensuring correct and timely communication and understanding of messages and instructions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Experience of marine casualties has shown that accidents are more likely to occur in ships where there are multinational crews who are unable to communicate effectively with each other. This issue and other training criteria need to be addressed at international level to ensure that all flag states enforce equally high standards for their crews.  The difficulties of poor communication, aggravated <Col N="1440" /> by language difficulties, as a contributory factor in accidents must be addressed as a priority.</P>
    <P>I am, therefore, fully supportive of the current proposal at Community level to introduce a Directive on the Minimum Level of Training for Maritime Occupations. The purpose of the Directive is to improve the application and enforcement of international training standards on board all ships registered in the Community or entering Community ports, as well as to improve communication among multi-language crews.  Ireland is already a party to the relevant International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers.  I am confident that the EC Directive which is at an advanced stage will strengthen the hand of Ireland and other Community states in ensuring that existing international standards are improved and enforced on all ships in Community waters.</P>

      <P>Government policy has been to establish a network of major Fishery Harbour Centres (FHC's) strategically located on the North West, West, South West, South East and East coasts.  These are currently Killybegs, Rossaveel, Castletownbere, Dunmore East and Howth.  In addition, it is intended to designate Dingle harbour as the sixth FHC.  As the Deputy will be aware, substantial State investment has been made at this harbour over the last few years and it is now one of our top fishing ports.  The necessary legislation is being drafted by the Department of the Marine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1441" /> The Department, in accordance with Government policy, is committed to the concept of these centres as locations where the whole chain of activities from catching through to the landing, auctioning, processing and marketing of the catch, as well as the servicing of the fleet can be catered for.  The strategy is to cater for development in fish landings, improved handling and larger vessels.</P>
    <P>In addition, current policy also aims to develop other important fishing harbours at strategic locations, thus providing a solid infrastructural base and all necessary back-up, repair and service facilities for the efficient exploitation of stocks.</P>
    <P>While considerable progress has been made in recent years in the development of the Irish fishery harbour infrastructure, (including developments such as dredging and pier construction at Rossaveel FHC, County Galway, Greencastle County Donegal, and Dingle, County Kerry, undertaken under the first round of Structural Funds), significant investment, within available financial resources, is still required.</P>
    <P>To this end the National Development Plan envisages an investment of some £12 million in the development of harbour infrastructures over the 1994 through 1999 period: This funding will continue to be directed at improving facilities at priority fishing harbours and also at upgrading and maintaining local harbour infrastructures at selected local harbours where fishing or aquaculture activities play an important socio-economic role.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that investment to date together with planned expenditure will provide the port facilities to service the Irish fishing fleet.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to be able to advise the Deputy that training and equipment for fire fighting on board ships is covered by an extensive regulatory regime which is fully in line with current international standards.</P>
      <P>All Certificated Deck and Engineer Officers serving on Irish-registered vessels are required to have completed an approved fire-fighting course in accordance with the syllabus laid down by the International Maritime Organisation.</P>
      <P>Ireland has fully implemented into domestic law the provisions of the International Safety of Life at Sea Convention in relation to fire protection on board ships.</P>
      <P>All Irish ships are required to comply with the rigorous fire fighting and fire prevention rules as set out under the regulatory framework which gives effect to the relevant international maritime safety standards.</P>
      <P>These extensive requirements lay down rigorous standards in relation to fire extinguishing appliances and their chemical make-up, fire-alarm and detection systems, ventilation systems, fire doors and fire resistant materials.  They also lay down criteria in relation to fire patrols, protective clothing, crew training in the use of fire fighting equipment as well as fire drills.</P>
      <P>All Irish registered ships and foreign registered vessels providing a regular service to Irish ports are inspected regularly and at least once a year by the Department to ensure compliance with all safety standards including fire prevention.  I am satisfied that all Irish registered ships are fully in compliance with certification, equipment and training requirements in respect of fire fighting on ships.</P>
      <P>Fire safety standards on board Irish registered cargo vessels and on passenger ferries are kept under regular review by the Department, as part of the ongoing review of safety standards generally and with reference to developments at international level.</P>

      <P>I am indeed aware of the valuable work undertaken by Cairde na Mara, the voluntary organisation set up to bring together local community interests in support of the development to aquaculture on the west coast.  Since Cairde na Mara was set up in 1991 the Department has assisted the organisation with information, and technical advice and has been generally supportive of its activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand also that Údarás na Gaeltachta <Col N="1445" /> has contributed towards funding the salary of the organisation's manager and has helped with the provision of office accommodation.  An Bord Iascaigh Mhara has also been of assistance in providing information, technical advice and general promotional literature.</P>
    <P>I understand that Cairde na Mara intends to make proposals for grant aid support from Údarás na Gaeltachta in order to broaden its operations and is exploring the scope for assistance from the EC Leader programme and national lottery funds.  I would be glad to support in principle any such funding applications, which would enable Cairde na Mara to expand its activities.</P>
    <P>I fully support the aims and efforts of this community based organisation to promote greater understanding of the potential of aquaculture for job creation in coastal communities, and to work with local groups and other users of the marine resources in order to develop a consensus on how such development can go forward.</P>

      <P>I have no proposals at the moment to establish a national forum as suggested by the Deputy.  This is not to say that I would not consider setting up <i>ad hoc</i> structures from time to time to focus on our major policy issues.  This approach was used to good effect during the review of the Common Fisheries Policy through the group chaired by Dr. Whitaker and later Eamon Doherty.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that existing consultation structures work reasonably well.  There is close day to day contact on operational matters between the Department of the Marine and the fishing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a more formal level, senior officials of the Department and the major representative bodies meet monthly in the <Col N="1446" /> Fishing Industry Liaison Group.  This provides an opportunity for all important matters affecting the industry to be raised and discussed.</P>
    <P>I am concerned, however, at the degree of fragmentation in the fishing industry's representative structures.  I am not satisfied that it allows for the most consistent and professional industry input to policy development at national or Community level.  While the existing organisations have extremely able and experienced people at the helm, they do not have sufficient back up in terms of analysis and research capabilities, nor is there always sufficient co-ordination or unity of purpose as between the various organisations.</P>
    <P>I would view the creation of a strong unified fishing organisation umbrella structure with the ability to influence in a constructive and co-ordinated way the making and implementation of policies at all levels as a healthy and welcome development.</P>
    <P>I have indicated in the past that I would support such a development and that my good offices are available to assist in that regard.  I would be open to consider suggestions including the possibility of initial tangible support to encourage the creation of new structures.</P>
    <P>I know that there have been soundings within the industry on this matter but that there is not at this time a total consensus on the best way forward.  While I have no desire whatsoever to get involved in the internal organisational politics of the fishing industry, I propose early in the new year to touch base with the various fishing industry organisations to assess if I could be of assistance in advancing the concept of a unified industry structure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42, 52 and 53 together.</P>
      <P>While I would accept that fish stocks in the Irish Sea are seriously depleted, I can assure the Deputy that the need to address this problem is being given a high priority.  Since late 1991 my Department has been engaged in discussions with the UK fishery authorities on the introduction of conservation measures to safeguard and regenerate those stocks in order to preserve a sustainable livelihood for the fishermen who fish in those waters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most recently both the Irish and UK authorities have introduced a requirement that all prawn trawls must have a square mesh panel which allows immature white fish that had previously been caught up in such gear to swim through. This will eliminate discards in the prawn <Col N="1448" /> fishery which for the Irish fleet alone, were estimated to be of the order of 5,000 tonnes annually.  In addition, the Irish and UK authorities have retained a minimum landing size for Irish Sea Whiting 17 per cent above the EC approved norm of 23 cm.  These measures will help to ensure that young fish survive to spawn.</P>
    <P>Illegal nets constitute a major abuse of fish stocks and in an effort to further combat this threat the Department is urgently drafting legislation which will help the Department's enforcement officers to make accurate measurements of nets on land rather than only at sea, as is currently the case.</P>
    <P>As a further step, I recently received the approval of the Government for draft legislation to increase and extend the powers of sea fishery protection officers which will enable them to seek the confiscation of illegal nets irrespective of whether they are found on board a vessel or ashore.  In addition over the past year the Department has more than doubled the number of fishery protection officers based on the east coast.  The draft legislation which I plan to introduce early next year will also increase the prospect that the vessels of persistent offenders may be confiscated by the Courts.</P>
    <P>These deterrents combined with the other conservation measures, either planned or already in place, will help to address the ongoing problem of fish stocks both in the Irish Sea and in other Irish waters.  While it will take some considerable time for stocks to regenerate both I and the Department are determined to ensure that the Irish Sea fishery will not be destroyed by reckless exploitation of stocks.</P>

      <P>The substantial increase in <Col N="1449" /> ferry traffic at Dún Laoghaire Harbour this year is a most welcome development. During the summer season this year there were eight sailings per day from the harbour compared with five sailings per day in the previous year.  I wish to pay tribute to the co-operation and flexibility shown by the workforce in ensuring that the additional sailings were catered for.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the existing facilities at the harbour are not adequate to meet the demands placed at high season.  As the Deputy is aware, I have appointed a team of consultants to design new ferry terminal facilities.  I expect that the new facilities will be more efficient and cost effective and will not require a larger labour force than the present structures. The work requirements in the interim do not represent the final requirements of the port.  It would not be appropriate therefore to increase the permanent workforce in order to meet a temporary requirement.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44 and 45 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent resignation of Mr. Matt Murphy as a board member of the institute is naturally a matter of regret to me and to the Minister of State.  In accordance with the provisions of the Marine Institute Act, 1991 Mr. Murphy was appointed to a vacancy on the board of the institute last July by virtue of his <Col N="1450" /> contribution over many years to advancing the case for development of our marine resources.  While regretting Mr. Murphy's decision to resign after only a matter of months I fully accept that he has taken this decision for his own reasons.</P>
    <P>I do not however accept the criticism made by Mr. Murphy that the institute was spending more on its image than it was on research.  The factual position is that expenditure to date in 1993 by the institute on public relations amounts to less than 1 per cent of the institute's total Exchequer grant allocation for the year.</P>
    <P>Since the board of the institute was appointed in November, 1992 its activities have been dedicated to advancing a number of key issues in order to establish the institute on a sound basis.  The appointment of a chief executive officer will, I understand, be announced shortly. The institute is also finalising arrangements to acquire a premises in Dublin commensurate with its need for a small administrative base and to accommodate the National Marine Data Centre.  The institute has also assisted and advised the Department, in the context of the National Development Plan on key marine research investment priorities.  It has also initiated a comprehensive review of national marine research capabilities, priorities and potential for development and job creation.  I am confident that the institute will play a critical role in our work to develop the national marine resource and I am fully supportive of the board's effort to date to establish the institute as a fully operational entity.</P>
    <P>I am also taking this opportunity to announce that I have this week appointed Mr. Fergus Cahill, chief executive of Irish National Petroleum Corporation who has a longstanding interest in and concern for marine matters to the board of the institute.</P>

      <P>I propose taking Paralimentary Questions Nos. 46 and 67 together.</P>
      <P>The company in question received grant aid on one occasion during the last ten years.  Under the Shipping Investment Grants Act, 1987, the Company was awarded grant-aid in 1990 totalling £250,000, towards the construction costs of one 4,000 dwt bitumen carrier involving a total investment of some £7.5 million and which was built in 1990.  No concessionary tax rates apply to grant-aided ships as such.  However, all Irish shipping companies uniformly benefit from a preferential corporation tax rate of 10 per cent.</P>
      <P>All Irish-registered ships, grant-aided or otherwise, are required to comply with manning and safety requirements laid down in regulations made under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894-92.  Manning regulations stipulate that deck and engineer officers on Irish registered ships must hold certificates of compentency issued by the Irish authorities or alternatively certificates of compentancy from countries with whom the State has reciprocal recognition arrangements, currently the UK and a number of former Commonwealth countries.  Ratings of all nationalities can serve on Irish registered vessels provided they hold recognised qualifications as seamen.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49, 60, 69 and 106 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies will be aware, the proposal to introduce a decommissioning scheme for fishing vessels is one of the elements in the recently circulated discussion document on the management and development of the Irish fleet.</P>
      <P>The objective of such a scheme would be to facilitate the removal of excess capacity while providing decommissioning grants to the owners of the vessels removed.  Since the proposal forms part of the discussion document, the detailed provisions of such a scheme have yet to be finalised and will be the subject of further discussions with the industry early next year before I take definitive decisions in the matter.</P>
      <P>I should also point out that the commission itself is currently in the process of reviewing the community financial framework in relation to decommissioning and it is expected that the relevant regulation will be approved at the December Fisheries Council.  The Department will then be in a position to bring forward more detailed proposals in consultation with industry interests.</P>

      <P>Primary responsibility for coast protection lies with the property owner, whether it be a private individual or a local authority.  The Department of the marine's role is to work in conjunction with local authorities on the management of the coastal zone rather than individual sites.</P>
      <P>EC Structural Funds are being sought under the National Development Plan to help address the growing erosion problem. A sum of £5.5 million is to be made available over the period 1994 through 1999.</P>
      <P>In order to draw up a national coastal protection plan, all maritime local authorities were invited to submit proposals for addressing serious erosion problems in their administrative areas.  These proposals are with the Department and are being examined with a view to their possible inclusion in the plan.</P>
      <P>As I am sure the Deputy can imagine, the costs of the proposals submitted far exceeds the moneys available for this purpose under the National Development Plan.  As a result, the Department will only be able to grant aid local authorities in respect of the most urgent coastal erosion problems, having regard to economic, environmental and ecological impacts.</P>
      <P>Further consultation with local authorities will be required before a list of urgent coastal erosion projects for inclusion in the programme can be finalised. In addition, an Operational Programme to enable the EC funding to be drawn down remains to be agreed with the Commission of the European Communities. Pending completion of these exercises it is not possible to identify which projects will be included in the finalised programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The outbreak of bonamia disease in the Clarinbridge oyster bed, was first detected in September 1989 by the Department's Fisheries Research Centre.</P>
      <P>An investigation undertaken by the Department's senior fish pathologist in 1989 concluded that the disease was in all likelihood introduced into the Clarinbridge Fishery by unauthorised transfers into the area of native oysters.</P>
      <P>While bonamia does not affect the taste or edibility of the oyster in any way and poses no health risk whatsoever to oyster consumers, it does result in heavy mortalities in the affected stocks.  Once established it is notoriously difficult to control and eliminate.</P>
      <P>The quality of oysters taken by oyster fishermen in the Clarinbridge fishery has steadily declined since 1989.  This has been confirmed by ongoing sampling during the past four years.  Recent fishing effort disclosed that very few adult oysters remain on the beds at Clarinbridge and catch returns were extremely poor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even prior to the outbreak of bonamia at Clarinbridge in 1989 movements of molluscan shellfish within the State other than for direct human consumption were subject to strict controls under licensing procedures.  These controls have been maintained and rigorously enforced. Restrictions on the importation of oysters from outside the State have been in place since 1959 and have enabled Ireland to keep out shellfish diseases which are endemic in other countries.  Oysters brought in from abroad are subject to strict health certification requirements as prescribed by Council Directive 91/67 EEC. This Directive lays down health rules for the placing on the market, including intra community trade, of aquaculture animals <Col N="1456" /> and products such as oysters in the context of the completion of the internal market and the need to open up trade while avoiding the spread of infectious or contagious diseases.</P>
    <P>Following the 1989 bonamia outbreak at Clarinbridge the Galway Bay area was subject to intensive sampling by the Department to track and contain the outbreak. Initially all movements of oysters to, from and within the area were suspended other than for direct human consumption. Once identified, the affected site at Clarinbridge was totally destocked under the Department's direction and subsequent oyster movements continued to be strictly controlled.</P>
    <P>These control and monitoring measures have assisted in preventing the disease spreading to unaffected oyster fisheries around the country which are regularly tested to ensure their continued general health status.</P>
    <P>The Department is currently reviewing the existing restriction on movement arrangements in consultation with the Fisheries Board, BIM and the shellfish industry to ensure that the maximum protection possible is in place for unaffected fisheries and to strengthen and enhance controls if possible.</P>
    <P>In addition, and also in conjunction with the Western Regional Fisheries Board, BIM and the industry, the Department is working to identify further management measures which could be introduced to minimise the disease impact in the Clarinbridge oyster fishery and rebuild stocks.</P>
    <P>I would stress that full co-operation of the industry and compliance with national and Community movement controls absolutely vital to ensure the containment of the disease.  Unauthorised and reckless movements of oysters can only accelerate the problem and are not in the interests of the Irish shellfish industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three essential components to the question raised by the Deputy.  These relate to responsibility for the making of policy, responsibility for the execution of policy and to mechanisms for appeal against decisions taken.</P>
      <P>The making of policy is a political responsibility vested in the Government and the Minister and overseen by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Responsibility for policy making cannot be devolved to any executive or independent body and any such body would have to observe whatever policy guidelines are laid down. In many areas of administration, and this is especially so in areas of fisheries administration, the difficulties and grievances which many individuals raise relate to policy issues rather than alleged unfairness in handling any particular case.</P>
      <P>As regards the issues of licences and leases, one of the key considerations in deciding on structures is the relative cost effectiveness and efficiency of different arrangements.  As of now I am satisfied that the devolution of licensing type functions in the Marine area to new executive agencies would not be cost effective. However, there is in progress a review of the licensing process for the aquaculture sector and I will consider carefully in this context the various views received.</P>
      <P>The argument for an independent licensing body is sometimes put forward on the basis that there is an inevitable political bias in any system which is under the direct control of a Minister.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that this is the case. Moreover, there are ample safeguards via the Office of the Ombudsman and the Courts to ensure that the citizen is protected against any unfairness in the making of individual decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not at the moment see the need, therefore, for the setting up of any new special appeals system against individual <Col N="1458" /> decisions taken by the Minister for the Marine in the implementation of policy.</P>
    <P>However, I would qualify the foregoing statement in so far as the Minister is involved in the taking of decisions of a planning nature where the results of the decision may have significant implications for individuals or groups other than those directly granted or refused a licence.  This may be the case occasionally with foreshore or aquaculture licences and, especially so, where the local authority planning and appeals process does not apply.  At the moment the only recourse available to an aggrieved party is appeal by judicial review or otherwise to the Courts.  This process can be expensive and time consuming for all parties as well as being adversarial and divisive. While I have no immediate plans to change the present system, this is an issue which will be kept in mind in the ongoing review of the relevant legislation.</P>

      <P>I intend to answer oral Question No. 56 and written Question No. 100 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware the Community is currently negotiating tariff reductions with world trading partners within the context of the GATT Uruguay Round.  The Community is committed to achieving in this round a one-third reduction on average across all tariffs. The negotiating process involves the Community side in tabling and receiving tariff reduction offers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to possible reductions in <Col N="1459" /> fishery tariffs, the Commission did recently table certain proposals at the GATT negotiations.  These proposals had been made without any consultation with member states.</P>
    <P>This matter was raised at the Fisheries Council on 22 November last.  I made it clear to the Commission that I had serious problems with both the procedures adopted by them and the actual content and level of the tariff cuts envisaged.</P>
    <P>These concerns have since been reiterated in Brussels at meetings of the relevant Community groups dealing with the Uruguay Round.  I would, at this juncture, like to assure the Deputy that every effort will continue to be made to keep any tariff concessions offered in the fisheries sector to a minimum.</P>

      <P>The protection of all fish <Col N="1462" /> stocks, in Irish waters is a top priority for the State's Fishery Control Service both on land and on sea.  The Sea Fisheries Officers of the Department of the Marine, the Naval Service and the Air Corps are continuously upgrading their monitoring and control programmes to ensure greater protection for the valuable fish resources in our waters.</P>
      <P>A substantial five year capital investment programme, designed to enhance the effectiveness of Ireland's fisheries surveillance services commenced in 1991. The total package, at a cost of £34 million was approved for EC aid at a rate of 50 per cent.  Under this programme a range of new monitoring equipment, including fixed wing aircraft for the Air Corps and communications and data handling equipment for the Naval Service and the Department of the Marine is being acquired.  In addition inshore surveillance boats are being provided under the package.</P>
      <P>The Naval Service has a total of seven vessels which are employed principally in fishery patrols; aerial surveillance is provided by the Air Corps using the new Casa aircraft and an additional two such aircraft will be delivered next year.  The Department of the Marine has doubled its complement of Sea Fishery Officers who provide an onshore fisheries surveillance and control service.</P>
      <P>The penalties for illegal fishing and other breaches of the law are particularly tough, attracting in certain cases fines of up to £100,000.  Where persistent offenders are concerned, in addition to any other fines and forfeitures, the courts have discretionary powers under the Acts to order the confiscation of the offending boats.  Up to now, however, following a first conviction, some vessel owners appear to have transferred ownership of the vessel to a new company so as to eliminate the possibility of confiscation upon a subsequent conviction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To address this apparent loophole, early next year I will be introducing amending legislation which will permit the Court to order the forfeiture of a vessel in cases where: (i) the offence or a combination of offences is considered by <Col N="1463" /> the Court to constitute a serious abuse of conservation measures and a prohibited exploitation of the quotas; (ii) the conviction is a 2nd or subsequent conviction on indictment for an offence committed on board the same ship within three years of the date of the previous offence.</P>
    <P>Where there are grounds for suspicion that the change of ownership was effected in order to evade the possible forfeiture upon a further conviction, the onus of proof that the transfer was bona fide, at arms length and that the sale price reflected the real market value of the vessel will rest with the defendant.</P>
    <P>At Community level I have discussed illegal fishing with many of my counterparts in the Commission and have agreed the establishment of a framework for enhanced co-operation between the Irish control authorities and those of other member states.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 74 and 101 together.</P>
      <P>The European Commission is currently in the process of negotiating a framework fisheries agreement with Canada.  This would effectively set out the broad parameters within which annual EC-Canada fisheries agreements could be set.  Assuming adoption of the framework agreement before the end of 1993, the Commission would then proceed to negotiate an agreement for 1994 providing for quota entitlements of specific species and quantities from Canada in return, possibly, for assistance from the European Union in areas such as stock assessments and training.</P>
      <P>I understand that there exists the possibility that fishing rights for mackerel in Canadian waters may be made available to boats of the European Union.  This is something which I will, of course, be watching very closely with a view to assisting Irish vessels that wish to do so in acquiring the opportunity to fish for such stocks.</P>

      <P>Ireland and its partners in the European Union are following closely the situation in Liberia.</P>
      <P>The Agreement, signed in Cotonou, Benin, last July by the three main Liberian parties establishes a framework for a settlement and contains decisions on political, humanitarian and refugee matters. It was welcomed by the European Community which called on all Liberian parties to implement its terms.</P>
      <P>The UN is aware of the need for the disarming of the rival factions, particularly in the light of its experience in Angola.  Under the terms of the Cotonou Agreement, the various factions and the interim government agreed to disarm and demobilise under the control of ECOMOG (Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group) and the UN.  However, the planned ECOMOG reinforcements have been delayed and, of the 300 UN observers, only 122 have arrived to date.  The disarmament and demobilisation programme has been delayed pending their arrival.</P>
      <P>UN Security Council Resolution 788, adopted on 19 November 1992, imposed a mandatory arms embargo on Liberia. Ireland has taken the necessary measures to comply with this embargo.</P>
      <P>It is clear that a significant international effort will be required to help rebuild Liberia after more than four years of civil war.  In a statement on 29 September welcoming the Cotonou Agreement, the European Community said that it was willing to consider what assistance it would be able to provide in the context of a return to peace in Liberia. We hope that other governments, including the United States, will be able to do likewise.</P>
      <P>Ireland continues to monitor the situation and will support efforts in the European Union and the United Nations to facilitate the peace process.</P>

      <P>The Irish United Nations Veterans' Association has expressed interest in acquiring a lease of portion of the Department of Defence property known as Rockbrae House, Bray, County Wicklow. The future of this property is, <Col N="1473" /> however, presently under consideration in consultation with the Office of Public Works.  As it is necessary, in the first instance, to establish and meet prior State requirements for the property in question, this Department is not in a position at present to consider in isolation the association's request for a lease of portion thereof.</P>

      <P>The meeting to which the Deputy refers dealt with a number of matters, four of which were of particular interest to Ireland.  These were a proposal for a Community wide system of licensing for fishing vessels, the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG), a Commission proposal for reductions on tariffs as part of the GATT negotiations and the Review of the Iberian Accession Arrangements.</P>
      <P>All four proposals presented particular difficulties for myself and a number of other Ministers at the Council.  The only decision of relevance which emanated from the meeting in relation to these matters was that a passport/identity type licence should be agreed for all Community fishing vessels before the end of 1993.  This matter, the FIFG and the proposed GATT concessions will be the subject of further discussion over the coming weeks.</P>

      <P>The incident on the passenger vessel <i>mv Norrona</i> occurred on 9 April 1990.  The vessel was Danish registered and the incident occurred in British waters.  Responsibility for the holding of investigations into the incident was a matter for the Danish and British authorities. However, as the vessel was on charter to the B &amp; I Line at the time the Minister for the Marine appointed Capt. Davies, a Marine Surveyor of the Department to report to him on the incident from the point of view of maritime safety. Capt. Davies's report was prepared in co-operation with the B &amp; I Line.  In compiling his report Capt. Davies took statements on a confidential basis from crew members and others.  This procedure was in accordance with the longstanding policy of non-publication of reports of investigations into marine incidents at that time.  I regret, therefore, that I am not in a position to publish Capt. Davies report.</P>
      <P>The recommendations made by Capt, Davies in his report on the <i>mv Norrona</i> were considered by the National Ferry Safety Committee with a view to improving safety procedures on board ferries and to avoid recurrence of a further such incident.</P>
      <P>The recommendations, which have been implemented, relate to staff training in emergency procedures, regular holding of fire drills, improved fire detection and fire-fighting equipment and emergency evacuation procedures.</P>

The forum has met quarterly since its establishment last year and is currently developing its work programme for 1994.</P>
    <P>The objective of the forum is to promote the highest standards of safety and passenger service for consumers on board passenger ferries operating into and out of Irish ports.

      <P>A review of the safety aspects of passenger ferry transport has been continuing since 1987 when the National Ferry Safety Committee &mdash; NFSC &mdash; was established.  The <i>Herald of Free Enterprise</i> disaster in that year had highlighted deficiencies in safety procedures onboard passenger ferries.  The committee is chaired by the Department's Chief Surveyor and includes senior technical representatives from all the ferry companies operating into Irish ports.  The committee reviews safety procedures and standards on board Irish registered ferries, considers any measures necessary to improve safety and makes recommendations, as appropriate to the ferry operators and to the Department.  The NFSC is a technical safety committee in which the social partners do not have a function.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any other generalised problem with fish stocks in the west although there may be localised difficulties in particular areas from time to time.

      <P>An application for a sea fishing boat licence was received from the person to whom the Deputy refers and has been considered by the Department.

      <P>As regards the arrangements to regularise the position of unregistered vessels, I can confirm that, as has been agreed with the European Commission, an additional 3,000 gross registered tonnes may be added to the capacity of the Irish fleet to enable the registration of vessels which were part of the fleet since 1984 but which for various reasons have never been formally registered.</P>
      <P>As the vessel in question was introduced into the country sometime in the last two years, it would appear that it is not eligible for consideration in the context of the allocation of the 3,000 tonnes.  However, I have instructed that the case be re-examined.</P>

      <P>On 21 November, 1993, I announced a special £3 million consumer marketing plan co-funded by the Exchequer, the EC and the tourism industry targeted at the North American tourist market.  The campaign will be overseen by my Department and will involve the tourism industry, including hoteliers, tour operators and carriers in a co-operative venture with the Department. <Col N="1487" /> This is of course in addition to Bord Fáilte's normal promotional activities aimed at the American market.</P>
      <P>The World Cup will create an opportunity to increase US visitors to Ireland. The extra aircraft capacity being provided for Irish supporters travelling to the US, will be fully utilised by making the spare capacity on &ldquo;the empty legs&rdquo; available for US visitors to Ireland.  This capacity will be vigorously promoted.</P>
      <P>In relation to domestic tourism, Bord Fáilte is to intensify its efforts with the industry to encourage Irish people to take holiday breaks at home, particularly during the off-season.  With the help of business sponsorship, a major national TV promotional campaign is planned which will focus on the value and variety of holiday breaks available in the spring and autumn periods.</P>
      <P>The impact and results of the Discover Ireland spring campaign should counteract any potential loss of domestic tourism revenue through Irish people attending the World Cup next year.</P>
      <P>I should also point out that when Ireland took part in the World Cup in Italy in 1990, tourism from Italy in that year increased by 97 per cent.  Further increases of 31.5 per cent and 5.2 per cent were recorded in 1991 and 1992 respectively.</P>

    <P>The national primary childhood immunisation schedule was revised in 1992 to provide for the vaccination, against MMR at 15 months and also at ten-14 years of age for boys and girls who have not previously been vaccinated.</P>
    <P>I consider it vital that the common perception among parents that measles is a disease of little consequence be corrected. While the majority of children who contact measles recover quickly a small number, however, may suffer long term neurological damage and other consequences.</P>
    <P>I have already stated a number of times that I consider that the uptake of MMR is unacceptably low and must be increased.  I have launched a number of initiatives to bring this about including a television and radio campaign in August and September.  I propose to conduct a new media campaign to promote the MMR vaccine and other immunisations in the near future.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, I have established a working group under the chairmanship of the chief medical officer of my Department to review the existing arrangements for the delivery of vaccinations.  This group will include representatives from my Department, the health boards, the Irish College of General Practitioners, the Irish Society of Medical Officers of Health and the Irish Medical Organisation and is expected to report quickly.</P>

      <P>The Western Regional Mental Handicap Co-ordinating Committee, on which the Brothers of Charity were represented, recommended that the priority need for the additional funding provided in 1993 for the Western Health Board region was the strengthening of the funding base of the Galway County Association and the Western Care Association.  In view of their local knowledge of needs I accepted their view.</P>
      <P>The question of the provision of additional resources in 1994 for the development of services for people with a mental handicap is currently the subject of discussions in the context of the budgetary arrangements for 1994.  Any additional funding which may be provided will be allocated having regard to whatever guidelines may be issued by my Department and the priority developments identified by the Regional Mental Handicap Co-ordinating Committee.  If the service mentioned by the Deputy is given priority by the co-ordinating committee I would hope to be in a position to support it in 1994.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 134 and 135 together.</P>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the approval given to the Eastern Health Board in 1991 and 1992 to create additional social worker posts and to the approval that I gave to the Eastern Health Board this year to create 22 additional social worker posts and ten child care worker posts as part of the preparations for the full implementation of the Child Care Act, 1991.</P>
      <P>In 1991 11 posts of social worker were created.  These were recruited during 1991 and assigned to the following areas: the child abuse prevention programme; recruitment and training of foster families within the travelling community; establishment of an After Hours Social Work Service for homeless young persons; recruitment and training of families to take homeless adolescents on an emergency basis; provision of social work services for homeless families resident in north city hostels.</P>
      <P>During 1992 approval was given to the creation of eight additional social worker posts.  These posts were deployed among the board's community care areas to improve the level of social work service, particularly in relation to the recruitment and training of additional foster families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1993 approval was given to the creation of 22 additional social worker posts.  Twenty one of these posts are being assigned to the community care teams and the remaining post is being assigned to the child psychiatric services in Kildare.  I understand from the Eastern Health Board that competitions for social worker have been held and the board is now in the process of offering posts to the successful candidates.  The majority of these posts will be filled before the end of this year.  Pending filling of the posts on a permanent basis the board appointed 11 additional social workers on a temporary basis in June 1993.  These temporary <Col N="1492" /> posts will be phased out as the newly appointed permanent staff take up duty.</P>
    <P>The ten child care posts are being assigned to the board's community care teams.  Competitions for child care workers are continuing and the board is in the process of offering appointments to the candidates that have been successful to date.</P>

      <P>The sick pay scheme in the health board is administered by the chief executive officer.  The grant of sick leave is therefore at the discreation of the chief executive officer.  I have had inquiries made with the Western Health Board regarding this case.  The chief executive officer has exercised his discreation in deciding not to grant sick leave pay having had due regard to the circumstances of this particular case and the sick leave record of the person concerned.</P>
      <P>I understand, however, that the case is under review at the present time and that a meeting with the person concerned will be arranged in the near future.</P>

Having considered all the factors involved, particularly the nature and extent of the work, the estimated costings in excess of £2 million and the less than satisfactory final outcome in terms of facility enhancement, it has not been possible to authorise grant assistance towards the project.

      <P>An increase of £3.4 million was made in the 1993 provision for capitation grants for primary schools.  This enabled me to increase the standard rate of grant to £33 per pupil in ordinary national <Col N="1495" /> schools, with <i>pro-rata</i> increases for certain other categories of school.  This increase cost in the region of £2.8 million. The remaining £0.6 million was used to initiate further measures to assist those who are most disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to improve the financial position of primary and post-primary schools to the extent that the availability of resources permits.  I will be reviewing the existing rates of capitation grant to schools in the light of the results of the unit cost studies on primary and post-primary schools when summaries and my comments thereon have been prepared.</P>
