      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 22, 23 and 24.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that Nos. 1, 2, 4, 5 to 11 and 13 to 18 shall be decided without debate.  The proceedings on the Report and Final Stages of No. 22, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion by 1.30 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall in relation to amendments include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Finance.  In the case of the resumed debate on No. 24, the speech of each Member called on shall not exceed 20 minutes.  Private Members' Business shall be No. 25 and the proceedings thereon shall be brought to a conclusion not later than 8.30 p.m. today.</P>

      <P>Is it agreed that Nos. 1, 2, 4, 5 to 11 and 13 to 18 shall be decided without debate?  Agreed.  Are the proposals for dealing with No. 22 satisfactory?  Agreed.  Are the proposals for dealing with No. 24, the resumed budget debate, agreed?  Agreed.  Is the proposal that Private Members' Business shall be concluded at 8.30 p.m. agreed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a query about <Col N="678" /> the taking of item No. 4 without debate. It refers to the appointment of the committee which is to be responsible for justice, law reform and defence matters.  I note that item No. 7 proposes the committee responsible for equality matters, is to be a separate committee.  As equality and law reform matters are dealt with by one Minister, should they not be dealt with by one committee?  I raised this matter indirectly with the Minister for State and I do not understand why the terms of reference before us have separated law reform and equality matters, giving the Select Committee on Legislation and Security responsibility for law reform matters and the Select Committee on Social Affairs responsibility for equality matters.  As I drew the Minister's attention to this matter, I am surprised that it has appeared in this form.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton raised that matter with me and my response was that legal and justice matters will be dealt with by the Select Committee on Legislation and Security and that the other matters will be dealt with by a different committee.  There is no problem in this regard.  The Minister for Equality and Law Reform will have a right to attend either committee.  Certain equality legislation will be dealt with directly by the Select Committee on Social Affairs and law reform matters will be dealt with by the other committee. The Minister will have a right to, and will, attend both committees.</P>

      <P>With regard to items Nos. 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 and 7, this is a very important development in terms of the efficient running of the business of this House.  We on this side of the House support the setting-up of these committees. <Col N="680" /> However, I have to stress that fundamental to that support is the provision of proper resources and staff for these committees.  Judging from the treatment given to the editorial and reporting sections of the House, it will be very difficult for these committees to operate effectively if they are not properly staffed, resourced and financed.  I ask the Taoiseach to ensure that these factors are put in place without delay so that the committees can operate and carry out their business in an efficient manner.</P>

      <P>I wish to say a few brief words of appreciation to Paddy Cullagh on his retirement.  He has given 28 years of remarkable service to the House.  I believe his easy disposition and friendly and helpful attitude was appreciated by all parties.  We should recognise his long years of service by saying, &ldquo;Thanks for a job well done&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I should like to join the Taoiseach in paying tribute to Paddy Cullagh, the son of Tipperary who is retiring from the House.  Paddy Cullagh was well known around the House for the quality of his horse racing tips, although I think that even he would not have foreseen what happened last Saturday.</P>

      <P>I endorse what has been said and should like to add to the tribute that has been paid by saying that Mr. Paddy Cullagh was a good and gracious person on the staff of this House.  He was <Col N="686" /> exceedingly helpful to us all, especially when we came to Leinster House as newly elected Members and did not know our way around the House.  He has been a particularly helpful, kind and gracious member of the staff.  On behalf of my party, I wish Paddy Cullagh a long, very happy and very sporty retirement.  I hope that he will continue to feed in the tips, especially to the Tipperary people and especially when Cork and Tipperary find themselves in a head and head encounter &mdash; and I hope that he shall not lead the Cork people astray on such occasions.</P>

I am pleased to be associated with the kind remarks made with regard to Paddy Cullagh and the service he has rendered this House and Members of the House.  I daresay that Paddy Cullagh would be the second most notable Tipperary man here, second only to yourself, a Cheann Comhairle.</P>

      <P>Seldom would I agree with Deputy De Rossa, but this is one occasion on which I do.  On behalf of all Tipperary people who are not leaving Leinster House, I pay equal tribute to Paddy Cullagh.  I hope that he enjoys his retirement back in Ballycahill, where he could lose a bullock when the grass is at full growth.</P>

Paddy never allowed his county allegiance to interfere with his work in the House, but he was always a source of tickets for us when the GAA could not provide them.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(7)  Where the account of the Exchequer at the Central Bank has been operated to a material extent otherwise than in accordance with this section, the Comptroller and Auditor General shall, as soon as practicable&mdash;</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's amendment.  The Minister would recall, however, that the discussion held on Wednesday last in relation to the Central Bank and its accountability was somewhat wider in scope than the provision made in the amendment.  Such measures as the accountability of the Central Bank in the context of currency policy, devaluation and the bank's supervisory role in relation to financial institutions were discussed. In this amendment the Minister <Col N="715" /> goes into the very narrow area of the accounts of the Central Bank.  Opposition Deputies tried to emphasise last week that the Central Bank should be in some way accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts.  The Minister said that she was favourably disposed to the concept of some form of scrutiny of the Central Bank.  Having received the Minister's amendments just this morning, I do not see reference to this issue anywhere else.  It seems that on Report Stage the Minister is tabling only two amendments. Mindful of the fact that on Report Stage one can intervene only once, I shall try to make the most of this opportunity presented to me.</P>

      <P>Essentially, the point was made last week that at present it is virtually impossible for Deputies to ascertain what the cost of a real devaluation of 8.33 per cent was to the Central Bank. We want to know what was the cost in terms of what was owed to the European banking system and in terms of replenishing the external reserves &mdash; some £3.5 billion was used in support of the currency.</P>
      <P>The other matter raised concerned the supervisory role relating to building societies, banks and so on.  At a time when we learn of scandals in relation to golden handshakes and in relation to the residential property of executives, there is no vehicle that provides for the transparency or accountability of the Central Bank.  I have had questions ruled out of order in the House and other Deputies have had experiences that are similarly frustrating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week Deputy Mitchell talked of the accounting officer role of the Central Bank and suggested that the bank be put on a par with other bodies in this regard. I recollect the Deputy mentioning An Bord Pleanála and other institutions.  It seems to me that the Minister, in responding to that point has missed the major point made, which concerned the <Col N="716" /> general accountability of the Central Bank.  While the Fine Gael Party supports this amendment, my colleagues and I are critical of the fact that those points have not been taken cognisance of and have not been responded to effectively.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I support amendment No. 1.  Perhaps in my contribution I might make a couple of points that to some extent would obviate discussion on amendment No. 2.</P>
      <P>I raised this matter on the last occasion on which we discussed this Bill and received the support, I think, of all other Deputies in the House on this issue. Indeed, the Minister seemed very sympathetic. As I recall it, the Minister of State drew a distinction between the critical responsibility of the Central Bank for policy matters, especially the protection of the currency from the impact of interest rates and, consequently, its knock-on effect on our economy generally. She drew a distinction between that and the accounting role of the Comptroller and Auditor General in respect of the Central Bank.  I fully understand and appreciate that, but may I make this point?  Nobody is seeking to impinge on the independence of the Central Bank, but the question was one of accountability.  It seems to me that the role of the Central Bank is so critical in a modern economy, especially during the run-up to monetary union, having regard to our experience over recent months and to certain public criticisms that have been made public for the first time about the conduct of the affairs of the Central Bank, that we require something more than the accounts of the Central Bank being audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his role as auditor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has kindly arranged to have distributed a list of the various agencies, bodies and organisations for whom the Comptroller and Auditor General carries out this function.  I appreciate that, but that was not the point in the case of the Central Bank; I knew that function was being fulfilled.  The difference is that the Governor of the Central Bank does <Col N="717" /> not appear before the Committee of Public Accounts.  That is an important element of this accountability, because we have seen in the case of other accounting officers who are required to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts that, within reason, they deal with questions of concern to Members of this House about the responsibility of that particular accounting officer.  We still do not have that kind of access by the Governor of the Central Bank, nor is he required to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts.  All right; he may only be answering in respect of the budgetary allocation to the Central Bank for the conduct of its affairs.  However, that in itself is very important, because some of the criticisms we have observed of the Central Bank relate to such matters as, for example, the deployment of staff there, how modern are its procedures, technology and arrangements to cope with the kind of crisis we experienced over the past six months.</P>
    <P>There are very many questions surrounding that area Deputies would like to have an opportunity to pursue directly with the Governor of the Central Bank. Of its very nature I contend that would satisfy to some extent this requirement of accountability.  I think a majority in the House believe that the era of traditional secrecy and confidentiality surrounding the Central Bank is over.  I think there is a consensus in the House also that the independence of the Central Bank cannot be equated to secrecy and confidentiality. Having regard to the import of decisions taken by the Central Bank &mdash; there are other agencies involved but most critically those taken by the Central Bank &mdash; there is a necessity to explain the rationale of some of those decisions and to satisfy public concerns about some of the issues that have been raised.</P>
    <P>I do not know what was the status of the Minister's remarks on the last occasion that we in this House may have an opportunity, through the proposed Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs, to question the Governor of the Central Bank on policy issues.  If the Minister is speaking for the Government, <Col N="718" /> as distinct from expressing her views, perhaps she would avail of the opportunity to clarify that.  I would welcome such clarification, which would constitute a major step forward.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion on which we discussed this matter Deputy Gay Mitchell, in supporting my comments on this area, instanced his recent experience of having met the Governor of the Bank of England and the fact that the Governor of the Bank of England is required on a regular basis to be accountable to Committees of Parliament and to explain major decisions to Members of Parliament.  If the Minister is saying that, in the area of policy one of the new committees &mdash; presumably the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs &mdash; in future will have an opportunity to examine, exchange views and pose questions to the Governor and staff of the Central Bank directly, that would constitute a major step forward.  But in the interim I cannot see any reason why he ought not properly be required to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>May I make a few comments in support of what Deputy Rabbitte has said in this regard to the Minister?  For example, the First Schedule to this Bill sets out the agencies or bodies whose accounts are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I take the point the Minister has properly made drawing a distinction between the policy-making and accounting functions.  It is interesting to observe listed in that First Schedule bodies such as the National Economic and Social Council, Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited and the Economic and Social Research Institute.  Nobody in this House would want to have the Director of the Economic and Social Research Institute called to appear before the Committee on Public Accounts, seeking to diminish its degree of freedom with regard to policy-making decisions.  But one might want to talk about how the institute chooses to allocate some of the funding it receives. Likewise, in regard to the National Economic and Social Council, nobody here <Col N="719" /> would want to endeavour to delimit its function and remit in terms of its mandate; yet there is an accounting dimension involved.  However, it appears to me that if we can have access in policy terms to bodies from whom we derive considerable advice and expertise &mdash; the ESRI is a classic example in terms of its publications, as is the NESC, the same kind of thing &mdash; then logically why is it not possible to extend the same procedure to the Central Bank?  At the same time we recognise that the latter has an independent statutory existence, as indeed have a number of these bodies provided for in law, which will continue in tandem with but separate from their appearance here in the First Schedule.  Given the independence of many of those agencies even in operational terms &mdash; for instance, the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited &mdash; their accountability in the First Schedule to the Comptroller and Auditor General in no way diminishes their appropriate degree of freedom under the legislation which established them and under whose provisions they must operate.</P>
      <P>For all of those reasons there is a case to be advanced for the inclusion of the Central Bank in the First Schedule, with due regard to the point the Minister made about policy, without intruding into the policy domain of the Central Bank &mdash; no more than I would presume the Minister would expect we would intrude into the domain of the NESC, the ESRI, the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited or any other bodies listed in the First Schedule.</P>

      <P>As I said on a previous occasion, the policy functions of the Central Bank, which appear to be those in which Deputy Rabbitte has an interest, are appropriate to the select committee on Finance and General Affairs which is being established by this House.  In respect of the disbursement of moneys by the Central Bank I should say that this amendment adds the words &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo; which should speed <Col N="720" /> up the presentation of any report of the Comptroller and Auditor General in relation to what is the Central Bank's internal organisation of its funds.  I might point out that in fact the Central Bank made money during the recent currency crisis.  I understand its profits rose by approximately £18 million.  However, Members will appreciate that the Central Bank, in carrying out its functions as the independent monetary authority of the State, is not governed by considerations of what profit it will make in deciding how it devises or implements its policies. The policy functions of the Central Bank should properly be dealt with by the appropriate economic, financial policy committee of this House.  Of course, I would also need to declare an interest in relation to the internal disbursement of funds within the ESRI.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 35 and 36, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c) audit the accounts of the Central Bank.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As I have said, to some degree the discussion we had previously obviates the necessity to have a long debate on this amendment.  I raised this matter on Committee Stage and the Minister of State, in so far as she can, has responded in amendment No. 1.  However, I argue that the big deficit is that the Members of this house, through the Committee of Public Accounts, do not have an opportunity to question the Governor of the Central Bank.  I do not see, even within the narrow remit to which this amendment would apply, why this should be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, the Clerk of this House, as Accounting Officer, is answerable to the Committee of Public Accounts and must and does appear before it on a regular basis.  I consider that the Clerk of <Col N="721" /> the House has onerous and important responsibilities and I am sure he would take no offence if I were to suggest that the general impact of his decisions in terms of their knock on effect on the economy is not of the same import as the impact of the decisions of the Governor of the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>The public would be greatly interested to hear that the Central Bank made a profit of £18 million during the currency crisis.  There are two remarks that one could make, the first of which is that if the Central Bank did not make a profit during that period there would be no hope left for us, and the second is that this is only one side of the equation. There were other decisions to which, it has been reported, the Central Bank was firmly committed and which did not result in a profit for the economy but, as the Minister of State has said, that is a matter for discussion on another day.</P>
    <P>I press this amendment as I do not see the reason &mdash; no more than some of the Accounting Officers who must appear before us &mdash; why the Governor of the Central Bank should not appear before us.  Taken within the remit of this amendment and this debate, which is circumscribed by non-policy matters, the question of accountability in relation to its own funds is the issue on which we received much criticism in the wake of the currency crisis.  I am in no position to say whether public comment about the conduct of the affairs of the Central Bank was fair or reasonable but what I do know is that some of these comments were penned by former members of the staff of the Central Bank.  I would like to have an opportunity to test them against the Governor of the Central Bank who has responsibility.</P>
    <P>I do not see how it fits in with the Minister of State's argument that we must be careful not to intrude on policy matters and that we are dealing with the narrow area of accounting.  In the narrow area of accounting we would have the usual facility, as members of the Committee of Public Accounts, to question the Governor of the Central Bank on his <Col N="722" /> area of responsibility as defined in this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a number of points.  Would the Minister of State clarify that what she is saying is that it would be more appropriate for the finance committee to examine this issue than the Committee of Public Accounts and whether the Governor of the Central Bank will be accountable to the finance committee?  Is she giving that undertaking to the House?  It strikes me, if she is trying to deflect our attention towards that committee, it is only reasonable that there be transparency but I fear that this will not be the case as no provision was made for this in the terms of reference we dealt with this morning.  Would the Minister of State clarify whether she is deflecting us up a <i>cul-de-sac</i> which is of no use or benefit in seeking transparency?</P>
      <P>I am intrigued by the Minister of State's remarks that the Central Bank made a profit of £18 million.  I am aware that that is the Central Bank's view, that if one takes a particular look at the transactions in relation to the external reserves one could come to that figure but this is less than a full account of what happened. One will find that on 31 January this year &mdash; the day the devaluation took place &mdash; the Central Bank owed the European banking system some £800 million for its support for the currency during the period in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would the Minister of State clarify &mdash; on Report Stage we do not get an opportunity to tease matters out as we do on Committee Stage &mdash; that the big loser in the devaluation debacle was the National Treasury Management Agency in so far as it was instructed during the period between September 1992 and the end of January this year to borrow abroad, in hard foreign currency, an additional £2.3 billion?  This money was not raised domestically or in sterling and the cost is well in excess of £220 million.  In the same way as the speculators won, somebody lost. The question that must be asked, therefore, and I would like the Minister of State to clarify this, is whether the National Treasury Management Agency <Col N="723" /> are fully accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts.  It is a borderline case as to what is a policy decision &mdash; whether one borrows in sterling, Austrian schillings, Deutsche Marks or Swiss francs. This could be construed as a policy decision or as an Executive action but either way it is the taxpayer who has to foot the bill if there are errors of judgment.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister of State clarify, first, whether the Governor of the Central Bank, in relation to the issue of transparency, will appear before the finance committee and, second, if the National Treasury Management Agency will be able to account fully for its almost disastrous decisions in recent months?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the governor of the Central Bank, I decided that on this issue I should get on my bike as well.  The Central Bank made a profit of £18 million and therefore even on a wet day it could afford to send the governor here in a taxi to meet Members.  At least that would be good news, that is if we provide a facility to meet him.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State has made the point that it would be more appropriate for another committee to deal with this matter than to deal with it under the Comptroller and Auditor General Bill.  I hope that is the case but I would point out to the Minister of State, in respect of the highly independent European Central Bank proposed under the Maastricht Treaty, that notwithstanding a very rigorous definition provision is made for a considerable degree of accountability in the form of an annual report by the Central Bank to the European Parliament which will be debated by its relevant committee and in plenary session.  However, we have no equivalent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the implication of the Minister of State's assurance on this matter is that the Central Bank will be held accountable to another committee of the House in relation to policy one would be less vigorous in trying to find some bridge to ensure accountability in respect of the bank.  Like the Minister of State, I am a <Col N="724" /> new Member of this House and as I become more acquainted with the ring craft and stage craft in this institution, I observe that one should find some little bridge to explore material.  It is important that some bridge be built between this House and the Central Bank.  If the Minister of State is reassuring us that a bridge will be built to another committee this would be a satisfactory outcome and we could stop chewing on this particular bone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>First, the amendment seeks to have the accounts of the Central Bank included under this Bill. As I said the previous day, the accounts of the Central Bank are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General under the Central Bank Act, 1942 and to that extent the proposal is redundant.  As a consequence the Central Bank falls within the ambit of section 9 of this Bill which deals with value for money audits. The White Paper on the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General has proposed changes in the terms of reference of the Committee of Public Accounts, including a change to allow it to examine reports to the Dáil and such other accounts as they see fit which are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and presented to the Dáil.  That change in the terms of reference will give an opportunity to the Committee of Public Accounts to consider the Central Bank's role in terms of financial accountability. The role of the Central Bank and the National Treasury Management Agency in terms of economic policy is more appropriate to the two committees established today on finance and economic policy.  Deputies might read the ESRI report on the national debt which refers to the issue of borrowing in foreign currencies.  That is fundamentally an economic policy issue rather than an issue relating to profit or loss of the National Treasury Management Agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget arithmetic this year provides for the extra £18 million profit earned by the Central Bank from September to the end of January.  It also provides an additional £100 million more <Col N="725" /> than that forecast to be earned by the National Treasury Management Agency. Contrary to the implication made by Deputies opposite, the money management agencies of the State have been making money.  As regards the National Treasury Management Agency, the Minister is answerable to the Committee of Public Accounts since the National Treasury Management Agency exercises powers delegated by the Minister for Finance, and the chief executive may deal with the Committee of Public Accounts in the same way as would an accounting officer.  Deputies can be assured that there are reasonable measures in place to deal with the operations of the financial organs of the State in terms of accountability. The key issues concerning Deputies lie in the economic policy area and are best addressed by the committees dealing with that matter.</P>
    <P>As a result of the Maastricht Treaty and the setting up of the European Central Bank, amending legislation will be introduced on the role of the Central Bank.  That will give Deputies a good opportunity to debate the role and function of the Central Bank.  In this Bill the Central Bank is very much tangential to the whole purpose of the Bill, which relates to the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General and broadening that role to ensure value for money.  Many of the points made by Deputies opposite would be more appropriately dealt with by committees relating to economic policy or in legislation specifically dealing with the Central Bank.  This amendment is redundant because&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cox referred to the necessity to acquire certain ring craft <Col N="726" /> here.  The Minister's ring craft, if I may be so bold as to say, has certainly increased in leaps and bounds.  She has managed extremely expertly to deflect the amendment without saying a great deal.  Before we finish dealing with this amendment, inexpertly worded and inappropriately placed as it may be, I would like some answers from the Minister.  It would be more acceptable if one had even a small share of the advice available to the Executive &mdash; I am not making a partisan point but a real one.  It seems absurd that the entire weight of Civil Service and other advice is available to the Executive while advice on drafting is not available to the Opposition spokespersons.  The Department of Finance has always managed to support the position that the burden of resources is with the Executive and it is difficult for the Opposition to get advice.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister tell the House why she is so determined to keep the Governor of the Central Bank at arm's length from Members of this House?  The Committee of Public Accounts is not going to contaminate him by virtue of the fact that we may ask him a couple of difficult questions.  What is the reason behind the statement that there will be audited reports, that the reports will be available to the Committee of Public Accounts or that such other report will be laid before the House?  We know what that means in practice &mdash; rarely does this House have an opportunity to debate reports of significance. Instruments are laid in the Library every day of the week which this House never has an opportunity to debate.  The nub of the point is the question of the Committee of Public Accounts coming arm to arm with the Governor of the Central Bank, and I am not sure why the Minister wishes to protect that position.  Deputy Cox believes a bridge ought to be built to the Central Bank.  At present there is a subterranean tunnel and I would like to know what is going on in it.  I would like to hear the rationale for some of the decisions made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister suggested &mdash; she may be right &mdash; that the Governor of the Central Bank be required to appear before the <Col N="727" /> Finance and General Affairs Committee. However she is not telling us that he will be required to appear before that committee.  There is nothing in the terms of reference of that committee, which were put through the House this morning, that will require, compel or oblige the Governor of the Central Bank to appear before it.  Therefore the Minister is merely calling on her undoubted reserves of economic expertise, good sense and wisdom in telling us that this is what the Opposition should be seeking. I am quite prepared to be advised by the Minister and acknowledge that that is a good idea; but is this merely a request that we can debate to our hearts content on the Opposition benches, or is the Minister telling us that the Government have had an opportunity to discuss the matter and that it is the disposition of the Government that the Central Bank will be required to present themselves before the Finance and General Affairs Committee?</P>
    <P>I appreciate that when I raised this matter on Committee Stage the Minister had no notice of it.  Perhaps she can fairly say it is somewhat tangential to the Bill, but it is not tangential to the economy and the interests of the economy.  From experience, I suggest the Minister should seize the day, <i>carpe diem</i>.  We have an opportunity here to raise an important issue and it is an opportunity that may not arise soon again.  I would be quite satisfied if the Minister assured us that she is speaking in the knowledge that the matter has been or is being discussed by Government and that it is the disposition of the Government that the Governor of the Central Bank will be required to appear before the Finance and General Affairs Committee.</P>

      <P>Strictly speaking, the Deputy's address closed the debate on amendment No. 2. Nevertheless, if the Minister wishes to reply to questions raised rather than tend to debate, she has my permission to do so. However, she too is under the same stricture as all of us in that she may address <Col N="728" /> the House once only on Report Stage. The only Deputy who may contribute on more than one occasion is the Deputy who has moved an amendment.  If the Minister wishes to intervene by way of reply to a specific question or questions she may do so with the blessing of the Chair.</P>

The Committee of Public Accounts will be entitled therefore to call on the Governor of the Central Bank in relation to the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on the accounts of the Central Bank.

      <P>I have not been involved as a Whip in the detailed negotiation of the terms of reference and how matters will be organised, so I cannot give a straight answer.

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 8, line 30, to delete &ldquo;April&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;February&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This modest amendment, which we discussed last week, substitutes the month of &ldquo;February&rdquo; in place of &ldquo;April&rdquo; and brings forward to February the date by which accounting officers, that is secretaries of Departments, must have their appropriation accounts before the Comptroller and Auditor General, who examines the outturn of expenditure for the previous year.</P>
      <P>This amendment is entirely reasonable. Last week the Minister of State said that &ldquo;The Minister may by order bring forward the date at some time in the future&rdquo;.  But &ldquo;may&rdquo; and &ldquo;will&rdquo; are two different things; while there may be an intention to do it, it may never happen. Since our debate last week something happened which makes my point very compelling.  The Exchequer returns of tax receipts for the first quarter which had to be submitted by 31 March 1993, last Wednesday, were published on Friday, 2 April.  The information can be put together in such a way that it can be published within two days.  Yet we are asking for a four month period for others to account for expenditure.  That shows the way we look at things.  In my view there is no case against bringing forward this date.  It will put pressure on the accounting officers, which is entirely desirable.  It is much better to specify the date in the Bill rather than leaving it to the Government to decide whether to bring it forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because the process is so slow it is virtually a year later before the Committee of Public Accounts examines matters and this means that the nature of accountability to this House is historic. The Comptroller and Auditor General has to have his report to the Committee of Public Accounts by the autumn and, due to one thing or another, it is probably <Col N="730" /> into the next calendar year before the accounts are assessed.  It is not possible to put the breaks on certain areas of public expenditure and to draw certain lessons from accounts that are over a year late.  If we speeded up this part of the process, the time at which the Comptroller and Auditor General begins to study the accounts would be brought forward. This is very desirable and I ask the Minister to accept my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We discussed this point at an earlier Stage and Deputy Yates withdrew his amendment.  The Bill provides that the date is brought forward from the end of April to 31 March.  There is provision in the Bill also for the Minister to tighten up and bring the date forward even further.  We are trying to tighten up accountability, but it is important that we set a date that is practicable. I hope that the pressure will be put on and that in time we will be able to bring forward the date from 31 March to the end of February and eventually to I February, as suggested by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are making a start by bringing forware the date by one month.  It may not be practical at this stage to bring the date forward to the beginning of February, which is bringing it forward by three months.  The difficulty is that some units operate manual systems, so one has to allow for the slowest part of the system. However, we hope to have all systems computeristed in the future.  Until all operations are computerised it would not be practical to accept this proposal.  We all share the Deputy's view that the procedures should be speeded up.  Indeed, I would ask why it takes a year from the date of submission of the Appropriation Accounts to the time they are examined? That period could be shortened and this needs to be looked at as well.  I agree with what the Deputy is trying to achieve; but it would be more effective to bring forward the statutory date by one month, enshrine it in legislation and get it up and running rather than setting a target which is too ambitious and then allowing it not to be implemented.  I would prefer to do what will achieve more progress and in <Col N="731" /> that light I ask the Deputy to withdraw his amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 14, between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;8. &mdash;(1) Accounts of elected local authorities (other than those which may be audited by him under other provisions of this Act) shall be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General in the manner provided in section 6.</P>
      <P>(2) For the purposes of subsection (1) of this section, references in section 6 to a vocational education committee and to the Minister for Education shall be construed as references to a local authority and to the Minister for the Environment, respectively.</P>
      <P>(3) Fees under section 12 shall not be chargeable by the Comptroller and Auditor General in respect of audits under this section.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this Bill we are proposing that the vocational education committees and the health boards move out from the watchful eye of the local government auditors' office and come under the control of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The decision has been taken that councils on which there are local authority members would not come under the Comptroller and Auditor General but remain under the local government auditors' office.  A number of issues arises from this.  The staff concerns need to be addressed.  That is most important.  The trade union, <Col N="732" /> Impact, has made representations about this.</P>
    <P>The only way to proceed is to establish a national audit office, as exists in the United Kingdom, whereby the Comptroller and Auditor General's Office would be decentralised and regionalised and would examine all aspects of the accounts of public institutions and the expenditure of public moneys.  To draw a distinction between the scrutiny exercised by elected councillors and that by members of health boards and vocational education committees is invalid because the very same councillors are in the majority on health boards and vocational education committees &mdash; in other words, the same people are applying the scrutiny under the same procedures.  I do not think that is correct and I do not believe the analysis in the White Paper is valid.  There should be the possibility, as provided by the new section 8, that the work of local government should be brought under the Comptroller and Auditor General and that all the people in the local government audit service would be transferred to a national audit office.</P>
    <P>This makes eminent good sense.  The present liaison arrangements, whereby the Comptroller and Auditor General is sent these accounts, are not sufficient.  If I want to find out whether a mile of resurfacing of road in County Donegal is cheaper than, for instance in Kerry, I cannot do so at the moment.  The Committee of Public Accounts could ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to find out, but individual local government auditors cannot.  I am trying to streamline the service so that everything will go in the direction in which the Government is moving for vocational education committees and health boards.  This would allow us to establish a league table of effectiveness, of cost structures, of a whole variety of performance of local authorities.  As a member of two local authorities, I can say that the facilities are not available for local authorities to analyse expenditure to a satisfactory extent.  I do not know what other local authorities' performance level is in terms <Col N="733" /> of value for money.  If all this information was coming into one office it would be helpful.</P>
    <P>When I was spokesman for health, it became obvious that the prices paid for milk, eggs, butter, cotton wool and laundry services at different hospitals bore no resemblance to each other.  In one area, milk suppliers could get together to form a cartel.  If the information is fed into one office the Comptroller and Auditor General could study it.  Non-medical supplies in the health area are a huge element of the budget.  In terms of studies between direct labour of local authority road workers, as opposed to contract services, one could draw comparisons between different parts of the country. In some areas it would pay to have the plant and equipment available for unforeseen weather circumstances.</P>
    <P>Money from the central budget to local government is of the order of £300 million, which is not an inconsiderable sum. The White Paper pointed out that health boards and vocational education committees get more money from central funds than do local authorities, but that could change.  At the time when rates were abolished the domestic rates support grant accounted for over 50 per cent of the revenue of local government.  That is not the case now, but if there was a property tax that could change.  The argument put forward by the Government does not hold water.  We need a beefed up Comptroller and Auditor General's Office which will become a national audit office for every semi-State company, every non-commercial State body, every body that receives over 50 per cent of its revenue from central funds and every local government body, be it an elected body, a health board or a vocational education committee.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to reflect on this and consider it when the Bill is going through the Seanad.  My arguments are logical and valid and international experience shows that a national audit office is more effective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, this is essentially a policy issue <Col N="734" /> about whether we have one audit service or two.  The decision of the Government is to have two, the existing local government audit service and the Comptroller and Auditor General providing a national audit service.</P>
      <P>The decision was taken to move the vocational education committees and the health boards to the national audit service under the Comptroller and Auditor General because most of their funding comes from central Government and because they are not as directly accountable to local people as are directly elected local authorities.  There is an issue about local accountability and decentralisation. It is a policy issue, and we are on different sides of the fence.</P>
      <P>With regard to the concerns of the staff, I met their representatives and discussions will take place.  In the light of discussions I amended section 17 in committee to allow flexibility for staff to opt to move to the Comptroller and Auditor General's Office or to stay with the local government service.  Staff who are working on vocational education committee and health board audits will not necessarily have to move.  That will be discussed as an industrial relations issue.  Everybody is concerned about the effect on staff and I give an assurance to the House that there will not be any compulsory redundancies on foot of this Bill.  The changes to be brought about by the Bill will be made through negotiation, organisation and consultation, as was the whole decentralisation process which has been so successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is envisaged that the Comptroller and Auditor General's Office will be regionalised as a result of the changes in the Bill and the very considerable regionalisation of central Government services that we have seen in, for example, the decentralisation of the examinations branch to Athlone, the children's allowances section to Letterkenny and other elements of social welfare to Sligo.  To audit those areas one must be on the ground.  We will see a regionalisation of the Comptroller and Auditor General's Office which will facilitate staff moving from the local <Col N="735" /> government audit service to a regionally-based Comptroller and Auditor General's Office.  These are essentially industrial relations issues which will be discussed in that context with the staff concerned.  There need not be any fear arising from the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates is asking us to make a policy change which we do not accept.  It will be up to the House to decide on which view to uphold.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I have dispensed with the points argued in the White Paper. The Minister's arguments do not hold water.  The legislation which we are amending dates back to 1866.  It is not every day that we deal with a Comptroller and Auditor General Bill.  When looking at reform we must look into the distant future regarding the potential decisions to be made.  There is a case for stream-lining the system and for uniformity.  In years to come it will be considered a pity that the Government did not go the whole way in revamping the Comptroller and Auditor General's Office.  For posterity, I would like to press the issue so that when I am vindicated in the future, I will be able to say so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 14, between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;8.&mdash;The Comptroller and Auditor General shall include in each report prepared by him under this Act a comparison of costs&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) as between the public and the private sectors, and</P>
      <P>(b) in the case of health boards, vocational education committees and local authorities, as between the body which is the subject of the report and other such bodies having the same functions as it.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="736" /> My amendment proposes to insert a new section to require the Comptroller and Auditor General to include in his report a specific element of study between public and private sector costings and cost comparisons between health boards, vocational education committees and local authorities.  In the last report of 1991 the project audit dealt with the collection of television licence fees and stores management and control.  Private sector practices included what could be called &ldquo;just in time&rdquo; management techniques or proper controls of stocks so that they would not have huge amounts of biros or shoes in stock to cover three years.  That would not be a good use of money.  There is a myriad of areas in which we have to look at the cost of public administration through the civil or public service and consider what would be the cost if that was open to competitive tendering.  It may well be that the private sector is more expensive because it is trying to make a profit.</P>
    <P>There is justification for people saying that, despite recent increases in public sector pay, the lower grades are paid less than those in the private sector.  It is also possible for performance in the public sector to be weaker.  I would like to see a study on absenteeism in the public and private sectors for similar types of employment.  Is it the case that some people feel they are entitled to a day off per month as a right, as sick leave? Perhaps these practices have evolved over the years.  These questions need to be addressed by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  At present it is left entirely to Mr. McDonnell and the Committee of Public Accounts to decide whether to examine a particular area.  It is right that he should choose, as appropriate, areas which he would like to put under the microscope, for example, the cost of running employment offices.  At present I understand they are done by contract.  What is the cost comparison between running them and employment exchanges?  Alternatively, would it be better to put employment offices entirely under Civil Service control?  At present I understand an employment office is put <Col N="737" /> up for contract, a manager is appointed who, in turn, rents the property and hires the staff; essentially, it is privatised.</P>
    <P>There are many more examples, such as the TB eradication scheme where it could be asked whether it should be operated by Department or private sector vets.  We do not necessarily have to move towards the private sector but there would be a cost comparison between the two.  That question is valid and there should be a section specifying that he would be asked to carry out such comparisons.</P>
    <P>The efficiency or cost effectiveness of local authorities, health boards or vocational education committees depends entirely on the quality of management. The efficient chief executive officers and management structures in individual health boards are getting better value for money than others. There is no transparency in relation to highlighting the good and the bad.  The North-Western Health Board is the most efficient, I have a view on which board is the least effective, which would relate to the quality of management.  There is no basis on which any Member of this House can have material forwarded to him by the Comptroller and Auditor General to make valid appraisals work. After all we are dealing with expenditure of £1.4 billion and it should come under scrutiny.  The Minister of State will have to accept that this is not unreasonable and a report could include these points. I urge the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with much of the substance of the argument advanced by Deputy Yates which deals with systems, procedures and practices and the need to have comparisons between them.  That is something on which I should like to speak later when we return to it on another section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>During the debate the previous day Deputy Yates made a valid point concerning comparisons between the public and private sectors and between different bodies in the same <Col N="738" /> class.  As a result, I am proposing an amendment to section 12 which deals with this issue, it allows the Comptroller and Auditor General to make such comparisons, including comparisons of systems, procedures and practices as he considers appropriate.  Where he proposes to make an examination under this section he may, at his discretion, seek the views of the Committee of Public Accounts to examine and report to Dáil Éireann on the appropriation accounts. That provides the necessary power for the Comptroller and Auditor General. Instead of it being a mandatory power it is better to leave it to the judgment of the Comptroller and Auditor General in relation to where he considers those comparisons would be fruitful.  Indeed, in different years, he may wish to carry out different comparative studies.  The general point is being addressed.</P>
      <P>I would not like to leave the point without saying there are many areas of the public service where the standards of work and work practice are second to none.  The parks department of Dublin County Council is an example.  The quality of their work and work practices is excellent.  In accepting the thrust of the point we should have some comparative figure and it should not be taken as public service bashing.  The public service is second to none and many private sector operators would do well to emulate their efficiency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I am intrigued by the Minister's last remarks.  Two examples I gave were areas where the public sector could substitute work in the private sector in relation to departmental vets as opposed to private sector vets and in the running of employment offices.  That is not to say because one carries the mantle of the Labour Party, especially when the Minister of State said on the previous day that her salary is paid by the Department of Finance, one should think that the public sector is beyond analysis or criticism.  It is highly undesirable to construe criticism as public sector bashing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People working in the public sector, for example, teachers and gardaí, carry <Col N="739" /> a heavy burden of taxation and as part of the 1.1 million people at work they have certain rights, which should be protected by this House, in relation to value for money which they get as taxpayers.  I am surprised the Minister of State should accuse me of public sector bashing when the whole purpose of the Bill is to try to get better scrutiny and accountability in the public sector.  Like Mrs. Marcos the longer the Minister of State is in this House the more she will see the merit of what Members of the Opposition benches are trying to do.</P>
    <P>Having rebuked her I welcome the substantive point made by the Minister of State in relation to subsection (3) of amendment No. 12.  Subsection (4) of amendment No. 12 deals with the role of the Committee of Public Accounts to which I will refer later.  I did not notice this as I did not receive her amendments until this morning.  I hope that point will be brought to the attention of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">

      <P>Amendment No. 8 seeks to allow the Comptroller and Auditor General to inspect the books, records and accounts of bodies which <Col N="740" /> receive not less than 50 per cent of their gross receipts from a body which itself receives not less than half of its gross receipts directly from the State or where the aggregate of the amount received from such a body from a Department or from the Exchequer comes to not less than half the body's gross receipts.  The point was well made in the discussion the previous day that where public money is involved, or if a problem arises in a body receiving a significant share of its funding from the Exchequer, the Comptroller and Auditor General should have a right to examine and report on it to the Committee of Public Accounts.  I am taking that point on board in this amendment. The advice we have received suggests that the wording in our amendment is better than the alternative wording proposed by Deputy Yates in relation to &ldquo;directly&rdquo; or &ldquo;indirectly&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like some clarification on this matter.  I welcome the Minister's amendment, but will she clarify the cut-off point of 50 per cent?  I suppose a cut-off point of 50 per cent is as good as any to include in the legislation but it will refer to those bodies who only receive money directly from the State.</P>
      <P>Does the remit of this section extend to the subsidiary organisations set up by the grant-giving bodies who receive money from the State referred to in the First Schedule?  For example, are the many subsidiaries of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company in which it is the substandial owner and who indirectly receive substantial State funding deemed to be included in this section?</P>

    <Col N="741" />
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>First, we must be clear about what we mean by indirect funding.  The Committee Stage amendments in this regard would have included bodies such as Focus Point the staff of which consists of almost 90 per cent FÁS trainees and people on social employment schemes.  I do not believe it is our intention to include such organisations under this legislation.</P>
      <P>Given the arithmetic involved in SFADCo grants, I do not believe the type of bodies the Deputy referred to will be included.  For example, if the Government gives money to an organisation such as the Irish Red Cross and questions arise in regard to that body, this section will give the Comptroller and Auditor General power to inspect that body.  The intention of this section is to enable an investigation to be carried out into bodies such as the Red Cross, Rehab and so on where over half their funding comes from the State.  In regard to commercial organisations, I do not believe that half of their money will come from the Exchequer either directly or indirectly through SFADCo.  Therefore, I do not believe this will arise in regard to commercial organisations such as the IDA and SFADCo who have procedures in place in regard to funding.  This section deals with a power of inspection rather than an audit.  Initially, it is up to the bodies to organise their audit arrangements and we do not anticipate the resources of the Comptroller and Auditor General being so widely used that he will not be able to administer the new value for money audit we are setting him.  When questions arise in regard to an organisation this new power will allow the Comptroller and Auditor General to investigate such an organisation.  I accept the substantive point made here, but I am advised by those responsible for drafting the Bill that this is the best wording.</P>

      <P>There is no substantial difference between amendments Nos. 8 and 9.  Paragraph (d) has been deleted. Therefore, I am happy to accept the Minister's amendment.  However, will the Minister clarify that she is rejecting paragraph (d) in section 9, which refers to 50 per cent of the equity share capital? In other words, if 50 per cent funding is given in a year, that would apply but if there was an equity injection it would not apply.  Is that what the Minister is rejecting and not the wording?  There is a point of substance in paragraph (d) that she is rejecting.</P>
      <P>I referred last week to two cases where there should be a power of inspection.  A total of £17 million was lost in Aer Lingus Holidays and the Comptroller and Auditor General had no power of inspection. That was regrettable, especially as no questions have been answered at any stage in regard to that company.  We were told by Aer Lingus that the company was subject to litigation against its auditors and we were told subsequently by the Minister that the Director of Public Prosecutions may be involved, but three years later he has done nothing.  There was a successful shroud of secrecy in regard to that entire matter and there was no accountability to anybody.</P>
      <P>The second case I put forward was that of Tipperary Enterprises in regard to the Leader programme.  That company received almost its entire moneys from a Department of State.  Once this amendment is passed, will there be a right of inspection in regard to both those cases?</P>

      <P>I share the concern expressed in regard to the unaccountability of public money, as occurred in the case of Aer Lingus Holidays. However, I am happy, having followed up the point, that the appropriate way to deal with such companies is for the semi-State body to appoint auditors who would then pursue the matter.  If they do not, they should be used by the company.  A commercial body hires commercial auditors to do a job and if matters slip under the net they are not doing their job and should be used.</P>
      <P>As regards the involvement of this House; the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies has responsibility for overseeing these bodies.  Where State equity is involved that is the appropriate forum in which they should be addressed.  Having regard to Dáil reform and efficiency, it would not be proper for two separate committees of the House to carry out two separate examinations of the one company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to Aer Lingus Holidays, the Director of Public Prosecutions has become involved and that more than anything has stalled the particular Dáil investigation. If criminal charges are to be proffered or an investigation held involving the fraud squad, nothing that would be said by any committee of this House <Col N="744" /> should prejudice people being brought to justice.  That should be the appropriate outcome of any investigation involving substantial funds.  I will not say anything further on that because such issues are delicate.  We should not engage in a turf battle on this matter between the Committee of Public Accounts and the Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies.  The matter is under investigation by another organ of the State.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Leader programme there is provision for the audit of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry in regard to its procedures for overseeing matters.  There is double indemnity, so to speak, in such cases as there is also an involvement by the European Court of Auditors.  Following the case involving the Leader programme in County Tipperary, action has been taken by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry in regard to the overall operation of the programme.  It is also examining the operation of supervision arrangements in similar projects.  The European Court of Auditors who are never behind the door, so to speak, in drawing attention to issues which it considers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>By definition, semi-State bodies are covered by this section. The non-commercial semi-State bodies will be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I think we all accept this point.  The point at issue here is whether all bodies which receive more than 50 per cent of their funding from the State should come under the direct aegis of the Comptroller and Auditor General. Following consideration of the points made during the debate, the appropriate procedure is for the Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General to be given the power to oversee the parent Department and its <Col N="745" /> procedures governing the bodies under its control.  The commercial auditors appointed by commercial bodies have a duty and responsibility in relation to any matters which they believe are not 100 per cent correct in terms of audit, efficiency and value for money.  They have a role in this area.  The sponsoring Department, the Minister responsible, or the Government as a whole appoints the board of a commercial semi-State company. It has the task of running the company and it can employ whatever specialist advice it requires in order to do this.  That function is overseen by this House through the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies.  This is the right way to deal with the matter; we have to distinguish between the two areas.</P>
      <P>I am not saying that there will be no inspection of commercial semi-State bodies.  The inspection of semi-State commercial bodies will be by way of a report by private auditors to the board and a report from the board to the Minister, who will report to this House.  There is adequate accountability in that procedure to cover the issues raised by the Deputy.  The non-commercial semi-State bodies come under the aegis of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  My amendment deals with bodies such as the Red Cross and Rehab, private organisations which receive more than 50 per cent of their revenue from the State. These organisations should be allowed to hire commercial auditors, who will be responsible to them, to audit their accounts.  However, if a problem arises the Comptroller and Auditor General should have a right to trace the spending of that public money.  The issue in relation to non-commercial semi-State bodies is somewhat different and there are already reasonable controls in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not get an answer to my question about Tipperary Enterprises. I understand the point the Minister made about the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies.  However, the employment <Col N="746" /> of private auditors was part of the problem with Aer Lingus Holidays.  The board of Aer Lingus Holidays turned around and told the auditors, &ldquo;you never identified this problem.  How can you explain this oversight?  Therefore, we are going to sue you&rdquo;.  The private auditor system fell down so far as this company was concerned.  Therefore, that point is not a valid one.</P>
      <P>The Minister's point about the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies is good in theory but the fact is that this committee receives a consultancy budget of only £30,000.  I have spoken to members of that committee who have told me that the best they could do is examine two companies a year &mdash; there are approximately 31 companies under the aegis of that committee.  While the committee works in theory and there is no need to duplicate its work, the point I am making is that the Comptroller and Auditor General, as a professional auditor, should be able to appoint staff to audit the accounts of commercial semi-State bodies.  I do not wish to labour this point, and I will not be moving my amendment No. 9.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the Red Cross and other organisations.  May I take it that after the enactment of this legislation the Comptroller and Auditor General will be able to appoint staff to audit any of these companies as and when he sees fit?  Will bodies such as the ISPCC and other bodies which receive 50 per cent of their gross receipts from a health board be scrutinised in the same way?  It is not uncommon for organisations such as the Roscommon Kidney Association, or a wheelchair association which wishes to build a centre to apply for a once-off capital grant from the national lottery, a health board or a local authority.  If such organisations receive 50 per cent of their gross receipts&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In page 15, line 49, after &ldquo;General&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;for the purpose of ensuring economic, efficient and effective management of resources, the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General may recommend systems, procedures and practices deemed to constitute best practice in respect of any matters examined under this section&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note with approval the Minister's amendment No. 12 which, in substance, picks up the intent of this amendment. This amendment deals with the issues of value for money, effectiveness and the necessity to be able to compare systems. procedures and practices.  Of all the innovations proposed in the Bill, section 9 is perhaps the key innovation.  Last week the Minister argued that it might be invidious to expect the Comptroller and Auditor General to come up with a thesis of best practices, so to speak.  I welcome the formulation of that notion into a comparison of systems.  Unless every system is like a curate's egg &mdash; good in spots and bad in spots &mdash; presumably some systems will be better than others and a comparison will, of itself, recommend best practice.  This is extremely important.  I <Col N="749" /> rise to speak on this amendment not to take issue with the Minister's amendment but to point out the necessity to ensure that great emphasis is placed on this matter in any dealings between the Minister's Department and the Comptroller and Auditor General's office in regard to the implementation of this legislation. Members of the House look forward to getting comparitive material.  This is precisely the point made earlier by Deputy Yates in relation to his amendment on section 8.  It is in the comparison of procedure, practice and system that there is so much to learn across the public sector. The group of amendments now under discussion tries to take that aspect on board.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the Minister's amendment No. 12, I should be happy to withdraw amendment No. 11, tabled in my name and that of Deputy Cullen.  I welcome amendment No. 12.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) of amendment No. 12 picks up the substance of amendment No. 11.  Subsection (4) of amendment No. 12, which deals with section 9, states:</P>
    <P>Where the Comptroller and Auditor General proposes to make any examination under this section, he may, at his discretion, seek the views of the Committee of Dáil Éireann established under the Standing Orders of Dáil Éireann to examine and report to Dáil Éireann on the appropriation accounts.</P>
    <P>Given that the Comptroller and Auditor General is the only constitutional officer who does not report to or work directly for the Executive, as distinct from reporting to this House, that provision is useful. Perhaps I am anticipating an issue that will be reached later, but I regret that the Ministr's amendments do not give any indication of Government willingness in terms of policy to concede that there may be instances when, for example, the relevant committee of the House might invite the Comptroller and Auditor General to initiate a special project audit.  In any one year we benefit from the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General <Col N="750" /> in that we are able to consider various special reports.</P>
    <P>Given the very particular nature of the office of Comptroller and Auditor General, which as I said, expressly relates to the functions of the House and not directly to the Executive, what is the policy logic for excluding any right of initiative on the part of a relevant committee of the House?  I am disappointed that not even the slightest degree of initiative is afforded to a relevant committee. Is the Minister prepared to offer any solace in regard to that question? Even if there were a requirement that only highly specific issues could come under consideration or if the full unanimity of the committee were required &mdash; and it should be remembered that the Committee of Public Accounts normally operates on that basis &mdash; Members of the House would have open to them a reasonable amount of discretion.  The right to take initiatives would, of course, have to be circumscribed &mdash; naturally, not every single project could come under investigation in such a way. However, if a committee of the House was able to take the initiative in inviting the Comptroller and Auditor General to examine particular matters that fall within its remit it would be of benefit.  I am disappointed that the thrust of subsection (4) of amendment No. 12 is not towards such an initiative.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 12, in the name of the Minister, is welcome as it relates to amendment No. 5 in my name. However, it does not deal with some major points discussed last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Cox that section 9 is the most important section of the Bill, as it deals with the issue of the effectiveness of expenditure.  The Government has limited the level of the review of effectiveness to systems, procedures and management.  The effectiveness <Col N="751" /> of programmes does not come within the scope of that review.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) (a) of amendment No. 13 proposes that the expenditure programmes undertaken should also be reviewed.  In other words, the Comptroller and Auditor General should be able to say to what extent the TB eradication programme eradicated TB, to what extent the housing programme alleviated homelessness and the effect welfare programmes had on poverty.  At present, all that can be reviewed is the effectiveness of departmental officers in the expenditure of money.  The Government has missed the whole point, the need to be able to examine the value gained for the money spent.  It appears that those concerned with expenditure who wanted just their own jobs scrutinised, rather than examining the main thrust of the programmes, have got their own way in the White Paper but it funks the big question.</P>
    <P>I feel very strongly that the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General should be supplemented by a new office.  Someone should be able to advise the House on value for money of public expenditure <i>per se,</i> which verges on a policy area and which would, undoubtedly, be controversial. There are many examples of matters that should be examined, for instance, the value for money gained from computerisation programmes, the opportunities computerisation has opened up for staff redeployment and the potential savings in terms of staff redeployment of further computerisation expenditure.  At present the only aspects that can be examined are whether the computers worked effectively, whether they provided value for money and whether the money was spent on computerisation, as planned.  The main point at issue is ignored &mdash; why the computers were installed in the first place and how many staff members were released.  The taxpayer is interested in the big picture. Therefore, if the Government wants to avoid getting the advice of the Comptroller and Auditor General on areas in which £200 million of the £10.5 billion spent on public expenditure might be <Col N="752" /> saved, a new office could be set up along the lines of the &ldquo;Board Snip&rdquo; which operated when former Minister MacSharry had responsibility for the Department of Finance, when there was some iron resolve in that Department unlike the present ritual when people come along with bloated spending estimates. For the past few years the effect of the present system has been an increase of 6 per cent in public expenditure, with no improvement in public services.  In this regard the resolve of the Department of Finance is weak and withering.</P>
    <P>Did the Minister, in her discussions with her programme managers and advisers, put to them the arguments made in the White Paper?  It is a cop-out to say that this concerns a policy question and that the House does not want to get into the area of policy.  Informed judgments about policy cannot be made without the availability of information on the cost of programmes, not the cost of management programmes or the systems followed.  For example, one could analyse whether the expenditure of Structural Funds &mdash; funding on which the Minister is waxing eloquent at present &mdash; on infrastructural projects eliminated the worst traffic bottlenecks&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>It did in Castlebar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;was made on the basis of marginal political constituencies, or where Ministers were involved.  We should be able to analyse the strategic routes taken <i>vis-à-vis</i> airports and seaports and the way in which expenditure on them was made.  The Comptroller and Auditor General can only say that the money was spent through a particular contractor or local authority, that a certain number of kilometres was the subject of road works and that provision was made for a hard shoulder and a couple of traffic islands, for instance.  It brings into question the accuracy of the expenditure, the compliance of the expenditure; it does not deal with the fact of the road perhaps having been constructed in the wrong place, which is the most important question for the taxpayer. <Col N="753" /> People on this side of the House have to ascertain how we can improve government, how we can improve value for money, how we can improve the lot of the taxpayer, either by saving money or getting better public services and facilities. But we cannot make informed judgments because there is nobody to advise us on that.  All we are getting is an historic analysis of expenditure.</P>
      <P>Therefore, what I am seeking to do is to ensure that the Comptroller and Auditor General, or some adjunct to his office, could identify areas of duplication of effort, a number of which spring to mind.  Again I come back to the Department of Defence, where one may well pose the question: are those responsible for the managerial aspects of the Army doing what the Department of Defence is doing and, if so, what are 300 people in the Department of Defence doing? Undoubtedly there is duplication.</P>
      <P>Within the Minister's own Department, the Department of Finance, the question arises: what work is being duplicated in that Department that is being done by accounting officers in other Departments?  I contend this constitutes a major gap in public adminstration.  We must remember who is writing these White Papers.  Perhaps it is the accounting officers who are writing them, who do not want the effectiveness issue to be raised or big questions to be asked. Politicians must take responsibility because at the end of the day it is we who are accountable to the public, not the accounting officers.  We are the people who can be voted out, not the accounting officers &mdash; they remain regardless of whether they have wasted money or expended it wisely.  I do not wish to be accused of bashing the Civil Service, but the fact of the matter is that if we complacently accept that everything is all right, nothing will ever improve.  If the Minister believes that within expenditure of £10.5 million there is no waste, I do not share that view.  Beginning from that disposition, I believe we need to strengthen the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Minister of State has moved in paragraph (b) to a point that will arise <Col N="754" /> later in amendments Nos. 14 and 15, it was still a bit wishy-washy.  She used phrases such as &ldquo;may&rdquo; or &ldquo;under consideration, examination or analysis&rdquo;. That is very weak.  I do not like it.  I prefer something tangible not open to ambiguity.  We should remember that a point of law is to give certainty, not give rise to ambiguity.  After all what we are doing is making law.</P>
    <P>Those who lectured us on probity have not gone one step further and sought in Government to ensure there would be value for money.  If one is seroius about open Government what one needs is a new office of public expenditure comptroller who can advise this House independently and say that there is waste or duplication in a Department or that an expenditure programme is not achieving the objective set for it by the policy makers.  In such circumstances the effectiveness of the whole programme comes into question rather than the effectiveness of its management.  I regret that the Minister has baulked at this, has pulled back from it and has not, in consultation with her experts, seen the merits of the argument.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I can speak in favour of my amendment No. 12.  As Deputy Cox has acknowledged, the first part of amendment No. 12 deals with the <Col N="755" /> point he is making in amendment No. 11. Omitting the phrase &ldquo;best practice&rdquo;, I think he acknowledges the point we have been trying to make here: that we should examine systems in a comparative sense rather than saying which is the best.  That is fair enough.  Amendment No. 13 (4) allows the Comptroller and Auditor General, at his discretion, to seek the views of the Committee of Public Accounts in relation to project audits.  As we discussed on the last occasion, the Comptroller and Auditor General is a constitutional officer.  Therefore, it would not be appropriate for the committee to direct the Comptroller and Auditor General in any particular area. But, given the close relationship between the two, this gives explicit power to the Comptroller and Auditor General to seek the views of the committee.</P>
      <P>When the Bill has been enacted there will be a review undertaken of the terms of reference of the Committee of Public Accounts at which point we would seek to insert a section which would specify the committee may put forward their views. That would deal with that point.  I do not think there would be any problem with it in practice, but in legislation we need to respect the constitutional autonomy of the Comptroller and Auditor General. That is why the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is used in this case.  It is not an attempt to be wishy-washy but rather an attempt to meet the point but to do so in a way that respects the constitutional independence of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 13 invites the Comptroller and Auditor General to carry out economic appraisals.  In section 9 there is a distinction to be drawn between issues of economy and efficiency and that of effectiveness.  What the Bill proposes is that the Comptroller and Auditor General, in terms of value for money, can pursue economy, efficiency and systems to ensure there is effectiveness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This morning we established a series of committees of this House.  Those committees will be looking at Estimates.  That is the manner in which this House will be <Col N="756" /> examining effectiveness at the policy end of what is involved in particular expenditure programmes.  The public expenditure division of the Department of Finance is charged with the task of monitoring and controlling public expenditure in other Government Departments, including examining the effectiveness of programmes.  It is that body, plus the Government, rather than an outside body, such as &ldquo;An Bord Snip&rdquo;, that examines public expenditure programmes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates mentioned the effectiveness of housing programmes in tacking homelessness as being one of the issues involved.  One of the main effects of &ldquo;An Bord Snip&rdquo; was virtually to abolish the local authority housing programme when homelessness soared.  We have seen a massive increase in numbers of local authority housing waiting lists nationwide as a result of a policy decision to abandon a housing programme rather than something that was about trimming its effectiveness or examining whether we are getting value for money in our contracts and so on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a policy issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a policy issue. I would not deify &ldquo;An Bord Snip&rdquo; as being about achieving effectiveness rather than something that has intruded into policy areas.  Certainly I would query policy decisions they took and the fiscal rectitude achieved on the backs of our homeless.  I am glad to note that the present administration has been in a position to reverse that policy and has resumed a serious local authority housing programme which in time will overturn the damage done within that earlier period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the point Deputy Yates made about the cost effectiveness of programmes, I contend it is necessary to draw this distinction between the general value for money audit and getting into the policy area.  There are to be established now committees of this House which will have the time to delve into the kind of policy detail that is required. <Col N="757" /> There is a role for the Comptroller and Auditor General in ensuring that the staff in each Department are geared up and have assistance in place to ensure effectiveness.</P>
    <P>Where Deputy Yates's amendment No. 13 &mdash; subsection (4) (b) &mdash; refers to proposed future expenditure programmes, I should say that relates to policy and would be entirely inappropriate for the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Paragraph (c) refers to the need to identify areas of duplication of effort and expense and other areas of inefficiency.  The substantive point there is covered already in my amendment No. 12, where it is said &ldquo;make such comparisons, including comparisons of systems, procedures and practices&rdquo;. The power being given the Comptroller and Auditor General to undertake such comparative studies will identify areas of duplication of effort or other areas of inefficiency.  Therefore, that point would be covered.</P>
    <P>In relation to policy, as more of the work of the House will be done by committees it will be able to examine the Estimates in more detail and to review the effectiveness of the policy decisions which lie behind them.  This has not been possible up to now because only a cursory look was given to the Estimates.  Under the process of Dáil reform committees will specialise in particular areas.  For example, the social affairs committee will consider developments in the social welfare area and review the effectiveness of policy decisions to see if they are succeeding in eliminating poverty while Ministers and their Departments will be called to account for the effectiveness of their objectives.</P>
    <P>It is important that we do not involve the Comptroller and Auditor General, who is independent under the Constitution, in policy matters.  Under the new arrangements the powers of Deputies will not be diminished but rather increased.  However, we need to make a distinction in relation to the role of the Committee of Public Accounts.  It may well be that in the past, in the absence of an effective committee system in this House, the Committee of Public <Col N="758" /> Accounts broadened its remit to examine matters which should more properly have been examined by a policy committee.</P>

This is also the subject matter of amendments Nos. 14 and 15.  In addition, amendments Nos. 12, 14 and 15 refer to page 15, line 49.

      <P>Amendment No. 15 is similar to the amendment tabled by Deputy Yates.  I listened with great care to the point the Minister of State made in relation to the constitutional position of the Comptroller and Auditor General, that it would be most improper if this House was allowed to intrude into the domain of that office.  Nonetheless, I notice that amendment No. 12, which seeks to include a new subsection (4) in section 9 &mdash; I welcome this and the Minister of State is quite correct to make provision for this &mdash; reads:</P>
      <P>Where the Comptroller and Auditor General proposes to make any examination under this section, he may, [I agree that it should not be mandatory] at his discretion, seek the views of the Committee of Dáil Éireann established under the Standing Orders of Dáil Éireann to examine and report to Dáil Éireann on the appropriation accounts.</P>
      <P>This proposal that the Comptroller and Auditor General should have discretion is to be welcomed and in giving him discretion we are not creating an offence in relation to the constitutional position of the Comptroller and Auditor General in the sense that the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is used as opposed to the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>May I make the parallel case?  Without prejudice to the constitutional position of the office amendment No. 15 in my name reads:</P>
      <P>The Committee of Dáil Éireann established to examine and report on the appropriation accounts may direct the Comptroller and Auditor General ...</P>
      <P>I note that the word &ldquo;direct&rdquo; is infelicitous and improper in the context of the constitutional position and that we are going to replace the notion of directing the Comptroller and Auditor General with the notion of requesting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would it be possible, in parallel with <Col N="760" /> the proposal in amendment No. 12 to give the Comptroller and Auditor General discretion to consult the relevant committee, to allow that committee discretion to request the Comptroller and Auditor General to do certain things? If the Comptroller and Auditor General will have discretion to communicate with the relevant Dáil committee it would be appropriate that there be traffic in the opposite direction which would be subject to the same requirement.  This would respect the House and this constitutional office-holder who deals with this House rather than with the Executive.  Furthermore, it would create no offence in relation to the legitimate domain and sphere and activity of the Comptroller and Auditor General provided that we remove the reference, which I accept may be deemed improper, to the notion of directing the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I ask the Minister of State to consider making an addition to her amendment to provide for a flow of traffic in the opposite direction.  This would follow the receipt of a request and not as a result of a direction.  If the Minister can allow the Comptroller and Auditor General, at his discretion, to communicate with the relevant Dáil committee without creating an offence in relation to the domain and functions of that office the committee ought to have discretion in the matter without creating any offence in relation to the constitutional position which the Minister of State is trying to preserve.</P>
    <P>Having listened to what the Minister of State had to say she has a point that the language used in amendment No. 15 is improper in the sense that it includes the word &ldquo;direct&rdquo; but it would be entirely proper if it included the word &ldquo;request&rdquo;. I ask the Minister of State to consider this request given that she made the point that an attempt is being made to enhance the political process.  I agree with some of the remarks she made earlier and I do not stand for the view that we should abdicate to various officers of the State, including the Comptroller and Auditor General, functions which are properly the preserve of politicians such as those <Col N="761" /> which relate to public policy reviews, programming and priorities which suit the overall national interest.  I argue strongly that we should, in parallel with the new subsection (4), give the committee discretion. Even at this very late stage I urge the Minister and her advisers to consider that, because I believe it is appropriate and it could be done if the infelicitous phraseology of my amendment was to be changed.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cox has accepted the point that we cannot direct the Comptroller and Auditor General, but it might be considered if in legislation we phrased it as a request.  The feedback we got on this amendment was that it was too direct in terms of the Comptroller and Auditor General's constitutional independence.  I think the point is best teased out in the terms of reference of the Committee of Public Accounts when the Bill is being enacted.  I said already that the power of initiation should be given to the Committee of Public Accounts.  Provided the constitutional niceties of the office of Comptroller and Auditor General are respected and the Comptroller and Auditor General does not feel he is being pushed about, in practice there will be no problem in terms of joint co-operation.  That is the way to address the substantive point being made rather than the way the Deputy suggested.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the points going ping pong across the floor and I do not agree with the point on which consensus has been arrived at.</P>
      <P>Everything is fine while the present holder of the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General is still there, but we have to provide in law for the future where there may be somebody who regards politicans as a crowd of wasters, who may not have any respect for Members of the House or members of the Committee of Public Accounts.  We have to provide in law for certainty in any situation that might arise.  I think the words the Minister has put forward are too grovelling in nature.  Subsection (4) of the Minister's amendment states:</P>
      <P>Where the Comptroller and Auditor General proposes to make any examination under this section, he, may, at his discretion, seek the views of the Committee ...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister uses the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;, not &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, and she also adds the words &ldquo;at his discretion&rdquo; in case the committee is stroppy in trying to do its work effectively. I think the words &ldquo;at his discretion&rdquo; are superfluous and I ask the Minister to consider withdrawing them. In the Constitution the Dáil has primacy, because the people have spoken and elected a Dáil.  From an examination of the White Paper which deals with the revised terms of reference of the Committee of Public Accounts, it is quite clear that the Dáil takes precedence over everything.  While the Comptroller and Auditor General is a constitutional officer, I do not accept that he is above the Dáil or that he is not answerable to the Dáil.  The whole point of his office is that he is uniquely accountable to the <Col N="763" /> Dáil and, in this case, to the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    <P>As the amendments have been recommitted and we can discuss them again, will the Minister confirm that the proposed terms of reference set out in pages 41 and 42 of the White Paper will still apply or whether in the light of this debate it is intended to expand on them. On the last occasion a number of points were raised in discussion but there is no point where we can discuss the terms of reference of the Committee of Public Accounts except here.  Will the Minister comment on whether the terms of reference need to be expanded?</P>
    <P>I have great respect for the collective wisdom of the Committee of Public Accounts.  As has already been explained, it is non-political.  In my amendment No. 14 I sought to insert the words &ldquo;may direct the Comptroller and Auditor General&rdquo;; but the word &ldquo;direct&rdquo; and &ldquo;shall&rdquo; have been taken out and therefore the words in the Minister's amendment &ldquo;at his discretion&rdquo; are totally unnecessary.  The Comptroller and Auditor General could point to what exactly was said in the Dáil and say that it was entirely up to him, or the person at the time, whether he listens to us or not. While there is a harmonious working relationship between the Committee of Public Accounts and not only the Comptroller and Auditor General but also the Secretary of the Department of Finance, the fact is that this may not always be the case and I believe paramount discretion should be given to the committee in this instance.</P>
    <P>This is particularly appropriate in relation to project audit reports.  Either way the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General will do a root and branch analysis of the spending of every spending Department.  Therefore, the area of special study is not in dotting the &ldquo;is&rdquo; and crossing the &ldquo;ts&rdquo; but in the project audit area.  I believe the committee will have a level of expertise that reflects the ordinary punter in the street in areas that might warrant attention.  It may also be the case that the committee <Col N="764" /> could say that it does not think two project audits are enough for £10.5 billion expenditure.  It may believe that it is necessary to carry out six or seven project audits at a minimum.  There are matters of detail here which are very pertinent to the real effectiveness of the committee and which go beyond the relationship of the present members of the Committee of Public Accounts and the present holder of the Office of Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>Apparently the Minister cannot accept my amendment No. 14 because of her absolute determination to revere the Office of Comptroller and Auditor General and because she does not feel the House has a role to direct or instruct the Comptroller and Auditor General within certain parameters.  That attitude presupposes that the committee is reckless or irresponsible and that it would ask him to do things which he would not want to do.  I do not think that is so.  I ask the Minister specifically to remove the words &ldquo;at his discretion&rdquo; from amendment No. 12.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">

      <P>I apologise to the House for having to leave to attend a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts.  I am not sure that on this occasion I agree with my Opposition colleagues Deputies Yates and Cox.  One of the very valuable things about the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General is its constitutional status.  From my experience, notwithstanding the good intentions behind the amendments, I can see a situation where, in the nature of adversial politics in this House, members of the committee would want to send off the Comptroller and Auditor General to carry out audits of issues that might be controversial at the particular time.  I do not think this would necessily add anything to the valuable role he plays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand it &mdash; I have not heard the Ministers's contribution &mdash; we may at any event discuss a particular project with the Comptroller and Auditor General if we are so disposed.  There is nothing preventing us from doing this.  The relationship is very good, it is long established <Col N="765" /> over the years with the changing personnel of the Committee of Public Accounts.  There is no inhibition there. If the chairman of the committee on its behalf were to recommend to the Comptroller and Auditor General that the committee felt very strongly about a particular matter and that it ought to be the subject of an audit report, I believe that within the resources the Comptroller and Auditor General would be likely to take that on board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Yates spoke about the removal of the phrase &ldquo;at his discretion&rdquo;.  I have no hang-up about that; it may even strengthen the Minister's amendment.  The consultation process envisaged in the amendment may also be to the advantage of the committee. For example, the committee may wish to seek the views of the Comptroller and Auditor General or to request him&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore we are <i>ad <Col N="766" /> idem</i> on this matter.  If the various parties constituting the Committee of Public Accounts are in agreement on some matter and the chairman, acting on behalf of the committee, wishes to request the Comptroller and Auditor General to do whatever is contemplated it seems reasonable that he should respond to such a request.  The caveat, &ldquo;at his discretion&rdquo;, adds nothing to the term.  If that is all that is at issue the Minister ought to accede to the request. The relationship between the Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General is a very important one and, as Deputy Yates said, I do not think it is likely to be abused.  I was talking in the context of the committee having power to give the Comptroller and Auditor General a direction and in view of that being excluded what is sought here is reasonable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Rabbitte missed some of the discussion.  It is envisaged that the terms of reference of the Committee of Public Accounts, as proposed in the White Paper, be extended as soon as the legislation is passed to include a form of words to allow the committee to initiate suggestions in terms of project audits.  The reason the words &ldquo;at his discretion&rdquo; are included is to underline the constitutional autonomy of the Comptroller and Auditor General. There are legal tomes on the use of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  If it is used in this case without the words &ldquo;at his discretion&rdquo; it could be construed as meaning that he &ldquo;shall&rdquo; do something.  That could be perceived as being a directive to the Comptroller and Auditor General which would not be constitutionally appropriate. That is why the words &ldquo;may at his discretion&rdquo; are included as a phrase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter relates to constitutional autonomy which is something that is jealously guarded, and rightly so, by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  For example, he can only be removed from office for stated misbehaviour.  We need to be careful in this regard.  There are no practical problems posed by my suggestion to include subsection (4) of amendment <Col N="767" /> 12 which gives the Comptroller and Auditor General the right at his discretion to consult with the committee on the areas in which project audits will take place.</P>
    <P>We propose, through the terms of reference of the Committee of Public Accounts, a parallel function for that committee in terms of suggesting areas in which project audits might take place, in a way that respects the constitutional independence of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I do not anticipate under this or any future Comptroller and Auditor General practical problems arising provided the niceties are observed and we avoid, to use Deputy Cox's phrase, infelicitous language.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Chair has given some latitude in this matter and I do not wish to abuse that position but I would like to refer to Article 33 of Bunreacht na hÉireann.  Of course the constitutional position of the Comptroller and Auditor General must be respected.  Article 33.6 of the Constitution states: &ldquo;Subject to the foregoing&rdquo;&mdash; in other words all the constitutional niceties that have to be observed &mdash;&ldquo;the terms and conditions of the Office of Comptroller and Auditor General shall be determined by law&rdquo;. We are making law, not rules about the procedures of the Commitee of Public Accounts.  I accept the Minister's bona fides that the Committee of Public Accounts should have the ability to request, at the discretion of the Comptroller and Auditor General, that certain matters be considered.  Now that we are making law consistent with the Minister's stated policy in respect of the terms of reference of the committee and with Article 33.6 of the Constitution, why not state the policy in law and the detail can follow in terms of procedure and practice?</P>

      <P>It can be seen from today's Report Stage debate that I have used considerable discretion.  I acknowledged many of the points made in the very constructive debate we had on Committee Stage.  I have gone a long way in meeting the points raised.  On this matter there was specific consultation with the Comptroller and Auditor General and, arising from that consultation, I am putting forward this proposal.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is doing an excellent job and if he feels that certain forms of words or certain ways of achieving the desired result would impinge on his constitutional independence we should respect his view.  My proposal will achieve the desired result and I see no problem with it.  It is important, in terms of the language used, that we respect the constitutional independence of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
      <P>We are taking a two-fold approach in this matter.  First, the Comptroller and Auditor General will be empowered at his discretion to invite the views of the Committee of Public Accounts on what areas project audits should be carried out.  Second through the terms of reference the Committee of Public Accounts will be empowered to put forward suggestions in relation to project audits rather than make requests which may sometimes be considered as directives. If the work is carried out in that way I envisage no great problem in carrying out project audits.  We are talking semantics here.  It is important that in achieving our objectives we respect the constitutional independence of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">

      <P>I will not be pressing this matter.  I acknowledged earlier that the Minister has come a long way in regard <Col N="769" /> to a number of points brought to her attention by the Opposition.  The Minister has had the opportunity to consult the Comptroller and Auditor General and neither he nor the Minister should presume that this House wishes to impinge in any improper way on the function of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Perhaps, if the Comptroller and Auditor General was here listening to the views of the House he might be happy to agree to our suggestions.  Of course, this House must take account of constitutional officers and their rights but we too have rights and that is what we are trying to tease out.  I welcome the Minister's unqualified reassurance that the Committee of Public Accounts will be empowered to determine questions about special audits and, through its procedures, to bring those to the attention of the Comptroller and Auditor General. If the Minister pursues that policy I will let the matter lie because we will have arrived at the desired conclusion, which was not signalled by amendment No. 12 (4).</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(4) Whenever the Committee of Dáil Éireann established under the Standing Orders of Dáil Éireann to examine and report to Dáil Éireann on the appropriation accounts makes a report to Dáil Éireann following its consideration of a report <Col N="771" /> of the Comptroller and Auditor General, the report of such Committee shall be considered by Dáil Éireann as soon as possible after it is laid before it.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is a matter of some practical concern as it is not possible within the terms of reference of the committee to solve this. It is a matter for the House and relates to the whipping system and so on.</P>
    <P>We have often had excellent reports from the Public Accounts Committee which never got beyond its hallowed chambers and which were not discussed in the House.  The delay in dealing with this legislation is evidence of that. Deputy Gay Mitchell and other members of the committee have been seeking this legislation for some time.  It is important that the House should give the Public Accounts Committee the respect it deserves by including a section in the Bill to specifically provide for a proper debate on its reports.  Given the nature of debates in this House, for instance on the Estimates, we know that there will be a panic to get through 20 or 30 Estimates amounting to hundreds of millions of pounds in the three days before the summer recess; I might get 20 minutes in which to contribute and Deputy Rabbitte might get four.  Hundreds of millions of pounds go through without proper analysis. The checks and balances in the system are non-existent.  It suits the Executive to have it this way, to remove itself from proper scrutiny.</P>
    <P>The jury is out on all these committees. I chaired the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Small Businesses.  I know that the success of any committee is entirely dependent on the chairperson and on the back-up resources available.  The primary responsibility of Deputies is to be reelected, let us make no mistake about it, which is not unreasonable.  However, as there may be difficulty in obtaining a quorum for all these committees we should not assume that the proposed committee system will be a panacea for all our ills.  The debates on the floor of the House will still constitute an important <Col N="772" /> aspect of our work and the plenary sessions of the Dáil will still be those most likely to attract public interest and debate.  If we are to take the Public Accounts Committee seriously the Minister should agree to amendment No. 16 which would allow for debate on the reports as soon as possible.  Reports may never be debated unless such provision is made.  I do not accept that any change in the terms of reference of the committee would cover my proposal for debates on the floor of the House.  If we are to take the question of public expenditure control and scrutiny seriously we should accept this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to support the thrust of Deputy Yates's amendment because it raises the important point that much of the work done by the Public Accounts Committee remains in the confines of the committee and this House is rarely given an opportunity to debate it. The Deputy's caveat as to the efficacy of the committee system is timely.  It remains to be seen how the new array of committees will work in practice.</P>
      <P>It is a pity that Dáil reform is equated in the public mind with setting up new committees.  Our situation is not comparable with the House of Commons where they have 650 members, even when one takes out Ministers and Front Bench spokespersons there are still over 500 members, many with expertise, who are available and anxious to contribute in their area of expertise.  When one extracts 30 Ministers and at least 15 Front Bench spokespersons from the Members of this House it remains to be seen whether the very onerous committee structure imposed on our existing system can work.  I am sure that, for instance, Deputy Mitchell would like to have been here for the debate this morning, but he was chairing a meeting of the Committee on Public Accounts.  We will come up against that kind of problem regularly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I approve of the spirit of the amendment. In the last year of the previous parliament we had a very detailed hearing of evidence and a report on what <Col N="773" /> became known as the Carysfort Affair.

      <P>I recall that in the European Communities Act, 1972, there was a provision for elegant reports to be drawn up every six months.  A shelf in my office is groaning under the weight of these six monthly reports which, unfortunately, notwithstanding the provision, were not discussed in the House.  In welcoming this amendment I urge the Government and all sides of the House to take these things seriously and schedule them at an appropriate stage.  We should not, as we do with European business, catch up once every decade with 20 odd reports that have been lying fallow in the meantime.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy Yates on his amendment and I thank the Minister for accepting it.  This is a significant step in the right direction.  If Dáil reform means anything it should enable the House to perform its major role of holding the Administration and the Executive to account in the interests of the public.  We can only do so if reports like those from the Public Accounts Committee are debated speedily.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In page 17, between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(4) The Comptroller and Auditor General may, from time to time, <Col N="774" /> undertake comparative studies of the control and audit mechanisms which exist in other member states of the European Communities and shall report to Dáil Éireann thereon.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the House unduly on this amendment.  Auditing of Government accounts, public expenditure, scrutiny and control is an international matter.  The Minister made play of the fact that in practice the Comptroller and Auditor General consults with his counterpart in New Zealand.  This is a learning time for all Comptroller and Auditor Generals.  With the advent of new technology and with people dealing with trillion pound budgets people will develop an expertise.  It should be part of his brief to study the European Court of Auditors and the magistrate type system. There may be lessons to be learned there as to how we might be open to change in the future because everything is constantly changing.</P>
    <P>An aspect of the work of the Comptroller and Auditor General should be to keep up to date with international developments, liaise with the European Court of Auditors and other national audit offices.  The appendix to the White Paper indicates that it was found important to carry out a study of the US, New Zealand, the UK, Canada and other countries.  It is a vital part of democracy that we keep up to date.  The merits of the amendment speak for themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt with this point extensively on Committee Stage and with the international contacts which the Comptroller and Auditor General's office have through membership of Into-sai, the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions, and Euro-sai, the European Supreme Audit Institution and through secondments, placements and constant contact with the European Commission office.  This work takes place not only at European level but at a wider international level.  In that sense the amendment is redundant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 13 the Comptroller and Auditor General is empowered to <Col N="775" /> include any international developments in the report to this House.  There is good international contact in that they try to bring good international practice into the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and they exchange information. The Comptroller and Auditor General does not need powers to do this as he does it and, perhaps, in that light the Deputy would withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I take the point the Minister of State made in relation to the example.  It should be provided for in the Bill but it is not of desperate importance. In view of the time constraint I will not labour the point and will withdraw the amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P>In page 21, line 40, after &ldquo;General&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;but shall thereafter hold office and be employed by the Comptroller and Auditor General on terms relating to pay and conditions of employment not less favourable than those terms which applied to them prior to such transfer&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>All Deputies have received representations of concern from IMPACT that there would be a diminution of their position.  They are concerned that they may be forced to go from, say, the headquarters of the North-Eastern Health Board in Kells to Cork or Dublin because functions relating to health boards and vocational education committees carried out by the local government audit service are being transferred to the Comptroller and Auditor General under this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment seeks to provide a legal protection which is standard in other legislation.  The pay and conditions of people no longer in the local government service under the Department of the Environment should not be less favourable.  They are concerned not only <Col N="776" /> in relation to compulsory redundancy but that they would be accommodated, where possible, in local offices.  I am pressing this amendment because it is a matter of some concern.  This is not unreasonable given that the office will be expanded.  The Minister can give assurances and she has indicated that she had had consultations, but, of course, consultations are only consultations, they do not mean tangible commitments.  Therefore, it is important that we keep the Government on the straight and narrow in this regard and I ask the Minister of State to accept the amendment in the interests of those who have lobbied.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reluctant to accept this amendment.

I can give assurances that there will be no&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;changes in relation to pay or anything of the kind. In the past assurances were given in legislation when people moved from the Civil Service to semi-State bodies.  Staff feared that they would have a different relationship with the Government than previously. That is not envisaged here and in that sense laying down something specfic in legislation would be redundant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that any transfers will be negotiated with the staff and their trade union, IMPACT, for whose negotiating skills I have great respect. The transfers will be carried out in a human and reasonable way as have all transfers which have been negotiated, for example, in the decentralisation programme. I am reluctant to take on board the phrase &ldquo;conditions of employment&rdquo; because there could be litigation if, for example, somebody was in a less prettily decorated room in their new office and took that as a condition of employment. If they were moving to a less attractive <Col N="777" /> town than Wexford there might be litigation.</P>

I do not think it appropriate that a provision such as this should be put into legislation in the form the Deputy suggests. I have given assurances to the House that there will be proper negotiations with the staff.  I have amended section 17 to allow for flexibility in relation to deployment.  We envisage there will be regional operations of the Comptroller and Auditor General's office.  These matters are best left to trade union and staff negotiations rather than being dealt with by way of legislation.  It is not envisaged that there will be any diminution in the rates of pay or other conditions of employment.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little puzzled by the Minister's refusal to accept this amendment because, as she said, there are precedents.  I recall inserting a similar provision in the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, to give assurances to employees of the former Department of Posts and Telegraphs who were being transferred to An Post and Telecom Éireann.  This greatly facilitated and eased the transition.  If the Minister is as good as her word why not put such a provision in legislation?  There is a problem about the Labour Party giving assurances in this House because we all remember Deputy Spring's speech on 5 November and how he went back on every word of it.  I regret to say that this will have an impact on the credibility of Labour Party Ministers in this House in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Hyland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 5, 10, 55, 58, 59, 97, 99, 110, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 127, 128, 129 and 130 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I expect that the scheme for early retirement from farming under EC Regulation <Col N="782" /> No. 2079/92 will be in operation here, following clearance by the EC Commission, by the end of the summer.</P>
    <P>Details of the scheme which I will be introducing are at present being drawn up by my Department but I intend that it will provide attractive financial inducements to encourage farmers to consider early retirement.</P>
    <P>The EC Regulations governing the scheme requires a significant increase in the size of agricultural holding of the transferee to improve its economic viability before Community funding will be given.  The precise percentage figure which will be regarded as a significant increase has yet to be agreed with the Community.  A division of family holdings, however, at a time close to the date of transfer in order to meet the enlargement requirement at the time of transfer would not be acceptable to the Commission as meeting the restructuring objectives of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The normal situation under EC schemes is that eligibility is confined to actions taken from the date the measure is put in place in a member state.  I am, however, examining this and other aspects such as age requirements for transferees and the situation in relation to joint ownership in considering the detailed rules for the early retirement scheme as a whole.</P>
    <P>An amount of £1 million has been allocated to the scheme in this year's Estimates but as the scheme becomes fully operational, significantly larger allocations will have to be made in future years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State not aware that the apparent target date for this scheme continues to slip back? Initially, we were told it would be in operation in the spring of this year; then we were told it would be early summer and now the Minister tells us it will be the end of the summer.  Will he agree that it would be more realistic to say we will be lucky if the scheme is in operation this year?  Will the Minister also agree that if the provisions for a significant increase in farming area are implemented as they <Col N="783" /> are contemplated at present and if the Commission continues to take the same view in regard to restructuring, the scheme will be a dead letter here?  Very few people will benefit from it and there will not be any restructuring.</P>

      <P>I reject the Deputy's suggestion that there has been any delay in bringing this scheme to fruition.  With the exception of France, no other member state of the European Community has finalised the details of the farm retirement scheme.  Neither do I accept the Deputy's view that the scheme will not be of immense benefit to the farming community generally in terms of land restructuring.  We intend to make the scheme as financially attractive as possible from the point of view of encouraging the maximum number of farmers to retire and benefit from it.  At the other end of the scale, it is our intention that the requirements of the scheme will mean that young farmers in receipt of land will not be prevented from qualifying to the maximum extent for the benefits which can be derived under the scheme.  This is a worthwhile scheme and should be supported by Members from all sides of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention of the scheme has the support of Members on all sides of the House, but we are concerned that its details might make it a non-starter here.  Is the Minister prepared to bet that by the time our scheme is in operation there will not be schemes in operation in most other member states?  I am not impressed to hear that only France has put this scheme into operation.  I would be prepared to bet that other member states will get this scheme up and running before we do. Has the Minister any leeway in the specification of this significant addition question? Is it true that the general guideline used is that 20 per cent of the final total of land on the part of the beneficiary should have been owned, leased or beneficially controlled by the beneficiary for a period of at least two years before the <Col N="784" /> transfer takes place from the retiring farmer?  In that connection, will the Minister agree it will seriously limit the number of people who will benefit from this scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated already to the Deputy that we will be taking steps to ensure that bureaucracy will not stand in the way of the maximum level of particiaption by the farmer wishing to retire and the young farmer inheriting the land. Specific guidelines are laid down by the Commission in relation to the scheme and, as late as last week, the Minister had discussions with EC officials in regard to the amount of land that the transferee should have in order to qualify for the scheme.  Deputy Dukes correctly identified this problem.  There will be further discussions in this regard and I hope we can modify that as far as possible in favour of young farmers receiving the land.  We will also be anxious to ensure that the maximum degree of flexibility applies in relation to the timescale in which the young farmer should have the additional land which is required under the scheme.  We should not lose sight of the fact that basically the scheme is a restructuring one.  Therefore, the EC require that the additional land must be acquired by the young farmer inheriting the land from his parents or a relative.  I assure the Deputy and the House that the Minister and I will endeavour to do everything possible to ensure that this scheme is as attractive as possible in terms of eligibility and qualification for the person leasing the land and the person transferring it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister intend that the proportion requirement will be less than 20 per cent and that the time requirement will be less than two years? Will he not agree that it would be an outrageous intrusion into the normal running of family affairs if the Commission said that this scheme could not apply in cases where there had been a family division some time previously?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not give any specific <Col N="785" /> commitment in regard to the period of time or the amount of land.  However, we will endeavour to negotiate the most attractive benefits possible both in terms of the time period and the amount of land the young farmer must have to benefit under the scheme.</P>
      <P>The Deputy can take it from me that we are dealing with this matter in a very sincere way.  I hope that we will be able to come up with a very attractive retirement scheme at the end of the day.  I know that farmers are looking forward to such a scheme.</P>

      <P>The question of allocating funds to the Irish Equine Centre is a matter in the first instance for the Racing Board, which has responsibility for the development of the thoroughbred industry.  These responsibilities will be taken over by the proposed new racing authority on its establishment.</P>
      <P>Grants of £3 million for each of the years 1990 and 1991 and £3.3 million for the year 1992 were given to the Racing Board for the development of the industry. I understand that payments of £100,000 have been made by the board to the Irish Equine Centre for each of the years 1990-92, inclusive.  A sum of £3.3 million is being made available to the Racing Board in 1993.</P>

It would be very useful to have that facility continue in operation, particularly if, as we hope, we resolve the problem eventually.  It would be better to have this work carried out on a private contract basis rather than continually setting up a State organisation to do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 68 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of concerns being expressed regarding cattle imports.  A recently adopted EC decision prohibits the export of animals and their products from 16 provinces in Italy.  I am confident that the Italian veterinary authorities, and indeed such authorities in all member states, will fulfil their legal obligations under EC legislation governing intra-Community trade.</P>
      <P>Traded animals must meet the veterinary health standards of EC legislation and must be accompanied by official documentation in support of their status. The exporting member state is obliged to ensure that animals leaving its territory meet the required standards and do not pose a risk to other countries.  No member state is entitled to prohibit the importation of properly certified animals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Italian authorities are dealing satisfactorily with the foot-and-mouth disease outbreaks in <Col N="788" /> their country.  They are applying specified Community requirements to control foot-and-mouth disease.  EC Commission missions have been sent to Italy to ensure compliance with these measures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if he is satisfied with the reliability of the information being supplied in relation to the movement of animals both in and out of Italy?  I know that we in this House should not be disparaging of other adminsitrations, but there is serious room for doubt as to the reliability of that information. In this connection would the Minister not agree that it is worrying to see that a number of the export controls which had been applied in Italy are now being removed?  For example, the export of Parmesan cheese and a number of other products is being permitted again. Would the Minister not agree that where the reliability of the basic data on animal movements is suspect, other measures which follow from that later down the chain must also be a cause of great concern?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Three missions have visited Italy to assess the situation.  The report of the first mission indicates some shortcomings in the manner in which the epidemic was handled initially by the Italian authorities.  These criticisms included delays in confirmation of the disease, slaughtering infected animals and setting up protection zones, a lack of movement restrictions and an apparent absence of overall co-ordinating activities.  The Italian authorities said it was hampered by a mountainous terrain, bad weather and a high water table.  The last two reports indicate that the EC requirements are being properly applied.  Another mission, on which the Department will be represented, will visit Italy in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By and large, the Department is happy that the Italian authorities are honouring their commitments in regard to this terrible problem.  Obviously, our people are and will be keeping a very close eye on the problem.  The export of live animals susceptible to FMD, fresh meat, meat <Col N="789" /> products, milk, milk products, hides, semen and embryos from the 16 provinces in Italy where prohibition is in place is being monitored.  This prohibition does not apply to the entire country; it applies to the provinces where the disease has broken out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember very well the last occasion on which there was an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the UK &mdash; it was in 1968.  The Minister may not remember this outbreak, but I remember it because I was selling insurance for livestock at that stage.  May I ask the Minister &mdash; this may be a purely hypothetical question, but it is at the root of our concerns &mdash; would he be as happy as he appears to be today if, faced with the measures now in force in Italy and the degree of reliability of that enforcement, there was an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the UK, or would he be as worried as I am?</P>

They are monitoring the implementation of these regulations. That is the position as of now.  The Department and all Members on this side of the House realise the terrible problems an outbreak of foot and mouth disease would cause in this country.  In that context we are happy that the Italian authorities are doing what they should do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern about the need for adequate notice of any measure that would impact significantly on market support arrangements. That is one of the reasons that I have opposed the weight limit measure so vigorously since it was put forward without prior consultation last December. The Commission had first intended to apply a limit of 325kg from 1 January <Col N="791" /> 1993 but, following my intervention, it finally opted for a gradual approach and postponed implementation of the first phase involving a limit of 380kgs, to next July.  Moreover, the Commission agreed to prepare a report on the beef market, including the operation of the 380kg limit, before the end of the year.  In the meantime, I will be intensifying my efforts in the Council of Ministers to secure a more acceptable means of achieving balance in the beef sector.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Common Agricultural Policy reform agreement provided for significant changes to the beef intervention arrangements, with compensation by way of enhanced livestock premium payments. These changes include a gradual reduction in intervention intake from a ceiling of 750,000 tonnes in 1993 to 350,000 tonnes in 1997.  I have taken the view that these objectives can be achieved in a orderly fashion without the imposition of a weight limit.  However, the EC Commission, with the support of most member states, has decided to follow the weight limitation approach.</P>
      <P>A consequence of the introduction of the weight limit will be that heavier carcases which would otherwise have gone to intervention, and which are also our better quality carcases, will now be available for the commercial markets in Europe, where there is demand for the lean meat of the continental type breeds. The need to expand established outlets and to secure new markets will certainly post a huge challenge for the Irish beef industry as intervention intake declines. CBF will play an important role in supporting this marketing effort.  The EC will also provide funding for measures to promote and market quality beef and veal.</P>
      <P>Because of the number of variables involved, it would be extremely difficult to quantify the impact on the Irish beef sector of a weight of restriction on carcases eligible for intervention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 21, 29, 53, 61, 64 and 108 together.</P>
      <P>Most of the points raised were dealt with in my contribution to the Adjournment debate on Leader on 11 February and in replies to questions on 25 February and 31 March.  Included in those contributions was confirmation that all of the applications along with the report and recommendations of the consultants were forwarded to the EC Commission.</P>
      <P>As to the public funding involved in the Tipperary Enterprise case, two instalments totalling £741,000 were advanced to the company, £306,000 was refunded at my request, and some £243,000 has now been claimed under the insurance bond.  The balance of £192,000 is deemed to have been eligible Leader expenditure. Arising out of the Tipperary Enterprise case, the imposition of further conditions for the renewal of the insurance bonds by the Insurance Corporation of Ireland and of additional financial control procedures have now been agreed between ICI, the groups and my Department.  The new arrangements principally involve an additional annual audit of the operations of each group and one unannounced annual audit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the groups are operating, for the most part, in full accord with the guidelines drawn up by my Department and that adequate control procedures are in place.  My Department is in regular contact with the groups regarding <Col N="796" /> interpretation of the guidelines in particular cases.</P>
    <P>The future of the Leader programme remains to be decided at Community level in the context of the new Structural Fund arrangements.  I have, of course, been pressing for its extension.  Until that decision is taken it is not, of course, possible to indicate the areas to be covered in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer specifically to my Question No. 6.  In reply to an earlier parliamentary question, the Minister stated that there were 16 successful applications out of a total of 36 submitted. Were the 16 successful applicants those prioritised Nos. 1 to 16 in the recommendations of the independent consultants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>In all, 34 applications were received in the Department.  Following acceptance by the Department, a consultant was appointed to process and examine each application.  The consultant eventually reported to the Department.  The company's report, along with the Department's application for a national Leader programme, was submitted in its entirety to the European Commission for decision.  Of the 34 applications made, 16 were approved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>In my reply today, and in an earlier reply in the Dáil, I said the consultants' report dealt with 32 applications, analysing each one in terms of eligibility.  The entire report was submitted to Brussels, along with the Department's submission.  The details of the consultants' report are not available because there is much confidential information in relation to individual applicants <Col N="797" /> and individual projects.  I realise what it is that the Deputy is trying to elicit from me.  If it is any help to the Deputy, I wish to inform him that I made inquiries in relation to Tipperary Enterprise, the subject matter of some of these questions, and was assured that the application of Tipperary Enterprise was very highly recommended by the consultants and that a decision was made on that basis.</P>

      <P>Did I understand the Minister to say that he has recently made a further change in audit requirements in that he is now requiring an additional annual audit and one unannounced audit, whereas up to a couple of days ago he required an audit for almost every project? Would the Minister agree that his Department's response to the difficulties that arose in Tipperary was over the top and excessively restrictive?  Would the Minister further agree that to require an additional annual audit and one unannounced audit as well as the normal annual audit that is required and the reporting procedures to be followed with regard to each project, will stifle the whole programme?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that we found it necessary in the Department to introduce, if you like, a higher level of control and monitoring of Leader programmes. It was my policy and intention that Leader would operate in a very flexibile manner, with local communities taking decisions, interfered with to the least possible degree by bureaucracy and the Department.  That procedure worked <Col N="799" /> very well until we encountered the Tipperary problem.  As a result it was inevitable that our insurers would demand that we exercise stronger, more positive controls. It was in response to our insurers' request, that we took the action, in consultation with the Leader network.  We had constant, regular meetings with the overall Leader network and reached agreement with it. A meeting is taking place at present in my Department in relation to how these new controls will be operated. I might add there is general acceptance within the overall Leader network nationwide that the controls we have now introduced are the minimum we could get away with in terms of public accountability and of the massive amount of EC funding invested in the programme.</P>

Furthermore, will the Minister not agree that his Department, or his services, were at fault in giving all these groups the impression that they had to be bonded by ICI, which panicked as a result of the Tipperary event, whereas, in fact, there is no such requirement, and if the groups can obtain bonding elsewhere, as at least one of them has done, that is also acceptable?

      <P>The Minister will be aware that the intent of my question is to ensure that whatever lessons are to be learned from the Tipperary experience should be learned, should not become an obstacle to the progression of the excellent projects within the other Leader programmes and, as he said, should not detract in any way from moving on to Leader II.  Indeed I assure the Minister that my party fully supports the stand he has taken and compliments him on the manner in which he has handled this matter to date.  I am pleased with his response.  When the Leader application programmes were submitted to the previous Government of which I was a member it decided, very wisely on the advice of the Taoiseach of the day, not to draw up an order of priority between the various applications but to submit them all to Brussels who made a choice between the 32 applications.</P>

Of course, he was correct in stating that the decision taken at that time was to submit the entire consultants' report, with the Government's submission, to Brussels.

      <P>In view of the fact that the Leader programme is being operated relatively successfully in south west Kerry, will the Minister consider extending it, in the next revision, to the whole of County Kerry since we have lost more than 6,000 dairy farmers since 1973 and our rural population has declined by more than 3,000, according to the last census?  Will the Minister of State consider including County Kerry in the Leader programme given that all County Clare, for example, is included?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is confirming that the Leader Programme has been a success right across the country.  The Minister, Deputy Walsh, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea and I are considering the possibility of extending the programme.  This would be known as the Leader II programme.  At that stage it would be open to people throughout the country to submit new business plans which would be considered within the Department, processed and eventually forwarded to Brussels as part of our national application.  If the Deputy wishes to see the Leader programme which is in operation in parts of his constituency extended to the remaining parts of the county I suggest that he consider, as a matter of urgency, preparing a new business plan.</P>

      <P>I agree that this is an important development and we are anxious to ensure that the programme is effective in relation to rural development. When the Leader programme was introduced initially it was not made clear to those who put forward a proposal or programme the specific information being sought.  In relation to the Leader II programme, and I appreciate, as the Minister of State said, that it is not possible to go into the matter in detail, what assessment will be carried out on existing schemes and what criteria will be used? Furthermore, will these be made public? The point needs to be made that while <Col N="805" /> the Department has been criticised there is a need for transparency in relation to the local organisations involved in this experimental project.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a good question. As I indicated earlier, the Leader programme is being implemented on a pilot basis.  In each of the 16 areas where the programme is operated problems have arisen and difficulties are being experienced by individual companies.  These are being closely monitored by the Department and will be taken into consideration in the new submission which we hope to be in a position to make to Brussels when, perhaps, we will seek modifications in certain areas.  For example, in some instances companies have difficulty in meeting the 50-50 funding requirement.  I would like to see a greater degree of flexibility in relation to this requirement.  Transparency is relevant and important in dealing with public funds and it will be included in the current programme, in particular in relation to Tipperary Enterprises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>At present there are two avenues of appeal open to farmers who are not satisfied with decisions on applications for premium and headage grants. The first avenue is at local level.  A farmer in any given county can appeal his/her case of the local office of my Department in writing or in person and it will be dealt with fairly and sympathetically.  The second avenue is at headquarters level of the headage division of my Department in Castlebar.  Any farmer who is dissatisfied with the response of his/her local office to an appeal can ask that it be referred to headage division in Castlebar where all elements will again be carefully examined.</P>
      <P>These avenues of appeal provide a satisfactory appeals system within my Department.  It is not possible to envisage a separate appeals system operating outside my Department.</P>
      <P>My Department is the competent national authority for implementing the premium and headage schemes and must take all decisions relating to payment or refusal of payment under those schemes &mdash; it cannot delegate this function to a separate appeals body.  It can, however, take into account &mdash; and does take into account &mdash; all elements of cases made on behalf of applicants by the applicants themselves, by public representatives, by the farm organisations or by the applicants' solicitors, accountants or agricultural consultants.  It can and does also take into account the views of the Ombudsman in relation to any cases referred to him.  As a result, I am happy that the system is perfectly adequate to meet their needs and that a separate new appeals system is not possible under EC Rules or necessary in Irish circumstances.</P>

In his earlier reply the Minister stated that these farmers could appeal to a local office and that this was adequate and satisfactory.  I am pleased the Minister now accepts that there is a need for a separate appeals system.  Will the Minister agree that if a farmer's application is turned down it is because of a decision made in the local office?

      <P>As I stated in reply to correspondence from the Deputy &mdash; and a number of other Deputies &mdash; I am monitoring this scheme very closely because very substantial sums of money are paid to farmers in compensation for the constraints under the new reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy.  I am very anxious that farmers get paid in full and on time.  Some difficulties have arisen because of carelessness, in particular at farm level, as farmers do not always read the number from the tag but from the card, where errors may have been made. I have instructed Departmental officials throughout the country to deal sympathetically and to grant payments where unwitting errors are made.  It is only in cases where there is a blatant attempt to <Col N="809" /> defraud the system that there should be a hold-up in payment or disqualification from the scheme.  I have put in place in the Department a system to ensure that every help is given to farmers.  Under EC rules we are responsible to EC auditors as the competent authority.  In addition, the Department, with Teagasc, held a series of information meetings nationwide to assist farmers to fill in application forms.  I am continuing to make representations in Brussels to simplify further the application forms because, as the Deputy rightly said, they are still extremely complex.</P>

The Minister must know this, because anyone who reads the Order Paper every day realises that almost 80 per cent of the questions put down to the Minister concern farmers' entitlements to grant and premium payments, which proves that this system is unsatisfactory.  Is the Minister concerned about this?  Has he noted the enormous number of questions relating to grant or premium payments?

      <P>As I stated in my reply to Deputy Molloy, I have gone to very great lengths to ensure that farmers are paid in full and on time.  We have also organised a series of very well attended public information meetings.  I will continue to make whatever amendments are necessary to the application forms to ensure that they are in as simplified a form as possible.  In addition, Teagasc, at my request, have devised a programme of assistance for farmers to help them in this regard.  I feel as strongly as everybody else about this matter because the payments involved are very large.  Over £400 million was paid last year and in two years' time that will increase to £600 million.  Farmers are entitled to those compensatory payments and every measure possible will be taken to ensure the smooth running of this payment scheme.  We are implementing the scheme but the vast bulk of funds come from Europe.  It is of no advantage to the Exchequer or to any national institution to have a hold-up in the payments.  Farmers <Col N="811" /> are deprived of a considerable cash flow when there is a hold-up in payments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>No issue causes as many problems in rural areas as the debacle in regard to headage, beef and other premium payments.  I have a technical question for the Minister.  If a mistake is made in one application in the batch sent to Dublin from the local office why should all payments in that batch be held up?  This leads to frustration at local office level because the farmers ask staff why their payments are being held up and cannot be given a satisfactory answer. There is also a problem because of lack of staff.  It is totally unacceptable that people who applied for premiums last June have still not been paid and it is very difficult to accept that 99 per cent of payments were made.  Obviously that refers to 99 per cent of applications sent for payment and not 99 per cent of applications. When will the procedure be simplified so that those whose applications are passed for payment will get their cheques within a reasonably short period?  The bank managers are sending their clients to the office to find out when <Col N="812" /> the payments will be made.  If we go to the social welfare officer we will be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The applicants themselves, the farmers, have a major responsibility to see that this scheme runs smoothly.  They should take greater care in filling up the application forms and get the assistance of Teagasc, their accountant or someone familiar with the procedure. The amount of money involved is considerable and it would ease the situation greatly if this was done.  We have offered every possible assistance in this regard.</P>
      <P>Formerly, in the computer division if there was an error in one application in the batch, the entire batch was rejected. That matter has now been resolved and only the specific application is now rejected.  That is another improvement.</P>

It was laid down in European Community regulations that not alone would there be a rejection of payment for one year but for two years, which would be very severe on farmers who innocently took the numbers of ear-tags from the blue cards rather than reading the tag numbers.  I am satisfied that in every eligible case <Col N="813" /> where there was no intent to defraud the application will be allowed.</P>

      <P>While I accept what the Minister has said, in view of the fact that in the past public money given to Bord na gCon was channelled through that body to the Irish Coursing Club, does the Minister accept that it is an outrage that the Irish Coursing Club, which appears to carry out its activities like a secret society, has recently refused outright to make available a copy of its annual accounts to the Oireachtas Library?  That is the least they should be obliged to do, so that we would have available to us the information given by the Minister today.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the Minister's reply on 25 February 1993 to a number of questions relating to hare coursing.  In the course of his reply he stated that as part of a comprehensive review of the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958, he was also considering the question of hare coursing.  Such a review will of necessity include the relevant provisions of the Cruelty to Animals Act, 1965.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister, in view of the recent experience of coursing meetings at Clounana in February of this year when nearly 50 hares were savaged and killed, if this incident alone demonstrates once and for all that enclosed live hare coursing gives the unfortunate hare no reasonable chance of escape and clearly involves the infliction of unnecessary suffering on the hare?  In view of this, will the Minister <Col N="815" /> ensure that when the matter comes up for review live hare coursing is banned here as it has been in other countries throughout the world?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The killing of 51 hares at Clounana in February is obviously totally and utterly unacceptable.  The Minister, Deputy Walsh, stated during Question Time in February that an inquiry was being conducted by the Irish Coursing Club into what happened on that day. That inquiry, which is being closely monitored and directed by officials of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, is ongoing and is expected to take some time to complete.  I await that report and will act on it.  In a more general context the Minister made clear the last day the position of the Department.  The task force set up last July to consider the whole greyhound industry, one aspect of which is coursing, is due to report in the near future.  The Minister gave an undertaking that the views expressed by Deputies and others in relation to hare coursing would be taken into consideration in reaching decisions in the context of the greyhound industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister publish the findings of the investigation directed by his Department in relation to Clounana?  Regardless of the incidents that occurred there, will he make his position clear?  Does he not accept that the practice of enclosed live hare coursing, involving on a regular basis at virtually every coursing meeting the savaging of timid and defenceless animals by large dogs, entails unnecessary suffering? It could easily be replaced by drag coursing, which does not involve live animals, as has been done in countries such as Canada, Australia and other countries.</P>

Obviously, I am concerned about the unnecessary cruelty and I am <Col N="816" /> keeping an open mind on the matter until the report of the task force is published. The greyhound industry is an important industry and measures need to be taken to improve it.  It is an industry that not alone provides jobs, but it provides incomes for breeders, trainers and people who race dogs.  As the Minister stated previously, all the views expressed will be taken into consideration in a very full and comprehensive way in reaching policy decisions in relation to the industry.</P>

In view of the tremendous value of the greyhound industry, not only internally but also in terms of exports, a careful view should be taken of the matter rather than considering it on the basis of one coursing meeting in any one area.  I would ask anti-field sports lobbyists to stop sending letters of a personal and filthy nature to Members of this House.  This matter has been investigated already by the Garda Síochána on two or three occasions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent reductions in export refunds for dairy products are unlikely to have any significant adverse effect on either milk prices in Ireland or on the level of Irish dairy exports.  This is because about two thirds of our dairy <Col N="817" /> exports go to other EC member states and are, therefore, unaffected by the changes in the levels of export refunds. Contracts for most of the remainder of this year's exports had already been concluded prior to the recent reductions and they will be eligible for the higher levels of refunds available until recently.  The effect in regard to exports after that will depend on the development of world dairy prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the point. The point is that the price has been prefixed. It will not affect the remainder of this year's exports as the contracts had already been concluded prior to the recent reductions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am appalled at the Minister taking such a relaxed attitude on this. If that is the way the Minister negotiates in Brussels, I am not surprised refunds have been reduced.  Is the Minister not aware that at the end of the present contract period Irish dairy product exporters will have substantial difficulty in third country markets?  Does the Minister not know that any difficulty that Irish dairy exporters or other EC dairy product exporters have in third country markets immediately falls back on the markets within the European Community?  Will the Minister now bestir himself and take some interest in our exports to third countries because, without them, the markets in the EC will come under severe pressure?</P>

The Department was represented there, Ireland voted against the proposed reductions and will take part in their review.  Two thirds of our exports go to the Community so they are unaffected.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 23, 27, 33, 40, 49, 51, 77 and 78 together.</P>
      <P>My general objectives in relation to the next round of Structural Funds will be to secure a modern efficient and competitive agriculture and food industry attuned to added value content and to the needs of the market; to capitalise on our green image as a producer of high quality agricultural and food products through the achievement of high standards in terms of the environment, food quality and safety; to secure a vibrant rural society through maintenance of the maximum number of viable farm households and the development of the wider rural economy.</P>
      <P>The objectives for the agriculture and food area in the period 1994-1999 have also to be set against the background of the Common Agricultural Policy reform changes and more liberal international trading arrangements which are likely to follow when the GATT Uruguay Round is ultimately concluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The importance of securing competitiveness and greater market penetration in an area which is so vital to Ireland's economic growth and employment creation and maintenance is something <Col N="821" /> that cannot be lost sight of in considering how we use the next round of Structural Funds.  Towards this end I am seeking very considerable levels of funding in all areas within my Ministerial remit from primary production to maketing as well as in the areas of rural devlopment and forestry.</P>
    <P>In relation to the general agriculture area my aim will be to continue the various schemes already in place such as the control of farmyard pollution which has been independently evaluated and recognised as an important instrument in protecting the environment, and the farm inprovement programme which I am proposing to expand to help farmers conform to new EC dairy hygiene and animal welfare regulations.</P>
    <P>Under the Programme for a Partnership Government, we are committed to a specific operational programme for the food industry.</P>
    <P>As regards rural development, I am looking at a combination of a continued and much expanded Leader initiative alternative farm enterprises such as animal diversification, horticulture, agri-tourism etc., and headage compensatory payments including accommodation for a third category of disadvantage.</P>
    <P>As regards forestry, my plans will be to underpin the planning objective of 30,000 hectares per year to the year 2000 and they are also formulated with a view to facilitating the development of a competitive downstream processing and marketing industry.</P>
    <P>This is only a broad outline of the various proposals for achieving the objectives I have set out.  Programmes in the research, training and advisory areas will be vital inputs in all of the areas I have mentioned and these will have to be given considerable support.</P>
    <P>I presume the study referred to is an evaluation study, prepared by the ESRI and still in draft form.  This study was commissioned by the Department of Finance to evaluate spending of the Structural Funds in the 1989-1993 period and to make recommendations for the post 1993 period.  As this sudy has not been finalised, it would be inappropriate to <Col N="822" /> comment on it in any detail.  However, the position as regards headage payments is very clear.  The objectives are set out in EC Regulation 268/75 as follows: to maintain a reasonable level of income for farmers; to conserve the countryside from an environmental aspect and to prevent further depopulation in rural areas.</P>
    <P>These objectives apply throughout the disadvantaged areas of the Community and have been agreed at the level of Council of Ministers.  In my view, and in the view of the EC Council of Ministers, these payments make a very valuable contribution to the maintenance of populations in rural areas and as such will continue to be funded from the guidance side of the FEOGA fund.</P>
    <P>As regards the amount of funding, the position is that, in the next round, the overall level of funding for Ireland will be substantially increased.  This should ensure that all Departments can expect to secure considerable extra funds over the next six years.  I expect that the allocation for my Department will reflect, the relative importance of agriculture, food and the rural economy generally in Irish life.  Decisions on the level of funds for individual measures will have to await developments on the global allocation to my Department.</P>

In the negotiations for this tranche will the allocation be close to that figure?  Will the Minister comment on a credible television programme, &ldquo;Euro Focus&rdquo; which quoted a leaked Department of Finance document which stated that the Department was <Col N="823" /> seeking 13 per cent for agriculture in the negotiations for Structural Funds from 1994 to 1997 or 1999?</P>

Will the Minister clarify that point?  In relation to the whole question of headage payments and environmental protection, there is a very good example in areas of Galway and Mayo where there are considerable problems of soil erosion because of over-grazing by sheep, a direct result of that policy <Col N="824" /> in the past.

      <P>While rural development programmes are beneficial to many areas, nevertheless many individual farmers do not benefit directly from them.  I am strongly of the view that headage payments should continue to be of assistance to individual farmers.  I will be insisting that payment of headage and the resources allocated to it will continue. To that extent I do not accept the findings of the ESRI report that a substantial part of the funding should be diverted from headage.</P>

      <P>Arising from the Minister's reply, can we take it that his clear and concise exposition of the role and function of headage payments is a direct warning by the Minister to his colleague, the socialist yuppie Deputy for Dublin 4, Minister of State, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, to keep her hands off the headage payments and that there is no intention of perverting the use of headage payments to relieve Government expenditure on Social Welfare?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications the immediate steps and precautions, if any, which are being taken to safeguard the health of the population and our environment as a result of yesterday's accident at a nuclear power plant in Russia, especially in view of the understanding of the previous accident at Chernobyl.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>This morning, my Department and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland received reports of an accident which took place earlier at a chemical plant, Tomsk-7 in Siberia which leaked radiation after an explosion in a tank containing a uranium solution at a reprocessing facility at the plant. Tomsk-7 in situated in a very remote area in Siberia in the Russian Federation about 1,900 miles from Moscow, therefore, approximately 3,500 miles east of Ireland.  The very isolation of the plant in this instance is serving to limit its consequences to the immediate area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="826" /> The explosion, in a tank at the plant for processing spent nuclear fuel, resulted in a release of radioactivity to the surrounding area.  Latest information is that an area of a few square kilometres may have been contaminated, with radioactivity levels some hundreds of times background level being recorded.</P>
    <P>According to the reports received to date, there were no casualties at the complex, one of three facilities in Russia which reportedly has the capability for processing spent nuclear fuel.  A special committee has been created by the Russian authorities to investigate the causes of the explosion.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is probably aware that there is in existence an Early Notification Convention operated by the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA. Under this, any member state in which an accident occurs and which is likely to have transboundary effects submits early notification of such an accident to the IAEA.  On this occasion, the Russian authorities did not formally notify the accident to the agency because there was not the potential of contaminating areas outside of the national boundaries of Russia.  There are two reasons for this. As I have already said, the plant is very isolated.  Secondly, it is reported that the force of the explosion did not have the energy to push or lift the leaked gases or contamination high enough into the atmosphere for upper winds to carry it beyond the boundaries of the country.</P>
    <P>I have asked the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland to request the fullest information from the International Atomic Energy Agency on the reported radiation leak.  Details on the exact nature of the radiation release and its possible consequences have been sought.  I have also asked the Irish Embassy in Moscow for all available information on the incident.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that we have a national emergency plan for nuclear accidents which is a plan of action designed to provide a response to accidents involving the release, or potential release, of radioactive substances into the environment which could give rise to a <Col N="827" /> radiation exposure to the Irish public. Copies of this plan which were made widely available nationally were also sent to all Members of the Oireachtas.  The plan outlines the measures which are in place to assess and mitigate the effects of nuclear accidents which might pose a radiological hazard in Ireland.</P>
    <P>As regards this particular incident at Tomsk-7, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland will be continuously monitoring the situation and the public will be kept informed as further details come to hand.  The RPII's nationwide radioactivity surveillance network continuously measures external gamma dose rate and samples precipitation and aerosols. The system is designed to detect quickly deviations from the normal background level of radioactivity in the environment.</P>
    <P>For the moment, Russian officials say there is no reason to fear that the effects of the accident will be felt further afield. The explosion at Tomsk-7, however, once again focuses world attention on the dangerously dilapidated state of Russia's ageing nuclear infrastructure and the need to close down unsafe nuclear plants.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the preliminary information available, it would appear that there is no risk of the effects of this incident being detectable outside Russia, and therefore, no risk to the Irish population. It is not anticipated, therefore, that any emergency measures in Ireland will be necessary.</P>
    <P>This unfortunate incident points to the inherent risks of nuclear facilities.  The installation at Tomsk-7 was apparently geared to the reprocessing of nuclear waste.  The failure at the Tomsk-7 site merely exacerbated our own concerns about the hazards of reprocessing and storage of radioactive waste at Sellafield. This is yet another reason to justify my total opposition to existing and proposed reprocessing facilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the statements by the Russian authorities can be believed in view of their previous track record in relation to Chernobyl?  Is <Col N="828" /> he satisfied that all the arrangements in Ireland can be put in place at short notice?  Would the Minister consider the health boards are equipped to deal with the effects of radiation on food supplies and livestock?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Based on the available information we do not anticipate that this incident will have trans-boundary effects. We are satisfied that is the position.  We are monitoring the situation and there is no evidence to suggest that there is any danger at present.  I understand the Deputy's concern following the Chernobyl incident.  However, based on the available information we understand that this incident is not to be compared with Chernobyl.  Our Ambassador in Moscow, Mr. McCabe who is very attentive to our concerns &mdash; I met him last week &mdash; will keep us advised of developments.  The RPII has been instructed by me to seek what information they can from the IAEA who will be informed of the trans-boundary effects of this incident, but at present there are no such effects.  No other country outside Russia has intimated that there are gamma dose rays detectable which would suggest that they have extended beyond the boundaries of Russia.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied as to what the prevailing weather conditions were, and if the prevailing winds when the accident occurred and since are not in any way capable of carrying radiation in the direction of this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I emphasise that this accident occurred in a very isolated area. I understand the winds prevailing at the time indicate that the radiation was dispersed into the vast expanse of isolation of Siberia and no immediate population was endangered.  I understand that there were no casualties at the plant arising from the accident.  It does not appear that the power of the explosion was such that radiation would have been raised into the upper stratosphere which would enable <Col N="829" /> upper winds to carry it beyond the immediate vicinity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the last incident, it was not until the Swedish authorities detected radioactive particles in the atmosphere that the incident was admitted.  Will the Minister step up the efforts being made by the Government and the European Community to ensure that military and nuclear power stations that are unsafe in Russia be dismantled as quickly as possible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The political situation in Russia is far different compared to when the Chernobyl incident occurred.  At that time such information would not have been forthcoming from the USSR.  The authorities have been very forthcoming in regard to this incident.  They are sending their own teams to examine the extent of the damage.  No other member state has detected anything which would suggest that the issue is not as serious as the Chernobyl disaster.  Comparisons would be invidious based on the available information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied with the current system whereby the country in which the accident occurs decides if it is necessary to make an immediate worldwide notification?  A similar incident occurred in Sellafield. Would the Minister agree that there should be an independent body to which any incident, irrespective of its magnitude, should be reported and that body should decide whether there should be immediate notification worldwide?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>

The early notification convention requires that notification be given in circumstances where there is a trans-boundary aspect to any nuclear accident.  That is the international obligation on all member states with a <Col N="830" /> nuclear facility.  It did not arise in this case because there are no trans-boundary effects envisaged following this incident. Until the international law is changed that will remain the position.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 1 in the name of Deputy Harney.  I observe that amendments Nos. 3, a3b, 3b and 9 are related, and amendment No. a3a is an alternative to amendment No. 3. I suggest, therefore, that we discuss the amendments I have outlined together.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 20, after &ldquo;message&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;including a message reproduced by electro-magnetic radiation, including fibre-optics, microwave or radio&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My party was part of the Government that produced this Bill and, therefore, the amendments I am moving are not substantial.  Agreement to introduce such a Bill was part of the Programme for Government both in 1989 and in 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My decision to move these amendments was prompted by reading the very good debate on this Bill in the Seanad and the amendments proposed by the then Senators Upton and Costello.  I have <Col N="886" /> taken on board their precise amendments because they were so appropriate.  Neither Deputy is here now, but since they felt so strongly about the matter in the Seanad I am sure they feel equally strongly now.  They are right.  We need to broaden the definition of &ldquo;communication&rdquo;. I note the attitude adopted by the Minister of State in the Seanad when he said there was no definition of &ldquo;communication&rdquo; either in this Bill or in the 1983 Act.  We had to go back to the Telegraph Act, 1869, which defines &ldquo;telegram&rdquo; as meaning &ldquo; ... any message or other communication for transmission by telegraph&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;telegraph&rdquo; is defined in the same Act as including any apparatus for transmitting messages or other communications by way of electric signals. That definition is understood to be wide enough to cover a system of electric signals with or without wires. ... Therefore, it appears that &ldquo;telecommunications&rdquo; includes a message propagated by electro-magnetic radiation including fibre-optics, microwave or radio.</P>
    <P>The Minister felt that the definition had evolved on the basis of case law.  It is not enough to assume it covers matters transmitted by way of electric signals; we need to be quite specific.  I propose this amendment to broaden the definition to ensure that messages reproduced by way of electro-magnetic radiation, including fibre-optics, microwave or radio are included.</P>
    <P>It is also significant that it is extremely easy to intercept messages transmitted in this way, far easier than messages transmitted by hard wire systems.  The Ceann Comhairle stated that we could take all these amendments together because they are similar, yet they are different.  I propose later to move an amendment to put definitions of &ldquo;communications&rdquo; and &ldquo;interception&rdquo; into the 1983 Act.  A definition of either does not appear in that Act.</P>
    <P>I accept what the Minister said on <Col N="887" /> Committee Stage in the other House and also on Second Stage here that it may be better to assume a definition.  I do not accept that.  We will not have an opportunity in the foreseeable future to amend the 1983 Telecommunications Act and we must use this opportunity to ensure that we have the most modern legislation in this area.</P>
    <P>The Ceann Comhairle indicated that amendment No. 3b is similar.  Is that the case?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Joe Jacob">

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise, I did not have the additional amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that we have a precise definition and know exactly what we are discussing.  While the Minister requested his Department, Telecom Éireann and the Department of Communications to <Col N="888" /> examine this matter between Committee and Report Stages in the Seanad, the fact that the Minister was using phrases such as &ldquo;we understand something is covered&rdquo; is simply not good enough.  We need to be certain.  Members of one party now in Government felt strongly enough about that to move amendments both on Committee Stage and on Report Stage.</P>
    <P>I note that there are two amendments in the name of Deputy Gallagher.  It is unusual for Government backbenchers to propose amendments to legislation. Can I assume the Minister is accepting these amendments?  It seems strange that a party which tabled so many amendments a few months ago should restrict themselves to two amendments that are very similar.  The then Senators expressed dissatisfaction in relation to the official response to some of those amendments.  When I noticed the two amendments proposed by Deputy Gallagher I thought that they would be accepted.  Perhaps it is my cynical mind. This covers the optics of what was involved.  I see the Minister of State is nodding.</P>
    <P>We have had a number of Bills from the Department of Justice since this Dáil assembled.  The Minister of State is more than capable of taking them and I pay tribute to the manner in which he deals with legislation.  However, the Minister of State tends to deal with difficult work such as long and tedious Committee Stage debates on virtually every Bill emanating from the Department of Justice. It is the Department that deals with most legislation.  I mention that by way of a marker and wonder will we ever see the Minister in this House on Committee Stage of any legislation.  From my own experience I know that Ministers of State are restricted in the kind of amendments they can accept.  I make the point not by way of criticism.  It has been a feature of this Dáil that the Minister for Justice has not come into the House to take Committee Stage of any of the Bills so far.  I hope that will not be a feature of the next couple of years.</P>

      <P>If it is agreed, I will speak to amendments Nos. a3a and a3b at the same time.  Those amendments were raised in the Seanad where the Minister gave an undertaking, particularly in relation to amendment No. a3a that he would examine the question of the ascertainment of the contents of a postal package without opening it by electronic means or otherwise.  I understand an advanced system is in operation which enables this to be done at present. As vice-chairman of the Dáil Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism I visited Garda headquarters to see some of their modern equipment.  From an indentation on paper the Garda can suck through evidence which they can use in ascertaining the origins of a letter or parcel.  I understand it is possible to read a card or telemessage which is in an envelope by means of electronic equipment without opening the envelope.  The Minister gave an undertaking in the Seanad that he would examine this matter. Therefore, I ask him to inform the House of the position at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the word &ldquo;telegram&rdquo;, in amendment No. 3b I propose that the words &ldquo;and also includes a message propagated by electro-magnetic radiation including fibre-optics, microwave or radio&rdquo; be inserted.  This matter was also raised in the Seanad.  Has the Minister had an opportunity to consider it?  By and large, this is a worthwhile democratic exercise.  The necessary checks and balances are being put in place.  However, if we do that in relation to the Minister, who is accountable to this House and as a member of the Government is charged with serious security duties we should also put in place checks and balances in regard to other power bases to which similar constraints do not apply.  Those are the people who would be clamouring to have the rights which the Minister enjoyed in the past restricted.  I have put <Col N="890" /> down an amendment to deal with that matter, although I do not know if it is strictly within the scope of the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is a strange democracy that makes a Minister, who is a democratically elected and accountable person, go through those necessary checks and balances when, for example, some sections of the media can, with apparent impunity, record and broadcast private conversations not alone between politicians but, as I read in a recent Sunday newspaper, between a business woman and her solicitor or professional adviser.  That is a very distasteful practice.  Therefore, as we are putting those restrictions on ourselves, we might ask the National Union of Journalists to introduce similar ethics because they are also a powerful group. At least, the Minister is accountable to this House and I welcome the putting in place of those checks and balances, but other professions should examine their ethics and the way in which they infringe people's privacy.  The community would benefit from open and public debate in this regard and the leadership should come from this House and from the National Union of Journalists.</P>

      <P>I rise to speak on amendment No. 3 in the name of Deputy Gilmore which is, word for word, similar to the amendment which Deputy Gay Mitchell put down, No. a3a.  Therefore, it is pointless going over in detail what has been said by Deputy Mitchell other than to say it is clear that the technology exists for ascertaining the contents of a letter without opening it.  Therefore, the definition of interception must be expanded to include the possibility of discovering the contents of a letter by electronic interception.  The day when letters are opened by steam from a kettle on a gas cooker is gone, except perhaps in certain circumstances in the home.  It makes sense that the definition of the word &ldquo;interception&rdquo; should be expanded, although that may not be adequate unless this provision is included in the attempted opening of postal packets. I understand from reading the newspapers that it is possible to insert a pen <Col N="891" /> or a letter opener in the corner of an envelope, wind the letter inside that envelope around the pencil or letter opener and extract it.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> In introducing a Bill such as this, we should provide for the future.  In the age of electronics and with the advance of science, if possible, a global term should be used to cover any future technology which may be introduced.  Amendment No. a3a, which refers to the ascertainment of the contents of a postal package without opening it, covers what is taking place at present with the aid of scanning devices and something that may happen in the future and would prevent the advance of science defeating the purpose of this Bill. If this amendment helps to advance prevention because of future scientific discoveries it would be an asset to the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a long official response which I will read into the record of the House, but first I will deal briefly with some of the points which were made. This group of amendments relate to the two methods by which communications can be intercepted, the interception of a message transmitted through telecommunications or through the postal system.  Deputies are correct in saying both those points were raised in the Seanad.  Not only have I examined those matters since then, but I have consulted with the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications and Bord Telecom who are the experts in regard to such technology.  In relation to telecommunications, Deputies Harney, Gilmore and Mitchell want to expand the definition of telecommunication to include fibre optics signals and so on. Deputy Harney said that she wanted the <Col N="892" /> word &ldquo;communications&rdquo; defined.  The word &ldquo;communications&rdquo; is defined as a postal package or a telecommunication message.  The term &ldquo;telecommunication&rdquo; is not defined, but that is only a small point.</P>
      <P>I consulted with the legal people in Bord Telecom and the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications and they stated that the term &ldquo;communications&rdquo; should not be defined, but deliberately left as broad as possible.  They believe that not alone is it wide enough to cover matters mentioned in the amendments, but it will cover all forms of transmission, even those that have yet to be invented.  There is no statutory definition of the word &ldquo;telecommunication&rdquo;. The word originates from the terminology &ldquo;telegram&rdquo; or &ldquo;telegraph&rdquo; which, as Deputy Harney correctly stated, was defined in the 1869 legislation and subsequently interpreted very widely by the courts.  In fact, in one case in the 1880s &mdash; which is the landmark in this regard &mdash; the House of Lords took the view that the definition in the 1869 Act was sufficient to cover forms of communication not yet invented.  In my view it would not do any great injustice to the legislation to include in the definition what Deputy Harney proposes, but not all people hold that view.  They believe that when the courts look at new forms of communication in the future they may, as a result of the inclusion of this wording in the definition, decide that the Bill does not cover these and that it is confined to particular types of communication.  This is not an easy concept to explain, but courts have restricted definitions in that way for reasons which certainly were not intended by Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies Harney and Mitchell wish to alter the definition to take into account the fact that it might be possible for the Garda or other people to examine the contents of a package with the use of modern technology.  The legislation governing this area is the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983 which criminalises the following activities: opening or attempting to open a postal packet, delaying or detaining such postal <Col N="893" /> packet or doing anything else to prevent its due delivery or authorising another person to do any of these things.  As the Deputies rightly said, this definition does not cover the taking of a photograph of a postal packet and thereby seeing what is inside of it.  There are two points I wish to make in relation to this issue.</P>
    <P>This legislation will merely authorise and put on a statutory basis certain activities which would otherwise be regarded as a crime under the 1983 Act.  We are saying that activities deemed to be a crime under the 1983 Act will not be a crime if authorised by the Minister for Justice in accordance with this legislation. We are not in any way expanding the 1983 Act &mdash; that would be a matter for the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.  Unfortunately, or fortunately as the case may be, I have no brief to put provisions into the 1983 Act which are not there or criminalise activities which are not criminalised in that Act.  The sole purpose of this legislation is to put on a statutory basis the way the Minister for Justice can allow things to be done which would otherwise be criminalised under the 1983 Act.  I have no brief to broaden the terms of that Act or broaden the definition of what constitutes interference with a postal packet.</P>
    <P>As I undertook during the debate in the Seanad, I have been in touch with the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications and An Post about this matter.  They have both advised me that it is not necessary to broaden the Bill in this way.  People's opinions can be wrong and, perhaps, there is a slight lacuna in the law in that this activity is not covered in the 1983 Act, but I have no mandate to change this in an authorisation Bill.</P>
    <P>The 1983 Act covers the opening or attempting to open, delaying or detaining any postal packet or preventing its due delivery.  It goes on to criminalise further activities in this area.  For example, it criminalises the disclosure of the existence of the contents of a postal packet, the use of the information got for any purpose and tampering with such postal packets.  The word &ldquo;tampering&rdquo; is not defined in the Act; it may be taken to be <Col N="894" /> sufficiently broad to cover what Deputy Mitchell wishes to achieve.  To take the example given by Deputy Mitchell, delaying the delivery of a postal packet by even a millisecond so that someone can take a photograph of what is in it is criminalised under the 1983 Act.  Therefore, the lacuna which may exist in the 1983 Act is more apparent than real.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to tease out one point in this regard.  With regard to the 1983 Act, what does the word &ldquo;postal&rdquo; cover?  Does it cover a letter I may send internally in the House to Deputy De Rossa or Deputy Harney, internal post within firms, post carried by private couriers who are not part of An Post, post carried by private companies for profit or post sent from one branch of a company to another, as often happens?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>A wider definition is needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true, but we are simply authorising activities which would otherwise be a crime under the 1983 Act. I do not think we can get into asking the Minister for Justice to issue warrants in relation to the opening of internal packets. I do not think this would be appropriate.</P>
      <P>There are three distinct elements to these amendments.  I will deal first with amendment No. 1, amendment No. 3b and the definition of &ldquo;communication&rdquo; in amendment No. 9. I will then deal with amendment No. 3, amendment No. a3a and the definition of &ldquo;interception&rdquo; in amendment No. 9.  I will finally deal with amendment No. a3b which deals with eavesdropping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Transport, Energy and Communications has been consulted on the issues raised by amendment No. 1 and the definition of &ldquo;communication&rdquo; in amendment No. 9, and it, in turn, contacted Bord Telecom Éireann.  The opinion received from it confirms that such modern means of transmitting messages <Col N="895" /> or information as are referred to in the amendments are covered by the meaning of the word &ldquo;telecommunications&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Deputies will note that &ldquo;telecommunications&rdquo; is not defined in this Bill.  It is described as having the meaning that it has in the 1983 Act.  However, it is not defined in the 1983 Act either.  To get an idea of its meaning one has to go back to the Telegraph Act, 1869, which defines &ldquo;telegram&rdquo; as meaning &ldquo;any message of other communication for transmission by telegraph&rdquo;.  The term &ldquo;telegraph&rdquo; is defined in the same Act as including any apparatus for transmitting messages or communications by way of electric signals.  That definition is understood to be wide enough to include a system of electric signals with or without wires.  The fact that a particular method of telegraph or telecommunications was not invented or contemplated at the time when the definition was enacted does not prevent that method from falling within the terms of the definition or, in the case of telecommunications, its meaning.  This understanding of the meaning of the term &ldquo;telegraph&rdquo; is based largely on case law, and the fact that the word &ldquo;telecommunications&rdquo; is not defined means that that meaning is not restricted in any way.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the amendments would, in effect add nothing to the Bill, but their inclusion could cause problems because of the effect they might have on the long-established understanding of the meaning of the term &ldquo;telecommunications&rdquo; as developed from other terms such as &ldquo;telegram&rdquo; and &ldquo;telegraph&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the definition of &ldquo;interception&rdquo; in amendment No. 3, amendment No. a3a and amendment No. 9. First, amending the definition of &ldquo;interception&rdquo; in section 1, as proposed in amendments Nos. 3 and a3a would not, in itself, achieve anything.  This is because the Bill proposes to regulate the power of the Minister for Justice to authorise interception.  It is section 84 of the 1983 Act that contains the prohibition on the opening and so on of postal packets. <Col N="896" /> Amendment No. 3 would prohibit nothing, and, accordingly, I cannot accept it.</P>
    <P>Even amendment No. 9 to section 2 and section 84 of the 1983 Act would achieve nothing in so far as this Bill is concerned.  That amendment could, solely in the context of the 1983 Act, make it an offence to establish the contents of a postal packet by the use of technology.  That is as far as it would go because of the definition of &ldquo;interception&rdquo; in this Bill.  In addition, the amendments to sections 2 and 84 are tautological, in effect placing the same definition twice in the same Act.</P>
    <P>In this Bill subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (a) of the definition of interception of postal packets limits the meaning of &ldquo;interception&rdquo; for the purposes of the powers of the Minister for Justice under this Bill to interceptions that, apart from a direction by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to An Post under section 10 of the 1983 Act, would constitute an offence of unlawful interception under that Act.  The way in which the power of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to issue such a direction is related to the power of the Minister for Justice to issue a warrant for interception is covered in section 3.  The effect of subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (a) of the definition of interception is to exclude from the Bill interceptions which would not in any case require a direction by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications and, hence, a warrant by the Minister for Justice. An example would be the opening of an undeliverable letter.</P>
    <P>The effect of what I have just said is that the amendments as proposed would be outside the scope of this Bill.  The implications of the amendments would be for the 1983 Act and would more properly fall to be considered in that context. For any such amendments to have an effect on this Bill they would have to be inserted into the 1983 Act in such a way as either to relate to directions by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications or else to amend the substantive law as to privacy generally in <Col N="897" /> relation to postal packets.  There is no occasion to amend the law in either of these ways.  I wish to add that the Law Reform Commission is at present examining the general law on privacy.</P>
    <P>Even if the amendments were within the scope of the Bill and acceptable, I would have doubts about the wording of two of them.  The use of the word &ldquo;technology&rdquo; in section 84 (1) of the 1983 Act, without being defined, would seem to import a loose element into a definition which is well understood.</P>
    <P>Interception of a postal packet means more than just opening it.  It also means delaying or detaining the postal packet. The person to whom the warrant is addressed could properly delay or detain a postal packet for a reasonable period if that were necessary in order to comply with the warrant, but anybody else who detained or delayed the postal packet would be guilty of an offence under section 84 of the 1983 legislation, unless the case fell within the exceptions provided for in that legislation.</P>
    <P>Although amendment No. a3b seeks to amend the definition of the word &ldquo;interception&rdquo;, it addresses a different point.  In effect, it seeks to prohibit the use of bugging devices to record communications between persons.  By use of the word &ldquo;communication&rdquo; the amendment is for all practical purposes restricted to recording telephone conversations. I shall deal with that aspect when the amendment is moved.</P>
    <P>I would be glad to listen to any Deputy who has anything further to add.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his response but I am disappointed with it.  I should like to take up his final point. The Minister indicated that he would not be happy to include a reference to technology because that would be much too loose.  However, he told us earlier that the definition of the word &ldquo;telegraph&rdquo; in the 1869 legislation was very loose and that that was a good thing.  The Minister's attitude to those two matters is not consistent. Reliance is being put on a definition contained in the Telegraph Act, 1869.  There is great dependence on the <Col N="898" /> courts' interpretation of that definition. There is a case pending against a newspaper or newspapers in relation to interference with Deputy Bruton's car telephone conversations.  It could well be argued by counsel on behalf of the newspaper or newspapers that an 1869 definition could not have included mobile phones because they did not exist at that time.  It cannot be assumed that because case law in the 1880s was in our favour, as the Minister said, the position will be the same in the 1990s.  We all know from experience that the Judiciary change their interpretations from time to time. Certainly that is very often the case in constitutional law, which is evolving; interpretations change with the ethos and value system in society.  It is equally true that the Judiciary change their view of legislation.  Members of the Judiciary will be asked to try to determine what the legislators of 1869 may or may not have understood when they defined &ldquo;telegraph&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I understand the position of the Minister of State, because I have been in his position myself, and I will not be unreasonable.  However, it seems unreasonable for the Minister of State to argue that amendments are more appropriate to the 1983 Act.  We will not have an oppportunity to amend the 1983 legislation. Whilst this Bill concerns itself with authorisations by the Minister for Justice, it does not make it illegal for the Minister for Justice to authorise certain matters. The Minister for Justice is being restricted by a very narrow definition of what may be authorised.  The authorisation of the Minister for Justice would not be necessary if the gardaí were to use a scanning device to find out what was in a postal package.  If the gardaí did not open or attempt to open that package, the authorisation of the Minister for Justice would not be necessary.  The Bill is restrictive in that respect.  The same applies to bugging devices, but I shall speak on that matter later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State has said that it is a criminal offence under the 1983 Act to delay or detain a postal package.  I have that legislation in front of me, and I agree <Col N="899" /> with the Minister.  I wonder what constitutes a delay.  In the recent general election campaign a substantial number of letters addressed by a colleague of mine to his electorate was detained until after the election and was not delivered until about two weeks after it was posted. My colleague has taken up that matter and I do not wish to make an issue of it now because it is being dealt with in another way.  I make the point to illustrate that we are all the subject of delays. I have often had letters posted to me that have not arrived for a week or so.  Has anyone ever been prosecuted for delaying the delivery of postal packages?  What constitutes a delay?  I wonder whether a delay means delivery taking two days, four days or five days?  I realise that the Bill refers to communications but the definitions section refers to the 1983 Act. One cannot take one without the other.</P>
    <P>I am always worried when there is reluctance to accept definitions.  In neither definitions section nor elsewhere in the 1983 legislation could I find a definition of either &ldquo;communication&rdquo; or &ldquo;interception&rdquo;. That is very strange and that is why I sought, by way of amendment No. 9, to include a definition.  The definition I have worded may not be perfect and I would be happy to accept a different definition if the Minister of State were to present a better one.  It is unsatisfactory to have legislation dealing with telecommunications that does not define either &ldquo;communication&rdquo; or &ldquo;interception&rdquo;. That is part of the problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister is right in saying that it is an offence to disclose the existence of the contents of a postal package or to use it for any particular purpose.  Would sections 84 (1) (b) and (c) apply if by the use of scanning equipment one were to find out what was contained in a letter without opening or attempting to open that letter?  If one were able to elicit information by the use of technology of one kind or another, would those provisions make it an offence to disclose the contents of a letter if the information contained in that letter was not received by the opening or the attempted opening <Col N="900" /> of the letter?  I should like the Minister to clarify the matter.  The words used by the Minister both in the Seanad debate and now are rather vague.  The Minister uses words such as &ldquo;we understand that&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>When I hear a Minister use the words &ldquo;we understand&rdquo; I am concerned that there is uncertainty.  One cannot be certain for all time, but I would like to think that the advice available to the Minister is more certain than &ldquo;we understand&rdquo;.  That expression is much too vague.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, the Opposition is fairly well disposed to the Bill.  Legislation is certainly necessary.  The attitude of the Opposition is demonstrated by the small number of amendments that have been tabled.  It would be beneficial if the definitions could be made more clear and precise.  A future court judgment should not have to reply on a definition made in 1869 and decide that because certain developments in technology were not then available the definition did not apply, thus meaning that a host of interceptions could fall foul of the appropriate legislative controls.  It should be remembered that it is the privacy of individuals that we are concerned with.  Most people want to ensure that individual privacy is interfered with only when there is a security matter at issue or in the investigation of serious crime.  I shall deal with that aspect later on, because the word &ldquo;security&rdquo; can be defined in so many ways.  On the occasion that led to the necessity for this legislation it was held by the Minister of the time that people were subverting the State, which seemed in his opinion to justify the tapping of telephones.  No reasonable person could have assumed that there was subversion of the State involved.  If there is no definition, that assertion can be made.  It is unsatisfactory that we limit or do not have a definition and therefore allow somebody to use a particular power at a given time to invade the privacy of others.</P>

      <P>When I referred earlier to the need for ethics in the news media in relation to the reproduction of private telephone calls, I was not referring in particular to the incident involving telephone calls made by Deputy Bruton but to the general point.  In so far as my remarks related to a particular case, I was referring to something I read in the newspaper last Sunday, a matter that did not involve a politician.</P>
      <P>The Minister should accept amendments Nos. a3a and 3b.  Those amendments strengthen the legislation and do not in any way detract from or undermine the principles involved.</P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;postal&rdquo; needs to be defined. What is something that is in the post?  If, for instance, I were to send a message to Deputy Harney, Deputy Gilmore, Deputy Browne or any other Deputy through the internal post in the House, would that message if intercepted be considered to be in the post?  Alternatively, if one takes it to the end of the corridor and places it in the post box there, is it deemed to have been in the post from the moment it is placed in the post box?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that if anybody were to delay something in order to photograph it or to carry out electronic surveillance of it in any other way, it would be necessary to delay it and that, by even delaying it one minute, one would be in contravention of existing legislation.  Is it not reasonable to suspect that any of these examinations &mdash; if I may use that word &mdash; which took place in the past, presumably, would have taken place overnight, when sorting had taken place, when perhaps bags of envelopes were lying there awaiting the next process, perhaps awaiting the delivery men to collect them and, in that sense, the letter or letters would not have been delayed.  Yet they could be intercepted.  The title of this Bill is Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Bill, 1992 &mdash; I emphasise the word &ldquo;messages&rdquo; to underline the fact that it may not necessarily be something put in the post to be delivered by An Post or calls made through Telecom Éireann's system.  For instance, what <Col N="902" /> about internal telephone calls, or calls over car telephones?  What about messages sent to people in another manner?</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. a3a. and 3b., the opening by electronic means or otherwise, the ascertainment of the contents of the postal packet without opening it by electronic means or otherwise, I contend are perfectly reasonable.  I suspect there are readily available systems that would allow for this so that, in the future, that will be possible.</P>
    <P>In relation to the matter of definitions and the use of the word &ldquo;telegram&rdquo;, I contend adding the words &ldquo;and also includes a message propagated by electro-magnetic radiation including fibre-optics, microwave or radio&rdquo; is worthy of consideration.  For instance, what happens in the case of ship to shore communications which I understand are carried out by radio?  For example, a former Taoiseach went to sea quite a bit in the literal sense and might well have been called upon to send back messages; or take the case of, say, business people enjoying their leisure time.  If we tie this down then there is little point in padlocking one stable door and leaving another door open.</P>
    <P>If this is a Bill whose provisions are intended to deal with the interception of postal packets and telecommunications messages, then they should be more comprehensive and take on board some of these amendments.  After all, the Minister has dealt with Committee and Report Stages in the Seanad.  He may wish to consider some of the points we make now and return having considered them on Report Stage.  I would ask the Minister to think in terms of the broad objectives of the Bill and accept these two amendments.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I could not help thinking of an incident that occurred when I first became a Member of this House, when a letter was sent to me by my colleague, Deputy Yates, from Wexford.  Exactly one month afterwards I received it back and stamped on the envelope were the words &ldquo;mis-sent to Australia&rdquo;.  At this stage I wonder <Col N="903" /> would I have a serious legal claim about the unnecessary delay on that occasion. I presume it arose inadvertently and I will leave the matter there.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State said something that caused me some consternation.  He referred to somebody who has a vow of silence and who may open a letter.  If he does not open his mouth he cannot be summonsed.  Suppose such a person received information?  I thought of what happened last week when a businessman decided to make one property very valuable by buying it.  Suppose he received information by letter, kept his mouth shut, went off and invested his money and is now on the way to becoming a millionaire?  Would he be deemed to have committed no offence or would he be caught under some other technicality?</P>
      <P>I would worry that we would incorporate or omit anything that would not anticipate the capabilities of modern technology.  It would be awful if somebody later contended that those circumstances did not obtain at the time. The proposed amendments cater for advanced scientific discoveries.</P>
      <P>In the absence of the former Tánaiste, Deputy John Wilson, who was a Greek scholar I might remind the House that when we talk about &ldquo;telegraph&rdquo; we should remember that &ldquo;to telos&rdquo; and &ldquo;grapheo&rdquo; are the Greek words from which that word derived, important information.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I have tabled amendment No. 3.  I want to make a couple of points.  First, I think observations were made, when this Bill was being debated on Second Stage, that in many respects the Bill as drafted, is already out of date and was introduced in response to circumstances which arose in 1982, a subsequent court case that arose from that and the political pressure then exerted to introduce a Bill of this type.  There has been reference here to circumstances obtaining in 1869.  Indeed, even in 1982 one could not have anticipated the kind of rapid developments in technology that have taken place which now enable telephone <Col N="904" /> calls, letters and so on to be scanned by electronic devices.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Browne said, the provisions of this Bill must keep up with the times. We have long passed the days of the unscrupulous post person taking letters into a neighbour's house to have the envelopes steamed open and the contents read.  We live in an era in which letters can be read without being opened at all, in an era in which telephone conversations can be monitored on a regular basis.  For example, I understand that GCHQ in the neighbouring island now have an arrangement that all telephone calls between this island and the United Kingdom are monitored regularly, that they have devised a computer programme to pick up certain words which then trigger off some procedure to carry out detailed monitoring.  We live in a whole new age of Big Brother.  Therefore, we must ensure that citizens' rights to privacy, including the right to privacy in the transmission of messages, whether by letter, telephone or other means, are protected.  Such protection must take account of the modern technology obtaining for the interception of messages and endeavour to anticipate as well future likely technological developments.</P>

      <P>In response to the points made, Deputy Harney felt I was being somewhat inconsistent in questioning the term &ldquo;technology&rdquo;.  What I object to there is importing new definitions to explain a word that has been in existence for a long time, which has been dealt with by the courts, has been understood in a certain way by the courts, has been understood to mean certain things by the people working in the area.</P>
      <P>Deputy Harney also mentioned Deputy John Bruton's case, whose mobile car telephone conversation was tapped.  As I understand the position, clearly that would be an offence under section 98 (1) of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983 which specifically states:</P>
      <P>A person who&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="905" /> (a)  intercepts or attempts to intercept, or</P>
    <P>(b)  authorises, suffers or permits another person to intercept, or</P>
    <P>(c)  does anything that will enable him or another person to intercept,</P>
    <P>telecommunications messages ...</P>
    <P>As I understand the position, from newspaper reports of Deputy John Bruton's case, a telephone conversation between himself and another Deputy was intercepted, that is, an interception of a telecommunication. Clearly that is an offence.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney also made the point <i>vis-à-vis</i> interpretation, since mobile telephones did not exist in 1869.  I would not accept that argument at all.  &ldquo;Telecommunication&rdquo; is the term used in the legislation under which prosecutions will be brought in Deputy John Bruton's case.</P>
    <P>The only reference I made to 1869 was to explain that the term &ldquo;telegraph&rdquo; was defined statutorily in legislation in 1869. &ldquo;Telecommunication&rdquo; is an advance on the term &ldquo;telegram&rdquo;, type of terminology derived from the term &ldquo;telegraph&rdquo;.  The 1869 definition of &ldquo;telegraph&rdquo; was held to be very wide.  For example, section 4 of the 1869 Act, which defined the term, was stated in <i>Halsbury's Laws of England</i> in 1880 and read:</P>
    <P>The definition is wide enough to include a system of electric signals with or without wires, and a system of wires worked by hand if arranged so as to constitute a code of signals.  The fact that a particular method of telegraphy was not invented or contemplated at the time when the definition was enacted does not prevent that method from falling within the terms of the definition.</P>
    <P>That passage was quoted with approval in a landmark case on this subject, the <i>Attorney General v.  The Edison Telephone Company of London</i> 1886, Queen's Bench Division, page 244.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney also made the point that the Garda can, apparently, use a scanning device to discover what is <Col N="906" /> contained in a postal packet without authorisation.  Perhaps they can, and, perhaps, this is a lacuna in the 1983 Act, but they will not be able to disclose the contents, its existence or any information gained. This also covers the point made by Deputy Browne, that somebody may make an investment in the stock or property markets if they discover information as a result of using a scanner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny) Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Would it not be of help to Garda investigations if they did discover information in a letter?  It would be highly dangerous if they could not use such information.  It would be a marvellous advantage if one could discover information and did not have to tell anyone about it.  In the case of the Garda, I am sure it would be a great help if they could be given a letter that would incriminate someone.  They might never have to use this letter in court but it would put them on the right track.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>They would hardly be able to convict the person without the evidence.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore, and others, made the point that the definition is unduly restrictive and does not cover modern developments in telecommunications but that is the reason we have not sought to define the term, &ldquo;telecommunications&rdquo;.  This matter can be approached in two ways. First, if one is dealing with a word which encompasses a small area of activity one tries to define it in a comprehensive way and include as much as possible &mdash; this is true in the case of Revenue statutes &mdash; whereas if one is dealing with a vast area of activity one introduces a general definition and does not try to define bits and pieces of it.  It has been found that, despite the best intentions of the parliamentary draftsman and legislators its meaning can be restricted in the light of further developments.  Experience in the courts shows that it is best to have a general definition.  I genuinely believe this and I have much experience in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="907" /> Deputy Mitchell asked if there was a definition of the term &ldquo;postal packet&rdquo;.  It is defined in the Post Office Act, 1908 as follows:</P>
    <P>A letter, post card, reply postcard, newspaper (printed packet), pattern or sample packet or parcel, every packet or article transmissible by post and includes a telegram.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell also referred to the question of internal mail.  This is not covered by the definition of &ldquo;postal packet&rdquo; and this legislation will only apply to postal packets delivered through the An Post system.</P>
    <P>On whether the Garda can intercept internal mail without authorisation, it would be a crime for anyone to intercept any form of postal telecommunication unless authorised to do so in accordance with a direction from the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications under section 110 of the 1983 Act. Deputy Mitchell made the point that such a direction does not have to be authorised by the Minister for Justice.  This would not be appropriate because there has to be some limit.  However, I am prepared to look at this point again.</P>
    <P>On the question of delays, Deputy Mitchell made the point, and I agree with him, that mail can be scanned while being sorted.  One will not be able to use any information gained or to disclose the fact, for example, that Deputy John Browne has written a letter to me.  Ship-to-shore communications are covered by the definition of telecommunications.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore made the point that the Bill is out-of-date but I contend that it is not.  The definition of &ldquo;telecommunications&rdquo; covered all forms of communication in 1869, 1982 or 1983 and covers those which have been invented since and will be invented in the future. It is my understanding that it covers all forms of non-postal communications by way of signals which could possibly be invented.  That is the reason we have deliberately kept the definition very wide.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister of State to clarify a number of matters. First, we mentioned a hallmark case in the 1880s in which the definition of &ldquo;telegraph&rdquo; was quoted.  Is there any Irish case law and, if so, how recent is it?  Has anyone been prosecuted for a breach of the 1983 legislation?</P>
      <P>In responding to the various points made by Members of the Opposition the Minister of State has, on several occasions, indicated that while the Garda may discover information as a result of scanning a letter this cannot be used.  If a tap is placed on a telephone having been authorised by the Minister for Justice following a request from the Garda Commissioner under this legislation can the information gained be used in a subsequent prosecution?  Will the court be made aware that the Garda tapped a telephone and received particular information?</P>
      <P>The Minister of State also made the point that if one acquires information as a result of scanning a letter and so on it would be an offence to pass it on or to use it in any way.  I accept that that is the case but I am aware that someone can at random scan the system, tap into some number, listen into conversations on a car phone and subsequently circulate the information gained to a number of people.  In such circumstances it would be difficult to establish who circulated the information initially but this can be extremely damaging even if it is circulated quietly and not published in a newspaper.  It can be circulated to the people that matter.  For example, it could relate to a business matter or to a future stock exchange deal and all that one need do is send information to a small number of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to requests made by the Garda Commissioner and the Defence Forces, obviously these are made to the Minister for Justice.  Perhaps it would be more appropriate to make this point on a later section.  If a request is made will it be sanctioned automatically?  Is the Minister's role purely a nominal one or is it envisaged that the Minister will seek advice and, if so, from whom?  Given the <Col N="909" /> concern about the definition I am anxious to know the basis on which the Minister will seek advice.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House as we have aired our views on these issues but I suggest that the Minister of State seek advice prior to Report Stage &mdash; he agreed to do this in the Seanad and one could say that the advice may not change over a period of three months &mdash; as to whether the points made by Deputy Gilmore are valid.  Technology is changing rapidly and it may well be the case that the amendments we have proposed are too specific and would not cover future developments. I have no doubt that it would be possible to prepare an amendment which would cover all such developments.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Judiciary take an independent line and like matters to evolve.  I do not think any of us could be certain that they would agree with the wide definition contained in the 1869 Act. The Minister of State may argue that the concept of telecommunications is covered but I do not think we can be certain that all modern developments are covered by the 1983 Act or this Bill or by a definition which was relevant in 1869. We cannot presume that that would be relevant for all time.</P>
    <P>We will not have another opportunity to amend the legislation dealing with telecommunications, the interception of messages and the protection of the privacy of individuals for quite some time. Therefore, when we are given such an opportunity it is important that we use it to ensure that the legislation is as complete and as comprehensive as possible. It is important, when we have the opportunity, to use it to ensure that the legislation is complete and as comprehensive as possible, not just for now but to try to anticpate what will happen in the future, and have as wide a concept of telecommunications, interception and communications as possible.  I do not intend to respond again because we need to make progress.  I had hoped that the Bill would go on over Easter because I had tabled amendments to later sections of it, but there is no point in speaking at random on these points.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="910" /> I would like to hear the Minister being a little more forthcoming on the possibility of a broad amendment that covers what we in the Opposition are trying to insert in the legislation.  Because there is such goodwill to the overall proposals of the Bill it is important that we try to take on board some of the concerns people have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with Deputy Harney's last point first.  I have no difficulty in having this matter further examined; perhaps the way to do it is to amend the term and write it in so that it will cover future developments in this field. In relation to her query on Irish case law, there is no recent Irish case law that we know of on the subject, but I will investigate whether there is any Irish case law on the definition and I will communicate with the Deputy in that regard.</P>
      <P>I was also asked whether anybody was prosecuted under the 1983 Act, but as far as I am aware only the people who were involved in Deputy Bruton's case will be prosecuted in the near future; but again I will have the matter checked out and let the Deputy know.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked also if the information is used or made known to the court in subsequent prosecutions.  The answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  The Deputy also queried what will happen to those who tap into car phones and circulate the information widely.  I realise the point the Deputy is raising but I do not think we can deal with it in this legislation.  There is the problem of having the matter investigated and getting sufficient evidence to prosecute.  Under the legislation as it stands, if somebody taps somebody's car telephone and uses the information or discloses the contents or any part thereof, that is a criminal offence.  If the Garda can get sufficient evidence to prosecute and get a conviction, the person will be convicted.  That is a matter for the Garda, all we can do here is make the law.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked whether the Minister for Justice will discharge his functions automatically.  The answer to that is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  Section 2 (1) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="911" /> The Minister may give the authorisation, but only for the purpose of criminal investigation or in the interests of the security of the State.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) states:</P>
    <P>The Minister shall not give an authorisation unless he considers that the conditions specified in section 4 or 5 of this Act, ...stand fulfilled, and that there has not been a contravention of section 6 of this Act, in relation to the proposed interception.</P>
    <P>The conditions set down in sections 4 and 5 are quite specific and in my opinion they contain very adequate safeguards of a person's right to privacy.  The procedure to be followed is that a request will be made to a nominated officer in the Department of Justice, whom the Minister will nominate to receive a request like this, and the nominated officer after studying the information supplied by the people seeking the warrant &mdash; whether the Garda Síochána or the Department of Defence &mdash; will then make his own inquiries.  He can use any information he has himself and then he will make a submission to the Minister for Justice.  The Minister for Justice will not be obliged to accept that submission, although I would imagine it would be an unusual case that he would not accept it. Let me point out also that the whole procedure will be supervised by a High Court judge and he is in a position to demand to see any documentation whether from the Garda, the Department of Justice, the Civil Service, Bord Telecom or An Post in relation to any particular case.  The designated judge will report to the Taoiseach, who is obliged to lay his reports before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The procedure will be well supervised. There are adequate safeguards.  The Minister must meet the conditions of sections 4 and 5.  The matter will first go to the nominated officer who will make whatever further inquiries he wishes and then make a submission to the Minister.</P>

      <P>As we have a lady Member in the Chair I should make the point that section 2 (3) when referring to the Minister refers to him as &ldquo;he&rdquo; and I wonder if this covers the present Minister.</P>
      <P>I want to deal further with the Minister of State's clarification of the use of information. As I understand it, he said that if the information is received officially and the request comes from the Commissioner approved by the Minister and information is received by the Garda Síochána to help them with their investigations by giving them a steer, that information is not used subsequently in court proceedings.  Is that the case?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the case we are requiring them to get the Minister's approval if they wish to open or attempt to open a letter, but they do not need the Minister's approval if they want to scan the letter to get the information because they are not going to use the information in any event in court proceedings.  There is no difference.  We are asking them to get the Minister's approval &mdash; and this is a protection I support &mdash; to open or attempt to open a postal package but no ministerial approval is required when they use the type of technology described by Deputy Gilmore.  That seems to be inconsistent.  If we have the technological means to scan postal packages to find out what is in them, it seems to me the Garda should have to get approval to do that.  I cannot see why it is different.  Perhaps the Minister will respond to that either now or on Report Stage?  What we are doing is giving the authorities another weapon to fight crime, and I support that and I certainly do not want to make it more difficult for them.  However, I want to ensure that we have the kind of protection for the privacy of individuals to be upheld and that there are no inconsistencies in what we are seeking to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever about the technology that is available at present to scan postal packages, in five, ten or 50 years from now it will probably be far more advanced and <Col N="913" /> there will probably be no question of opening letters to find out what is in them as it will probably be done by this means. Therefore I believe we are not covering the situation as fully as I wish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept Deputy Harney's point that there is no difference in principle between the authorised and unauthorised situation.  There are more ways to make use of information than just using it as evidence in court.

I will communicate with him between now and Report Stage to see if I have his authority to cover that situation by amending the 1983 Act in this legislation. We do not want the situation that erudite Deputy Browne <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny)</i> describes where the laws are as Dean Swift described them &mdash; like cobwebs to catch flies but let wasps and hornets through.

      <P>Extracting a letter from an envelope, whether by opening the envelope <Col N="916" /> or otherwise, is dealt with under the 1983 legislation as it relates to tampering. In relation to my knowledge, or lack of it, of electronic devices for scanning, I was able to make my decision regardless of whether these devices exist because the disclosure of the existence of the contents of a postal packet of the use of the information obtained in a postal packet are criminal offences.  All of us hear rumours and read reports on these devices but I have not been officially informed of the existence of any such device.  I suspect they do exist but regardless of whether they do, the point is covered under section 84.  This is simply authorisation legislation.  Amendment of the 1983 Act is a matter for the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications. I have already undertaken that I will talk to that Minister about the matter and I shall revert to the House on Report Stage.  I considered the matter previously and took advice on it and in view of today's debate I will be happy to do so again.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 29, to delete &ldquo;judge&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;person&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>A similar amendment to this one is tabled to section 8, which proposes that a High Court judge should oversee the authorisations given by the Minister.  I have no objection to High Court judges doing this work but there are a number of other people who would also be suitable for this job, for example, a retired judge, the Ombudsman or other individuals.  Therefore, instead of merely defining the person as a designated judge I propose that the definition refer to a designated person.  That would allow us at a later stage to include persons other than High Court judges.  I do not envisage that these powers will be used frequently and I do not assume that a High Court judge will be tied down for a considerable length of time in any one year to reviewing these matters.  The courts are extremely busy and there are long delays in having cases heard.  Only a week ago at Question Time I advocated the need to appoint extra judges in order to expedite proceedings in our courts, particularly the Circuit and High Courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The assumption has been made that only a High Court judge would be suitable for the job.  We are involving the Judiciary too much in matters of this kind.  Therefore, I propose that the definition be widened to include, perhaps, retired judges, the Ombudsman or other suitable persons.  When we come to the relevant section I hope to have amendments tabled to cover that matter. I would be interested to hear the Minister's views in this regard.  This is a very small point but would allow us at a later stage to include other persons.  I suggest that the Minister consult with the President of the High Court or the Chief Justice <Col N="918" /> in deciding on the appointment and that the appointment be made on the basis of consultation and agreement between all parties in this House.  That would give greater flexibility, accepting that there are persons other than High Court judges who have the confidence of the public in being fair and impartial, in protecting the citizen's privacy and so on in matters of this kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little confused because a group of amendments were taken together, some of which were in my name.  However, I support Deputy Harney's amendment and the general point she makes.  The Ombudsman would be a very suitable person for this job as would the Comptroller and Auditor General, or a former Comptroller and Auditor General, former Members of the Oireachtas and churchmen, people whose integrity could not be called into question.  The person appointed need not be a High Court judge.  I take Deputy Harney's point that we have an unelected Judiciary which all too frequently makes laws in the Four Courts.  It lets the House off the hook to some extent that they are prepared to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in turn constantly push things onto the Judiciary, presumably at the behest of civil servants.  The Judiciary and the civil servants between them control a lot more power than this House should allow them.  It seems that we only have the powers that they let us have.  We have gone too far down that road.  I support the point Deputy Harney made about the Judiciary and I would go further and include the Civil Service.  This is a House of Representatives, not just a Legislature. The Executive should account to us.  I would not rule out judges for appointment, but it should not be only judges who are eligible for appointment. There are other eminent people who would be suitable for appointment.  No one could claim, for instance, that the current Director of Public Prosecutions, the former Director of Public Prosecutions, the Comptroller and Auditor General or the current Ombudsman were not suitable to fulfil this role.  Anybody <Col N="919" /> who could qualify for the role of Ombudsman should qualify for this job.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Technically, the acceptance of this amendment would require many more amendments.  Deputy Harney has already indicated that she will table those amendments on section 8.</P>
      <P>Following the Malone case the European Court of Human Rights stipulated that the Convention on Human Rights required that a person whose rights are affected by the system of authorised interception should have adequate guarantees against abuses and an effective remedy if such abuses occur.  It is essential therefore to have some form of review of the operation of the system and redress.  In the normal way a person whose rights are violated by administrative action can have such action reviewed in the courts.  But because of the inherently secret nature of the interception system it is necessary to restrict access to the courts and so it is necessary to establish an alternative forum which can ensure that the system is being operated properly.  A reasonable solution is to entrust this duty to an independent judicial person who by his training and experience is well qualified to scrutinise and report impartially on the operation of the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing new in having a judge investigating and reporting on administrative or executive actions.  It is done regularly in the courts and in the course of judicial inquiries.  The designated judge's report on the operation of the interception system will be made public when it is laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and in this regard will be no different from the report of a judicial inquiry.  Involvement of the Judiciary in reviews or inquiries has not hitherto <Col N="920" /> undermined their independence in the eyes of the public and there is no reason to think that it will do so in this instance.</P>
    <P>Normally administrative functions can be reviewed by the Judiciary.  This is a particular form of administrative action &mdash; the secret interception of telephone conversations, postal deliveries and so on.  Under section 10, access to the courts is restricted.  One can only take a constitutional action for invasion of privacy, but not ordinary forms of civil action.  To make up in part for that we are having the whole thing reviewed by a High Court judge to whom people would be going for a judicial review if they had normal access to the courts without the restriction under section 10.  I am not opposed to Deputy Gay Mitchell's suggestion in relation to judges, retired judges or senior public officials, but my understanding is that the Government decision is that the appropriate person to conduct the review is a High Court judge.  I will have no difficulty about consulting on that, if Deputies feel particularly strongly about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that we need a system of review and of checks and balances so that ministerial powers are not abused.  I simply question whether we limit that to a High Court judge.  I would not exclude the possibility of a High Court judge but I want to include the possibility of other persons.  Deputy Mitchell mentioned even more people than I considered, and he is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister clarify something?  A High Court judge will review the operation of this legislation when it is in force. If the High Court judge is subsequently involved in court proceedings involving the individual whose phone the authorities found it necessary to tap to preserve the security of the State or because he was suspected of being involved in serious crime, surely there would be a conflict of interest there?  There is no guarantee in section 8.  Have we any guarantee that the High Court judge will excuse himself from hearing such a case? If a judge was aware that senior Army officers or the Commissioner of the <Col N="921" /> Garda Síochána felt a person was involved in subversion or serious crime necessitating the tapping of the person's phone or the interception of his post, he might form the view that the person was involved in activities of this kind because of the knowledge of information gained confidentially.  The High Court judge cannot discuss what he has learnt from the files he will have read in relation to the authorisation.  There could be a conflict there and there is a case for limiting this to a serving judge.  What kind of guarantees can we have that the judge will not subsequently be involved in any trial that a suspect person could be the subject of?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the point made by Deputy Harney.  I do not suggest that judges should be excluded but they should not be the exclusive appointees to roles of this kind.  In general I would put down a marker for the Minister and his Department.  The Judiciary are not elected and they tend to be protective of their profession not only on the Bench but sometimes off the Bench as well. Perhaps there are reasons for that. However, they are not the most accountable and open of people and are not suitable for every task.  Judges should be included for this task, but I would ask the Department to look more broadly when they are appointing people or suggesting people for appointments of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to administration. The person with the most knowledge of our administrative structure and who reports on it is the Ombudsman, who already works in the area of infringements of rights and duties under the existing provisions of a range of legislation. Nobody knows better than the Comptroller and Auditor General how the administration works, and he is a person capable of keeping secrets.  He has access to the most secret of files. Former secretaries of Government Departments and journalists of a high calibre, such as Michael Mills was when he became Ombudsman, churchmen and so on would be suitable for appointment. Former distinguished Members of the <Col N="922" /> Oireachtas would also be suitable appointees as would many people involved in the trade union movement. Judges have enough definite powers for which they do not have to account.  It is time to trawl a bit more widely and to thrust this responsibility onto a broader spectrum of the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I take Deputy Mitchell's point about putting down a marker.  The Government decision is that this should be confined to a High Court judge, but I will have no difficulty in speaking to the Minister or the Taoiseach about this.  As the Deputies say, if this is framed more broadly there is nothing to stop the Government from appointing a High Court judge.  We would just leave ourselves with the flexibility to appoint somebody from the categories mentioned if that is wished.  I am aware of the possibility of a conflict or interest &mdash; a point raised by Deputy Harney.  We have been in touch with the Chief Justice concerning this matter who had discussions with the President of the High Court.  They agree &mdash; I have it in writing from the Chief Justice &mdash; that the judge involved in reviewing the overall operation of the Act should be taken off criminal work.  I presume he would not be involved in any civil case relating to any case he reviewed.  We have a communication both from the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court &mdash; who allocates High Court business.</P>
      <P>I can give Deputy Harney a categoric assurance that there will be no question of a conflict of interest in relation to reviewing the operation of this legislation and dealing with cases which arise directly from that operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for that assurance.  The Chief Justice is an honourable man and the members of the Judiciary are honourable people and if there is a conflict they will not involve themselves.  We are not putting a statutory requirement on them to prevent them getting involved.  To a large extent, we are relying on their own rules, their honour and their sense of what is <Col N="923" /> or is not appropriate.  That is not good enough.  The Bar is not established on a statutory basis as opposed to, say, the Incorporated Law Society and as a result self-discipline is imposed on members of the Judiciary, with the exception of the Circuit Court whose members are selected from practicing barristers.  It is not good enough to rely on their own set values of right and wrong, we need to provide a statutory basis.</P>
      <P>I accept what the Minister of State has said.  He has been very open and supportive and has promised to speak with the Minister and the Taoiseach in relation to this matter.  It would be in our own interest to widen the scope of who may or may not review this legislation.  I take the view that putting one person in charge of reviewing something puts them in a very difficult position.  We are talking about somebody who has been appointed by a Government.  Our present system for making appointments to the Judiciary is that they are nominees of the Government. The Minister then goes to the President of the High Court &mdash; I do not know whether he suggests Judge X, or how exactly it is done &mdash; but as the legislation is framed the Minister will discuss the matter with the President of the High Court and a judge will be nominated for this purpose.  Despite the independence, competence and honour which members of the Judiciary have, it puts them in a difficult position.  Perhaps we should consider a group of three people, including the Ombudsman, a member of the Judiciary and, possibly, a senior public servant from another Department or a retired member of the Judiciary, a retired Ceann Comhairle or a retired President. When one person is put in charge of a review procedure it is very difficult for people to accept that a balanced approach has been adopted.  It is always better to have three people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not advocating that we should have committees and large groups for everything but certainly to expect one person to take on board the views of a Minister or a Commissioner in the Garda Síochána or, say, someone in the Army, <Col N="924" /> puts a huge onus on them.  I know I will be told they are able for this responsibility and that they are independent people, nevertheless it is better if there is a wider concept.  As Deputy Gay Mitchell said, the responsibility of the Ombudsman is to protect the rights of ordinary people.  We still have the first ever Ombudsman in place as the present incumbent was reappointed when his term of office expired.  He has managed to obtain the confidence of the public as a person who protects their rights and defends their interests.  Somebody of that calibre as well as a High Court judge and somebody else would bring a sense of balance to the review procedure which would be a good thing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be appropriate to have a committee as the Deputy rightly said.  Basically we are trying to balance the powers being given to the Garda to investigate crime and subversive activities on the one hand and the right to the privacy of the individual on the other.  That is the reason there are provisions in the legislation requiring that only the absolute minimum use shall be made of the information obtained through interception.  We are also providing that copies of any communication be destroyed immediately.  The intention is to keep the publication and dissemination of information to the minimum. The likelihood is that if more people are involved in the procedure, particularly in a small country, the information would spread.  Hence the reason for only one person to be designated.  If the person so designated is a High Court judge he would certainly be competent to carry out that function on his own.  Of necessity, only the minimum number of people would have access to the material in order to protect the rights of the individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>To assume that a review carried out by more than one person would not be confidential is wrong; it could be an argument for dictatorship &mdash; a one-member Government, otherwise you would not have confidentialty.  In <Col N="925" /> the case of a request from the Garda Commissioner a large number of persons will know, presumably a number of people in the Department of Justice and I have no objection to that.  We have a large public service and it could be said that they act in an extremely confidential way, and this is not merely because they sign the Official Secrets Act.  I do not assume for one moment that if it is widened to more than one person there will be suddenly breaches of confidentiality or an invasion of the citizen's privacy.  A number of people will know about this in any event; that is not a bad thing and it cannot be avoided.  I would hate to think that a Commissioner would make a request off the top of his head.  I assume he would discuss it with the Garda Fraud Squad and that a number of people would be involved before there would be a request for an authorisation to interfere with a postal packet or to tap a telephone or whatever.  I will withdraw the amendment because the Minister has been reasonable and he has promised to examine it for Report Stage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Harney said earlier that I had tabled this amendment with an attitude of cynicism.  While that attitude may be based on her experience in both Houses &mdash; which is much longer than mine &mdash; it is not accurate.  Given that the Minister is aware of the concern which gave rise to my amendment and given that I am <Col N="926" /> satisfied it will be addressed in the House I am happy to withdraw it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment seeks to insert, for authorisation purposes, the metering of information relating to the number of telephone calls a person makes, to whom he makes them and so on.  At present that information is made available to the Garda, if they request it, by Telecom officials, under their normal duties, to assist them in the prosecution of crime because they had released that information without a statutory basis. The right to release such information to the gardaí on a statutory basis is being provided for.  The metering information which relates to the number of calls a person has made, their duration and to where they were made does not involve releasing details of the contents of those calls and, therefore, would not be a matter requiring the authorisation of the Minister for Justice.  Certainly such authorisation would be necessary in relation to cases where the gardaí tap into people's telephone conversations, but the release by Telecom officials to the gardaí of mere metering information would not be a matter for authorisation by the Minister for Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 13 of the Bill provides for Telecom officials to release information on a number of grounds, for example, for the prevention or detection of crime or for the purpose of any criminal proceedings. Deputy Gallagher, in his second amendment, proposes a formalised procedure whereby a recognised Garda officer, not below a certain rank, would be required to issue a request.  That provision is probably not unreasonable and I will examine it between now and Report Stage.  We must formalise the procedure if detailed confidential information in regard to the number of telephone calls people make is to be released to the gardaí for the purposes of criminal investigation.  It would be correct to formalise the procedure in this regard and I will examine this matter between now and Report Stage to see how this might be achieved. I suspect it might be achieved by stating that the request should be made by a <Col N="927" /> Garda officer not below a certain rank, perhaps an inspector.  I thank Deputy Gallagher for bringing this matter to my attention.</P>

I am advised that a bugging device in or attached to a telephone or which otherwise would intercept a telephone conversation is covered by section 98 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983.  In <Col N="929" /> other words, the use of such devices would be an interception of a telecommunications message in the course of its transmission and, as such, would be an offence with a penalty, on conviction and indictment, of a fine up to £50,000 or imprisonment up to five years, or both.

      <P>The difficulty in relation to Deputy Harney's amendment is that she uses the term &ldquo;communication&rdquo; which is defined in the Bill as &ldquo;telecommunication or postal packet&rdquo; but I understand the Deputy also intended her amendment to include general bugging <Col N="930" /> devices, which might be attached to walls, etc.  The Deputy has introduced a much wider area for debate which would be a subject for separate legislation. Section 1 simply provides authorisation of a procedure which is criminalised by the 1983 legislation.  Responsibility for introducing legislation to cover bugging devices for industrial espionage lies with the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications.  It covers a large area.  I understand that the Law Reform Commission is currently considering the law on privacy and we may get some suggestions from its published report. There are many difficult policy areas in relation to legislation concerning bugging devices and to what extent bugging conversations for criminal proceedings can be allowed.  It is a large area and not appropriate to this legislation, but I accept Deputy Harney's point that the problem will have to be resolved soon.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this legislation is to deal with the authorisation procedure, but if the Garda Síochána wish to use a bugging device as opposed to tapping somebody's telephone, for example, if they wish to place a bugging device in somebody's home, would that be in order without seeking ministerial approval?  If that is the position it seems to be inconsistent with what we are seeking to achieve.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify the position.  I accept that the general area of industrial espionage may be a matter for another Minister but, as I said earlier in the context of telecommunications and the type of controls we want to put in place and the checks and balances we must have to ensure that citizens have their privacy, we will not get an opportunity in the foreseeable future to amend the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983.  That is why, in the light of our experience and the development of and greater use of this equipment, we need to have a certain amount of safeguards.  I am paricularly interested in the powers of the Garda Síochána in relation to the use of bugging devices.</P>

      <P>That is a scandal because this legislation would seem to have arisen simply as a result of the Kennedy/Arnold case.  Instead of tapping their telephones on that occasion if the Minister in question had authorised the placing of a bugging device on their dwelling, the device would obviously have picked up as much information as may have been required on that occasion.  It certainly is a loophole if we are simply responding to the narrow set of circumstances that arose in the early eighties.  We need to have a wider definition of what exactly we are trying to protect.  We are trying to protect the privacy of citizens from gross interference by the authorities.  It seems ludicrous to say that we will place strong controls on the tapping of telephones or the interception of postal packages, but the use of bugging equipment &mdash; from which people can equally receive confidential information and interfere with the privacy of individuals &mdash; is not covered under any legislation.  It is not good enough for us to say that it is a matter for another Minister.  It does not matter which Minister will be responsible.  We are discussing safeguards and the protection of citizen's rights and privacy.  I see no reason why we cannot have an appropriate amendment to this legislation to ensure that our privacy is protected.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Harney.  Indeed, it is not just a question of implanting a type of bugging device on the wall of somebody's house.  Again, we are back to the area of technology.  It is now possible, I understand, for ordinary conversations to be picked up by way of various kinds of long range microphones and recorded in that way.  One could conceivably locate one of these devices in a white Hiace van outside the home of a political opponent, for example, and happily record the conversation of that opponent.  We would all agree that we must have protection against actions of that kind.  I agree with Deputy Harney when she says it is a question of protecting the privacy of the citizen and legislating for those circumstances, which we all appreciate, when, in the fight against crime or where there is a threat to the security of the State, exceptional measures have to be taken.  But in providing for those circumstances we must be careful to protect the rights of the individual citizen against what really amounts to an invasion of privacy.</P>

      <P>I am always anxious to console Deputy Browne.  This explosion <Col N="933" /> of technology, including bugging and eavesdropping devices, has also caused problems in other countries.  I understand that in the United Kingdom the relevant criminal law review committee is examining some way to tackle this particular device.  Apparently the main problem that has arisen there relates to intrusion by the press into privacy of individuals, famous individuals in some cases.  I assure the House that at the moment an examination of the uses and possible misuses of bugging devices is being undertaken by the Department of Justice.  It is a major problem which more advanced countries than us have not managed to solve yet.  It is a comparatively recent problem because this explosion of technology has occurred only in recent years.</P>
      <P>I do not envy the public service and the Department of Justice the task which lies before them.  However, I assure Deputy Browne and the House that an examination is underway at the moment. Perhaps some guidance will be obtained from what the United Kingdom decide to do in the matter.  I do not agree with slavishly following the United Kingdom in everything we do, but if they can give us some guidelines in this regard we will not ignore them.  We are aware of the problem, we are conducting a study and are eagerly awaiting to see how other countries address this matter.  I agree with all Deputies who said that it is a problem that will have to be tackled on some level.</P>

It seems obvious to me that what we need to do is to make that an offence and this is the appropriate Bill in which to do that.  Exceptions could then be such as we do for telephone tapping. I cannot see a great difficulty with that.  I cannot understand under what circumstances it could possibly be legal or acceptable to bug somebody else's conversation. As we all know, conversations can be used out of context and unless both or all parties to the conversation agree it is unacceptable and should be a criminal offence to bug the conversation of another.</P>

We all accept that it is not good enough that there should be open season in regard to bugging.  Some controls must be exercised and the formula provided in this Bill could be applied.  I appreciate there will always be circumstances where bugging may be carried on and by its very nature nobody will know anything about it.  The same could be said about many crimes which are not detected, but that does not mean they are not crimes and it does not prevent an attempt being made by the State at least to limit the commission of such crimes.  I do not understand why the procedures in this legislation could not apply also to the problem of bugging.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not, but I will respond briefly to Deputy Gilmore's point.  In this Bill we are authorising a procedure which would be a criminal act under basic legislation which is already in place to deal with telecommunications matters.  There is no basic legislation which deals with the problem of bugging and, therefore, we would have to start at the beginning, as it were.  That is where the difficulty arises.  This legislation is linked to the 1983 legislation which deals with telecommunications and if we want to introduce procedures, authorisations and so on in regard to eavesdropping we must start at the beginning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated that a review of this is being carried out in his Department.  Does he intend to introduce the basic legislation to which he referred arising from that review?  I gather from the tone of what he said that he accepts the necessity to legislate in this area.  Will he inform us if it is intended to do that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister clarify the difficulties he anticipates in this regard?  I assume he is referring to situations where a person is blackmailed or threatened in regard to a possible kidnap. In such circumstances it would not be unreasonable to have the conservations recorded.  I am not a legal person, but I believe the proper way to do this is to make bugging a criminal offence and introduce a good defence clause.  When I was Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, we introduced some good defence clauses which meant that in suspicious circumstances an action was wrong except where a person could prove that he or she took all reasonable precautions to avoid doing it.  Perhaps we could introduce a defence clause in this regard.  If a person could prove they had reasonable grounds to believe they were the subject of a kidnapping threat or being blackmailed, bugging would not be a criminal offence; otherwise it would, <Col N="937" /> except subject to an authorisation along the lines which exists in regard to telephone tapping.  We are relying on definitions and concepts that are more appropriate to the 1869 legislation when it was not envisaged that there would be bugging devices that could record conversations from a distance.  Part of the difficulty is that the provisions of the legislation are out of date and in time we will probably regret not amending those definitions.  I do not expect the Minister to clarify all the difficulties he anticipates, but perhaps he might refer to some of them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Harney correctly identified one of the difficulties.  There must be a basic provision criminalising bugging and the difficulties arise in regard to the number of exceptions in this regard.  We must deal also with sale, importation and so on.  Substantial legislation would be required to cover all the difficulties.</P>
      <P>In response to Deputy Gilmore, the study being undertaken at present by the Department of Justice is in regard to the problems to which bugging gives rise.  A policy decision will have to be taken in regard to whether it should be criminalised and if the decision is in the affirmative we will introduce legislation. This area is not as simple as it may appear.  In my view, it should be criminalised but I am unsure whether there could be a civil action if a person improperly bugged a conversation.  It could involve an action in regard to trespassing. I do not wish to pre-empt the ultimate decision in regard to the criminal area, but if it is decided that there are sufficient problems to justify criminalising this matter, we will act on it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (2), lines 11 to 15, to delete paragraph (b).</P>
      <P>This section deals with the powers of the Minister to give an authorisation for the purposes of criminal investigation or in the interests of the security of the State. There is no disagreement on that.  Section 6 sets out the procedures, the persons who may make an application and the requirements which they will have to meet in order to make an application for an authorisation in the first place.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to section 2 (b) where it is provided that the authorisation should be given in writing. Section 2 (b) makes an exception in that the Minister can give, in what is called a case of exceptional urgency, an authorisation orally, by telephone or otherwise, and if it is so given, it should be confirmed, as soon as may be, by warrant under the hand of the Minister.  There are two reasons I believe that provision should not be included in this Bill.  First, it is unnecessary.  If there are cases of exceptional urgency where there is not enough time available to give the authorisation in writing in the normal way, it could be sent by fax.  I cannot contemplate situations which would require a decision to be made by the Minister and given orally by say, telephone.  It is as quick to communicate a decision by fax as it is by telephone.  There is no necessity for this type of oral authorisation. This is a dangerous provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One has merely to reflect on the widely reported circumstances which gave rise to public concern and in turn, gave rise to this legislation.  There was a great deal <Col N="939" /> of oral communication in those circumstances which was subsequently confirmed or not confirmed in one form or another.  I certainly do not want to see a situation arising whereby the Garda Commissioner or an officer of the Defence Forces can walk into the Minister's office and get oral approval to tap a telephone when, under the Bill, such approval has to be confirmed at a subsequent stage.  This approval may not be confirmed subsequently and, of course, the damage will have been done by that stage.</P>
    <P>People who turn up at the Minister's office asking who gave the authorisation to tap their phones may be told that the Minister gave the authorisation orally, it was a case of exceptional urgency, but something went wrong and it was not subsequently confirmed.  This is poor consolation to those whose phones have already been tapped.</P>
    <P>Section 6 outlines the various procedures which have to be gone through in order for an application for authorisation to tap a phone to be made in the first instance.  Do the provisions in section 2 (2) (b) mean that the procedures outlined in section 6 can, in cases of exceptional urgency, be set aside and that the Minister can be approached in the street or pub and asked to authorise a tap on someone's telephone?  We have to be very careful about this issue.  I do not think there is any necessity for oral authorisation; it is a dangerous provision. Given the existence of fax machines, there is no necessity for it.  The authorisations should be given in the normal way.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> When I was reading this section the term &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; caught my eye.  This may be a legal term but it does nothing for the English language.  What is the difference between the term &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; and the term &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo;?  I understand Deputy Gilmore's fears that this provision may be abused, but there might be cases of exceptional urgency.  The difficulty is that <Col N="940" /> we do not know what the term &ldquo;exceptional urgency&rdquo; can mean.  When the Minister is in a car he will not have access to a fax machine and he may have to give the authorisation over a phone.  This is the type of provision which could be abused but I have enough trust in Ministers to believe that they would not abuse it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>When I first saw this amendment I was not taken by it, but Deputy Gilmore has made some very valid points for its acceptance by the Minister.  I accept that the Minister is not always sitting at his desk in the Department of Justice waiting to give authorisations to the Garda Síochána or the Defence Forces for the interception of a telephone or telecommunications message. However, I equally take the view that a Minister for Justice is never far away from a fax machine.  I further take the view that in cases of exceptional urgency a car phone would not be used to communicate the request for the authorisation, given the danger of having a conversation on a car phone.  The Minister would use the nearest &ldquo;safe&rdquo; phone, and the chances are that there would be a fax machine in close proximity to such a phone.</P>
      <P>The term &ldquo;exceptional urgency&rdquo; can be used to define many circumstances.  I do not wish to harp back to the events which initially led to this legislation as I do not want people to think that I live in the past.  However, it was maintained at that time by the Minister in question that the individuals were involved in the subversion of the State, or words to that effect; it was considered to be a very serious matter.  Every reasonable person took the view that this was not the reason, and the courts upheld that the privacy of the individuals was interfered with.  The term &ldquo;exceptional urgency&rdquo; can be interpreted in many ways, depending on who is interpreting it.  I am concerned about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned that the procedures referred to by Deputy Gilmore could not be put in place if it was not possible to use a fax machine or write a letter.  If a <Col N="941" /> matter is so urgent that a decision has to be made immediately then the procedures proposed in the Bill could not be put into place.  There is not time limit on oral approval &mdash; it does not stand for 24 hours; it stands for as long as any other approval.  This provision could be open to abuse.</P>
    <P>Deputy Browne referred to the appropriateness of the term &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo;.  Whatever about its legislative context, I think it is supposed to mean as soon as is practicably possible.  For example, a Minister could be out of the country when approval is sought.  Of course, there is supposed to be an acting Minister for Justice who, presumably, would have the powers of the Minister. Therefore, it is not good enough to use the term &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo;.  There should be a specified period of time.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that the Garda Commissioner could walk up to the Minister when he is at a function and whisper to him that he would like to tap the phone of X, Y or Z and that the Minister could say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; on the spot?  I would be concerned about this as it would remove all the other powers proposed in the Bill.  I am concerned that we do not make the law so strict that the Garda are powerless to tap the telephone in a house in which a wanted IRA person is staying.  I do not want to make the law so strict that we do not provide for the genuine exceptionally urgent cases.  As Deputy Gilmore rightly said, a letter by way of a fax should be the minimum requirement because Ministers are more accountable when they put their names to something than when they give a direction orally.  We have all seen how very honourable people can deny what they did or did not say orally; this happens all the time.  A letter sent by fax should be the very minimum required in such cases.</P>
    <P>The Bill states that the oral message may be given by &ldquo;telephone or otherwise&rdquo;. If a message is given &ldquo;otherwise&rdquo; presumably the Minister will be in the company of the Garda Commissioner at a party or whatever.  It should be possible in those circumstances for him to give a written note to the Garda Commissioner; <Col N="942" /> I do not understand why a letter is not acceptable in those circumstances.  Presumably a Minister will give approval by telephone if he is away from his office or not with the person, who has to be the Garda Commissioner or a nominated officer of the Defence Forces requesting the authorisation.  If the authorisation is given otherwise than by telephone presumably the Minister is with the person requesting the authorisation.  I do not understand why the authorisation cannot be given in written form in those circumstances. The Minister should clarify the intention behind this provision and consider taking on board the points made by Deputy Gilmore.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Browne that the term &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; is somewhat unusual; we usually use the expression &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo; in legislation.  I will discuss the matter with the parliamentary draftsman to see if we can tidy up this term.</P>
      <P>Section 2 (2) (b) states that oral authorisation may only be given in the case of an exceptional emergency, not an emergency.  Therefore, it is envisaged that this would happen only on rare occasions.  The approval has to be confirmed by way of written warrant as soon as may be or as soon as practicable.  I can assure Deputies Gilmore and Harney that the conditions set out in sections 4 and 5, and the procedure set out in section 6, will apply equally to an oral warrant as they apply to a written warrant. I wish to allay any fears which may exist in this regard.  Section 2 (3) states:</P>
      <P>The Minister shall not give an authorisation unless he considers that the conditions specified in sections 4 and 5 of this Act, as may be appropriate, stand fulfilled, and that there has not been a contravention of section 6 of this Act, in relation to the proposed interception.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This provision relates to subsection (1), that is, all authorisations, whether written or oral followed by a written authorisation. Therefore, the provisions in <Col N="943" /> sections 4, 5 and 6 will apply even in the case of oral authorisations.</P>
    <P>As I have said, it is envisaged that an oral authorisation could be given only in very rare cases, cases of exceptional emergency.  Deputy Gilmore wanted to know what the position would be if an oral authorisation were not followed up by a written authorisation.  Provision has been made for an overall review of the legislation by a High Court judge.  I am sure that if a Minister tended to make oral authorisations and then not follow them up with written warrants the High Court judge will comment on that in the report he or she made to the Taoiseach, which, as I have said, will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Ministers would need to be very careful in their approach to the legislation and in the way in which they exercised the new powers provided under the legislation.</P>
    <P>I am able to give an example of a time when an oral authorisation might be necessary.  It might be discovered that someone was importing gelignite into the country and at the time of discovery the Minister might be, for example, down in Templemore or in transit between Dublin and some other area.  If the Minister were to get a call from the Commissioner on his or her car phone to advise that the importation could be headed off or the load of gelignite raided, which would save the lives of innocent people, if authorisation were immediately given to tap a certain person's telephone it would not be reasonable to expect the Minister to hunt around for a facsimile machine so that the authorisation might be put in writing.  In the meantime, the telephone conversation that the Garda wanted to record in order to prevent that importation might have taken place, meaning that the gelignite could come into the country and innocent lives could be lost.</P>
    <P>As I have explained, it is envisaged that the provision for the Minister to make oral authorisations would be used only in very rare cases.  It cannot be guaranteed that the Minister would have immediate access to a facsimile machine. <Col N="944" /> It is not the question of preventing a crime that is at issue; it is the question of getting the information that will enable the Garda to prevent the crime from being committed.  It could easily be that a short telephone conversation due to take place might be concluded within a matter of minutes, that being the reason for the provision for oral authorisations.</P>
    <P>As I have also said, the making of an oral authorisation has to be immediately followed up by the making of a written authorisation.  If that were not done, the High Court judge would no doubt question that in his or her subsequent investigation.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;exceptional urgency&rdquo; has been used, because it is only in cases of extreme emergency that an oral authorisation would be made.  It would certainly be the very rare exception rather than the rule that oral authorisations would be given.  Nevertheless, all Members would be able to think of a very unusual instance in which it would be right and proper that the power to make an oral authorisation be given in order that crime, possibly serious crime, may be headed off.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have any difficulty in accepting that the Minister should have the power to act quickly to deal with the kind of instance envisaged. However, I presume that even in Templemore there is access to facsimile machines and one would assume that if the Minister were in Templemore written authorisation could be made by use of facsimile.  The Minister spoke of an instance in which authorisation had to be given by a Minister in transit.  It seems that we are talking of times when the Minister is either in transit or in such a remote location that there is access to a telephone but not to a facsimile machine. Deputy Harney referred to the &ldquo;otherwise&rdquo; situation, when presumably there would be somebody with the Minister and the Minister was not relying on the telephone.  In that circumstance it would be as easy to make an authorisation in writing, albeit handwriting, as it would be to make an oral authorisation.  It must <Col N="945" /> be remembered that it was an exceptional set of circumstances that gave rise to public concern and led to the introduction of this Bill in the first place.</P>
      <P>The Minister has spoken of the powers of the High Court judge to review the legislation.  The High Court judge does have those powers.  There is power for the High Court judge to obtain documentary evidence.  We could assume that the judge found that a certain telephone had been tapped.  After making inquiries about that, the judge might discover that there was no documentary evidence, that no subsequent warrant had been issued. When the judge questioned that, the Commissioner might say that the Minister's authorisation was received on a particular evening via the Minister's car phone.  The Minister might confirm that, or perhaps the Minister might genuinely have forgotten that the authorisation had been given.  For whatever reason, however, subsequent written authorisation had not been issued.  I am concerned about a loose situation in which it all comes back to who said what to whom and whether the Minister did get a telephone call to authorise a particular phone tapping.  The Minister could be put in a difficult position.  The Minister might find that he or she genuinely could not remember whether a telephone call had been received, whether the Commissioner had been met on a particular date and whether an oral authorisation had been given.  That could particularly be the case if, as could well be, the inquiry took place some time later &mdash; memories can be faulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is necessity to get the authorisation onto paper, however this might be achieved.  I suggest to the Minister that some formula should be decided on by Report Stage.  There should also be a legislative requirement on the person who made the request to record the fact that an oral request for authorisation was made and an oral authorisation was granted, which oral authorisation could subsequently be the subject of a formal written warrant.  There has to be documentary evidence of the authorisation <Col N="946" /> having been made.  If that does not happen, we may &mdash; admittedly, in very limited circumstances and very probably in controversial circumstances &mdash; find that there is no documentary evidence and that the Minister's credibility is on the line.  The Minister could be put behind the 8 ball, trying to remember something that might have happened two or three years previously when he or she was travelling from Limerick to Templemore one evening.  To avoid having a grey area in relation to oral authorisation there is a need for documentary evidence.  I still believe that there are now sufficient means at everybody's disposal to get such matters down on paper.  If there were a very urgent set of circumstances that required such an immediate response, a certain procedure should be followed to provide documentary evidence of the authorisation so that there was no need to rely on vague recollection at some later stage.</P>

      <P>There is a misunderstanding of the procedure involved here.  The Garda Commissioner cannot approach the Minister and the provisions of section 6 make that quite clear.  The Garda Commissioner or Army officer has to approach &ldquo;the nominated officer&rdquo;, that is the civil servant in the Department of Justice, who then passes the request to the Minister who, in 99.9 per cent of cases, will give written authorisation. Sometimes, in an emergency, the authorisation is oral but the Deputy can take it, in view of the fact that the request is being made by a nominated officer, who is a civil servant, it will be in writing.</P>
      <P>In deference to Deputy Gilmore's point of view perhaps we can write into the section that &ldquo;the nominated officer&rdquo; shall record the day and time of the Minister's authorisation.  Would that meet Deputy Gilmore's requirements?  We could provide for an oral authorisation which can be followed subsequently in writing, so that the civil servant, &ldquo;the nominated officer&rdquo;, who will be requesting this from the Minister, can record the fact that the Minister gave oral authorisation. Therefore, it will be on record.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 8, subsection (1) (a) (ii), to delete lines 16 to 19 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(II) where the activities under investigation relate solely to members of the Defence Forces, an Officer of the Permanent Defence Force who holds an army rank not below that of colonel and is designated by the Minister for Defence for the purposes of this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is the section where an application for an authorisation can be made by the Garda Commissioner or an officer of the Permanent Defence Forces who holds an Army rank not below that of colonel and is so designated by the Minister for Defence for the purposes of this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment seeks to draw a distinction between the tapping of the telephone of a civilian citizen and the tapping of the telephone of somebody who is a member of the Defence Forces.  I accept that there are circumstances in which it <Col N="949" /> may be felt necessary to tap the telephone of a member of the Defence Forces.  In those circumstances I accept that it is appropriate that the application be made by a senior officer.  In this respect, I agree with amendment No. 5a tabled by Deputies Gay Mitchell, Browne and Harney, that perhaps it should be the Chief of Staff of the Army but that the route would be through the Defence Forces.  What I am seeking to protect here, which is not clear in the Bill, are circumstances in which, under the Bill as at present drafted, one could conceivably have a request for an authorisation being made by the Defence Forces in respect of a civilian.  I do not want to get into the very Irish &ldquo;coup&rdquo; type of circumstance in which one runs away with oneself imagining the Defence Forces doing all kinds of things but traditionally a very clear distinction has been drawn between where the remit of the Defence Forces in security matters ends and where the remit of the Garda begins.  When dealing with civilians that function must be confined to the Garda.  My amendment seeks to ensure that the application for an authorisation in the case of civilians is made through the Garda; that the application in the case of a member of the Defence Forces can be made through the Defence Forces but that one would protect against circumstances arising &mdash; as the Bill at present &mdash; in which an application in respect of a civilian could be made by the Defence Forces.  I do not think that would be appropriate.  I am sure it is not something the Defence Forces themselves would wish anyway.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Amendment No. 5a in the names of Deputies Gay Mitchell, Harney and myself is self-explanatory.  We should remember that section 6 (1) (a) reads:</P>
      <P>(1) An application for an authorisation&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  shall be made in writing&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  in case the authorisation is for the purpose of criminal investigation, by the Commissioner, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="950" /> (ii)  in the case the authorisation is the interests of the security of the State, either by&mdash;</P>
    <P>(I) the Commissioner, or</P>
    <P>(II) an officer of the Permanent Defence Force who holds an army rank not below that of colonel ...</P>
    <P>When it came to designating the Garda Commissioner there was no mention of a Garda officer above, say, the rank of superintendent, the senior officer of the Garda Síochána was designated.  Therefore, it is not helpful that the senior Army officer, the Chief of Staff, is not designated as the person responsible.  Without wasting anybody's time that change should be effected to balance matters.  If the Garda Commissioner is to be designated on one side then the Chief of Staff of the Army should be designated on the other.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with Deputy Browne's remarks.  We are talking about circumstances in which the security of the State is threatened or endangered.  Surely if the security of the State is threatened or endangered the Chief of Staff of the Army will be very much aware of that fact?  We spoke earlier about protecting individuals' privacy, ensuring that there are proper checks and balances.  If we are to be consistent I cannot see why, in relation to crime, we designate the Garda Commissioner but, when the security of the State is endangered an officer of lesser rank would be nominated by the Minister.  That is unacceptable and I do not understand its purpose.  In any event &ldquo;the nominated officer&rdquo; of the Minister for this purpose probably would always consult the Chief of Staff before adopting procedure for an authorisation under the provisions of this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of Deputy Gilmore's amendment will be to restrict the power of the Defence Forces to apply for an authorisation only in circumstances in which a member of the Defence Forces is under investigation; that is a matter relating to the security of the State.  His <Col N="951" /> amendment totally ignores the part played by the Defence Forces in preserving the security of the State.  It would also deviate from the present administrative procedures which have never caused a problem in that respect and which it is now intended to place on a statutory basis.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy is concerned about the Defence Forces continuing to perform their present functions in relation to authorisations when this Bill is enacted I hope I can ease his mind by making the following points.  First, the Defence Forces can apply for an authorisation only when the security of the State is at issue. Second, in practice, only one Army officer will have power to initiate an application.  He or she must submit it to the Minister for Defence who will have to recommend it in writing to the Minister for Justice before it can proceed.  Third, it must contain sufficient information, in accordance with the provisions of section 5, to enable the Minister for Justice to make a decision.  The House should remember that section 5 deals with conditions justifying interception in the interests of the security of the State. Fourth, &ldquo;the nominated officer&rdquo; has the duty to scrutinise it and seek any further information he deems necessary to enable him to make a submission to the Minister for Justice, that is the civil servant in the Department of Justice, who will pass on the submission to the Minister. The fifth and most important is the provision in section 8 under which the designated judge will have the power to keep the operations of the Act under review, of ascertaining whether its provisions are being complied with and of reporting to the Taoiseach.  Therefore, any authorisation under the Act will be made in the knowledge that it can come under the scrutiny of an independent judicial authority of high standing.  This is the surest guarantee that authorisations given under the Act will be proper authorisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Deputy Browne's amendment No. 5a the positions of the Garda Síochána and of the Defence <Col N="952" /> Forces in this respect are not comparable. There are many senior officers within the Garda Síochána who have responsibility for preventing or investigating crime in particular areas or for preventing or investigating particular types of crime. Similarly, in security matters operational responsibilities do not devolve on one officer alone.  It would be intolerable if all these officers could apply direct to the Minister for Justice for authorisations for interception.</P>
    <P>The position in the Defence Forces is different.  There is no need for applications to be channelled to the Chief of Staff as usually they would come from one source, namely, a senior military officer who would be designated by the Minister for Defence for the purposes of the Act.  That officer would, under section 6 (1) (c) have to submit any application to the Minister for Defence who would, in turn, have to make a recommendation in writing supporting the application.</P>
    <P>Deputies would agree, therefore, that there is no need for applications from the Defence Forces to come through the Chief of Staff.  It would add an unnecessary layer of repetition to the application process.  Also, as with all procedures in the Bill, the designated judge, with his power of investigation, will be in a position to ascertain whether the provisions of the Bill in this respect, as well as every other respect, are being complied with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not been greatly reassured by the Minister.  We are dealing here with the role of the Defence Forces, which is solely to preserve the security of the State.  The Minister has set out the procedure which will have to be followed by the Defence Forces: a military officer will be designated by the Minister for Defence and he will apply to the Minister for Defence who will in turn, apply to the Minister for Justice.  If the Defence Forces receive information &mdash; I am talking here about cases involving civilians &mdash; I cannot see why this information cannot be communicated to the Garda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the Minister of State is doing is giving the Defence Forces an independent <Col N="953" /> role which they do not have at present in relation to the policing of the civilian population.  It is my understanding that the role of the Defence Forces is to act in support of the Garda Síochána.  It is proposed in the Bill, however, that the Defence Forces should be able, independently, to seek authorisation to tap the telephone of a civilian. If there are grounds to justify this, I cannot understand the reason the request cannot be routed through the Garda Síochána and the officer of the Defence Forces requesting authorisation should not be confined to cases where a member of the Defence Forces is under investigation. I accept that cases may well arise where the security of the State is under threat.</P>
    <P>A clear distinction should be made in relation to the role that the Army has played in Irish life.  Their role has always been respected and clearly defined.  What the Minister of State is attempting to do here is create a dangerous precedent whereby the role of the Army will be extended to cover the policing of the civilian population.  This role should be the preserve of the Garda Síochána and it is important that this distinction be maintained.</P>
    <P>I accept, having regard to the role the Army plays in preserving the security of the State, that information will be made available to Army intelligence which would give rise to a request for authorisation to tap a telephone; but it is important that this be routed through the Garda Síochána and that there be co-operation between the Garda and the Army on these matters.  The Minister of State is creating a dangerous precedent whereby the Army are being given an independent role.</P>
    <P>I should also make the point that we are talking here about the security of the State.  What is interpreted as or constitutes the security of the State is a moveable feast.  During the course of a previous debate it was mentioned that an industrial dispute in the United Kingdom a few years ago was elevated by the then Government to a level where it was held to constitute a threat to the security of <Col N="954" /> the State.  Therefore, depending on the perception adopted by the powers that be at a given time, this can be a moveable feast.  Most of us interpret the security of the State as grappling with the problem of paramilitary activity on this island. While we have no difficulty with the idea that the resources of the Garda Síochána and the Army should be mobilised to deal with that problem, this must be done in a way that the respective roles of the Garda Síochána and the Army are maintained and the Army are not given an independent role in policing civilians.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Can the Minister of State outline to the House in simple language the reason the Chief of Staff will not be nominated, in view of the fact that the Garda Commissioner, who has Deputy Commissioners, Assistant Commissioners, Chief Superintendents and Superintendents beneath him, has been nominated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I suspect that the purpose in introducing these provisions is to assist Army intelligence and to give them an extra weapon in gathering intelligence, but can the Minister of State tell me what procedure will be followed?  We were told earlier that if the Army tap a telephone or intercept a postal packet and receive information, they will not be able to use this information.  What do they propose to do once they receive information?  Do they propose to go to the Garda Síochána?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, I do not see any logic in the Minister of State's argument in relation to the Chief of Staff.  If the security of the State was at risk the Chief of Staff of the Army would be aware of it and I assume that no nominated officer would seek authorisation without first discussing the matter with the Chief of Staff.  I do not accept the argument that because a number of members of the Garda Síochána are involved in the investigation of a crime one cannot have each of them applying for authorisation and that consequently this is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  I do not think this should be used as a reason to nominate <Col N="955" /> any officer above a certain rank in the Army.  I understand that it will have to be sought by an officer above the rank of Colonel.</P>
    <P>Deputy Browne made the point that it would be offensive to nominate an officer below the rank of Chief of Staff in the Army.  I do not think the Minister will be required to even discuss with the Chief of Staff who should be nominated.  The Chief of Staff does not seem to have any role.  In the case of the Garda Síochána only the Garda Commissioner may seek an authorisation.  Precedent would require the Minister to discuss with the Chief of Staff in an informal way which officer should be nominated, but there will be no requirement on the Minister to consult with the Chief of Staff.</P>

I will consult the Chief of Staff tomorrow and if he has no objection I will accept the Deputy's amendment.</P>

      <P>With your permission, Sir, I wish to share my time with Deputy Yates.</P>
      <P>Last night I explained that the limited number of Aer Lingus transatlantic flights from Shannon Airport has ensured its viability.  The Aer Lingus service ensures continuous employment there and the airport's viability in the winter months.  I was very supportive of Mr. Cahill's rescue plan and the conditions laid down to execute it but since we last debated the matter on 12 March 1993 I have met a number of employees of Aer Lingus, most of whom were very disappointed with the degree of consultation, who are not very satisfied.  I understand they received out of date information from the Government plan which was subsequently rejected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister, and all parties involved in the rescue efforts, to have consultations.  I hope the Minister, his Department, the management and workers of Aer Lingus will join to produce a rescue plan, otherwise we will run into huge difficulties later.  There seems to be an assumption that the Aer Lingus workers will accept massive redundancies because of the financial problems but I have not heard that at any meeting I attended.  At all meetings I was invited to attend the workers told me they did not want any redundancies. <Col N="958" /> Therefore, we are on a collision course if such proposals are made.  I know the Minister has had experience in the Department of Labour but I was disappointed to hear him say he was waiting until the plans were submitted to him.  He should be more involved.  If the motions tabled in Private Members' Time are to have any effect, the Minister will have to rid himself of the rigid attitude he has adopted to the problem, examine the problem again and accept the benefit of joint consultation with all parties.</P>

      <P>The situation facing Aer Lingus could not be more grave or serious.  I have very little sympathy for the Fianna Fáil and Labour Party Government that has to deal with this mess.  When I held the transport portfolio for my party one or two years ago the difficulties were clearly articulated to me by Mr. Cathal Mullan and Mr. Kyrl Acton who were screaming at the Government and Department officials about the crisis they were facing.  All they met from the former Ministers, Deputy Séamus Brennan and Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn was paralysis and inaction.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt the Labour Party have played politics with this issue which resulted in massive gains in seats, particularly on the north side of Dublin.  They are hoist on their own petard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My party believes very direct steps need to be taken in the short term.  First, revenue, and the yield, must be increased on the routes they fly at present.  There is no escape from the reality that Aer Lingus must become competitive.  One aspect which horrifies me is that at a time when Aer Lingus is experiencing record losses on air transport, Aer Rianta is making record profits of over £20 million per annum.  The Minister should arrange a reduction in airport charges.  Fine Gael supports the injection of equity into Aer Lingus.  The Government is the only shareholder.  We do not support the mealy-mouthed vague nature of what the Government states.  The taxpayers are entitled to know that the money they are investing in Aer Lingus will secure its long term future.  There will be no long <Col N="959" /> term future after this difficulty is overcome unless there is an aviation plan and a strategic blueprint for the development of the Aer Lingus group.  Having studied the matter at some length, there is no doubt that the way global aviation is going we are heading for an oligopoly of ten or 12 mega carriers.  What happened in the United States will happen in Europe.  The survival of the airline is very much in doubt.</P>
    <P>We should have a national airline and it should be retained in State control but we should not be the only airline in Europe that has not taken in outside participation. Irish Life, and other companies, consider the State shareholding to be a very dormant shareholding.  It is possible to tie up a strategic joint venture deal with Delta or some other airline in the future that will not only give equity capital to the company, which the taxpayer may not have, but also give it a network of contacts.</P>
    <P>We must also develop a hub.  Unless we do Ireland will be a secondary destination. We must try to take advantage of our pivotal position between East and West so that we could serve as a hub for a trans-Atlantic carrier from which there would be spokes to all points in Europe. If we fail to develop a hub we will simply be servicing Manchester, Paris or Heathrow and they will be the main hubs. As a result of deregulation in the United States there has been a shake out in relation to the carriers, it started out with attrition, then the carriers entered into mergers and consolidation and hubs and spokes were developed throughout America.  That is what will happen in Europe but it is very questionable whether we will develop a hub.</P>
    <P>We support the injection of equity but it must be part of a realistic framework within which Aer Lingus will operate. There is a clear blueprint and view that it has a place as part of a mega carrier with a direct hub and a strong aviation business.  I see no reason <i>per se</i> why taxpayers should be financing hotels in Britain as that does not provide a public service here.  The approach to the subsidiaries <Col N="960" /> must be strictly commercial and underline the interests of the aviation industry.</P>
    <P>This motion is timely and we support all aspects of it, apart from paragraph 3, and we will be opposing the Government amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been asked by my party Whip to ask the House to agree to my time being shared with Deputies Tony Killeen, Eoin Ryan, Sean Ryan, Roísín Shortall, Derek McDowell and Joe Costello and that gives Deputies some idea of how much time I have to speak.</P>
      <P>In the very limited time available I go along with the Government's amendment to the motion before the House. I would prefer a stronger amendment because I am concerned with the wording, &ldquo;when a viable and convincing strategy for the future of the company has been put in place&rdquo;.  I would prefer if this was stronger.  It would be stronger if the Government had taken a more active role in the rescue strategy that is in place.  The Government has committed itself to an injection of equity.  I emphasise that it was not just one side of the Government who did that but the Government as a whole.  Fianna Fáil has always been totally committed to Aer Lingus and an injection of equity is vitally important for the future of the company.</P>
      <P>In the strategy being worked out at present I would caution against wholesale privatisation.  When a company is in difficulty it should not become involved in sales because they may become fire sales rather than the sale of sections for a realistic value.  I would advise against fire sales.  I do not agree with Deputy Yates in that I believe the hotels are very important to the company.  The non-core business has been the backbone of the airline for many years in terms of achieving financial results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard much about cuts in recent months while Aer Lingus became a political football.  It is time to look at the other side of the equation in terms of revenue.  Cutbacks should not constantly be made.  There are marvellous people working in Aer Lingus who provide an <Col N="961" /> excellent service to the people.  Greater emphasis should be placed on consideration of the future of the company in terms of increased revenue.  As a member of the European Community there are limitations on the way we spend our money.  Every Minister, civil servant and semi-State official leaving the country should, by choice, use an Irish airline. I accept that the Government has to use the executive jet to get to meetings &mdash; I did so in my time in Government.  That is an essential service that will always be available.  Leaving aside EC regulations, why should we be the only good Europeans? An instruction should be given that every Minister, civil servant and semi-State official use Irish airlines.  We must preserve as well as create jobs and one way of doing so is by increasing the revenue of Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>I could go on at great length about the company, the workforce of 7,500, the need for an injection of equity and the service provided down the years, but my time is limited.  All the points I wish to make in relation to this matter are already on the record.  The Minister should be careful in the advice he accepts. It should be convincing not only to the mandarins of the Department of Finance and the Minister's advisers but also to the electorate and it should be viable not just in terms of pounds, shillings and pence but also in terms of a service to us as an island nation.  Let there not be constant cuts but rather let us concentrate on increasing revenue and the creation of jobs.</P>

      <P>Everybody agrees that changes must be made in Aer Lingus. The losses which occurred in the last few years cannot continue.  I hope we can bring the airline back to profit.  The Minister has been very consistent in his statements on this matter.  He has always said that a viable strategy should be put to the Cabinet and to this House.  The Commission has directed that a viable strategy must be set out before money is made available.  I do not understand why this debate is taking place this week.  This is a serious issue and I do not wish to be <Col N="962" /> frivolous but had we waited for the plan we could have had a meaningful debate on it.</P>

      <P>Aer Lingus was established under Fianna Fáil and we are committed to the company.  Some people give the impression that we are not so committed or that we do not care about the company but nothing could be further from the truth.  There is a commitment on this side to Aer Lingus and that has always been the case.  We helped the company in the eighties when it was in trouble and we will continue to help it. However we have a responsibility to the taxpayer, and a viable strategy must be in place before public money is made available for Aer Lingus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The criticism has been made that we have not developed Aer Lingus and the aviation business.  Since 1987 various Governments in which Fianna Fáil have been involved have developed regional airports.  As the Minister said, the number of people visiting the country increased to almost three million in 1991, an increase of more than 50 per cent since 1987; more than 23,000 jobs were created in tourism between 1987 and 1991; increased income generated in the tourism and air transport sector amounted to more than £500 million since 1987; travel <Col N="963" /> by business travellers has increased by almost 50 per cent since 1985 and at least 3,000 direct jobs have been created by the participants in the air transport and related industries since 1987.  Since 1987 Fianna Fáil has created the economic atmosphere for Aer Lingus to increase the number of people coming here, which is essential.</P>
    <P>Many new companies have been set up such as PWA, Airmotive, TEAM Aer Lingus and Shannon Aerospace. Together with Deputies from all sides of the House I visited TEAM Aer Lingus last year and everybody was amazed at the huge success of that project.  It has great potential for development, dealing as it does with companies such as Virgin Airlines, Federal Express, Tower Air, British Airways, Syrian Air and, of course, Aer Lingus.  The IDA should examine innovative ways of developing TEAM Aer Lingus and Shannon Aerospace because there is great potential for their future development.  Ireland is very well placed to service aircraft and that sector of the business should be developed.  I hope the IDA and the Government will consider such development. I agree with Deputy Yates that Ireland needs a hub airport.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil set up and nurtured Aer Lingus but some people give the impression that we do not care about the company now.  All we insist on is a decent plan to indicate that any equity which we put in is not lost in current spending.  That <Col N="964" /> is not a lot to ask, as an obligation on behalf of the taxpayer.</P>

      <P>There is widespread agreement on the value of Aer Lingus to an island economy in terms of tourism, jobs, industry and access generally.  The Minister is right to insist that the viability plan for the airline be in place before the Government makes its decision on the level of funding. That is the only sensible option and it is a requirement of the European Community in this instance.</P>
      <P>The fact that the Shannon red herring was trawled through the debate on numerous occasions reflects no credit on the previous Aer Lingus management. I understand that politicians in certain sensitive areas might feel obliged, because of their regional bias, to mention the issue, but any independent assessment carried out has come down very strongly against the argument that Shannon has done damage&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Thank you, Deputy and I strongly agree with what Deputy Carey said last night.  That was a most welcome statement from the Deputy.  It is possible for Aer Lingus to come up with a viable plan and it will be possible for the Minister and the Government to support that <Col N="965" /> plan.  The Minister's position is in perfect accord with his strategy in this matter.  I have every confidence that the future of Aer Lingus will be assured.  It is in our interests in terms of an island economy, that we have a viable national airline.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to restate the position of the Labour Party on Aer Lingus.  This debate is perhaps five to six weeks premature. Last October I gave an undertaking that the Labour Party would stand by Aer Lingus.  That is still our position.  Our commitment will be honoured in the context of a plan agreed by the management and the workforce and copperfastened by the Government in the form of the necessary equity.</P>
      <P>It is important to have an aviation policy.  The provision of £150 million for equity in the company may not resolve the problem for Aer Lingus unless it is coupled with an aviation policy.  I welcome the policy outlined by the Minister last night but it must be fleshed out.  Will the company have the commercial freedom to compete in the open skies market?  That is very important.</P>
      <P>There was a brief reference to the Shannon stopover.  The Government have stated their position on that.  If the Shannon stopover is to be retained, the cost to the company can be quantified.  If the Government of the day decides to retain the stopover it is incumbent on it to pay a subsidy to Aer Lingus.</P>

      <P>I fully support the Government and I accept the commitment to equity, but I have slight reservations about the phrase &ldquo;subject to constraints on the national finances&rdquo;. <Col N="966" /> Can anyone tell me of any Minister for Finance who has not put on the &ldquo;poor mouth&rdquo; approach?  In the mid eighties over £100 million was found to bail out ICI and it is conservatively estimated that the recent currency crisis could cost the State in the region of £450 million.  The State is obliged to meet these costs.  In view of this it is unfair to subject the provision of equity to a company whose return to the State in terms of tourism, trade and employment is remarkable, to the same criteria.  The Minister should look at that.</P>
      <P>I can appreciate the deep concern and worry of the staff of Aer Lingus, particularly when they do not know the terms of reference of the executive chairman, Mr. Cahill.  It has been suggested that he will cut jobs.  A job shedding exercise will not be acceptable to me or to the Labour Party.  Given that we have a final opportunity to produce a plan to secure the future viability of the company, I now appeal to the Government, to management and to staff to grasp this opportunity. We have to ensure that there is confidence which will enable everyone working in Aer Lingus to have an input into this rescue plan.</P>
      <P>The company should not be privatised. The necessary equity should be injected, and there should not be involuntary job losses.</P>

      <P>Across North Dublin city and county the livelihoods of thousands of men, women and children depend directly or indirectly on the well being of Aer Lingus.  The total wage bill of the company in 1992 came to no less than £172 million.  Taxation amounted to £63 <Col N="967" /> million.  That is only £5 million short of the entire State investment in Aer Lingus since its foundation, 56 years ago.  In addition, Aer Lingus spent £90 million on goods and services, excluding expenditure on fuel and over £30 million on payments to Aer Rianta and the Government in relation to landing charges and so on.  The State is committed to Aer Lingus.  Mr. Cahill was appointed a few weeks ago to a very onerous job.  He must be given the time to produce the analysis and the plan which will ensure the company's viability and the maintenance of every possible job.</P>
      <P>He can adopt a bookkeeping approach or he can take into account the wider picture, recognising that airlines worldwide are going through a period of intense difficulty, but that all is not as gloomy as it first appeared, that the tangible and intangible benefits to the nation of a healthy Aer Lingus are vast, that it interacts with many facets of the economy such as the obvious commitment of the Government to the growth of the tourism industry, and to the development of indigenous industry in general.  I hope this is the approach Mr. Cahill will take. I call on the Minister to insist that Mr. Cahill takes this broad approach to solving the problems of Aer Lingus.</P>
      <P>Lest there be any doubt about the Labour Party's commitment on the question of equity, I will place on the record the remarks that the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring made last weekend at the Labour Party Conference in Waterford.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to repeat the two-fold nature of the commitment we made last November &mdash; which we repeated three weeks ago in this House and which the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, repeated publicly on national television last Saturday &mdash; that in the first instance we will not privatise the core airline business of Aer Lingus and, second, that we will provide significant and sufficient equity to the company.  I heard Deputy Burke say earlier that this is not a good time to privatise Aer Lingus.  There is never a good time to privatise major public companies; that has always been the position of my party.  We believe we should not accept private equity into Aer Lingus for the reason that the importance of Aer Lingus extends beyond the thousands of jobs in north Dublin, Clare and Cork.  It has a strategic importance in the economy as a whole in dealing with industry and tourism.  As Deputy Killeen said &mdash; and I am sure Deputy Carey too &mdash; it is important in terms of the effect in the Shannon and mid-west regions. These are things that are above and beyond the profit motive.  If we accept private equity into Aer Lingus effectively we are changing the ethos of the company. Companies or institutions who put equity into companies do so for the reason that they want to take profit from them.  We could not expect them to do it for any other reason.  Our interests, and those of the Minister, must go beyond that.  The national interests of the Irish people are of paramount importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be useful if the Minister were <Col N="970" /> now to give some indication of the amount of equity to be invested but I understand perfectly his reasons for not doing that.  Clearly, whatever equity is provided will have to be sufficient.  There is no point in our coming back in two years time seeking extra money because, as we understand it, the European Commission would not allow us to do so.  If we were to put money into Aer Lingus now which, in two or three years time was to prove insufficient, apart from anything else, that would be a wholesale waste of taxpayers' money.</P>
    <P>There is a process underway at present in Aer Lingus which involves three parties &mdash; management, the unions' representatives of the workers and Government.  I welcome the statement by the union representatives in recent days that they fully appreciate the need for change in Aer Lingus and I fully appreciate what the Minister said last evening and on previous occasions.  I have every confidence in the Minister and that the Government will not be found wanting when it comes to playing its part in any viability plan which is put together.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Aer Lingus is the standard bearer of the semi-State sector. Having started from very humble beginnings we see it now as the jewel in the crown.  It is now an international carrier with all types of ancillary services being provided by a very large and dedicated workforce both in Ireland and abroad and it has been central to the expansion of the tourism industry.  We got all that with a minimum of State equity and a maximum return, not to mention the tax revenue to the Exchequer from the workforce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present situation arose for a number of reasons, first, an act of God, the Iraqi war, and the recession, and, second, lack of planning by the previous Government.  Both partners in that Government are to blame.  The Progressive Democrats cannot wash their hands of this matter.  Because of deregulation imposed by the EC they should have taken that in hand.  Due to the lethargy and inertia of the previous <Col N="971" /> Government, the Progressive Democrats&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Labour Party has always been opposed to privatisation even though that was the only solution the previous Government could come up with at the end of 1992 when the crisis arose.  Our commitment to Aer Lingus has been to streamline a good semi-State industry and not to privatise it.</P>
      <P>Since the election, we made the categoric statement that we were standing by Aer Lingus.  We did so as recently as 11 March in a day long debate here where the position was again stated by Labour Party Deputies and by our Fianna Fáil partners.  On 3 April last we had a categoric statement from the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, in relation to significant equity and on 4 April, we had a full scale debate at the Labour Party conference.  We are not running away from anything, we are allowing it to be debated at every possible opportunity.  I am disappointed that the Democratic Left should see fit, when we have set the procedures moving to introduce this motion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>At the outset, it is time to congratulate the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Cowen, who is back in a minority Government, in view of some of the speeches I have listened to from Labour Party Deputies this evening.  It is also significant that the Labour Party Deputies have abandoned the Minister on the Government side of the House while they sit in what we know to effectively be the Opposition benches. Labour Party Deputies are struggling with a simple question here tonight.  They have the choice of voting on this Bill at 8.30 p.m. and they will be voting for the policy that the Minister states exists and which some Labour Deputies claim does not exist.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's party, should have supported Aer Lingus in this House in 1988 when it was in a healthy position, at least on paper.  That time there were moves afoot to find a partnership for the development of that airline. Labour Party Deputies howled down such proposed developments day <Col N="974" /> in day out and now they have reaped the whirlwind for the attitude they adopted while we tried desperately to seek some solutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The deregulation of the airline industry inevitably meant that substantial changes would have to be made by Aer Lingus and all other airlines. Clearly, no adequate response was taken by Aer Lingus, and the luxury of profits from ancillary activities was used to submerge the true health of its core airline business.  This is the reality and we have to decide here over the next number of weeks whether we are fighting to save an airline industry or some hotels outside this country.  In my view we must save the core airline business.</P>
      <P>I want to be unequivocal in stating that I believe Aer Lngus has an important future in the aviation industry.  It is absolutely essential for the economic welfare of this country that Aer Lingus be restored to viability and health.  But it must also be a commercial and efficient operation which can survive in the fiercely competitive, international open-skies era of air travel which now obtains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To regard Aer Lingus as an operating airline similar to much larger mega airlines like British Airways or Lufthansa showed a clear lack of reality and flawed judgment by those who managed the company.  Management should long ago have sought to get the scale of its operations, overheads and manning levels down to the appropriate level of the medium sized but very important airline that Aer Lingus is.  Instead it was obvious that certain management people indulged in virtual empire building.  Take 1991 for instance, when the financial problems of the airline were already clearly apparent.  That was the year of the Gulf War and the worldwide downturn in the aviation industry.  However, whereas other airlines were battening down the hatches and retrenching, Are Lingus in that year recruited an extra 1,370 workers, which saw its wages bill soar by <Col N="975" /> over £40 million and in that year too they spent a further £170 million buying new aircraft.</P>
    <P>The company simply cannot continue without major readjustments nor can it continue to accumulate losses of up to £100 million a year and sustain the burden of accumulated losses of over £500 million.  That is why the formulation of our comprehensive national aviation policy is of such importance.  But it must be a policy that strikes a fair balance in the interests of all regions in the country and it must also take into account the role of various agencies like Aer Rianta, Bord Fáilte, the regional airports, SFADCo etc.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta's role must be part of the national aviation stratgey.  I was somewhat dissappointed by the Minister's outline of what he termed the national aviation strategy and that no reference was made to Aer Rianta's important role in that regard.  There is no point in Aer Rianta being an extremely profitable company while Aer Lingus, its main user and contributor to those profits, is sustaining such huge losses.  The cost structures that Aer Rianta imposes on all airlines using Irish airports will have to be considered in the context of an overall review.  The number of incoming passengers to Ireland must be increased.  The cost of access to Ireland is a crucial factor in the wellbeing of our tourism industry as well as the development of our business sectors in general.  Therefore, Aer Rianta must be taken into account in the formulation of a comprehensive national aviation policy.</P>
    <P>Another aspect which the Minister did not take into account yesterday was the development of our regional airports.  As the Minister is aware, large allocations of Structural Funds have been poured into those airports and money has been raised also by ordinary citizens to support regional airports.  We now have some fine regional airports strategically located throughout the country.  Yet, it seems that, having built those important assets, no policy to develop those airports has <Col N="976" /> emerged from the Minister's Department.</P>
    <P>This is a disgraceful and inadequate response to those regional airports.  The suggestion by the Irish Airline Pilots Association that a separate and autonomous division should be developed within Aer Lingus to deal with the regional airports should be carefully examined.  I am not convinced it is the way forward but I believe it is something that should be considered in the context of maximising our national assets.</P>
    <P>I want to make the point that only this week we saw in my area a new departure in Waterford Regional Airport with the commencment of flights by Manx Airlines from Waterford to Stansted and hopefully there will be further developments with a service from Waterford to Manchester.  I sincerely hope that Aer Lingus is not once again going to see those developments as a threat to its existence.  Those developments are surely complementary and should be seen as such and a vital development for both our aviation and tourism industries.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not refer in his speech last night to the freight side of the airline business, which is a very important part of the aviation business.  It seems that, with the disappearance of customs clearance posts within the EC, a great opportunity exists to develop a major clearing centre for freight into Europe from various parts of the world.  Dublin is ideally placed to exploit this opportunity and would have the capacity for a substantial operation in this area.  I realise that poses other questions down the line because of the way most major international carriers split passenger and freight carrying over long haul distances, particularly in 747s as they travel around the world.  It raises the question of other regional policy issues here.  The issue of regional policy over national policy must also be considered in the context of developing a type of hub in the freight industry, which we have disgracefully failed to do.  The result is that we have seen Manchester blossom to the detriment of Dublin in the passenger end of business over the past number of years.  This is something I <Col N="977" /> regret and, indeed, hope will never occur in the context of the possibilities that exist in the freight industry.</P>

      <P>This is a very difficult and worrying time for the 7,000 staff in Aer Lingus and their families.  Given the appalling level of unemployment in our society, it is only reasonable that everyone working in Aer Lingus looks with the greatest trepidation at the prospect of job losses in the company.</P>
      <P>I stated when I spoke to the Aer Lingus staff at a mass meeting in Dublin Airport some weeks ago that the Government must put equity into Aer Lingus.  That is a fundamental need.  Secondly, they must seek to maximise the number of secure jobs that can be sustained so that the airline can be commercially successful and viable.  Thirdly, and most importantly, the staff through their union representatives must be allowed participate fully in the formulation of new structures and plans for Aer Lingus and the aviation industry.</P>

      <P>I agree with my colleague, Deputy Cullen, and all the other speakers who have contributed to this debate, that the national airline represents a major strategic asset.  In that regard there is one common point in the contributions from Deputies.</P>
      <P>I read with care the Minister's contribution to this debate.  There are certainly many points which one can criticise but for the Minister to give his objectives of transport and aviation policy as the equivalent of a policy itself stops short of the mark.  However, the Minister is taking the right approach.  We must be careful with the issue of Aer Lingus.  We will have one opportunity to address this problem and we must avail of it.  I am glad the Minister is exercising caution and discretion in terms of defining what that opportunity should be.  We will not get this opportunity again.  Whatever happens in terms of equity investment will happen only once.  The Minister is correct to address this problem with care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many problems in Aer Lingus that people have highlighted and one problem concerns basic commercial decision-making by the management of that company.  It is significant and fundamental <Col N="979" /> to any long term reform that events are taking place at management level which will hopefully have a greater commercial effect on the overall outcome.</P>
    <P>A number of points made in relation to policies that have been pursued are worth addressing.  A very significant national economic element addressed by the Minister last night was that visitor numbers in the four years up to the end of 1991 increased by almost 50 per cent. Why was that the case?  That was partly and, perhaps, even substantially, the case because access transport costs to visit this country reduced dramatically.  Any aviation policy in the past that contributed to the reduction of access transport costs contributed significantly to the development of tourism here.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies' contributions last night surprised me.  They raised questions about having low access transport costs here.  It is good for the consumer, for Irish business people, for Irish tourism and, ultimately, what is good for Aer Lingus must fit broadly within that context.</P>

      <P>If we had British Airway's accounts at the moment we would be doing well and would not be having this debate tonight.  The difficulty has been that pricing policy was decided by the airline's management and not by the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is right to give a degree of commercial freedom to State bodies.  It is contained in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> it is what the social partners agreed to, it is part of the process of encouraging commercialism within those bodies.  In <Col N="980" /> regard to that pricing policy, if we take, for example, Ryanair, which injected competition into the area &mdash; and I support and defend the achievement brought about by that &mdash; they were offering, on the London route, a Ford, in terms of quality, while Aer Lingus on the same route was offering a BMW but charging the price of a Ford for the same service. It was on that aspect that they began to have difficulties.</P>
      <P>In terms of their investment in new fleet east bound, and in terms of fifth freedom, picking up in European airports and moving on elsewhere, that has not proved to be a commercial success.  I do not know why that is the case but it is the case that they have been doing worse having followed that commercial policy than they were beforehand.  Whether it is as a result of a market failure in selling the service I am not sure.</P>
      <P>Points have been raised here regarding Shannon.  I have been interested to see the tip-toeing that has been done by some Deputies.  Some Deputies from this side of the House last night raised the question of the implications of the Shannon stop-over but seemed to stop short of saying that they wanted the Government to reverse that policy.  The Government's explanation regarding the Shannon stopover has been unhelpful in terms of Aer Lingus problems.  It may be one problem but the substantial problems of Aer Lingus would not be resolved if the policy were to be changed.  To give an example, one could fly directly to Brussels from the United States in the same way that people fly directly to Dublin.  Yet half of those people who arrive in Brussels from the United States have come through Frankfurt or London, just as people who arrive here have come through London or elsewhere.  This happens because of the airline pricing policies and the hubs and spokes that operate in other jurisdictions, particularly in north America. We must get that into perspective.  I will conclude on that point because I am sharing my time with other colleagues.  I know Deputy Deenihan and Deputy Gregory want to contribute to this debate.</P>

Far from being unwelcome, people in the workforce who can survive should welcome it.</P>
      <P>The core activity of Aer Lingus needs to be protected.  This is the key strategic asset which has been referred to by many people.  If ancillary elements exist that can contribute to the protection of that core &mdash; I do not know whether the assessment of that will be positive or negative &mdash; we should have an open mind in this House about any measure which protects the core activity.  In the end we must defend low access transport costs for Irish business, Irish industry, Irish services and for the development of Irish tourism. Anyone who says to the contrary is very wide of the mark if that is the way they suggest we save Aer Lingus or develop tourism policy in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>As Fine Gael's spokesperson for tourism I wish again to state the important part played by Aer Lingus in the promotion of tourism here. This debate cannot be taken in isolation. Aer Lingus and tourism are inextricably linked and when we consider the problems of Aer Lingus we must analyse the major contribution that it makes to tourism. I am glad several Deputies mentioned that because the survival of Aer Lingus is crucial to existing and future expansion plans for our tourism industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I read a comment last week in the <i>Irish Independent</i> by the Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy McCreevy, in which he said that Ireland must become the most dynamic country in Europe as regards tourism by the end of this century. <Col N="982" /> I agree with him but unless we have a strong national airline carrier we cannot realise that objective.  That is why it is so important that Aer Lingus is preserved in a healthy financial position.  Otherwise it will not survive.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of access.  At present Aer Lingus is the key provider of access to Ireland from all major markets.  Indeed, access transport is one of the key factors which determines the success of a country's tourism industry. Tourists must be able to travel here quickly and at competitive fares from our main markets.  As mentioned by previous Deputies Aer Lingus brought over 1.26 million visitors to Ireland in the 1991-92 season.  This represents a third of all tourists who choose to fly into Ireland from abroad.  Indeed, the name Aer Lingus is synomymous with Ireland and Irish tourism throughout the world.  It is the main flagship for Irish tourism and a major contributor to the growth and success of Irish tourism through its overseas marketing and promotion.  As Deputies are aware, Bord Fáilte's budget has been cut by approximately £15 million since 1985 and it is now up to Aer Lingus to do much of the vital overseas marketing for us.  Aer Lingus employs approximately 400 sales and marketing personnel who are dedicated to attracting business from abroad.  If that number is cut or diminished in any way it will reduce our tourism marketing effectiveness abroad.  Aer Lingus is an important partner of Bord Fáilte in regard to advertising overseas.  For example, this year Aer Lingus will contribute 20 per cent of the £1.6 million spent on the main tourism advertising campaign by Bord Fáilte on mainland Europe.</P>
    <P>It is also worth noting that in addition to the expenditure on tourism promotion, Aer Lingus provides significant assistance to the tourism industry through flights for overseas travel agents, tour operators and conference and convention organisers to cover attendance at Bord Fáilte workshops in Ireland and inspection visits to this country.  This applies also to press, television and other media <Col N="983" /> personnel from abroad for public relations programmes.  Most importantly, every year Aer Lingus provides free flights for several hoteliers, car hire people and cruising and self-catering marketing personnel on sales visits to overseas markets.  This support is worth in excess of £1 million per annum to the tourism trade and the present level of tourism promotion by many individual operators could not take place without this support.  Many hotel operators in my county and others engaged in tourism could not afford to go overseas to promote Ireland if they did not get assistance from Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>It is blatantly obvious that Aer Lingus is in serious financial trouble.  Since 1986 net borrowings have increased from £28 million to £494 million in 1992 and operating profits no longer cover interest payment.  The heavy losses in air transport now exceed the profits of the company's other business divisions. However, it is worth noting that Aer Lingus has spent over £500 million &mdash; almost as much as it owes at present &mdash; on 28 aircraft since 1987.  Such investment must be taken into consideration.  It is vital that the Boeing 747 aircraft be relaced by the mid-nineties if the company is to continue to serve the vital North American market. The current state of the airline's finances will not permit further investment and this will have drastic implications, especially for the North American market.</P>
    <P>To their credit, the workers of Aer Lingus have already accepted cost reduction measures such as deferment of salary increments in 1991, rescheduling of payments under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and reduction in overtime levels.  They have made sacrifices already and in any future plans for the company I would appeal to the Minister to ensure that they do not have to make any further sacrifices and that as many jobs as possible are preserved. It is vital for the people of Ireland that Aer Lingus is saved.  We must preserve the 7,500 jobs, but we must consider <Col N="984" /> also the 87,000 jobs in industry and the projected 25,000 we are trying to create.  Aer Lingus will play a vital role in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put on record my support for the motion put down by Democratic Left Deputies.  I regard the Labour-Fianna Fáil Government amendment as totally inadequate.  It tells us nothing of the Government's specific intentions regarding Aer Lingus.  It is more or less the same as the amendment tabled by the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat Government on 27 October 1992 when Deputy Spring of the Labour Party, then in Opposition, proposed a motion similar to that in the names of Democratic Left Deputies.  It is as if this is a game with no real commitment to Aer Lingus or to the thousands of workers whose livelihoods depend either directly or indirectly on the airline.  I am genuinely amazed that the Labour Party cannot bring itself to support this motion. Instead, it appears it intends to vote for a meaningless amendment which those who were in the last Dáil voted against in October 1992.</P>
      <P>At the weekend I listened to the Tánaiste and Leader of the Labour Party and many other members of that party again pledge their support to Aer Lingus and to that magic word &ldquo;equity&rdquo;.  I hope they intend to honour their commitments because the Labour Party's record in Government, as far as adhering to its pre-election promises is concerned, is not good.  Three of the priority commitments it gave in regard to social welfare, health and Aer Lingus have still not been delivered or honoured.  We are continually told that the welfare cuts will go but more than half of them are still in operation.</P>

      <P>We are continually told that the welfare cuts will go, but more than half of them are still in operation, just as we are repeatedly told that Aer Lingus will get equity.  There is no indication as to how much, how little or when the Government intends to give that equity or, indeed, what price in terms of redundancies, job losses and privatisation this Labour-Fianna Fáil Government will demand in return for equity. Although the Labour Party did not stipulate such conditions prior to the election, the commitment to provide equity is continually referred to as being subject to constraints on the public finances and our wider responsibility to the taxpayer. There is no mention of equity in the Government amendments.  There is reference to sufficient support for Aer Lingus only when a viable and convincing strategy for the future of the company is put in place.  Nobody seems to be able to answer the question posed by the trade unions representing Aer Lingus workers. How can a strategy be put in place in the absence of any specific indication as to the amount of equity that will be available? How can a strategy be put in place when the Government instructs the airline to continue with the Shannon stopover even when the best advice available to it is that the Shannon stopover&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, let me reiterate the acknowledgement and appreciation of the successes of Aer Lingus, over its relatively long and proud history, which my Government Ministerial colleague, Deputy Brian Cowen, expressed in this House, last night.</P>
      <P>The airline business is a high risk and complex business.  It is also an extremely important people business.  Much of Aer Lingus's success is due to the calibre of the people, who have worked and still are working in the company.  Aer Lingus's success since its foundation would not have been possible without the commitment, dedication and loyalty of its employees.</P>
      <P>Aer Lingus staff in the past have faced up to major problems in their company and have helped to solve them.  We have no doubt that the present staff will rise to the challenges posed by the current difficulties.</P>
      <P>Our Government is committed to seeing Aer Lingus survive and prosper. As the Minister, Deputy Cowen has pointed out on a number of occasions in this House, the environment in which the airline operates has changed irrevocably.</P>
      <P>The deregulation and liberalisation of air services internationally has increased competition in the industry to levels not seen before.  Aer Lingus must become a highly efficient and competitive organisation in order to underpin its immediate future and long term development.  This is the only way to protect long term employment in the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is committed to ensuring the commercial future of Aer Lingus as part of its overall transport policy.  This has been stated again by the Taoiseach and other members of the Government.  It is enshrined in the Programme for a Partnership Government. <Col N="987" /> Let there be no doubt, therefore, about the Government's commitment to Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>Commercial viability is a prerequisite for EC sanction, for any Government support for Aer Lingus.  The European Commission will only approve any equity investment on the firm and clear understanding that it is for a necessary once-off restructuring of Aer Lingus in order to ensure a return to sustained commercial viability.</P>
    <P>There have been various references during this debate to internal appointments in Aer Lingus.  As the Minister, Deputy Cowen pointed out last night, he has no function in the matter of management appointments.  These are a matter for the board of the company, on which there are four worker directors.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowen in his statement last night dealt with the spurious and malicious claims that the Government has no air transport policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the Minister's colleagues said the same tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>He did not.  The Government's policy is clearly evident in the measures which it has consistently taken to strengthen the Irish presence on international air routes, to develop our State and regional airports, to provide the latest high technology radar and communications equipment &mdash; the development of Ireland as a &ldquo;Centre of Excellence in Aviation&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Everybody agrees that Aer Lingus is facing very significant financial difficulties. There is no need, however, to be alarmist.  This company has faced difficulties before.  With the same determination, imagination and flexibility that both the company and its employees have shown in the past in overcoming those difficulties, we are confident that the present difficulties can and will be overcome with, I want to assure this House, full Government support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was suggested last night that the Government is hoping that the executive chairman will present so drastic a plan <Col N="988" /> that the Government will be able to &ldquo;bow out&rdquo; of providing equity.  That is pure fantasy.  Deputy Cowen has made the position perfectly clear.  Subject to the constraints on the national finances &mdash; and it is unrealistic to suggest that these can be ignored &mdash; the Government will provide sufficient support for Aer Lingus once a viable and convincing strategy for the future has been put in place.  I commend the amendment to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Deputies who have contributed to this important debate.  I must say I regret the fact that it has been largely a ritual exercise because of our inability to move the Government one whit past the position previously expressed in the House.</P>
      <P>I see little point in going back over the history of Aer Lingus, the statistics with which we have been regaled, the number of passengers carried by the airline, the importance of the airline to the economy and the lump in the throat we all get as images of the shamrock in some far flung outpost of the world are conjured up and how proud this makes us.  I do not think this is of any material interest to the workers or management in Aer Lingus. They have known the facts for a very long time and they have been trying to bring those facts to bear on the Government, who has responsibility for the national airline.  Having looked at the Government amendment, they like us, have failed to impress on the Government the need for it to face up to its responsibility. There is little point in all of the talk in which Deputy Costello engaged about how Aer Lingus is the jewel in the crown, how tears come to our eyes when we see the shamrock flown on the tail of an Aer Lingus aircraft&mdash;&mdash;</P>

First, he delivered in no uncertain terms remarks which were designed to chastise the unions and to make it clear to them, in a most extraordinary sentence, that the amount of equity which was likely to be provided for the national airline would be in direct proportion to how mannerly he perceives the conduct of the trade unions to be.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that Deputy Cox has left the House.  He will have to appreciate, when he praises the Minister's caution, that this House and the national airlne were in business before he became a Member of this House.  There is no particular need for caution.  The Government has been seized of this problem for more than two years.  That is the real genesis of the crisis we are now in. Talking about exercising caution, I am afraid Deputy Cox has missed out in which Parliament he is in.  All sides of the debate now concede that the inaction of two previous Ministers, Deputy Séamus Brennan and the Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, has greatly exacerbated the crisis and contributed to the scale of the crisis confronting both the workers and management.  Despite urgent pleas from the Aer Lingus management, especially in 1991 and 1992, both Ministers contrived to avoid their responsibilities in the matter.</P>

      <P>The full extent of the opportunities lost has not yet been revealed. The Minister, Deputy Cowen came into the House and blithely threw up his hands and said that the conditions for injecting equity now are different from what they were during the past two years. That is precisely my point.  Why did neither of the Minister's predecessors act during the previous two years?</P>
      <P>The price of dithering on the question of the Shannon stopover has been a costly one in terms of the future of Aer Lingus. I am surprised at Deputy Cox's remarks on this issue.  I can assure the House that if the Progressive Democrats' Party had their headquarters anywhere but Limerick it would have a different view on the free market and the operation of competitive forces as it affects the Shannon stopover.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The longer it took to make a decision on Shannon, the more ground was lost to Dublin and the more progress Manchester made in developing the kind of international hub to which Deputy Cox referred.  Hit by the worst recession in the international air transport business in the past 50 years, the impact of the Gulf War and spiralling interest rates necessitated by the urgent purchase of new aircraft, successive Ministers with responsibility for transport have refused to act.  Now the Minister, Deputy Cowen has entered, conducting himself like the Bart Simpson of this Government. What did he say in regard to the position?  The Minister only eroded further the morale at Aer Lingus by making scapegoats of individual managers and by giving an Ian McGregor style mandate to Mr. Bernie Cahill who had presided as chairman through the worst period of decline in the history of Aer Lingus.  There was no evidence of any major conflict of policy between Mr. Cathal Mullen, heading the management, and the board, headed by Mr. Cahill.  However, in a move that defied logic Mr. Mullen became disemployed and Mr. Cahill became chief executive.  The man whom a significant portion of the Government viewed as part of the problem in Greencore is considered to be part of the solution in Aer Lingus. Admittedly, Deputy Cowen has back-tracked on his outrageous conference of what he termed &ldquo;absolute discretion&rdquo; in regard to Mr. Cahill.  He continues, nonetheless, to ensure that he himself is not involved in any overt participation in the decisions that have to be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is nothing short of disgraceful, after seeing the damage done by the inaction of the new Minister's two predecessors, that he should withdraw to the sidelines and wash his hands of the biggest challenge to confront his ministry.  Judging from the tone of the Minister's speech last night, he seems intent on remaining on the sidelines, from where he will issue occasional threats to the unions and management to get on with the task.  The crisis at Aer Lingus is so grave in the <Col N="993" /> context of jobs, strategic considerations, tourism growth and benefits from the planned expansion to the end of the decade, it is scandalous and unthinkable that the responsible Minister should cop out of its resolution.  Ministers with responsibility for labour issues have fallen over themselves down through the years in claiming credit for the resolution of disputes that pale into insignificance by comparison to what is at risk in Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>It is irrational for the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to remain aloof from the resolution of the crisis and at the same time to make heavily qualified undertakings about equity support in the context of an agreed plan.  Surely the shareholder is central to the emergence of such a plan?  How does the Minister purport to address a position whereby there is indeed an agreed plan, a plan worked out between the unions and the management, that is predicated on a certain level of equity injection? Does the Minister purport to concede the target that is part of the plan or to allow the plan to fall apart when he cannot meet the target?  Either proposition is absurd.  The only sensible way forward is for the Minister to participate in the negotiations with the unions and management towards the evolution of that agreed plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The crisis will not be resolved by the Minister stepping aside. If the Minister is relying on negotiating with the unions through Mr. Cahill, it is a recipe for disaster.  Having regard to the threat that confronts Aer Lingus, the Minister could be faced with the biggest scandal confronting the Irish economy in many years, a scandal concerning 14,000 jobs, more than 7,000 of which are here. Such a scandal could well be termed &ldquo;Cowengate&rdquo;, if the Minister keeps his distance from the issue.  I warn the Minister now, in time that he might have an opportunity to avoid &ldquo;Cowengate&rdquo; afflicting Aer Lingus and all its employees.</P>

      <P>I say this with no disrespect to the Minister, the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications is not all that significant in the scale of things, but the crisis affecting Aer Lingus and the level of its importance in the economy should be the priority of the Minister.  He should concern himself directly with the resolution of that crisis. If nothing else came out of this debate, if the Minister were to agree to try to resolve the crisis, I would be a great deal more optimistic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened carefully to the contribution by Deputy Derek McDowell, who uses words carefully.  He said that while the Labour Party was in Government there <Col N="995" /> would be no privatisation of the core business.  I think Deputy Gregory also referred to this point.  The meaning of what was said is crystal clear, it means that the rest of the business will be sold. That is amazing in the context of the view of all commentators, which is that in present circumstances it would amount to a fire sale.  It is regrettable if that concept has been given the nod by the Labour Party in Government.  I say to my friends and colleagues in the Labour Party that to have a hang-up about privatisation in the sense that it is being trotted out here, as meaning that the soul of the Labour Party is intact and that there will be no privatisation of Aer Lingus, is almost meaningless in the context of the scale of the problems affecting Aer Lingus and modern world aviation conditions.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Financial Times</i> reported on Monday last that the four airlines KLM, Swissair, Austrian Airlines and SAS are talking about linking up.  If the significance of Aer Lingus in the Irish economy is to be maintained, it seems inevitable that Aer Lingus will link up with another airline in the not too distant future.  In saying that, I mean no disrespect to anybody in Aer Lingus, workers or management. The challenge facing us is to get as far as a link up.  We are not even at the table, because of the inaction on the part of the two previous Ministers with responsibility for transport and because of the people who allowed the crisis to develop.  When other comparable airlines were getting their act together and facing up to new conditions in the context of the European Community about which the Minister has told us so much, the managment of Aer Lingus were making pleas to Ministers in Government at the time, which fell on deaf ears.  The Labour Party's mantra about no privatisation is insignificant.  As a Deputy behind me said, that was much more important in relation to Greencore. There was overwhelming logic in the concept of maintaining a major indigenous food company such as Greencore in State hands, but that concept has been sacrificed.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish to refer to what we will <Col N="996" /> be voting for tonight, not the motion tabled by the Democratic Left but the Government amendment.  The Government amendment makes very clear what we are being required to do.</P>

      <P>There is still a minute remaining on the clock I am looking at, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  The Government amendment makes it clear that what we are being required to do is endorse Government policy.  Government policy is defined in the amendment as meaning, and I quote:</P>
      <P> ... supports the Government's decision to provide, subject to constraints on the national finances, sufficient support for Aer Lingus ...</P>
      <P>That is virtually meaningless.  At this eleventh hour I appeal to my colleagues in the Labour Party that &mdash; contrary to Deputy Joe Costello's statement that this motion is six weeks too early &mdash; it will be six weeks too late as soon as the Minister brings a decision into this House which we will not be able to change.  Now is the time for the Labour Party to do what they have to do on this amendment. If they are serious about extracting from the Government the necessary equity to resolve this dispute and if unions and management get together on devising a viable future for Aer Lingus, now is the opportunity to do it.  They cannot console themselves with this amendment, because it is meaningless, does not advance the argument one whit.  It will be worthless tomorrow; it says nothing; it makes no specific commitments on equity, which is the only issue facing the House this evening.  I appeal to them to support the amendment at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulvihill</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to have this opportunity to raise this most important issue for the people of Carrigtwohill, County Cork, which is in the heart of my own constituency.  It is with much regret and sadness that I have been forced to raise it in the House tonight.</P>
      <P>It concerns an encampment of travellers located on the outskirts of Carrigtwohill which is having an adverse effect on the residents of the local community. Given the circumstances surrounding this encampment and the problems it is causing for local residents and industries, I have been left with no option but to raise the matter in the Dáil.  I hope the Minister for the Environment will use his authority not only to take immediate and effective action but to ensure that such encampments will not be allowed to be established in the future.</P>
      <P>Other parts of County Cork have also suffered from this problem.  During festivals, the town of Cobh in particular is almost overwhelmed by traders who park their vans and trailers in front of local business premises.  This problem also exists in the vicinity of Youghal.  Serviced sites should be provided throughout the country and the Minister must make greater use of his office and work with Cork County Council to have more such settlement sites established.  At present this illegal site is in a disgraceful condition. It is dirty and, at times, rat infested.  Recently a representative of the Industrial Development Authority stated that there is a great danger that a multi-national plant could be lost because of the encampment and the dirty, unsightly appearance of the site.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I ask the Minister for the Environment to find out if suitable settlement sites could be provided for travellers where they could reside and, if they so wish, run their business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before dealing with the situation in the location in question I take this opportunity to outline to the Dáil my responsibility and that of the Garda Síochána in relation to these encampments.</P>
      <P>I fully appreciate the difficulties faced by all those who are confronted with this problem. Indeed, the problem is very prevalent in my own constituency. However, the resolution of the issue is usually a civil matter, as such, there are limits as to what the gardaí can do.</P>
      <P>Breaches of the law, such as illegal parking of caravans or mobile homes, which come to notice are dealt with by the Garda Síochána.  It is a matter for the gardaí to enforce the law in such cases in the same way as they do when any other breach of parking or traffic law is detected.  In order for a parking offence to be committed, however, the person or persons concerned must have parked their vehicles on a public roadway.  It is important to point out that no breach of the parking regulations occurs unless the vehicles in question are parked on a public roadway.  Persons who park vehicles on property which is either privately owned or owned by a public body such as a local authority, are not committing any offences under the parking laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of removing caravans and trailers from private property is a civil matter and as such, it is not open to the gardaí to intervene.  In such circumstances, it is a matter for the owner of the property to seek a court injunction <Col N="1001" /> to have the trespassers removed.  If requested, the gardaí will, of course, attend the scene to prevent breaches of the peace.</P>
    <P>I would now like to deal with the situation at Carrigtwohill.  This matter was the subject of a Parliamentary Question yesterday and the Minister said in her reply that the Garda authorities have informed her that there are six caravans parked at the above location and that they are not causing an obstruction under the Road Traffic Acts.  However, I am informed that a recent prosecution under the Casual Trading Act was taken by the gardaí against one of the persons parked at the location and that further similar prosecutions will follow.</P>
    <P>I have again been in contact with the Garda authorities and I am assured by them that they are closely monitoring the situation and that they will deal with any breaches of the law which come to their attention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for giving me the opportunity to raise this most urgent and important matter.</P>
      <P>There must be no further delay in getting the work underway for the improvement and extension of Keelbeg Pier at Union Hall, County Cork.  There has been no shortage of announcements that this work will proceed.  We had an announcement in 1991 from the then Tánaiste and Minister for the Marine, Mr. John Wilson, and then we had a subsequent announcement from the next Minister for the Marine, Deputy Michael Woods.  However, the work never properly got underway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been brought to my attention in Union Hall that work did get under way but it was described to me as a piece of political chicanery which occurred in the week prior to the general election last November.  For that week there was great activity at the pier.  Lorries were there drawing stones and tipping them in around the pier.  The people of the village and the area not unnaturally felt that their dreams were being realised and that the work was at long last underway. Deputies can imagine how their hopes <Col N="1002" /> were dashed on finding that the lorries and workmen had disappeared like the mist on a summer morning, the week after the election.  We can further imagine the cyncial comments that were made about the political process arising from this exercise.</P>
    <P>The total cost of the pier and approach roads is about £3 million.  The work at the pier itself will cost £2 million which will be at least 50 per cent funded by the EC.  The approach roads including the road across the new causeway will cost at least £1 million.  In case there is any question of finding justification for the expenditure of such substantial sums in Union Hall, it is as well that the background should be fully known.</P>
    <P>The Union Hall area has a tradition of fishing extending over many years.  As was common with many small Irish fishing ports, the industry in this area was for a number of years badly organised and its full potential had not been developed.</P>
    <P>In 1986 a number of local fishermen joined together and formed the Union Hall Fishermans' Co-operative Society Limited.  The work of this co-op was so successful that it purchased the vacant industrial estate at Marsh Road, Skibbereen, where its auctions are now held and it is responsible for many jobs in the area, directly and indirectly.</P>
    <P>The number of boats using the pier is about 60 trawlers, 20 of these are locally based and the others come from Kinsale to Dingle.  The employment content directly on these boats is about 250.  In addition, there are 20 staff employed by the co-op in Skibbereen and a further 20 part-time staff.  The co-op now has a turnover of £6 million per annum.</P>
    <P>A portion of the industrial estate has been rented out for related activities and at the moment there are four fish packers, a ship's chandlery, a repair section and a business dealing with marine electronics which between them are giving employment full-time to upwards of 100 people and many more on a part-time basis.</P>
    <P>We are therefore talking about the provision of an essential facility for the maintenance and development of all these jobs.  It is very clear that a pier is as important to a fishing-based enterprise as <Col N="1003" /> a hospital is to a surgeon.  The present pier is not alone inadequate but dangerous for the huge number of boats which are using it.  There is, therefore, an unanswerable case to get the pier works underway.  I understand there is some element of debate between the Department of the Marine and the county council in relation to who should pay for what. It is time that any such dispute ended. Jobs are at stake here and must not be put in further jeopardy.  In relation to the £3 million project, the county council has already spent £500,000 on the approach road over the causeway and is willing to spend at least a further £500,000 on the other approach road.  In addition, it has made an offer of a further £250,000 towards the actual cost of the pier, half payable now and the other £125,000 on 1 January next.  The Minister will also be drawing from the EC for at least 50 per cent of the cost of the project.</P>
    <P>In this situation it is not acceptable for the Minister to attempt to off load responsibility.  Very clear and positive commitments have been made in the past by previous Ministers.  The case is proved from the point of view of user and employment.  I want immediate action and if that involves the Minister going to see the county council and ironing out any remaining issues it must be done this month.  I want to see the work underway on the pier on 1 May next.  I am demanding immediate action and I am not prepared to take no for an answer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. G. O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>What Deputy O'Keeffe will hear from me tonight are the facts &mdash; the bare, honest, truthful facts.  Proposals for the development of Keelbeg Pier, Union Hall, County Cork, were included in the Department of the Marine's fishery harbour development programme covering the period 1989-93.  The development was included on the basis of the existing facilities and activity levels at Keelbeg.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The existing pier, which is 80 metres long and 7.7 metres wide and is of masonry construction, has been in a deteriorating state for many years and is seriously defective in terms of adequate <Col N="1004" /> and safe access and berthage.  The sea approach is tidal and most of the pier dries out at low water.  As activity is restricted to suitable tidal conditions, there are inordinate delays in the landing and handling of catches.  The local fleet, which accounts for landings in excess of £2 million per annum, has been operating under great difficulty over the past number of years.  In fairness to the local fishermen, credit is due to them for the way in which they have successfully increased landings at this harbour in spite of totally inadequate facilities.</P>
    <P>As a first step to remedying the infrastructural deficiencies at Keelbeg Pier, a site investigation, which is a prerequisite of harbour development works, was undertaken during 1990.  During 1992 the results of this investigation were used in the drawing up and costing of a preliminary design for the development.</P>
    <P>Sanction for the undertaking of this development which will cost £2 million was obtained at Christmas 1992. However, at that time it was decided to modify the design of the development for reasons of durability, robustness and cost.  The modified design proposals gave rise to a number of concerns among the local fishermen and the Union Hall Development Association.  In order to address these concerns a number of meetings were held with local interests over the last few months, culminating in a meeting &mdash; attended by the Minister for the Marine, Deputy David Andrews and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Joe Walsh &mdash; on 25 March, 1993 when agreement was reached on the nature of the development.</P>
    <P>A condition of the sanction and of the Government approval for the undertaking of this project is that Cork County Council contribute 25 per cent of the total cost.  This local contribution requirement is a long-standing one, whereby a contribution of 25 per cent or 50 per cent, depending on geographic location, is required in respect of projects undertaken at local authority-owned harbours. Without this contribution it will not be possible to initiate the project.</P>
    <P>The county council has offered to pay <Col N="1005" /> £125,000 in 1993 and a further £125,000 in 1994.  However, a total contribution of £500,000 is required.  It has been indicated to the council that a payment of £125,000 in 1993 will suffice along with a written commitment to pay the balance in equal instalments over the years 1994 and 1995.</P>
    <P>Confirmation of Cork County Council's agreement to the contribution arrangements is awaited.  Once confirmation is received the tendering process can begin immediately and civil works can commence within three months.  I understand that Cork County Council will meet next week and in view of the importance of this development I urge them to accept the Department's proposal.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute to the Minister, Deputy Joe Walsh, and Deputy Paddy Sheehan who have continuously made representations to me on this urgent and serious issue.  The Department has done everything in its power to ensure that development commences as soon as possible and Cork County Council should take the matter from here.</P>

      <P>Tá mé buíoch díot, a Cheann Comhairle, as ucht deis a thabh-airt dom an cheist thábhachtach seo a árdú sa Dáil anocht, i dtaobh scoil i mo dháilcheantar féin.  Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for granting me permission to raise this matter.  I would not have asked the Minister to attend tonight if other attempts to resolve the matter had not failed.  The situation obtaining in Scoil Chaitríona is quite extraordinary. This is a national school in Renmore in Galway for which the Department has refused to sanction the appointment of a caretaker.  Since the previous caretaker resigned from the post the school manager and some of the staff have been <Col N="1006" /> obliged to carry out maintenance work, a situation that is most unsatisfactory.</P>
      <P>The Department has taken the stand that there are two schools involved. There is a junior school with 432 pupils and a senior school with 463 pupils.  There are 34 teachers on the staff, with two principals and two boards of management. Both schools are built on common ground, with just one school building, and both the junior and senior classes commenced on the same day.  The schools share a secretary whose salary is paid by the Department.  There is a common ESB account and a common boiler house that heats water for the central heating system throughout the building. I cannot understand why the Department is insisting that there are two schools involved.</P>
      <P>If there were an additional 68 pupils in the junior school and an additional 37 pupils in the senior school the Department would sanction the appointment of a caretaker for each school.  With an increase of 105 pupils the Department would be quite happy to sanction the appointment of two caretakers for this one building, but it will not sanction the appointment of even one cartaker for a school with an attendance of 900 pupils. This is a matter of grave concern to the school management.  I appeal to the Minister to apply common sense in this case. I hope in his reply he will indicate a willingness to sanction the appointment of a caretaker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my area in Galway city there are two schools, a boys' and a girls' school which are 500 or 600 yards apart.  There is one caretaker, who was made permanent last year, with responsibility for both buildings.  These two schools have a staff of only 20 teachers.  In Scoil Naomh Phroinsias, a new school in Headford Road, Galway, with an attendance of 700 pupils, there is a caretaker and a secretary whose salaries are paid by the Department.  Scoil Chaitríona is unique in that it has taken responsibility for the physicially handicapped class which was transferred from Merlin Park Hospital, with no assistance from the Department. About £6,000 has already been spent on the school from parish funds.  This is the <Col N="1007" /> only school outside Dublin with a language impaired unit and therefore there are extra costs involved.</P>
    <P>The condition of this school is deteriorating. Most of the caretaking work, such as cutting the grass, is done by the manager, but there are many tasks which he cannot do such as painting, repair work and plumbing.  If any item of furniture is broken it cannot be repaired and replacement is very costly.  The windows in the school need special attention and are very expensive to replace.  The previous caretaker was able to replace small panes of glass for £7 but now a glazier has to be employed at a cost of £32. It now costs £145 to replace the large windows which were previously repaired by the caretaker for £40.  Recently 16 classes were denied physical education because the gym was flooded and there was no caretaker on hand to repair the damage.  Whenever there is a breakdown in the school, whether it be in the boiler, the roof, the windows or furniture, there is nobody to carry out the repairs and contractors have to be employed at great expense to the parish.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the Department's stance on this matter.  I am raising it in the hope that the Minister will concede that a mistake has been made and will agree to sanction the appointment of a caretaker.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should first advise the Deputy that the school referred to as Scoil Chaitríona, Renmore, Galway, with an enrolment of 900 pupils, is in fact two schools, Scoil Chaitríona senior and Scoil Chaitríona junior.  In order to augment the resources available to schools a phased programme of financial assistance for the provision of cartaking and clerical services in national schools was introduced from 1 September 1992 under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the first phase of this programme those primary schools with single enrolements of 500 pupils or over benefited from this additional capitation grant.  It should be noted that the schools referred to by the Deputy did not qualify in the <Col N="1008" /> initial phasing in of this programme as neither school had a single enrolment of over 500 pupils.</P>
    <P>Under the Programme for a Partnership Government, an additional provision of £0.506 million is being allocated during 1993 to expand caretaking and clerical services in national schools.  As a result, a further phase of the programme for caretaking and clerical service will be introduced in September this year.  It will become clearer at that time if either of the schools in question will benefit under the expansion of the programme in 1993. The Deputy can rest assured that his concern in this matter will be taken into consideration at that stage.  Furthermore, I give an undertaking to the Deputy tonight to have the matter reviewed in view of the case put forward by him.</P>

      <P>A week before the November general election the then Minister for Health, Dr. John O'Connell, informed the Kerry branch of the Irish Kidney Association by letter, that £140,000 would be allocated to finance the installation of a kidney dialysis unit at Tralee General Hospital.  However, the present Minister, Deputy Howlin, has stated there is no such record in the Department's files.  In a recent reply the Minister stated that no specific funds have been provided in the 1993 Estimates in respect of these developments.  This totally contradicts the commitment made by the then Minister, Dr. John O'Connell, apparently at the behest of the Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, who made a strong commitment that he would ensure that the Minister for Health would give the matter priority during his pre-election tour of Kerry.</P>
      <P>Seven Kerry patients are forced to travel to Cork for kidney dialysis, sometimes three or four times a week.  Three of these patients are what are described as CAPDs and they require treatment on occasions four times a day.  Last week a child had to be rushed to Cork and was lucky to survive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We want a satellite unit in Tralee.  The Kerry Association have now collected £115,000 on their own initiative.  With an <Col N="1009" /> allocation of £140,000, this would almost put the unit in place.  I appeal to the Minister to clear up the contradiction between himself and his former colleague and to give a clear commitment on the funding of the dialysis unit this year.  At last week's conference, the Minister said that he was looking for money in every place.  Did the Minister find it anywhere?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any undertaking made by my predecessor before the last general election regarding the provision of kidney dialysis services at Tralee General Hospital.  No such record exists in my Department, and I have looked.  The then Minister stated that the development of a dialysis service at Tralee General Hospital was included among the developments for consideration for funding for 1993.  I found the letter written to Deputies at that time in that regard.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's wish that I should find money, I already spend 20 per cent of all the revenue spent by the Government and I intend to ensure that the very considerable increase in expenditure on the health services this year continues to the best advantage of the patients and the people depending on the health services.</P>
      <P>While no specific funding was provided in 1993 in the Estimates in respect of a dialysis unit for Tralee, my Department is currently discussing this with the Southern Health Board in the context of the board's 1993 development service plans.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy of my direct interest in this matter and of the interest of the Tánaiste who has made repeated representations to me.  I am aware of the urgency of this service and I have had discussions with the Kidney Association in that regard.  As soon as resources allow, I hope the service will be made available.</P>

      <P>The <i>Cork Examiner</i> of Monday 6 April last stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An investigation into alleged &ldquo;back-handers&rdquo; at Tralee General Hospital has found that there was some substance in claims made by patients and their relatives, it was reliably learned last night.  The basis of the claims was <Col N="1010" /> that money was accepted on behalf of medical card holders who believed that they would receive better treatment if they made payments.</P>
    <P>The article goes on to say that payments may have been small and that they were unsolicited.  Such payments should not have been accepted anyway.  These are very serious allegations striking at the heart of our public health system and affecting the reputation of a number of people.  If they are not independently investigated the findings will always be questioned.  Since this affair has become public, in the interest of fair play for everybody concerned, both the accusers and the accused, I would ask the Minister to carry out a ministerial inquiry for the sake of everybody involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to avail of this opportunity to inform the House of the position concerning the serious matters raised by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>In September last a number of allegations were brought to the attention of my predecessor, Dr. O'Connell, by a member of Tralee Urban District Council.  On receipt of these allegations my predecessor instructed a senior officer of the Department to meet with the councillor. On consideration of the subsequent report prepared by the officer of the Department my predecessor instructed that the matter be investigated as a matter of urgency by the Southern Health Board.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that, under the contract of employment for consultant medical staff, the investigation of complaints is a matter in the first instance for the chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board.  I understand that the chief executive officer of the health board has almost finalised his report and that he expects to be in a position to submit this to me within the next week.  Pending receipt of this report from the chief executive officer, and in fairness to all parties concerned, it would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a story that will strike a chord with the parents of children who have been seeking orthodontic service <Col N="1011" /> over the past number of years.  It relates to a ten-year-old in Dublin south west who in October 1989 was advised by a private orthodontist of the urgent need for treatment.  She was examined by the EHB on 1 December 1989 and was not X-rayed.  She was again examined on 4 April 1991, appraised by the EHB and put back on a waiting list without X-ray. On 16 May 1991 the girl was again appraised, X-rayed by the EHB and put back to wait further.  On 21 May 1991 she was examined once again but not X-rayed, and in April 1992 the X-rays were mislaid.  On 16 June 1992 she was further examined by the orthodontic service and found not to be in need of urgent treatment, but on 16 March 1993 when the child began to complain of serious pain she was examined by an eminent orthodontist who deemed that she was in urgent need of immediate treatment.  She was referred again to the EHB orthondontic service and was reassessed on 5 April 1993 and has now been categorised as &ldquo;priority 2&rdquo;.  This means she is not deemed in need of immediate treatment and that she might not get treatment for two or three years, or perhaps never, because the child will have grown into a woman by then.</P>
      <P>Much has been said and written about orthodontics since I became a Member of this House and in no area has less been achieved. Will the Minister, as a matter of urgency, take action on this case and let it be a watershed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Children seen by the Eastern Health Board's school dental service are referred for screening for orthodontic treatment in accordance with guidelines issued by my Department.  Because of the high cost of secondary care orthodontic treatment, the Eastern Health Board operate the guidelines issued by my Department to ensure that the resources are used to the best advantage for those most in need of treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cases requiring attention are categorised according to the severity of their condition.  The most urgent cases, or category 1, for example, cleft palate, are treated immediately.  Other categories are dealt with in order of severity and in <Col N="1012" /> the order in which they are placed on the priority list.  Category 2 cases can have a severe functional handicap such as a marked overbite or overjet relationship of the teeth and jaws, while category 3 cases are non-handicapped and have a lesser need for treatment.</P>
    <P>I understand from the Eastern Health Board that the person referred to by the Deputy has been reassessed recently and placed on the board's waiting list in category 2.  Because of the number of children on the waiting list I am not in a position to inform the House tonight at what stage the child will receive the treatment required.</P>
    <P>There have been significant improvements in orthodontic care in recent times. I would draw the attention of the Deputy to the fact that a professor of clinical orthodontics has been appointed jointly between the EHB and the Dublin Dental Hospital and School.  A number of other service provisions have been put into place and I was happy to provide an additional £2 million this year to improve services.  I will take on board the Deputy's suggestions and I will look at the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I was horrified but not surprised when I saw the front page heading on yesterday's <i>Evening Herald</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Irish in London forced to work as strippers &mdash; Students In Sex Trap&rdquo;.  Channel 4 next Tuesday, to our shame, will tell the lot.  The sad reality is that the system of higher education grants which the Minister inherited and is now happy to administer has driven thousands of youngsters from our shores in search of higher education elsewhere.  In essence no son or daughter of a teacher, a civil servant, a health board official, a garda or a middle income PAYE worker can now qualify.  The grant qualifying thresholds are ridiculously low.  Qualification is based on gross rather than net income, even though the Labour Party clearly promised in their election manifesto that Labour would change the system and give grants on net income.  No cognisance is taken of tax, mortgage repayments, health or sickness costs, let alone the cost of keeping body and soul together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All our universities and colleges are <Col N="1013" /> bursting at the seams.  University College Dublin has the &ldquo;house full&rdquo; sign up. Students are standing in the corridors of the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology, and things will be chaotic next year because a record 52,000 have applied for entry to an already overchoked system.</P>
    <P>The points system and restricted entry to the so-called elitist faculties mean that our students have to go overseas if they want to become doctors, pharmacists or study ophthalmic optics.  Our students are to be found in every university campus from Edinburgh to Oxford.  The British university and education systems have been good to our students.  They have opened their doors and the British Government is paying the fees.  These Irish students are, therefore, responsible only for their maintenance and herein lies the problem as outlined in the Channel 4 programme and confirmed by the National Union of Students in Britain.  It costs a minimum of £60 per week in the average British city to live and maintain oneself; in London it can cost up to £100 per week.  The recession in Britain means that the traditional avenues of part-time employment have long since dried up. In desperation, therefore, Irish students, whom we have failed to accommodate here, are now a world focus and the subject of case histories in next Tuesday's Channel 4 programme.  What a price to pay for education.  Britain is paying our children's fees.  The least we might do is pay the other half and spare them the indignity they must now undertake to educate themselves.  What a price for education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to respond to Deputy Higgins on this matter.  The Government's commitment to widening access to third-level education, including continued improvements in the higher education grants scheme, is evidenced by the rapid expansion which has occurred in student numbers and the significant increased provision in student support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Numbers in third-level education have expanded from 21,000 in 1965 to 75,000 in 1991-92, increasing with an intake of nearly 27,000 in 1992-93 to a total of <Col N="1014" /> about 80,000.  A further increase in student places is planned during the next three to four years which will bring the participation rate up to about 45 per cent of the age group.</P>
    <P>Third-level education now accounts for about 22 per cent of the education budget compared to 8 per cent in 1986.  In the current year the total student support for fees and maintenance provided by the State is approximately £84 million compared with £75 million in 1992, an increase of 12 per cent.</P>
    <P>As regards the issue of where higher education grants are tenable, the scheme provides that grants are tenable at institutions of higher education in Ireland in respect of attendance at degree or other approved courses.  The purpose of this requirement in the scheme is to give financial assistance to students ordinarily resident in Ireland who reach a minimum standard in the leaving certificate examination and who because of family circumstances might not be in a position to proceed to third level education in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The payment of a grant may be continued for one year in respect of attendance abroad where the period in question is laid down as an integral part of the student's course in line with the terms of the Erasmus scheme, the purpose of which is to promote third level student mobility between EC member states.</P>
    <P>I am aware that requests are made from time to time for grants to be made tenable in the United Kingdom and elsewhere in the EC.  Except in the circumstances I have just outlined, all such requests have had to be refused on the grounds of cost.  The Deputy will be aware of the range of significant improvements introduced in the grants scheme in 1992, including special provisions for mature students.  Currently, that scheme is under review and all relevant matters, including the issue raised by the Deputy, will be examined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Aylward, for coming into the House tonight in connection with the proposed new national school at Faha, outside Killarney.  I am obliged to raise this <Col N="1015" /> matter now, due to the seriousness and urgency of the situation.  Faha national school was built in 1880.  It consists of four small classrooms and two prefabricated rooms.  The two prefabs were erected in 1968 &mdash; 25 years ago &mdash; and are now showing real signs of the effects of the weather.  The main building is very damp, the slates are held with pieces of lead and the nails are worn out.  The main chimney is leaking and the western gable is extremely damp.  There are outside toilets, which are unacceptable in 1993.</P>
      <P>The site was purchased ten years ago and the local contribution was collected. I understand that the detailed plans were prepared in 1992 and that the proposed project was ready to proceed to tender at that time.  Any reasonable person would agree that Faha must surely be on the top of the priority list for new starts in County Kerry in 1993.</P>
      <P>I am, therefore, asking the Minister of State to ensure that this project goes to tender as soon as possible and to commence work on its construction as a matter of urgency this year.  The parents and teachers are very concerned at the delay in advancing the proposed new school in Faha to construction stage.  The public in the entire catchment area are equally concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Leary for raising this matter and giving me the opportunity to give the up-to-date position regarding Faha national school, County Kerry.  In fact, I met a deputation when I was last in Kerry, brought to me by Deputy O'Leary, who pointed out the seriousness of the situation in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present accommodation consists of four classrooms which were built in 1876 and two prefabricated classroom dating from 1967 and 1969.  The school has 146 pupils and five teachers.  The request for additional accommodation <Col N="1016" /> dates from 1969 when two other schools amalgamated into Faha national school.</P>
    <P>An initial proposal to extend the school had to be abandoned owing to title difficulties. These difficulties were resolved in 1987.  A plan for a new six classroom school estimated at £300,000 was abandoned owing to financial constraints.  A further plan to build a new school in two phases while continuing the use of the existing school was also abandoned owing to financial constraints.</P>
    <P>The matter was reviewed in 1989, when the case was removed from the private architect's ambit who had dealt with it up to then, and the Department's architect was asked to report on the feasibility and economics of extending the existing school as opposed to building a new school.  The architect advised that a new school would be a cheaper and better option.  Plans were prepared for a new five classroom school and the case is ready for the invitation of tenders. However, the proposed extension is one of over 150 projects which were at pre-contract stage in the latter part of 1992. Only a certain number of projects, which were selected on grounds of priority, could be listed to go to contract in 1993. Unfortunately, it was not possible, on the basis of the total capital funding available and the relative priority of other projects, to allow the Faha national school project to be included in the list for 1993.</P>
    <P>However, I wish to assure Deputy O'Leary that my Department accepts fully that the conditions are such at this school that the project merits the highest possible priority rating in the context of the projects which will be selected to proceed as part of the capital programme in 1994 and which will be decided on in the next few months.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 8 April 1993.</P>

      <P>Community legislation provides for a lamb classification scheme which each Member State should operate on a voluntary basis from this month.  The implementation of the scheme and its impact on price reporting will be monitored by the Commission for a transition period and it is expected that by 1 January 1997, a compulsory scheme will operate throughout the Community for all plants involved in intra Community trade.</P>
      <P>My Department has been participating in discussions with CBF and factory and producer representatives on the implementation of a classification system for lamb.  Those discussions have not as yet reached a successful conclusion due to differences between factory and producers interests on the technical and price reporting aspects of the proposed classification grid.  The discussions are however still being pursued.  An agreed classification system for lamb in this country would be an important asset in export marketing and the parties concerned should, in their own and the national interest, make every effort to reach agreement.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31, 101 and 103 to 106, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The agri-tourism scheme, which forms part of the EC supported Operational Programme for Rural Development under the recent round of the Structural Funds, was launched by my Department in March 1991.</P>
      <P>Projects may be submitted under the scheme by individual farmers or groups consisting of farmers and rural dwellers. In the case of individual farmers all the investment must be on-farm, while in the case of groups at least 50 per cent of the investment must be on-farm.  In all cases, at least half of the investment must be in leisure facilities.  An investment ceiling of £50,000 per applicant or £250,000 for a group of five or more applies to each project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date, 210 projects &mdash; 134 individual and 76 groups &mdash; have been approved for <Col N="838" /> investment under the scheme.  A total of about 350 farmers, 33 of whom are in Kerry, are directly participating in the scheme.  However, many more farmers are in receipt of benefits flowing from grant aid to marketing projects under the scheme.</P>
    <P>Teagasc plays an important role in the promotion of rural tourism through its 23 socio-economic advisors.  Teagasc is involved in the provision of training programmes for rural communities, the development of agri-tourism on a community basis and the provision of an advisory service to tourism related projects. Teagasc also co-operates with Bord Fáilte and SFADCo, in the promotion of agri-tourism.  I envisage a continuing substantial involvement by Teagasc in carrying out their statutory functions in so far as they relate to tourism development.</P>
    <P>The agri-tourism scheme is an important element in the Government's rural development policy.  The interest in the measure is very evident in the current round of the Structural Funds, both under the Operational Programme for Rural Development and the Leader programme. As a result some additional funding was provided for the current scheme and I am seeking increased funding for the new agri-tourism scheme in the 1994-99 period.</P>

      <P>My Department has already announced some of the more important details of the decision of the Agriculture Council in January to amend the eligibility criteria for the suckler cow scheme for small scale milk producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The arrangements for the scheme provide that producers with milk quotas of up to 25,638 gallons will be eligible to apply for the scheme in future.  This compares <Col N="839" /> with the previous milk quota limit of 12,819 gallons.  In addition, the ten cow limit per producer has been abolished. Ireland has been granted a reserve quota of 63,400 suckler cows to cater for these changes.</P>
    <P>This quota will be allocated in the first instance to small scale milk producers who have suckler cows of beef breeds in their herds on 1 January 1993 and who keeps these cows on their holding until 30 June 1993.  Producers who were previously restricted by the ten cow limit will also be given priority in the allocation of this quota.  Any unused balance of the reserve quota will be retained in the national reserve.</P>
    <P>The deadline for submitting applications for the reserve quota of 63,400 cows is 14 May 1993 in the case of those farmers who had eligible cows on their holding on 1 January 1993.  Farmers who do not fulfil the eligibility conditions may apply for reserve quota at a later stage when they acquire the eligible cows.  My Department is having application forms printed at present in order to enable producers to submit their applications on time and will be placing further advertisements in the newspapers shortly inviting producers to submit their application.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34, 36, 41, 52, 60, 73 and 76 together.</P>
      <P>The GATT negotiations were comprehensively debated in this House on 16 and 17 February and they were the subject of a series of parliamentary questions on 25 February.  On those occasions, I outlined fully the most recent developments and my position on the negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="841" /> There have been little or no developments at international level since then. The new US Administration has stated that it is committed to concluding the negotiations by the end of the year but has yet to apply to the Congress for an extension of the fast-track negotiating procedure.  In addition, it has still to indicate its attitude to the proposals currently on the table in respect of the different subject areas, including agriculture. Pending the clarification of these aspects, it is unlikely that there will be any substantive developments in the negotiations, at least in the short term.</P>
    <P>Within the EC Council, we have been examining the draft EC/US deal and in particular its compatibility with the reformed Common Agricultural Policy.  There was an inconclusive discussion on the report at the Council in March and the matter will be taken up again at our next meeting.  Together with a number of my colleagues, I reiterated our serious reservations regarding the commitments contained in the agreement and pressed for further analysis to be undertaken before the Council adopts a final position on the agreement.</P>
    <P>The effect of a GATT agreement on Irish farming will depend on the arrangements made within the Community to meet whatever commitments are finally agreed.  I will continue in the ongoing discussions to defend Ireland's vital agricultural and food interests and to seek to ensure that whatever is finally agreed is compatible with Common Agricultural Policy reform.  I will in any event insist that we get firm commitments that our vital interests are protected.  A number of my colleagues in the Council also have serious concerns and it is expected that the new French Government will continue the strong line adopted by that country in the negotiations to date.  We will, of course, continue to liaise with the French authorities and colleagues as the negotiations develop.</P>
    <P>Finally, as regards Common Agricultural Policy reform, the overall effects of that agreement are positive for Ireland.  The question of re-opening the negotiations does not arise.</P>

      <P>While I do not have complete data on the level of research and development expenditure nationally, I am aware of the criticism in the Culliton report of both the inadequate focus of existing State supports and the lack of co-ordination between the agencies.  The House will note that in this year's budget we took a step towards remedying this situation.  A sum of £250,000 has been made available to establish a fund which will be used to encourage research institutions to carry out collaborative projects in the food area.  I consider research to be a priority for the future and to this end I expect to be able to build up this fund through the use of the new Structural Fund arrangements. I should also point out that this matter is being examined by the expert group on the food industry, whose report will be with me shortly.</P>

      <P>The price and volume restrictions agreed under the Common Agricultural Policy reform package are likely to restrict scope for further expansion of the currently high levels of gross output in the beef, sheep-meat, cereals and milk sectors.  Development in these areas will in future come from greater efficiency and quality <Col N="843" /> improvement.  In order to maintain and increase the value of output, Teagasc is making special efforts to encourage efficiency at farm level and reduce production costs.  The lower input costs resulting from Common Agricultural Policy reform together with generally improved competitiveness should allow output in the pig and poultrymeat sectors to be expanded further.  Significant expansion is also possible in the horticultural area.</P>
      <P>I expect any reduction in the level of gross output resulting from the Common Agricultural Policy reforms to be more than compensated by way of increased direct payments to farmers and reduced feed input costs.  In addition, the Common Agricultural Policy reform provisions are accompanied by a range of measures designed to protect the environment, restructure farm holdings to make them more viable and to find alternative uses for land.  In addition, the operational programme for rural development under the aegis of my Department contains a number of schemes designed to encourage farm diversification and farm based enterprise.</P>

      <P>Existing EC regulations do not permit the payment of all EC livestock and other premia in the year of application.</P>
      <P>The EC Commission Regulations governing the special beef premium and suckler cow premium schemes following the Common Agricultural Policy reforms provide that 60 per cent advance of premium may be paid after 1 November of the calendar year in respect of which an application is submitted.  The balance may not be paid until the following year. As regards the ewe premium scheme, the third instalment for any year cannot be paid until the EC Commission fixes the final amount of premium due for that year.  This decision is usually made in March of the following year.</P>
      <P>It has never been possible under any Administration to deal with all cases within the year of application because query cases inevitably take some time to resolve.  Furthermore, applications which are accepted in the last months of any year cannot usually be processed for payment until the early months of the following year.</P>
      <P>In 1992 I made a special effort to ensure that a higher percentage of farmers who lodged applications in June and July 1992 would be paid by the end of the year.  As a result, 83 per cent of June and July applicants under the various schemes were paid by the end of the year compared with 61 per cent for each of the two preceding years.</P>

      <P>Detailed statistics are not available on the number of applicants who were refused EC suckler cow and special beef premium schemes grants in the years 1990, 1991 and 1992 as statistics are kept on the numbers of applicants paid rather than on those refused. At the same time it is estimated that in the region of 2 per cent of applicants under these schemes are refused grants each year.  The most common reason for refusal of grants under these schemes are the failure to maintain the animals on which grants are sought for the required retention period, failure to account for the absence of animals not presented at inspection, and applying for premiums on ineligible animals.  Failure to ear-punch animals and to present cattle identity cards for checking, stamping and punching are also common reasons for refusal of special beef premium grants.</P>
      <P>All applications for 1990, 1991 and 1992 which have been refused were carefully examined before refusal and I am satisfied that there is no case for further re-consideration unless new information is supplied in any case.  All of the 1990 special beef premium refusal cases have already been reviewed in the light of concessions sought from the EC Commission and granted by it and only those not coming within the scope of the concessions now stand refused.</P>

      <P>Following a review of the operation of the milk quota system in 1986 the Council of Ministers agreed in December of that year on a quota reduction by way of the temporary suspension of quota.  In 1987/88, 4 per cent of the national quota was suspended and in 1988/89 a further 1.5 per cent was suspended.  In 1989/90, I per cent of the quota which had been temporarily suspended was reallocated to producers by way of a special reserve.  The temporary suspension of 4.5 per cent of quota remained in place, with compensation being paid annually up to and including 1991/92.  In total, the compensation over these five years from 1987/88 amounted to £1.78 per gallon.  While the 4.5 per cent suspension remained in place from 1 April 1992, no specific provision was made for any further compensatory payments. I have, however, been pressing at the Council to have the position regularised.</P>

      <P>The Central Statistics Office conduct an annual Labour Force Survey which relies on a representative sample of the labour force to provide details of their occupation. These surveys show that employment in agriculture, forestry and fishing stood at 167,000 in 1990, at 154,000 in 1991 and at 150,000 in 1992.  The Central Bank in its Quarterly Bulletin for Spring 1993 estimated that employment in this area would decline by another 2,000 in 1993. Although these are not the precise figures asked for by the Deputy they do show a continuing downward trend in agricultural employment.  It should be noted that this is part of a worldwide trend in <Col N="847" /> developed economies in recent decades and is related to improved farming technology and greater efficiency in agriculture generally.  Indeed the rate of decline in the agricultural population in Ireland in the last decade was considerably less than in the seventies.</P>
      <P>What is more important than the actual numbers employed in agriculture is the number of jobs in rural areas.  The existence of a vibrant rural community is possible only if there are enough opportunities for work and enterprise for those living there.  This does not always have to be in the traditional agricultural activities.  Within the operational programme for rural development operated by my Department there are a number of schemes designed to encourage farm diversification including agri-tourism and horticulture while other schemes, like the Leader programme, are designed to help groups in rural communities take advantage of business opportunities.</P>
      <P>In addition to these measures the Programme for Government emphasises our intention to implement a development programme for the food industry.  This will be drawn up following the report of the expert group on the food industry which I expect to receive shortly.</P>
      <P>This development programme, together with the operational programme for rural development, will help to improve the employment position in the food industry and in rural areas.  It would be my aim to ensure that the numbers thus employed are at least maintained and increased by the addition of worthwhile sustainable jobs created with the help of the measures I have referred to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 57, 98 and 102 together.</P>
      <P>The Government's policy for the forest sector is outlined in the Programme for a Partnership Government.  This provides for the expansion of planting to 30,000 hectares per annum, maintaining this to the year 2000 and developing the downstream processing industry.</P>
      <P>In relation to the second part of the Deputies' query, forestry development is subject to a number of controls.  It is a basic condition of grant-aid under the current programme that forestry development is compatible with the protection of the environment.  This is implemented with particular regard to proximity to dwellings and public roads, the landscape, areas of scentific interest, fisheries and archaeological sites.  In addition, afforestation of over 20 hectares of conifers is subject to the full environmental impact assessment procedure.</P>
      <P>I wish to make it clear that I am anxious to see that in all cases forestry developments are undertaken in an environmentally sensitive way.  My Department has put in place measures towards this end.  I am not aware that it has been established that forestry measures have infringed on the rights of adjoining properties.  In any such case the aggrieved landowner would have right of recourse to legal remedy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Deputies' final point, I certainly do not believe that forestry is an inappropriate use of land.  On the contrary, it is an important alternative land use which supports the reform of agricultural structures, stimulates rural development, provides employment, diversifies the rural <Col N="850" /> economy and, of course, provides the raw material for the forest-based industrial sector.</P>

      <P>The national base area for the purpose of compensatory payments in the arable sector under the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy is the average of the areas under cereals, oilseeds, protein crops and set-aside for the three years 1989, 1990 and 1991.  These data, as required by regulation, were based on estimates submitted by the Central Statistics Office, CSO, to the European Statistics Office, Eurostat.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the CSO that the estimates for the three years are based on benchmark data from the 1980 census of agriculture and subsequent annual postal surveys of farms to monitor year-to-year changes.  However, the original estimate supplied by the CSO to Eurostat in respect of 1991 has been revised as a result of the 1991 agricultural census.  This showed the base area for 1991 to be about 10 per cent lower than previously estimated.</P>
      <P>This difference is attributed by the CSO to the fact that the original estimate was based on a series of samples linked back to the previous full census in 1980. Samples are subject to the usual sampling effors and, in addition, the use of linked samples can result in systematic biases accumulating over time.  The bias effect can be particularly significant where activities are undergoing considerable change &mdash; such as happened in the case of cereals where the area sown fell by almost a third between 1980 and 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The CSO has already supplied Eurostat <Col N="851" /> with the revised figures for 1991 and based on these will also be revising the data for previous years.</P>

      <P>The main elements of the integrated administration and control system required by EC Regulations which is being phased in over the period to 1 January 1996 are &mdash; (a) A computerised data base; (b) An alphanumeric identification system for agricultural parcels; (c) An alphanumeric system for the identification and registration of animals; (d) Aid applications; (e) An integrated control system.</P>
      <P>I have arranged for the existing computerised data bases of my Department to be more closely integrated during 1993 so as to approach the ideal set out in the relevant EC Regulation.  This should provide an overview across all aid schemes that will allow stocking densities and quotas to be applied and prevent double payment in respect of any particular areas or animals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have arranged for the distribution by mid-April to all farmers of area aid <Col N="853" /> application forms.  When these are completed by farmers and returned to my Department they will serve as a basis for compilation of the alphanumeric identification system for agricultural parcels which I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>The present ERAD eartags and cattle identity cards are being taken as the basis of the alphanumeric system for the identification and registration of animals currently in force.  I propose, however, to introduce by the 1 October 1993 deadline the new arrangements for earlier ear-tagging of cattle and the farm registers which are needed to ensure better compliance with the EC's Integrated Administration and Control Regulations.</P>
    <P>Aid applications under the 1993 ewe premium and sheep headage schemes have already been received from farmers. All arable sector aid applications are being included in the area aid applications now being posted out to farmers while disadvantaged areas cattle and equine headage and suckler cow and special beef premium schemes applications will issue as normal during the rest of 1993.</P>
    <P>In order to provide an integrated control system, I have arranged for all completed applications received to be linked together within my Department's computer system in such a way that (a) each area in respect of which area aid or area-linked aid is being claimed will be identified so as to prevent two different kinds of aid being paid in respect of that area and (b) that each animal on which special beef or suckler cow premium is being claimed will be identified to verify that it is eligible for premium and will not be paid the same premium twice.</P>
    <P>I am happy that these arrangements I have made provide a very sound basis for future progress towards a fully integrated administration and control system for all EC aid schemes administered by my Department.</P>

The number of badgers removed from the population is minimal.  Also, road casualty badgers are fully utilised as research material.</P>
      <P>Given the overriding requirement to reduce the incidence of bovine TB, a thorough analysis of all the factors involved in disease transmission is a key element of the programme.</P>

      <P>The Government <Col N="856" /> decided on 28 July 1992 to admit up to 200 refugees from the former Yugoslavia. A group of 178 arrived in Ireland on 2 September 1992 and visas have been issued to allow a further 22 immediate family members of these refugees to come to Ireland.  The refugees have been given temporary protection status in Ireland, with the full rights of refugees. The refugee agency, which operates under the aegis of my Department, has primary responsibility for the co-ordination of the reception of the refugees.</P>
      <P>The 178 refugees were accommodated at a special reception centre at the Cherry Orchard Hospital site on their arrival in Ireland.  The refugee agency co-ordinated a reception programme which included specialist counselling and language training in the initial phase.  In recent weeks the refugees have been moved into private rented accommodation in the Dublin area and the refugee agency is beginning the task of integrating them into the community and identifying appropriate educational and employment opportunities.  The shortage of available local authority housing has dictated that the refugees be moved into private rented accommodation.  In addition to receiving weekly social welfare payments they are also in receipt of a rent allowance from the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>I am considering urgently the question of admitting additional refugees with priority being given to close relatives of those refugees who are already here.  The refugee agency already has a number of requests for family reunification on hand. My Department is consulting with other Government Departments and agencies to identify the most pressing cases.</P>

      <P>A system of quarterly revision of valuations was introduced by the Valuation Act, 1988, to replace the previous annual cycle.  Under the quarterly revision system the owner or occupier of a property, the rating authority or an officer of the Commissioner of Valuation may apply at any time to have the valuation of a property revised.  Applications are sent on a monthly basis to the Commissioner who issues results of revisions at quarterly intervals.  As the results are issued only on a quarterly basis it is inevitable that there will always be a certain number of applications on hands in the Valuation Office.</P>
      <P>The number of requests received since 1988 for Dublin city is 16,335; and for the rest of the country the number is 61,910. The number of results issued in this period is 11,093 for Dublin city and 48,816 for the rest of the country.</P>
      <P>Staff resources do not allow for the compilation of statistics regarding the length of time such requests have been on hands.  However, every effort is being made by the Valuation Office to clear outstanding requests.  There is a two tier appeal system.  The first appeal is to the Commissioner of Valuation and the second level of appeal available to anyone dissatisfied with the Commissioner's determination is to the independent Valuation Tribunal.</P>
      <P>The issues involved in appeals can vary in complexity from case to case and this is reflected in the time it takes to reach a determination.</P>

    <P>Seals are a protected species under the Wildlife Act, 1976, and it is an offence to hunt or kill them, save under licence or permission under the Act.

Such a cull would in any event have to be carried out on seals in Scotland.</P>

      <P>Article 26 (3) (a) of the Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) Regulations, 1989, establishes the period of validity of a certificate of competency as two years after the date of issue and this is clearly stated on each certificate. Article 29 of the same regulations requires that an application for a driving licence must be accompanied by a certificate of competency save in circumstances <Col N="865" /> which do not apply in this case.  This requirement cannot be set aside in individual cases.  In the case of the person in question, a certificate of competency was issued on 8 February 1991 and it is not now valid.  If he wishes to take a further driving test, I will on request make the necessary arrangements to have this carried out at an early date.</P>

This has been recognised by all independent commentators.  The positive effect will be further enhanced by the recent devaluation of the Irish pound which, besides increasing prices, will also increase the level of all Common Agricultural Policy compensatory payments by about 10 per cent in due course.</P>

      <P>The scheme of Civil Legal Aid and Advice is administered by the Legal Aid Board.  Expenditure incurred in the operation of the scheme is met from the Legal Aid Fund.  This fund consists of&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) grants paid in each financial year out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas of such amount as the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, after consultation with the Board in relation to its estimated requirements for that year, and, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, may fix and</P>
      <P>(2) All other payments made to the Fund including contributions paid by persons granted legal services and costs and damages recovered by such persons as provided for in this scheme.</P>
      <P>The funds available to the Legal Aid Board from these sources in the years referred to in the Question are as follows:&mdash; 1985, £1,622,000; 1987, £1,724,000; 1989, £1,637,000; 1991, £2,435,000; 1993, £2,981,000 (provisional)</P>
      <P>The abridged version of the Estimates for Public Services 1993 shows an allocation of £2,906,000 as Grant-in-Aid to the Legal Aid Board.  This will, of course, be supplemented by other payments to the Fund, as described above, estimated at £75,000.  The amounts shown opposite each of the years 1985 and 1987 also include an allocation from funds made available for legal aid under a provision in the Funds of Suitors Act, 1984, of £65,000 and £190,000 respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The funds available to the Legal Aid Board for 1993 are not sufficient to allow <Col N="872" /> for the opening of additional Law Centres or for expanding existing ones. However, the Government is committed to the provision of additional funding to facilitate an expansion of the scheme of Civil Legal Aid and Advice and I consider the honouring of this commitment to be a priority.</P>

      <P>Under the Health Act, 1970 medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the Chief Executive Officer of the appropriate health board are unable, without undue hardship, to provide general practitioner services for themselves and their dependants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Chief Executive Officers draw up guidelines in relation to income limits and to assessment criteria: however, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and a person who would not qualify on the basis of the guidelines may still be awarded a medical card if the Chief Executive Officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.  Persons aged between 16 and 25 years who are dependants of a person who is not a medical card holder are not normally entitled to a medical card except where they have an entitlement under EC regulations or where they are in receipt of a Disabled Person's Maintenance Allowance.  The decision on whether or not a person is regarded as a dependant or as being financially independent is made by the Chief Executive Officer of the health board <Col N="876" /> on the basis of the circumstances of the individual case.</P>
    <P>I should stress that the position, as outlined above, applies equally to persons on unemployment assistance (whether at full or reduced rate) and to persons on unemployment benefit, and that there is no automatic right to a medical card in either case.</P>
    <P>It is open to all persons to apply to the Chief Executive Officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.  I am satisfied that health boards give sympathetic consideration to such applications when the circumstances warrant it.</P>

      <P>As a result of the sudden withdrawal last year of a FÁS Teamwork scheme, the Irish Wheelchair Association was forced to discontinue its day care services at Clontarf for those aged 65 and over.  Following discussions between the Irish Wheelchair Association and the Eastern Health Board, the health board examined the needs of each person aged over 65 and every one of them was offered some alternative service such as home care attendant service or attendance at other day centres or day clubs.  These arrangements have now been put in place.  Currently, as persons attending the Irish Wheelchair Association day centre approach 65 years they are assessed by the public health nurse with a view to providing the most appropriate alternative service.</P>

      <P>The question of who attends these latter courses is a matter for the organising bodies.  It is made clear to the organisers, however, that optimum benefit may not be derived by participants if the attendance at a course exceeds 50.</P>

After that stage the question of <Col N="882" /> the funding of an extension would be considered in the light of the availability of finance and having regard to other commitments and priorities.</P>

      <P>A fundamental requirement of the secondary schools building grant scheme is that to qualify for captial grant assistance from my Department in respect of any development the prior written approval of the Department must be obtained for that development.  This requirement was not complied with by St. Vincent's Secondary School, Glasnevin in respect of the technology extension provided at the school.  My Department has no funds available for <Col N="883" /> the payment of what is in effect a retrospective grant.</P>
      <P>A total of 173 schools, including St. Vincent's applied for and were paid the standard grant of £5,000 each for the purpose of assisting the introduction of junior technology within the existing resources available to them.</P>
      <P>With regard to the request for a grant of £40,000 for the provision of hardware and furnishings at St. Vincent's the position remains as stated in reply to Question No. 128 from Deputy Gregory on 17 February last.</P>
