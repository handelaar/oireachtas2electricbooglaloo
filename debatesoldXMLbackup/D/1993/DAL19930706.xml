      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of a reply to Parliamentary Questions on 27 April 1993, I reported on my visit to Derry on 16 April.  I have no immediate plans at this stage for a further visit to Northern Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that there is a need to break the political logjam on the question of Northern Ireland talks and that a new initiative is needed to break that political logjam? In that context, would he accept that a visit by him to the region and his meeting there with members of political leaders of both communities might be the springboard which would lead to a new approach and a restart to the Northern Ireland talks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that there is need to break the logjam in trying to <Col N="1062" /> get all parties back to the table.  The expectation at this stage is that the British Prime Minister and the Secretary of State, Sir Patrick Mayhew, will be successful in their efforts to resume the talks by the autumn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the Taoiseach in his hope and expectation that the British Prime Minister, Mr. Major, and the Secretary of State will be successful in their efforts but does he not accept that it would be useful if he, as the political leader in the Republic, was also trying to help break that political logjam? Would the Taoiseach not agree also that the cycle of violence on the part of both the IRA and the UDA is positively alarming and calls for a gesture on his part to assist the efforts of the UK in getting those talks under way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I continue to use every effort possible, both behind the scenes and otherwise, to try to get both communities to see the sense of returning to the table and that the road to violence is the road to nowhere.  I will continue my efforts in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I put my question again, without interruption this time? Would the Taoiseach agree that he should take the opportunity of a visit to Northern Ireland to impress on the British authorities and, in particular, on the RUC, the wisdom of the policy of successive Irish Governments that there should be no contact or negotiation with paramilitary organisations or their political fronts?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach indicate to the House whether his Government believe that the talks will recommence on the basis of the three stranded approach which has been the approach to date?  Can he indicate also his view, or whether he intends to express a view, in relation to the joint sovereignty proposals which appear to be emerging and which, in my view, would create an appalling vista for the people of Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The expectation is that when the talks resume they will be on a three stranded basis, and that is accepted by the British Prime Minister and by the Secretary of State.  The proposal by the Labour Party spokesman in the UK in relation to joint sovereignty is a matter for debate with the British Labour Party.</P>

      <P>From a statistical point of view, is it not the case that if the Minister examined the position obtaining ten years ago, or in 1974 when the legislation was introduced, he would note that <Col N="1065" /> minimal progress has been made since then in narrowing the gap between the hourly or weekly pay of women and men?</P>

      <P>With respect, this is an important matter for more than 50 per cent of our population.  Having established that the gap is virtually as wide now as it was in 1974, is it the Minister's intention to introduce legislation to tackle the problem?</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Equality and Law Reform</askee>
      <Quest>if he intends introducing legislation to prohibit the holding of conferences in Ireland by groups intent on perpetuating discrimination against minorities and inciting hatred which is inimical to the achievement of equality for all regardless of their ethnic origins or religious beliefs.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the view that it is highly inappropriate that conferences of the kind referred to by the Deputy should be held in Ireland.</P>
      <P>So far as my proposals for legislation are concerned, it is my intention to bring before Government shortly proposals for comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation covering employment, services and other matters.  Following this legislation it is the Government's intention in accordance with the Programme for Government to ratify the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 21 December 1965.  Ireland signed this convention subject to ratification on 21 March 1968.  These measures will supplement the existing provisions of the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act, 1989.</P>
      <P>The introduction of criminal legislation on the lines referred to by the Deputy would be a matter for the Minister for Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister state the proposed timescale for the introduction of the legislation and the signing and ratification of the agreement to which he referred?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The anti-discrimination legislation is at an advanced stage of preparation, but the Deputy must <Col N="1067" /> appreciate that it is particularly complex legislation involving discrimination legislation in a variety of fields and covering a wide spectrum of categories of people who are adversely affected.  Consequently, I cannot give a definitive date for its introduction but it probably will be some time next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider that the rights of European membership confer on individuals of any EC country the right to travel to another EC country without restriction?  Does he envisage a position where individuals involved in perpetuating discrimination against minorities or inciting hatred might be allowed without restriction to attend in Ireland but would be subject to prosecution for an illegal offence only following confirmation of such crimes after having attended a conference or organised one here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of prosecution would be a matter for the Minister for Justice, but as I indicated at the outset, a conference of the type to which Deputy Kenny referred in his question &mdash; conferences by groups intent on perpetuating discrimination against minorities and inciting hatred &mdash;<i>per se</i> would appear to be an infringement of the legislation and the question of prosecutions might arise.  Attempts to commit offences under that Act could also arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 18 and 24 together.</P>
      <P>In line with the Government's Programme for a Partnership Government I am engaged in a process of initiation of a series of reforms of family law which will culminate in the holding of a referendum on divorce in 1994.  The Government's programme does not envisage another White Paper on the subject. I think it is generally agreed that the White Paper on Marital Breakdown has contributed greatly to the level of information and awareness of the many legislative, administrative and social issues involved in marital breakdown, including divorce.  I am availing myself of every opportunity to further improve the level of information and awareness but I am also taking necessary legislative and other action to implement family law reforms on most of the outstanding issues.  The full range of legislative proposals which I intend to introduce in advance of the referendum was outlined in my reply to questions on 1 June 1993.</P>
      <P>Implementation of the programme of reform is well underway.  The Matrimonial Home Bill, which I initiated, is before the House and Deputies will have the opportunity of discussing that Bill tomorrow when the Second Stage is due to be taken.  The Bill is an important measure in its own right, but it also represents a major step in the run-up to the referendum on divorce.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, I also initiated a Bill which enables Ireland to ratify two international conventions dealing with the recognition and enforcement of court judgments including maintenance orders.  That Bill has now been enacted. The other important family law legislation is at various stages of preparation and I intend to have those measures in place by the time of the referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure the House that when the Government decides, in due course, on the form the divorce referendum proposal should take it will indeed initiate <Col N="1069" /> an information campaign on the proposal and all related issues and, as I said also in reply to questions on 1 June 1993, I will be publishing, in advance of the referendum, the details of the legislative proposals on divorce that will be introduced in the event of a positive referendum outcome.  Those details will cover important matters such as the powers of the court in relation to custody of children, maintenance, pension and succession rights and property generally.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the support of the House on the various measures I am bringing forward and I have no doubt that all Deputies will play their part in informing constituents and the public generally about those measures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for outlining the steps he intends to take in the lead up to the proposed referendum on divorce.  However, I hope that the Matrimonial Home Bill which will be given a Second Reading tomorrow and which has taken ten years to get this far, will be given adequate time, particularly on Committee Stage.  Will the Minister confirm that it is the Government's intention to hold the proposed referendum on divorce on the same date as the European elections in 1994?  Does he expect to have the full support of all members of the Government parties in regard to the proposals he intends to put to the people at that time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in saying that the Matrimonial Home Bill has been in gestation for many years. However, during my occupancy of a ministerial position it has taken only five months to have it published.  It is a major step forward and a critical building block on the road to the divorce referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has not yet taken a decision about the date of the referendum. The Programme for Government provides that it will be held in 1994 and it would be my intention to ask the Government to have it on a date as early as possible in 1994 on the assumption that we will be able to get all the necessary preparatory legislation in place.  In regard <Col N="1070" /> to the Deputy's final supplementary, I can assure him that the Programme for Government provides for the referendum on divorce.  That will be agreed to by the Government and the proposals will be put at the appropriate time.</P>

      <P>If the programme of legislation that the Minister has outlined is to be dealt with by the House in good time for a proper information campaign to be presented to the people, a great deal of work will have to be done in the autumn session this year and again in the spring session of 1994.  Am I to assume that the Government intends to have European elections, urban elections and by-elections on one day and a divorce referendum at a separate time?  Further, is the Minister absolutely confident that in presenting proposals to the people there will be absolute clarity in regard to matters of property which caused much confusion and anxiety in many households when the people were last asked to decide on the question of divorce?  May I have an assurance from the Minister that there will be absolute clarity in respect of property rights before the people are next asked to decide?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The fullest possible clarification of all aspects of the divorce regimen, including property rights, will be provided.  It will be made clear to the people before they go to the referendum what the divorce regimen will be if the result of the referendum is positive.  I agree that it is important that that be widely understood.  All Deputies will have a major responsibility in that regard, and I know that they will row in with it.  The Deputy has been very pressing in regard to dates but, with the best will in the world, the Government is not in a position to fix any date yet.  All I can say is that it is the intention to have the referendum as soon as possible in 1994.</P>

      <P>The membership of the Task Force on the Travelling Community is as follows: Liz McManus, chairperson; Niall Crowley and Martin Collins, nominees of the Dublin Travellers Education and Development Group; Fr. Bill McKenna, nominee of the Council of Major Religious Superiors; Mary Moriarty representing the National Federation of Irish Travelling People; Chrissie Sullivan of the Irish Travellers Movement; John Magee of the National Association of Traveller Training Centres; Liam Keane, nominee of Kilkenny County Council; Dan O'Sullivan, nominee of Dublin County Council; Brian Mullen, Liam Hughes and Brian Breathnach, who are nominees of the Departments of Health, Education and Environment respectively.  Also appointed are Joan Maher of Fine Gael, Catherine Quinn of the Progressive Democrats, Gabriel Cribben and Ita Greene of Fianna Fáil and Senator Mary Kelly of the Labour Party.  An officer from the Department of Social Welfare is also being appointed to the task force.</P>
      <P>The Terms of Reference are as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1) to advise and report on the needs of travellers and on Government policy generally in relation to travellers, with specific reference to the co-ordination in policy approaches by Government Departments and local authorities; (2) to make recommendations for consideration by relevant Ministers to ensure that appropriate and co-ordinated planning is undertaken at national and local level in the areas of housing, health, education, equality, employment, cultural and anti-discrimination areas; (3) to draw up a strategy for consideration by relevant Ministers, to define and delineate the respective roles and functions of relevant statutory bodies which cater for the needs of travellers, including recommendations <Col N="1072" /> for ensuring that services are provided for travellers in all local authority areas and, likewise, throughout the functional area of each local authority; (4) to report on implementation of measures to meet the Government target of providing permanent serviced caravan site accommodation for all traveller families who require it by the year 2,000. Pending the realisation of that target, to report on arrangements whereby temporary serviced caravan sites should be provided by local authorities for traveller families who require them; and to examine and report on the costings of such sites and to advise and report on the most efficient use of resources in the provision of such sites; (5) to explore the possibilities for developing mechanisms including statutory mechanisms to enable travellers to participate and contribute to decisions affecting their lifestyle and environment; (6) to analyse nomadism in modern Irish society and to explore ways whereby mutual understanding and respect can be developed between the travelling community and the settled community; (7) to report and make recommendations to the Minister on any other matters affecting the general welfare of travellers.</P>
    <P>The Government has decided to provide the task force with an annual budget as follows: remainder of 1993&mdash;£50,000; 1994&mdash;£90,000; 1995&mdash;£75,000; 1996 &mdash;£60,000.</P>
    <P>An officer from my Department has been assigned to undertake the preparatory work in setting up the task force and, in addition, the Government has decided to assign two units of support staff, to be sourced from outside my Department, to service the task force. The inagural meeting of the task force will take place on 9 July 1993 and I would like to take this opportunity to wish them well in the arduous task facing them.</P>

      <P>As to the first question raised by the Deputy, my role is essentially a co-ordinating one; it is not a question of the task force supplanting me. The terms of reference of the task force are wide ranging.  The responsibility vested in other Ministers and other Departments in connection with travellers still stand.  These include, primarily, the Department of the Environment, also the Departments Health and Education and to some extent, the Department of Social Welfare. The primary responsibility for organising halting sites continues to rest with the local authorities.</P>
      <P>As to my own position in regard to a particular halting site in my own constituency, which I hold in common with the travelling families that it is intended to move in there, what Deputy Harney said is correct.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>My function is primarily a co-ordinating one.  That includes setting up the task force, and that has been done. It was my function also to outline terms of reference and arrange with the Government resources for that task force and to assist and work with it to break the logjam and widespread neglect of travellers in many areas for many years by previous Governments.  I hope to achieve a breakthrough in that position. The composition of the task force is well qualified to tackle that problem under the chairmanship of Deputy McManus.  I appreciate she has undertaken the arduous and dedicated task of chairing this task force.  The task force is made up of travellers, people who work with travellers, and local authority and Government representatives.  It is a high powered task force and it will be well served by officials if the Government treat it seriously.  Sufficient moneys have been allocated to enable it carry out its work in a proper manner.  I look forward to receiving its report in due course in regard to what may be done in this area. When the report comes to hand it will be considered carefully in the Department. Other Ministers who have responsibilities in this area will also consider the report.  I will present the report to the Government to seek the authorisations necessary to implement its recommendations as far as possible.</P>

      <Quest>if, in view of his statement to the Select Committee on Legislation and Security during the consideration of the Estimate for his Department that there is now in place, by way of Government decision, a requirement that women make up 40 per cent of new appointments to boards, he will give the procedures, if any, that are in place to monitor such appointments to ensure that they comply with the Government decision; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>As stated in the Programme for Government, it is intended to follow a radical programme of affirmative action in appointing women to State boards with the objective of achieving a minimum of 40 per cent of both men and women among the direct Government nominees within four years.  Progress towards this target will be monitored closely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not answered my question.  My question relates to a statement the Minister made at the Select Committee on Legislation and Security.  I stated that I did not see much difference between this Government and the previous Government in respect of equality.  The Minister replied by saying that one of the differences was a commitment by this Government that all State boards would have a 40 per cent gender balance.  That is a separate matter from the Joint Programme for Government.  I tabled the question in relation to the Minister's statement.  Since the Minister made that statement other Ministers appear to have disregarded it and are treating it as a guideline&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that other Ministers are treating his statement as a guideline and are refusing to meet the commitment he made to the committee?  The Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht is the only Minister I am aware of who has enshrined this provision in legislation in relation to the RTE Authority.  Would the Minister agree that the county enterprise boards <Col N="1077" /> appear to have less than a 40 per cent gender balance?  The principle the Minister said is a commitment by the Government is only a guideline&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>As reported on page 98 of the report of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security, I stated that a strategy of positive action has also been set in train to achieve gender balance for the next four years in appointments to boards of State bodies.  That reflects the decision of the Government that for the next four year period, being the period nominated by the Commission on the Status of Women, new boards must have a minimum representation of 40 per cent of each sex and that if the new appointments do not tend towards that minimum percentage, the Minister must give an explanation to the Government of its plans for achieving the gender balance required.  As far as I am aware, that commitment has been strictly adhered to in every respect.  I have monitored the position at Government.  It has been complied with and will continue to be complied with.  It must be remembered that we are referring to Government nominees.  Many outside bodies have nominating rights to State and other boards.  The Government at present has no direct control in that regard. However, the Government requests nominating bodies &mdash; county managers in respect of county enterprise boards &mdash; to adhere where possible to that gender requirement.  I will continue to monitor the position and if outside bodies are not meeting that requirement, legislation might have to be considered in that context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that it will be impossible to achieve that objective within the four years if he is adopting this approach and is in effect rolling back on the commitment made? Would he agree that unless Ministers make a commitment and follow up on <Col N="1078" /> that commitment the Government's intended gender balance will not be met? A consultative committee is being established by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry in the Department of Agriculture.  Is the Minister aware that when the Minister of State was challenged about the gender balance of that committee he indicated that he was not going to make a commitment in this regard?  Will the Minister for Equality and Law Reform ask the Minister for Agriculture, Food and forestry to report to the Government in regard to why he will not comply with a gender balance principle in this regard?  The principle of gender balance has not been put forward by the Opposition; this clear commitment has been made by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with the Deputy's suggestion that there has been any rolling back of the principle which I enunciated to the Select Committee on Legislation and Security.  That is an innovation by this Government; no previous Government ever enunciated such a statement referring to Government appointments on State boards.  I have no knowledge of the task force or consultative committee in the Department of Agriculture to which the Deputy refers, but if the Deputy supplies details I will check out the position.  The Government's decision refers to Government appointments and ministerial appointments to State boards.  However, there is also a commitment to monitor appointments to other bodies.  As the Taoiseach and other Ministers have requested, I call on those bodies to work towards the achievement of gender balance within the four year period suggested and accepted in the report of the Commission on the Status of Women.  After a reasonable period if I consider outside nominating bodies &mdash; many of whom do not have a good record in this regard &mdash; are not meeting this commitment I will introduce legislation.  If the need arises I will have no hesitation in introducing such legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 23 together.</P>
      <P>The Government has committed itself in its Programme for Government to introducing a policy of &ldquo;gender proofing&rdquo; for all legislation and other major Government decisions, in order to assess their impact on women's rights and interests.  In the legislative process, each of the standing committees of the House have the task of assessing the impact of every legisative measure in terms of women's equality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Equally important, however, is the gender proofing of other significant <Col N="1080" /> measures.  The allocation of Structural Funds is a matter of the greatest significance in terms of the prospects, in the medium and longer term, for improving the position of women in Ireland, especially in relation to employment and training.  The evaluation carried out by the European Commission of women's involvement in actions co-financed under the European Social Fund (ESF) in the 1989-1993 round has revealed that, amongst the member states of the EC, Ireland has the lowest rate of women's involvement in ESF funded programmes. Specific problems which have been highlighted in this regard include the lack of data collection and monitoring in relation to women's participation in operational programmes under the Community Support Framework, and the very low rate of childcare provision in this country.</P>
    <P>I will be making proposals in these areas in order to ensure that the allocation of Structural Funds in the next round takes account of our commitment to achieving full equality for women in Irish society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister state whether the national plan, which is to be submitted to Brussels for whatever amount of Structural Funds we succeed in obtaining &mdash; they will certainly be substantial &mdash; has been gender proofed in accordance with the Government's commitment in the Programme for Government and, if so, who has carried it out? As women in Ireland have the second lowest participation rate in the workforce of all European countries at only 30 per cent, will the Minister agree that the provision of childcare facilities, which is in line with many of the European programmes, should be included in the national plan?  If that is the case, will the Government make a provision in the national plan for additional childcare facilities to allow women to return to the workforce or to participate in training courses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary gender proofing in connection with the funds is not so much at the submission to Brussels <Col N="1081" /> level but at the time of their administration when they are received here.  I will be monitoring this to the maximum possible extent and will ensure that other Ministers who have responsibility for the distribution and administration of those funds do likewise.  Procedures for the gender proofing of legislation are in place.  I agree with the Deputy that the question of childcare is crucial in this issue.  There may be a further question in this regard on the clár.  However, this issue is receiving close attention in my Department and I am awaiting the report on that question to determine what procedures and improvements are necessary in that regard.</P>
      <P>I agree that in regard to previous fundings, the involvement of women has been extremely disappointing.  That is regrettable and it is my intention to achieve substantial improvements in the next tranche of funds to commence in 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that it is the responsibility of the Government, in advance of submitting the national plan and operational programmes to Brussels, to gender proof those plans, and not at the stage when they are being administered?  Is it the case that the Government does not intend to make provision for childcare facilities?  Also, does the Minister accept that in the co-ordination and regulations for the Structural Funds now available emphasis must be placed on equal opportunities?  Will the Minister accept if that is the case, and given that only 7 per cent of the participants in rural development courses established under the previous Structural Funds were female, that it should be gender proofed at the stage when the national plan &mdash; which is supposed to be a co-ordinated plan based on the principle of equal opportunities &mdash; is put forward?

Finally, in regard to the training element from the next round of Structural Funds which the Minister mentioned will he give us an assurance, in terms of the open Government we are now supposed to have, that training courses, particularly in regard to women, will not consist of morning meetings in hotels around the country where tea and biscuits are offered and social conversation takes place with no real element of any training or worthwhile activity?</P>

      <P>In relation to the disbursal of Structural Funds, will the Minister ensure there is participation of women on the various authorities and boards which will be responsible for their distribution?  For example, will the Minister ensure that the 40 per cent gender balance will be part and parcel of the various structures that will emerge?  At present, there is no gender balance in the structures in rural Ireland.  Surely the Minister is aware that, for example, in the Leader programme few women are represented or in a position of authority. The Minister must ensure that women have a voice in these areas.  In regard to the Leader and other programmes that will be established under the Structural Funds will the Minister undertake that there will be a 40 per cent minimum participation of women, to which the Government is committed so that women can make decisions with their male counterparts?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms. McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate when amending legislation will be introduced?  The recommendation of the Second Commission on the Status of Women seems to be straightforward and, presumably, the drafting of appropriate legislation would be a very simple matter. Is it not possible to draft legislation in a way that is inoffensive to women &mdash; for example, in current legislation human beings are automatically identified as being male?  Will the Minister agree that is untenable, particularly in legislation that has relevance to women?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy's general comments.  The drafting of legislation is undertaken by the Attorney General's office and the parliamentary draftspeople's office.  I will bring to the attention of those concerned the comments made by Deputy McManus in that regard.  I hope to be in a position to introduce an amendment to the Interpretation Act in the next Dáil session.</P>

I have not yet examined the Bill but I assume there are no such references.  I compliment the Minister on the references to chattels in that Bill which do not refer to spouses or women but to household goods.  I am delighted that at last the word &ldquo;chattel&rdquo; has a new legal meaning.</P>

      <P>I am shocked that my constituency colleague, Deputy Harney, would think for a moment that I would even dream of using the word &ldquo;chattel&rdquo; in connection with anything other than items of furniture and personal property. The Bill, as drafted, is structured to some extent in an unacceptable way and a number of appropriate amendments will be tabled on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister be willing to consider documents containing unacceptable language that emanate from Government Departments such as, for example, census forms?  A form is distributed by the local authority of which I am a member in which the term &ldquo;head of household&rdquo; is used.  Will the Minister agree that such language is offensive and negates the principle of partnership under which modern homes are run?  Will the Minister consider that aspect of sexism, even though it is not gender specific?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be happy to consider that matter.  Across the whole spectrum of local and central Government activities sexism is prevalent.

If there are any items, such as the census form, which need attention I will be happy to consider them.</P>

Has the Minister any proposals to deal with the mass of written material that discriminates in this way?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 11 and 128 together.  I have been examining the views of a number of organisations including IBEC, ICTU and the Employment Equality Agency which were consulted earlier in connection with the implementation of the provisions of the EC Recommendation and Code of Practice on the Protection of the Dignity of Women and Men at Work.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied, arising from those views, that there is a broad measure of support for the development of an Irish code of practice on this subject.  Such a code would of course draw on the EC Recommendation and Code of Practice on the Protection of the Dignity of Women and Men at Work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the re-organisation of ministerial responsibilities since the various views were provided and in view of my concern to see a more active role for the Employment Equality Agency in the preparation of codes of practice on equality issues, I have written to the agency asking it to undertake the preparation of a draft Irish code in full consultation with the social partners so as to <Col N="1089" /> ensure as broad a consensus as possible for the effective operation of any code.</P>
    <P>When the draft code has been submitted I intend to consider how best to give it effect.  The review of the employment equality legislation should be well advanced by then and this should facilitate my consideration of the most appropriate way forward.</P>
    <P>In addition to the preparation of a code of practice on sexual harassment, the Employment Equality Agency is continuing its work to highlight this problem and provides ongoing advice to employers and workers in this area.  Over and above the agency's involvement I acknowledge the efforts of IBEC and ICTU in combating sexual harassment.</P>
    <P>The possible need for codes of practice in respect of any other forms of harassment which might occur at the workplace should be explored initially within the general industrial relations procedures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>In what way would the Minister envisage an Irish code of practice being different from the EC code of practice?  What status does the code of practice have?  Does the Minister envisage that it would require legislation to ensure that it could be used where someone was being harassed at work or is the code in itself sufficient to protect victims of harassment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The code of practice could be used as a guideline by tribunals in determining cases or it could be given statutory force under the Industrial Relations Act, 1990, or under the new employment equality legislation.  The format of the codes of practice might warrant some difference from the European code and have some special needs for Ireland having regard to our industrial situation.  I consulted the Employment Equality Agency and they felt that it was appropriate for them to be involved in the preparation of an Irish code.  They have agreed to undertake the task with vigour and to let me have their code by October.  When I get it I will consult with them as to the advisability of giving it <Col N="1090" /> statutory backing or perhaps I will leave it there as a guidance for use by the tribunal in connection with cases that might come before it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister have a view on sexual harassment in the Irish workplace in view of the fact that the nursing organisation recently indicated figures to the effect that one in three nurses have had to suffer sexual harassment to some extent during the course of their career?  If this is the case does it not warrant urgent action by the Government and the agencies involved?  Could the Minister indicate when he might be in a position to have the code of practice introduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I read the report referred to by Deputy Kenny and it appears that the practice of sexual harassment is quite widespread.  I addressed quite a number of conferences called by the Irish Nurses Organisation and other groups concerned with the issue.  This practice, incidentally, affects men as well as women, but mainly women.  The code of practice will help but we must realise that sexual harassment is discrimination and the Employment Equality Agency already run an advisory service on it and will give advice and help where necessary in the event of a person being aggrieved on an issue of sexual harassment.  The Agency provides a valuable and expert service and the new extended procedures arising from the code of practice would be in addition to that.  People should be aware that a remedy already exists in legislation and is availed of by quite a number of people.  I would encourage people who have been affected to go to the Employment Equality Agency.  One of the worst things that could happen is that it should be accepted, thereby leading to encouragement. Many people, particularly women, suffer very badly from it and many are reluctant to come forward. Employers must be encouraged to implement practices to deal effectively with these issues when they are brought to their notice.  The question of employers' responsibility for the actions <Col N="1091" /> of their employees arises and it is something that must be carefully considered.</P>

The directive has been the subject of attention at the time of the preparation of the Directive by the various Departments with primary responsibility for the areas concerned.</P>

Deputy O'Donnell has been concerned about the issue and she spoke about it at yesterday's Estimates meeting.  She spoke particularly about partners in professional firms.  The question is being <Col N="1092" /> dealt with more directly in the new employment equality legislation which is in course of preparation.  The Bill will deal with cases relating to more sizeable partnerships.  Obviously, if one woman is a 50 per cent partner in a firm, it is a different situation, but more minority partnerships may well be addressed in my new legislation so far as certain protective rights are concerned.</P>

They will probably be taken on in the larger centres; I do not envisage them being taken on in the one solicitor centres. Arrangements will have to be made to allow the apprentices work part of the time in the Chief State Solicitor's Office as well as in the Legal Aid Board law centres because they will have to gain experience across the spectrum of legal activity.  This will involve gaining knowledge in branches of the law other than family law.  As part of the arrangement I had to persuade the Law Society to allow the law centres take on apprentices.  They will gain their experience in the other fields of legal activity in the Chief State Solicitor's Office.  On the question of salaries, this has not been determined as yet.  The Law Society has recommended a rate of remuneration for solicitor's apprentices.  I imagine that this is the rate that will apply but, as I said, I do not think this has been fixed or settled finally as yet.</P>

      <P>In the private sector it is usually done by way of word of mouth knowledge, or an intending apprentice or their family might know of a solicitor and make approaches to them to see if they would be prepared to take on an apprentice. Having regard to the changes which have taken place in the profession in recent years, there is a large number of people who seek apprenticeships but are unable to secure a placement.  I understand that the Law Society operates a list &mdash; in other words, an intending apprentice can put his name on the list and the Law Society will endeavour to find <Col N="1094" /> a placement for him, if possible.  I imagine, so far as the law centres are concerned, that a direct approach could be made or more likely they will be recruited through the Law Society list.</P>

      <P>In the present year my Department will make available a grant of £114,000 to the Council for the Status of Women, a national representative body covering over 90 affiliated women's organisations. I would hope to work closely with women's groups on matters of common concern.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that many of the organisations on the front line which are helping women with particular difficulties &mdash; be it the need for refuge in a shelter provided by Women's Aid for example, or a need for advice provided by groups such as AIM &mdash; are experiencing enormous financial difficulties because of the lack of resources? Will the Minister try to ensure that much of the money given out from the national lottery by other Departments is channelled through his Department so that the women's groups which are providing the most effective help and working in the areas to which greatest priority is given have a better chance, even if they represent minority interests of getting a bigger slice of resources because it is often felt that because they represent minority interests, essential and all as they are, they do not have the same clout <Col N="1095" /> when it comes to securing aid from certain Government Departments?</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy that there is a large number of women's organisations which do remarkable and invaluable work in various areas, particularly those affecting families.  They have been doing this for many years on a voluntary basis.  Indeed, I do not know where we would be without them.  Those who represent minority interests, and indeed those who do not, are worthy of the maximum possible support.  Many receive grants from Government Departments which have been organised during the years on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  I cannot say at this time whether arrangements will be made in future years to channel these funds through my Department, but I am sure the Ministers concerned will endeavour to provide the maximum possible help for many of these organisations consistent with budgetary positions from time to time.</P>

      <P>On the question of funding for women's organisations, would the Minister consider reviewing the way in which health boards provide funding for such organisations at present?  Very often funding is provided only when there is a crisis.  I am sure the Minister is aware that even where a health board has agreed to allocate funding &mdash; for example, to a refuge &mdash; very often the organisation concerned has a difficulty in extracting the money from the health board and there can be a delay of many months.  If organisations have to wait for money to come through the system they can run into immense problems.  Second, in considering the question of funding for women's organisations would the Minister take into account the point that women's organisations which work in areas of deprivation should receive special attention because very often they have to combat a double inequality, the first of which is economic and the other gender?</P>

      <P>I do acknowledge it and, as I have said, I am well aware that many women's organisations have done and continue to do remarkable work all around the country, in many cases for little reward or recognition.  As I have said, funding has been provided on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  The Department of Health, the Department of Social Welfare and in some cases the Department of Education have been involved.  I suppose a case could be made for rationalisation, but I do not have the resources to fund a wide ranging scheme at present.  It would be desirable to have some organisation to deal with the matter on a more co-ordinated basis.  So far as the particular case to which Deputy McManus referred is concerned, I cannot say that I will investigate it, but if the Deputy sends me the details of the case she has in mind I will be happy to refer it to my colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, who liaises with the health boards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that if an adoptive couple were to meet the means for civil legal aid, which is £6,700 or £6,900 per year, they would never be entitled to adopt a child as no adoption society would allow a couple with such low means to adopt a child?  I know the Minister is aware of a case concerning constituents of ours who recently had to go to the High Court in order to dispense with the natural mother's consent.  This cost the couple £23,000.  They have to remortgage their house in order to pay the costs.  Is the Minister aware that there is a possibility that the natural mother will appeal this case to the Supreme Court?  In the High Court case the natural mother was funded as she has no means and there is a possibility that she will be funded in order to take the case to the Supreme Court.  This has put both financial and emotional strains on the couple who have had the child for four years.</P>
      <P>Given that only a small number of families come into this category, would the Minister not agree that it would be both humane and just if he provided some small level of resources to the Adoptive Parent's Society?  Alternatively, in cases where the child has been with the adoptive parents for a number of years, the Legal Aid Board might look at these cases in a sympathetic way and adjudicate on entitlement to aid on a different basis. It should be remembered that there are very few adoption orders in any event and an even smaller number are challenged in order to dispense with the natural mother's consent.  Would the Minister not agree that it is grossly unfair that adoptive parents, many of whom have waited for years to adopt a child, should have to endure this terrible burden in order to finalise the adoption?</P>

      <P>I am aware of the case in our constituency to which the Deputy referred.  I sympathise with the adoptive parents who felt they had to go to the High Court to seek an order to dispense with the consent of the natural mother. The bill they received seems inordinately high to me.  It has to be remembered that the legal aid scheme has, and always has had, parameters set down for eligibility. It was never intended to provide a free legal aid for people with means or sums available at their disposal which would enable them to meet their own legal costs.  There are tremendous demands on the legal aid scheme and approximately £3 million has been allocated to it this year.  In the Programme for Government the Government is committed to extending and expanding the legal aid scheme to the maximum possible extent.  I am already engaged in consultations on arrangements to try to achieve this and to reduce the unacceptably long waiting list in the critical family law area.  Over the years many Deputies, including myself, have pressed for legal aid for tribunals, etc.  The demand on the scheme is potentially very large and all I can say at this stage is that the Government will honour its commitment to extend and expand the service to the maximum possible extent year on year and to revise the guidelines in accordance with the moneys which can be made available from time to time.</P>

      <P>In recent years Deputies on all sides of the House have received representations from people who wish to adopt children.  Will the Minister clarify that no statutory age limit is being imposed at present by the health boards due to the lack of children available for adoption?  Would he not agree that there is a very clear need for further information for couples who wish to adopt a child?  For example, many couples who travelled to Brazil to adopt a child and stayed there for up to six months eventually found out that they had been ripped off by unscrupulous legal representatives who were in the business of buying children.  In view of the fact <Col N="1099" /> that approximately 5,000 Irish women have abortions in England every year, would the Minister not agree that there is a need to encourage these women to have their babies and give them up for adoption by couples who are in a position to care for them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with many of the points made by the Deputy, but I would point out to him that the issue of adoption is a matter for the Minister for Health who makes the regulations.  The issue of adoption arose under Deputy Harney's question in so far as funding is available under the legal aid scheme, for which I have responsibility.  I do not know off hand whether an upper age limit is applied but I am sure the Adoption Board would have that information for the Deputy.</P>

      <P>With regard to a decision by the Legal Aid Board to grant legal aid to an applicant &mdash; in this case the natural mother &mdash; does the board examine the case before it makes its decision or is aid granted automatically if a person's means are below £6,700 or £6,900?  Will a natural mother, with means under the level, automatically be given aid regardless of the case?  As the Minister is aware, there was effectively no case in the case to which I referred &mdash; this was clear from the judgement of the High Court.  Does the Legal Aid Board consider all the circumstances of a case before it makes a decision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Every case is different.  In addition to examining the means of the applicant, the Legal Aid Board is also required under the terms of the scheme to examine the circumstances of the case. However, that specific ruling does not apply in quite the same way where the welfare of a child is at issue.  If it appears from the facts submitted to the Legal Aid Board that the welfare of a child or children is at issue then the question of the likelihood or otherwise of success in the proceedings does not arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the coming into effect of the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, a total of 1,514 persons have been granted legal aid in judicial separation proceedings.</P>
      <P>The scheme of legal aid and advice operates for the purpose of enabling persons of limited means to be legally represented before the courts.  The scheme depends for its resources on Exchequer moneys and, accordingly, is subject to the same constraints to which other bodies in the public service are subjected.  The eligibility requirements for legal aid are kept under continuous review but given the limited Exchequer funding of the scheme it would not be possible to increase those limits in a way that would meet all applications concerning judicial separation.</P>
      <P>As Minister with responsibility for the legal aid scheme I am, of course, concerned at the high costs incurred by the Legal Aid Board in dealing with judicial separation cases and I am examining ways in which those costs could perhaps be reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are alternatives to court proceedings for a separation and, indeed, the 1989 Act encourages parties to consider those alternatives.  Parties may negotiate a separation agreement with the assistance of a solicitor and there is the possibility of engaging in mediation to help effect a separation on an agreed basis. The value of mediation in assisting spouses to reach a voluntary agreement without the need for court intervention was fully recognised in the White Paper on Marital Breakdown.  I have previously indicated to the House my commitment to ensuring that we have a strong family mediation service and proposals are currently <Col N="1101" /> being examined in my Department with a view to strengthening and expanding the service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that the average cost of getting a judicial separation is £2,500?  Generally separating couples seek a judicial separation only when there is disagreement between them and it is impossible to reach an agreed settlement.  In a judicial separation case are the means of both parties assessed jointly or separately for civil legal aid?  Does he agree that it should be mandatory on a person seeking legal aid in a judicial separation to go first through the process of arbitration and mediation so that there is at least a possibility of reaching a settlement and thus minimising the cost?  I am aware that couples who have to fund the costs themselves are more inclined to go to arbitration; indeed, I know of very difficult cases where agreement was reached in arbitration because of the skills of the mediator or arbitrator.  There is a number of private mediation services which have been particularly successful because of the skills of their staff.  If it were mandatory on the Legal Aid Board to require applicants for a judicial separation to go through an arbitration procedure, does the Minister agree that it would minimise the costs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly agree that it is highly desirable that people should be encouraged to avail of mediation rather than going to court in judicial separation cases, where that is possible.  Whether it should be mandatory is another matter. The existing legislation requires the applicant's solicitor to give a certificate to the court when issuing the application that he has informed the applicant that mediation services are available and advised the applicant to avail of them.  It is up to the parties themselves to decide whether to do that and under existing legislation they cannot be compelled to do so.  For mediation to succeed there has to be at least a willingness by both parties to participate in it.  If they are not prepared to agree to try the mediation <Col N="1102" /> process obviously they are not going to succeed in reaching an agreement.</P>
      <P>As to the question of the costs, I have no information that suggests that £2,500, the figure mentioned by the Deputy, is the average cost of such a judicial separation application.  No doubt many applicants would pay that, possibly more.  Personally I think it is excessive and I do not think that the average case heard in the Circuit Court should cost anything like that figure.  There could be exceptional cases where a great deal of property would be involved, perhaps necessitating the case having to be heard in the High Court, with barristers and solicitors involved.  In such cases the costs could conceivably come to even more than £2,500, but in the average case heard in the Circuit Court I would have thought the costs would have been considerably less than that.</P>
      <P>Each applicant would be assessed on his or her own means for civil legal aid. For example, if the wife was the applicant, her means would be assessed and in the instance where her husband is in a strong financial position, she, the separated wife, would get legal aid and he would not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the mediation service &mdash; which I think everybody supports &mdash; is available only in certain parts of the country and indeed in many parts of the country one cannot avail of it even if one wishes to take that option?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>That must be a difficulty in some parts of the country.  Perhaps Deputy Harney hit the nail on the head, because all too often there is a reluctance to avail of it even if it is available.  Certainly that was my experience in the years I was dealing with these questions.  When I did put it to the parties, both wives and husbands, on occassion it was not well received, because for some reason the culture or concept of mediation is not warmly received.  Usually the difficulties have engendered bitterness and my experience was that there was an inbuilt reluctance to agree to participate.  I think <Col N="1103" /> that is the major factor.  We have to try in some way &mdash; I am not sure how &mdash; to encourage in so far as we can the culture of mediation so that people can accept that, although their marriage has broken down, that is no reason not to try to resolve the other outstanding issues without having to battle it out in court, where the only gainers at the end of the day are lawyers because their fees come out of the joint family assets.  We have to try to encourage that culture.  I agree that the mediation service needs to be extended. The kind of service provided by the Family Mediation Service in Dublin needs to be extended to the greatest possible extent.  There is an increasing number of consultant mediators in private practice available at various locations throughout the country and I believe they are building up an appreciable volume of work.</P>

Guidelines are being established on the numbers needed to bring about a lasting improvement in the service.

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

      <P>I do not think that it adds up to compare the ratio of solicitors employed by the Legal Aid Board with the number of practising solicitors in the State, who of course deal with a wide range of commercial activities, conveyancing and so on, as the Deputy well knows.  I am totally unhappy, and I regard it as unacceptable, that a lengthy waiting time has built up in many of the existing law centres.  As I have indicated, the Government has given a commitment that additional funding will be provided so that the scheme can be expanded.  The preparatory work in that context is going on in my Department in consultation with the Legal Aid Board.  I hope that we will make some appreciable inroads into the problem even this year and to a greater extent next year.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not accept, apart from the enormous waiting time involved in the case of somebody seeking the assistance of a legal aid solicitor, that the type of cases that would be handled under the legal aid scheme would be very limited?  The consequence of this is that, apart from the goodwill of ordinary practising solicitors, many people do not have the opportunity of having their cases dealt with or of gaining access to justice and this is an indictment of our democratic system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as access to justice is concerned, one of the primary complaints one often hears is that Irish people are too litigation prone, that all sorts of cases are brought to the courts, perhaps <Col N="1105" /> many that should not have been brought. The waiting lists for having a case heard &mdash; leaving aside the waiting periods in the law centres &mdash; are very long, particularly in the Circuit Court and especially in the High Court, two year waiting lists and so on, which is an indication that there are very large numbers of people out there going to law, having their cases heard.</P>
      <P>Within the family law area, the main area of work of the law centres at present, I should stress that there always has been a shortage in the case of the Legal Aid Board and the law centres who have never had the resources they reasonably required made available by any Government. The present position is unacceptable but, as I have said, I am hopeful we will be able to increase the resources. Of course, when we achieve the point at which the key, pressing areas of family law are contained, hopefully we would then be in a position to expand the parameters as far as eligibility is concerned and, also hopefully in due course so far as the type of case that may be taken by the law centres is concerned.  One particular aspect mentioned by Members, as I said in response to an earlier question, I am sure Deputy Jim O'Keeffe has mentioned it also as I have, is that of obtaining legal aid for tribunal hearings, one that is very close to my heart.  I hope that at some stage in the lifetime of this government, funding for the Legal Aid Board will be expanded to the point at which we will have the family law position under control and be able to examine that possibility.</P>

I am not, of course, referring to compensatory cases with which there is never any great difficulty in having them processed &mdash; soft claims, as it were, against insurance companies.  I agree with the Minister that there is some evidence that that has gone overboard.  I am talking more about the position of someone who has a legitimate claim, where there is not big money involved, where it is my firm <Col N="1106" /> belief that a democratic society should ensure that a person has access to justice, has an entitlement to have such claim processed.</P>
      <P>Finally, would the Minister agree that a particular problem arises in rural areas, where there is virtually no access to legal aid centres unless somebody is prepared to travel long distances into cities?  Would he agree that, in rural areas people who are not in a position to gain access to justice must rely on the goodwill of solicitors or, alternatively, do not have access to justice?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been entrusted, under the Programme for a Partnership Government, with responsibility for articulating and co-ordinating the implementation of Government policy in relation to travellers.  The programme provides that, in discharging this role, I will be assisted by a task force whose terms of reference will include monitoring and pursuing implementation of Government policy in relation to travellers. The task force will replace the monitoring committee whose term of office expired on 31 December, 1992 and will hold its inaugural meeting on 9 July 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have given the task force wide-ranging terms of reference which will encompass the issue raised by the Deputy.  The involvement of traveller <Col N="1107" /> children in begging impinges on the responsibilities of a number of Government Departments and State agencies such as the Departments of Health and Education, the Garda, health boards and local authorities.</P>
    <P>An <i>ad hoc</i> committee which included officials of local authorities and the Eastern Health Board as well as representatives of the Garda and voluntary agencies dealing with travellers recently presented a report on vulnerable traveller children on the streets to Dublin City Council.  The report recommends that an Outreach worker be appointed to assist with the identification and care of such children.  The committee advised that the worker should be based in one of the voluntary agencies working with young travellers and that the post should be funded by the Department of the Environment through one of the local authorities in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I understand that the report is at present being considered by Dublin City Council.  In addition, the Eastern Health Board are at present examining the question of children begging in the context of their obligations and the development of plans under the Child Care Act, 1991.</P>
    <P>I strongly support the recommendation in the report that an Outreach worker be appointed.  However, this can be regarded as a short term solution only and action is required to address the problem in the longer term.  To this end, I have directed an officer from my Department to meet with representatives of the relevant authorities to discuss ongoing plans to resolve the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree to turn off his long-playing record because he commences the answer to every question about travellers in the same way?  Would he accept that he has handed over responsibility to Deputy McManus, that she is now the Minister, even though he is being paid for the task?</P>

      <P>Would the Minister <Col N="1108" /> agree that it is unacceptable to see very young children, as I saw myself last weekend, of seven, eight and nine years begging at 2 o'clock and 3 o'clock in the morning?  Can he clarify whether this Outreach worker will be in a position to take these children into care when they are found on the streets at that hour?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure Deputy McManus in fulfilling her role on the task force will be investigating all these matters around the clock.  I should say the issue is a problem.  I am pleased to see that Dublin Corporation at least are trying to do something about it.  Their efforts will have my full support.  I will be in communication with the Minister for the Environment on the matter of the Outreach worker.  That will be of some help.  In fulfilment of my co-ordinating role in this regard, as I have said, I have arranged for a senior official of my Department to call in representatives of all relevant authorities to discuss this issue and ascertain what can be done. Within the context of the Eastern Health Board the increased funding now being made available by the Government to the Minister for Health will enable him to play an important role in this regard.</P>

Would he accept that the matter of parents bringing their children, babes in arms and youngsters out on the streets, seems to be an increasing rather than a reducing problem?  Would <Col N="1109" /> he give the House an undertaking to give it high priority and report back to us?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the phenomenon is increasing or reducing but it has been a problem in Dublin ever since I can remember.  I agree with Deputy Flaherty that we must endeavour to tackle it in every way we can.  Certainly I will be happy to work with the relevant authorities to the maximum possible extent.  That is the reason I decided to call them together to address that important issue.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 2 seeks to insert in the Bill a different definition of the person who henceforward will be known as chief special collector.  The amendment I tabled on Committee Stage in that regard was taken in conjunction with amendment No. 56, also tabled in my name.  As I have just received the Report Stage amendments, I do not know if this amendment relates to amendment No. 56.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 61 seeks to define the post of special collector as somebody who is an inspector of taxes and is so designated by the Revenue Commissioners to act in that post. Having regard to the nature of this Bill it is essential that the chief special collector and the special collectors assisting him or her ought to have the skills, training and background to enable them challenge the self-declaration facility contained in the Bill for people seeking the protection of the Bill.  In other words, such people are merely asked to make a self-declaration to the effect that they have been tax cheats in the past, that they intend to amend their ways and that the money they are seeking to protect under the Act has not been involved in any criminal activity.  Effectively, as the Minister conceded on Committee Stage, the special collectors or chief special collector may not challenge that declaration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So long as tax cheats confirm they have been tax cheats in the past, that they regret it and declare they are taking back into this country so many thousands or millions of pounds, the chief special collector may not challenge that; it must be taken at face value.  That is fundamentally wrong because by definition the kind of person who will seek the protection of this Act will already have lied to the Revenue Commissioners in the past, broken the law and evaded his or her proper tax liability and broken exchange controls as they existed. <Col N="1199" /> Despite the fact that he or she is a liar or a cheat, we are asked to accept his or her word at face value.  Every test the Minister brought to bear on this on Committee Stage started from the presumption of honesty.  I accept that in making laws generally that is a fair presumption from which to approach a matter.  However, in this case we are making laws for law breakers and that presumption cannot hold.  Instead, there ought to be a presumption that such people are not telling the truth.  It is wrong that the legislation should preclude the participation in this special unit of people who have the skills, training and background that makes them familiar with the kind of statement with which they will be confronted.  Such people would have the skills and training to examine the statements made by the tax cheats and assess and evaluate them for veracity.</P>
    <P>We will come later to amendments in regard to which the Minister will say that because there is an obligation to make timely returns in respect of the tax year 1992-93 it will be possible for the tax inspector to reconcile the returns of 1992-93 with the self-declaration.  I do not believe that will be possible.  The tax inspector will be inhibited and obstructed in doing that because the special collector will have given the tax cheat a certificate, on production of which the tax inspector must be called off.  That is why I am moving this amendment.  If we are to put this legislation in place it is important that the person to whom the confession is made is in a position to evaluate the validity of that statement.  I do not think that anybody outside the ranks of tax inspectors could possibly know what weight to attach to a statement by a tax cheat.</P>
    <P>In section 3 of the Act there is a provision relating to corporation profits tax which was abolished in 1976.  It therefore appears the expectation is that some people will go back to 1976 and beyond. It seems a fantastic proposition that somebody who has lied and cheated his way through the tax laws since 1976 or <Col N="1200" /> before that can now expect to have his statement taken at face value.  It makes a laugh of the law.  What we are engaged in here is humbug, making law for people who have spent their lives breaking the law and obliging the rest of the tax compliant citizens to carry the cost of the State's social services on their backs.  Just because these tax cheats are powerful people who, presumably, have the ear of powerful people, we are now expected to enact legislation that gives them <i>carte blanche</i> to do as they please and treat them as people who would never go out of their way to tell another lie.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill received a rigorous analysis on Committee Stage and we clearly exposed major flaws in it.  The biggest flaw is that the so-called incentive amnesty relies totally on self-declaration.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte said that the only thing we know about the people in this secrecy deal is that they have a track record of being dishonest.  However, every condition we laid down to make these self-declarations believable has been rejected by the Minister.  These conditions included a requirement for documentary evidence in relation to a total and full declaration of earnings, that audited accounts be produced and that the number of years represented by each declaration be specified as opposed to not stating a specified period.  To get this black certificate they would also have to make a declaration to the Garda Síochána that there was no illegality pertaining to the source of their earnings.  The Minister discarded all the safeguards we sought to give some respectability to this measure.  The Minister has sought, in a grubby way, to maximise revenue and disclosure in an effort to shore up the 1994 public finances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe that these people should be indemnified against the audit process.  It is quite ridiculous that when they have signed up in Dublin Castle, declared a certain figure to be the total sum of their earnings and that it is not from an illegal source, they cannot be refused the certificate.  People will underdeclare their earnings and what is even <Col N="1201" /> more farcical is that the rest of the Revenue Commissioners will not know who has these black certificates.  This means that the Minister's total reliance on 1992-93 returns to ensure compliance is not feasible.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Rabbitte that the people in this special unit should not only be of the rank of inspector of taxes but from the Investigation Unit.  They should be chosen from among the 600 people lined up to do revenue audits this year and who will now be put in quarantine because the whole audit process will have to cease.  The arguments put forward by the Minister on Committee Stage were singularily unconvincing.  People who defaulted will be able to specify an amount which they believe to be reasonable. The only conclusion to which ordinary taxpayers can come is that the tax evaders will pay as they please while they have to pay as they earn, which is patently unfair.  I will, therefore, support amendment No. 1.</P>
    <P>The other amnesty deals with interest and penalties for which there is a precedent in the five previous amnesties since 1932.  There is some basis in law for mitigating interest and penalties but there has never been an amnesty whereby, no matter what tax was owed, it was written off.</P>
    <P>A number of queries were put to me over the weekend.  Anonymous callers from the Border counties told me that they had just come through the audit process and were psychologically traumatised by it.  They had settled for a six figure sum and wondered if there was any way they could have some of the benefits of this amnesty.  Unfortunately I had to tell them the bad news, that this amnesty does not apply to those who have been exposed to the rigours of an audit.  I was also contacted by people who were under the impression that if they brought home £100,000 they would have to pay only £15,000.  There is a gross misunderstanding about this.  It is not a tax on residual cash; it is only a write down of income tax and profits tax to 15 per cent, the full VAT must be paid.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the next most <Col N="1202" /> important reason I support this amendment. Let us take the example of a shopkeeper, say a draper from Tallaght, who comes forward and declares £87,000 and offers to pay 15 per cent of it.  He may not realise that he has suppressed sales of VAT and that he must pay it at different rates, we all know sports goods are charged one rate of VAT, childrens' clothing at another rate, etc.  How is he to recollect which rate is applicable to what?  He would need someone with the expertise this amendment specifies to know exactly how much he should pay under the amnesty because he has to discharge the full VAT arrears that have been disclosed as well as 15 per cent on the earnings.  People may think they will get away with paying only 15 per cent when in fact they will have to pay a much higher amount of tax.  Therefore, the four or five people the Minister lined up should be from the Revenue Commissioners and able to agree the figures with the taxpayer so that the Minister and the taxpayer will know that he has reached the end of his liability and can truly get his affairs up-to-date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to support Deputy Rabbitte's amendment which was discussed at some length on Committee Stage.  This amendment helps anticipate the core of this debate.  The many amendments on Report Stage will enable us examine the multi-layered nature of this legislation.  By dealing with the legislation section by section and not considering the total package we may fail to see how odious and corrupt this Bill is.  Deputy Rabbitte's amendment seeks to provide that professionally competent people be appointed to oversee this amnesty and be given power to ask questions. Corruption is being effectively legalised.  This is perverse legislation.  It provides that tax avoidance gains, which are lawful whatever about being ethical, are unlawful under the amnesty, but that evasion which is illegal is lawful under the amnesty.  Lawfulness and illegality are determined by what a person may say is an &ldquo;Alice in Wonderland&rdquo; approach <Col N="1203" /> to this legislation and that is how this will operate.</P>
      <P>If Deputy Rabbitte's amendment is rejected, someone who has consistently cheated the system and evaded tax will be offered a bargain-basement write-off in respect of all liabilities up to 5 April 1991.  If such a person makes a declaration it cannot be questioned.  It must be accepted and without any discretion converted by a special collector into a certificate for the payment of the 15 per cent tax.  Such a certificate is one of virtual absolute tax immunity.  The Minister today and on Committee Stage stated that this is not an absolute tax immunity, but is conditional on the completion of the 1992-93 tax form.  He said that was not cheating.</P>
      <P>The only information the Revenue will have on a tax evader in respect of 1992-93 tax returns will be whatever details a tax liar, cheat or dodger submits on a tax declaration form.  I do not understand how the Revenue, who are ignorant of a tax evader's affairs up to 5 April 1991, will become omniscient in regard to his or her 1992-93 tax declaration and, therefore will be able to investigate a tax evader's affairs.  That defies logic.</P>
      <P>The Revenue are clearly not up to the task because information is the key to tax evasion.  The tax cheat and not the Revenue has access to that information. The information will be the key to securing a certificate of immunity.  If a special collector, or the chief special collector referred to in the amendment, issues a certificate to an errant taxpayer or an evader that person may produce the certificate of immunity to a tax inspector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 5 provides that forthwith a tax inspector shall cease an investigation unless he or she can establish with an appeals commissioner that he or she has grounds to show that the person who made the declaration was grossly in error. What grounds should such a tax inspector have?  The tax file in respect of that person will contain a blank sheet.  The only information in that file will be the 1992-93 tax return completed by the defaulter.  It is illogical to say that in <Col N="1204" /> practice the Revenue will investigate everyone who completes this declaration. Positive proof of this may be found in section 7.  The ultimate perversity of this may be seen in that section which states that the person who has consistently evaded, dodged and cheated on his or her tax liability may claim an amnesty under section 2 and get a certificate of immunity which is virtually absolute under section 5.</P>
    <P>The public servant to whom the declaration is given and to whom the money is paid may have to pay a fine.  That public servant is not trusted by the Government or the Minister to carry out his or her functions under the law.  He or she may be fined for breaches of confidentiality. There is no precedent for a Minister, on behalf of the Government, to suggest that public servants should not be trusted to implement what will be the law of the land perverse as that law will be.  This position reflects an extraordinary lack of trust.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I appealed to the Minister to withdraw that odious section which provides for the imposition of a fine on his public servants who contravene the declaration of confidentiality. That is an extraordinary perversion of the ordinary due process of the public service and of law.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte's amendment attempts to provide that the operation of an amnesty should not be so wide in its remit and take account of pertinent details.  If I wished to avail of this amnesty and was the greatest crook in shoe leather but made a declaration that income I am declaring is my evaded income of the past that cannot be challenged.  Under this Bill I cannot be questioned.  I can be asked to complete a form.  I may have been a cheat and obtained the money illegally but the Revenue must take my word in regard to where I obtained those earnings.</P>
    <P>This foul Bill legislates for corruption and introduces fines on public servants who may be assiduous in their duties. The Minister has gone so far to guarantee confidentiality that he will fine his own public servants.  That proves to me that <Col N="1205" /> the overall concern in this legislation is to produce a charter for tax dodgers so that they can be assured that unless they are stupid in regard to their future income declarations they can be guaranteed a write-off of 15 per cent under this nod and wink legislation.  This is disgraceful, unprincipled and unethical legislation which for the first time elevates the tax cheats and dodgers to a status where they are rewarded.  It provides that if public servants are in breach of confidentiality the law will come down on them like a ton of bricks and that is a disgrace.</P>
    <P>If this legislation provides for a bargain basement tax write-off rate, which I object to in principle, the least that should be demanded is some documentary account of where people obtained funds.  We should learn something from such tax evasion.  The special collectors will not be permitted to report any new tax dodges to the Revenue because they are not allowed to ask the self-declared tax cheats how they evaded tax.  They must swear an oath to hear no evil, see no evil and speak no evil because they must solemnly swear that any information they acquire or have access to in the course of discharging special collection functions shall be kept totally confidential. We are opening up an exclusive club where special collectors can talk to each other.  This club is small and elitist in the sense of the numbers involved and it is much more exclusive than the K Club.</P>
    <P>If these special collectors talk to anybody else they are liable, under this oath, to be fined.  They cannot even say to their colleagues in Revenue, &ldquo;We cannot give you the details in regard to Sheets A-Z but we can tell you some of the interesting ruses that these people use&rdquo;. That cannot be done because of the declaration clause that is included in the Bill which simply says that the forms must be completed as required, declare that the money was not obtained illegally and no more.  A certificate of immunity then ensues and despite what has been said about apprehending these people at a later date that will not happen.  Deputy <Col N="1206" /> Rabbitte's amendment is perfectly justified. We should get these people into the net to learn what we can about their methods of tax evasion and not treat them with kid gloves.  They have behaved disgracefully in terms of their social responsibility and I hope, even at this late stage, the Minister will see sense and take on board the need for some accountability.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to delay the proceedings much longer as I know my colleagues wish to debate other issues.  However, I have not had an opportunity to speak about this Bill.  I do not intend making a Second Stage speech now but I wish to echo what Deputy Cox said.  This is vile, base, disgraceful and corrupt legislation.  It reflects badly on this House that we are passing it, it reflects extremely badly on the Minister that he is sponsoring it and it reflects even more on this Government that it would countenance it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte's amendment is the litmus test of how disgraceful this legislation is.  If the methodology of corruption and tax evasion is to be kept a matter of secrecy then, as Deputy Cox said, we are not even learning from our errors by this measure.  If people are sworn to secrecy even as to the identity of the people involved, which might give some clue as to what they were doing and if, in turn, the special collector of taxes is prevented by law from making an inquiry as to precisely how the criminal act of evasion took place, how can we say that this Parliament is upholding the law in so far as we then enact legislation to keep secret from those to whom we entrust the care and maintenance of the Revenue's information which ought to be in the hands of the State as to how that system is failing and as to how corrupt people are circumventing it?  We cannot say that we are upholding the law and this Minister is spitting in the face of the Revenue Commissioners, its staff, its standards and its ambitions to conserve our revenues by asking it to participate in this grubby exercise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Deputy Rabbitte's amendment was <Col N="1207" /> accepted it would open the window slightly into this horrible mess of corruption and would perhaps enable the Revenue Commissioners to learn from experience how people evaded the system with a view to preventing them from doing it again.  But because of this iron wall of secrecy around the system the very learning process which Deputy Cox mentioned, and which Deputy Rabbitte's amendment is designed to sustain, is prevented.  In its place is an absolute immunity for criminals.  I believe the Minister shares their criminal responsibility by retrospectively ordaining that, effectively, it is to go unpunished.  Every Deputy who votes for this measure and who rejects these kinds of amendments put forward by the Opposition shares in the crime, shares in the vice that lay behind the crime and takes upon himself the standards that are involved.</P>

      <P>By failing to accept Deputy Rabbitte's amendment the Minister is loading the scales against this Bill when it comes before the courts.  I hope this measure is cast down by the courts when it comes before them for adjudication. By brazenly refusing to allow the Revenue &mdash; and doubtless these points will be made before a court when the time comes &mdash; to know even the methodology of criminality which is being absolved by this Act, the Minister is adding further to the unconstitutionality of this measure.  Although the measure has been widened since it was originally announced, I adhere to the point I made at the outset namely, that it amounts to an arbitrary, invidious discrimination against compliant taxpayers and this rejection of Deputy Rabbitte's amendment adds to that point.</P>
      <P>The whole tenure and complexion of the provisions are so fraught with an absolution of corruption that I believe the courts of this land, when the matter comes before them, will turn it down. Obviously, every Member of this House is entitled to his or her own view about the constitutionality of this matter but in my view it is unconstitutional.  I hope I am right when the matter comes to be proven.  I hope that this measure is cast down and I hope the courts vindicate standards which apparently the Government of this country is unwilling to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a proviso in section 7 of the Bill which states that the Revenue Commissioners are entitled to revoke the nomination of special collectors but where they revoke the nomination of the person who is chief special collector, they have to nominate a chief special collector <Col N="1209" /> in his place.  This is in case the Revenue Commissioners might have rush of blood to the head and refuse to operate the scheme by failing to nominate a successor where they revoke one person's appointment. If one examines this provisio, a duty is cast on the Revenue Commissioners to appoint someone to do this nefarious act even if they were minded not to do so themselves.  In another context Deputy Cox has pointed out to me that there is a childlike mistake in this Bill, for which Deputy Cox will receive the credit later, in relation to another aspect of enforcement and anti-evasion which shows that this Bill has been put together in haste and that it has not been well considered.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister, even at this eleventh hour, to accept what Deputy Rabbitte is putting forward as a reasonable amendment, to withdraw from this Bill some of its most obnoxious qualities or, alternatively, leave these obnoxious qualities in the Bill so that the courts can do the leagues in Government should have done a long time ago.</P>

      <P>One of the essential aspects of financial matters is confidentiality. It was on that basis that people, who avoided paying tax when tax was 70p in the pound and when we in Opposition said the amount of tax was penal and a disincentive, invested their money in areas where there was total confidentiality.  In order to ensure that the money is returned a similar level of confidentiality must apply in this case.  One would be foolish to think there are no bank accounts held confidentially that are not strictly within the law.  I am somewhat amused by Deputy McDowell's comment about criminality among Members of the House.  Do his comments apply equally to the legal profession who plead the innocence of somebody in court only to find afterwards that the person is guilty?  Confidentiality is essential for the success of this amnesty.</P>

      <P>Following a very detailed Committee <Col N="1210" /> Stage, Opposition spokespersons are broadening the issue on Report Stage, but I will try not to delay too long on the matter.  As regards Deputy Rabbitte's amendment, inspectors of taxes are not excluded from becoming special collectors since they too are officers of the Revenue Commissioners.  Presumably Deputy Rabbitte intends that the special collection office should be staffed by inspectors so that they can examine and investigate whether complete declarations of undisclosed income and gains are made by individuals availing of the amnesty.</P>
      <P>It will not be the task of the special collectors to examine and investigate cases.  I accept that some Deputies would like modern Ireland to be different.  They have difficulty in believing, at least under this section, that there are thousands of people who for many years have had undisclosed tax liabilities.  Perhaps when dealing with later sections their views may change.  Deputies have had more briefings on collectors than I have had. There are thousands of individuals outside the system who are not known to Revenue, who are holding back at least part of their taxes on an annual basis and have done so for several years.  Many of these people ignored the 1988 amnesty and will take the opportunity of availing of this amnesty.  Alternatively, they will continue to remain outside the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Special collectors will receive declarations and admittances and will issue certificates.  They are specifically nominated to provide a confidential collection service.  If we do not ensure confidentiality, as was proven in 1988, individuals will not use this amnesty. Individuals with undisclosed liabilities, not only on income tax but all taxes, whether it be capital gains, VAT, PAYE, CAT, surtax, stamp duties or corporation tax, will ignore the amnesty and remain outside the law, as they have done for years, if we do not ensure confidentiality. One matter that has been established in debates on this matter is that there are thousands of people with undisclosed liabilities who are known to banks and financial institutions.  Banks fear that if I <Col N="1211" /> were to follow the laws of the United Kingdom, America or other European countries, we would lose all the money in reserve &mdash; figures were quoted as to the amounts that might be lost if these rogues are not brought into the net.  In these circumstances interest rates would zoom and great difficulties would arise.</P>
    <P>Special collectors will not examine or investigate cases.  Confidentiality is essential for the success of the incentive amnesty.  It will help to maximise tax revenue which would never be collected otherwise.  I have a greater doubt now than I had five or six weeks ago whether there is a will in my political party to follow these rogues.  All parties in Opposition believe that non-compliant taxpayers are part of the make-up of the country.</P>

      <P>When Deputy Rabbitte read out the letter stating that I should double the fine, I started to believe that I may have got the section wrong.  I reexamined the matter and, in line with Deputy Cox's suggestion, introduced an amendment in that regard.</P>
      <P>In regard to the declarations, Deputies asked what would happen in terms of the absolute immunity.  There is no absolute immunity.  The declaration must be full and complete.  It must be accurate and must indicate that the income or gains are not received from an illegal source or activity.  There is no immunity whatsoever from investigation by the Revenue Commissioners of the 1992 certificate.  A non-compliant individual with liabilities pre-April 1991 presents himself or herself, or their adviser, to the special collection office and in the case of income tax and capital gains tax 15 per cent interest is paid.  In the case of VAT the rate is 100 per cent and the money is paid to the special collection unit.  All other taxes are paid to Revenue in the normal way.  In the case of others taxes such as PAYE, CAT, stamp duty and residential property tax, excluding PRSI the full 100 per cent is paid to Revenue in the normal way and interest is not paid on penalties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, before 31 January 1994 the 1992-93 tax form must be completed.  If people were never in the system that will give an audit trail to Revenue for the first time.  There is no immunity from investigation of the 1992-93 tax form which must be filled in before anyone can benefit under the incentive amnesty.  If <Col N="1213" /> the inspector establishes &mdash; I hope this will not have to be established because people who use this amnesty will be those who decide it is time to abide by the law &mdash; substantial capital income in 1992-93, the taxpayer will have to be sure his declaration is correct.  Otherwise the inspector will work back from 1992/1993 to catch the taxpayer abusing the amnesty. There can be no case for a VAT write down as after all it is the customer's tax and it must be taken correctly.  The Government has taken the view that the fiduciary taxes must be paid in full.</P>
    <P>If an individual was not previously known to the Revenue, that is its starting point.  The knowledge represents progress and there is now a trail for audit purposes.  I was asked about the audit cases excluded from the amnesty.  The amnesty is an incentive to individuals to bring their tax up to date by making a declaration of previously undeclared income and gains and paying tax on that income.  Cases subject to audit are those in which the inspector of taxes has begun &mdash; or is about to begin &mdash; an audit or investigation designed to unearth any tax evasion by the taxpayer.  Where such evasion is unearthed by investigation it is not appropriate that the taxpayer should be allowed to settle his affairs by paying reduced amounts.  As the House will recall, the areas excluded are agreed with the inspector but not paid.  Decrees with the sheriff for collection, applications for attachment or under appeal with solicitors must be paid in full to the Revenue. People will gain the benefit of not paying interest on penalties but will have to pay the full amounts.</P>
    <P>To achieve the objective of obtaining some of the tax yields, section 2 excluded from the scope of the 15 per cent charge any tax not paid by virtue of the tax avoidance schemes.  The reason for this exclusion is that the funds covered by the schemes are already in the tax net and the question of whether any tax falls to be paid on these funds depends on whether the tax avoidance scheme succeeds. By using tax avoidance schemes the taxpayer is in effect declaring that his income or capital gains would otherwise <Col N="1214" /> be taxable.  These funds are, therefore, in a very different category from funds that have never been declared.</P>
    <P>The need for the office of the chief special collector to continue indefinitely is to ensure that somebody is always in a position to validate the amnesty certificates.</P>

      <P>A number of times on Committee Stage and just now the Minister made the point that there is no absolute immunity.  Then he went on to say, in an unforgettable phrase, that it is &ldquo;absolutely conditional.&rdquo;  It reminded me of Deputy Brian Lenihan's famous remark about the &ldquo;futility of consistency.&rdquo; It is neither true nor accurate returns.  Section 4, to which the Minister referred, withdraws the benefit of the amnesty either under section 2 or section 3 of the Bill from people who do not duly deliver a return of income on or before the specified date in relation to that return.  They are required to make a timely return but it does not say anything anywhere about an obligation to make an accurate return.  It would not be possible to know whether it is accurate, so they are required to make a return.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course.  We should not persist in a sterile argument.  I know my colleagues are anxious to discuss other important matters in this Bill and, as Deputy Cox said, it is almost impossible not to broaden the issue because it does not make any sense in isolation. The Minister said &mdash; almost as if it was something about which we should be relieved &mdash; that it is not the role of the special collector to investigate or probe, merely to receive declarations.  That is the whole point of my amendment.  Even if one holds Deputy Davern's views about the merits of the amnesty, I do not know how it will offend his position to have somebody reasonably well informed receiving these taxpayers.  In other words, we should have the skills and training of the tax inspector so that at least he can spot a major criminal, for example, by virtue of the statement he makes.  Under the system as it operates, unless the taxpayer is wearing very gaudy Mickey Mouse underpants the special collector would not know the situation from Adam.  I cannot see how the Minister can make that out to be a benefit.  I will quote a paragraph from the statement from IMPACT, which represents tax inspectors.  It is surely one of the marvellously positive things about the public service that although all the estimable gentlemen at the right hand of the Minister disagree fundamentally with what he is doing, as I do, they will nonetheless ply him liberally with notes on the correct position on various things. However, their union speaks for them, and on this point it said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole concept of a Special Collector is designed to ensure that the left hand will not know what the right hand is doing.  At best this will be an administrative nightmare.  At worst it will provide immunity from audit for anyone who makes a half baked disclosure. All intending tax cheats would be well advised to make a small disclosure, get his certificate from the <Col N="1216" /> special collector and thumb his nose at the Tax Inspector or indeed the Collector General when they seek to collect the proper taxes.  The penalty provisions in Section 9 can have no &ldquo;bite&rdquo; if the Inspector is deliberately kept in the dark and prevented from making inquiries.</P>
    <P>That is the situation in a nutshell.  The same statement also said, giving the Minister's view:</P>
    <P>The legislation provides that an Inspector will be free to re-examine the case where he has reasonable grounds for believing that the declaration to the Special Collector is not a full disclosure.</P>
    <P>The tax inspectors say:</P>
    <P>This is circumvented in a number of ways.</P>
    <P>1.  The inspector can be prevented from commencing the investigation by the production of a receipt from the Special Collector.</P>
    <P>If one produces this badge of dishonour, the tax inspector may go no further.</P>
    <P>2.  If however the Inspector has managed to commence the investigation without the tax cheat's knowledge, the investigation can be stopped by applying to the Appeal Commissioners and requiring the Inspector to provide evidence that the declaration to the Special Collector was not a full declaration.  Since the Inspector is legally prevented from accessing the information which the Special Collector was given it is impossible to establish that it was incorrect in the first place.</P>
    <P>One cannot produce evidence before the appeals commissioner.</P>
    <P>3.  The information provided on receipt from the Special Collector cannot assist the Inspector as it can cover several years and does not indicate the commencement year.</P>
    <P>It is absolute immunity, contrary to what the Minister says except perhaps where <Col N="1217" /> some bigtime tax cheat is stupid enough to trip himself up.  We dealt with this matter on Committee Stage but I do not think that somebody in this league who can pay for the best tax advice in the city is likely to make returns in respect of the year 1992-93 that will not reconcile with the self-declaration he has made in the first instance.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell made the important point that because there will be absolute secrecy we will be prevented from learning anything about the methodology used in tax evasion.  As I put it on Committee Stage the special collector may not utter in his or her sleep what he or she has discovered on a particular day because they could be open to a penalty.  It is farcical that the special collector is open to a penalty&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This is a no questions asked amnesty. If the Minister is serious about imposing no bar on tax inspectors, all he has to do is accept this amendment.  He knows as well as I do that there is a bar, they will not be drawn from the ranks of tax inspectors.  He admitted on Committee Stage that there was a rumour or a push to have it contracted outside the Revenue Commissioners entirely.  Even if one accepts Deputy Davern's point of view about the necessity for confidentiality &mdash; I understood that the Revenue Commissioners operated on that basis &mdash; I think this is unnecessary.  The litmus test is whether the Minister accepts it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;individual&rdquo;, other than an individual who was a beneficiary of section 72 of the Finance Act, 1988, has the remeaning assigned to it by section 2 (2);.</P>
      <P>In this amendment I seek to preclude those individuals who benefited under the 1988 amnesty.  The only distinction between amendment No. 3 and amendment No. 5, which relates to persons, is that the definition in amendment No. 5 is taken from section 3 which deals with the general amnesty and in which an array of taxes, including corporation tax, is listed in addition to the taxes covered by the main amnesty.  People may benefit from both.  I seek to preclude those who benefited under the 1988 amnesty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister is serious about attempting to introduce a tax compliant culture then the last thing he should contemplate is sending out signals or making a positive declaration by way of enacting a law, that if a person will not benefit under this amnesty there will be another one around the corner, or even if they will benefit they should hold out, keep the Revenue Commissioners at bay and there will be another amnesty under which they can benefit a second time. The purpose of this amendment is to prevent this recurring amnesty culture, which is an appalling vista for those who attempt to pay their lawful taxes or those who do not have any choice, as in the case of the PAYE sector who have their taxes deducted each week.  As Deputy <Col N="1219" /> Davern has said, the tax system has been punitive in the extreme in the past for those citizens in the tax net who are paying their lawful taxes.  It has been an inordinate burden on them.</P>
    <P>We are now saying that there are two sets of tax laws.  There is one set for those who have no way of avoiding their taxes because they are deducted from their cheque each week, or for a self-employed person who is struggling to keep his taxes up to date; but there is a different set for those who can afford to pay for good advice and to keep the Revenue Commissioners at bay.  They will benefit.  In the case of the main amnesty all they will have to pay is 15 per cent and all their past sins will be forgiven.</P>
    <P>This is what I call the Tallaght bus amnesty.  We might not know when the next one is coming, but as sure as you are sitting there, a Cheann Comhairle, it will come and all that those on the inside track, who have the ear of powerful people and have inside information, have to do is keep the Revenue Commissioners at bay and at the stroke of a pen they will get away virtually scot free. Deputy Yates mentioned that the people who contacted him over the weekend are very sore given that they have had their full liabilities squeezed out of them in recent months, presumably with penalties, and now they find at the toss of a coin they are on the wrong side of the magic date of 25 May with the result that they are caught.</P>
    <P>The final and most important point I wish to make in favour of the amendment to prevent those who benefited in 1988 from benefiting again is that the Minister himself has claimed that these people are already in the tax net.  There are two categories: the main amnesty and the general amnesty.  In the case of the general amnesty they are already in the tax net.  If they are already in the tax net the Minister has the machinery available to him to go after them and get the taxes they owe to the State.  On Second Stage the Minister said in respect of the 1988 amnesty:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1220" /> New tax head records were set up in no more than 1,000 cases and of those who availed only 366 individual taxpayers and 13 companies were not previously recorded by Revenue under any tax head.  To put these figures in perspective, while an exact figure for the number of taxpayers who availed of the 1988 scheme cannot be derived there were some 170,000 inquiries to Revenue about that scheme and the number of payments received by the Collector General in that year was some 357,000 more than in 1987.</P>
    <P>The point the Minister was making was that we should look at those fantastic figures &mdash; 170,000 inquiries and an extra 357,000 payments &mdash; yet only 13 companies and 366 individuals were not in the tax net.  That is most extraordinary having regard to the fact that they contributed more than £500 million.  If these people are already in the tax net why do we need to persist and allow them benefit under an amnesty again?</P>
    <P>Taxpaying citizens, whether they are in business or just as individuals, are surely asking, &ldquo;Why should we bother paying our taxes for the next four or five years when, with any bit of luck, money will be badly needed after the next general election to do all the things those who support Deputy Davern's side of the argument say need to be done, and there will be another amnesty?&rdquo; We cannot continue to operate one law for the rich and another law for the remainder of income earners.  If we continue to wipe out with the stroke of a pen the taxes owed by the rich and powerful we will produce a reaction from people who are crippled by tax.</P>

      <P>My amendment No. 7 also proposes that those who availed of the 1988 amnesty should not have the benefit of his amnesty.  Apropos the Minister's remarks, I do not believe that there are very large numbers of people completely outside the system.  On Committee Stage I outlined a number of examples of evasion which I had come across, for example, invoices from Luxembourg, fictitious accounts for non-existent management services and export contracts to the UK for which a sum was deposited in a UK bank account.  People involved in this sort of evasion are already in the tax net.  I do not believe a person can live in this country without having an RSI number of some description.  I do not believe there are people living in this country who have totally escaped the tax system.  What we have is an underdisclosure of tax by tax evaders.  In other words, they will tell you some of the story but they will not tell you all of it.  I will be very surprised if more than 1,000 people &mdash; the Paddy Murphys about whom the Revenue Commissioners have never heard tell before &mdash; are brought into the system under this amnesty.  It is interesting that the Minister has not given any forecasts of the yield from this amnesty.  He is being very coy about this.</P>

      <P>The very minimum the Minister should do is ensure that the people who availed of the 1988 amnesty and who have probably been waiting for this bus to come along should not have the benefit of this amnesty.  On Committee Stage I outlined a case involving a company which in late 1988 had to borrow £20,000 to pay what it owed.  The owners sweated blood and tears trying to keep their company afloat. They hoped they would get a refund under this amnesty of the interest on the penalties.  However, they will get no refund at all.

In view of the number of amendments which were accepted, we might have profited more from being in sunnier climates.  The Deputy was missed particularly during the debate on hare coursing in Priavte Members' time, not to mention other legislation which no doubt we will come to again.  That legislation was rushed through in the Deputy's absence.</P>
      <P>Anyone who avails of the interest amnesty should be obliged to fill in a direct debit form for the future.  If this had been done under the previous amnesty it would have put a stop to those people who have cash flow problems and habitually pay their tax late; they do everything possible not to pay on time. Unfortunately we did not get an opportunity to debate my amendment on Committee Stage.  My amendment No. 42 which is similar, is reasonable.  The Minster could do this by way of administrative order.  He said this morning that the Revenue Commissioners had to approve particular cases involving access to bank accounts.  I think the Minister has made 14 statements in recent months welcoming the consecutive cuts in interest rates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am making is that the rate of interest payable on late tax is 1.25 per cent per month or 15 per cent per annum.  This is totally out of line with the current AAA rate, AA rate or A rate.  In view of the fact that he was prepared to write it off in 1988 and 1993, the Minister should do the decent thing and make the rate of interest reviewable every six months or every month with some commercial rate the double A rate or whatever.  It is very unfair to treat one group so savagely and another group so leniently.</P>
      <P>It has come to my attention that all is not as it should be or might be in terms of efficiency in the Collector General's office.  I have received complaints about this office from both within and without, so to speak.  Even inspectors of taxes are very frustrated about the inefficiency of that office.  This inefficiency is one of the reasons people fall behind in paying their taxes.</P>
      <P>People who availed of the 1988 amnesty did well; they did much better than those who paid interest charges before and after 1988.  There is no way that these people should be able to benefit from another amnesty.  My amendment is reasonable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with amendments Nos. 6 and 73 presently.  I supported amendments Nos. 3, 5 and 7 at length on Committee Stage and I do not see the need to repeat the arguments now except to say that if we allow people who availed of the amnesty in 1988 to avail again of this amnesty there is no clearer way of <Col N="1225" /> underwriting and creating an amnesty culture in the minds of taxpayers.  That is the phrase I used on Committee Stage and to my mind it is the key phrase.  What we are allowing for is recidivism &mdash; to use the kind of jargon applied to people in prison &mdash; those in trouble use an amnesty but, like habitual offenders, they start off again and use another amnesty.  These recidivists should not be allowed double amnesties because it creates the expectation that an amnesty will be available to them.  More than anything else, the inclusion of people in this amnesty who availed already of a previous amnesty and who as a result are known to the tax authorities is the most invidious discrimination against the compliant taxpayers. Now people who have been doubly non-compliant get a double bonus and those cited by Deputy Yates end up with a penalty.  That kind of amnesty recidivism should be outlawed and for that reason I support these amendments.</P>
      <P>In your absence, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, one of my colleagues, Deputy Michael McDowell, suggested that the Minister and others who voted for this, shared criminal responsibility for criminal acts.

      <P>The Minister in his response to the last set of amendments talked about special collectors.  Even if these are not Revenue staff in the ordinary sense with collection skills, as Deputy Rabbitte suggested, it really would not matter what skills they had because the special <Col N="1226" /> collector is like a receptacle, a letterbox of sorts, into which you put your declaration duly filled out and to whom you remit a cheque by the due date.  It seems to me that the special collection process is essentially that.  On that basis I could recommend for the job someone who is perfectly qualified, given that it is not going to strain their means.  The Minister may recall that one of the characters in Myles na gCopaleen's writing about &ldquo;the Brother&rdquo; was his dog, Eugene.  In one episode he writes that the dog was taken up to the Park one day to be interviewed by a Sergeant Kissane for a job as a Garda inspector, informant and tout.  His key qualification, according to the Brother, was that the dog Eugene was an iron disciplinarian, just like the Brother himself.  It seems to me that Eugene, the Brother's dog, would be a perfectly qualified candidate for the special collector role, because the dog could ask a set of questions of the people who make the declarations just as articulate as the special collectors themselves.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 6 and 73 relate to a point I dealt with at length this morning and I will deal with it more briefly now. These amendments deal with resident and non-resident accounts and the powers that exist further on in the Bill for the Revenue authorities in the normal course of events to look for the right of review of bank accounts for periods not exceeding ten years.  I expressed the fear that because of the way the law is defined under the relevant legislation, which goes back to section 18 of the Finance Act, 1983, the only accounts that could be looked at were the bona fide accounts held by persons and that the non-resident accounts could not be looked at.  Rather <Col N="1227" /> than rehearse all the arguments again, let me say that the Minister pointed out that, under section 13 (2) (<i>i</i>), bogus non-resident accounts held by persons ordinarily resident in the State could be included because of the following provision within brackets in that section: &ldquo;being an account or accounts from which the person may withdraw monies&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In drawing my attention to this, the Minister said that, effectively, it could take in a bogus non-resident account.  It might be worthwhile considering a belt and braces approach to this matter.  I suggested that the definition of a person in the 1983 legislation should stand save in so far as persons and amnesties are referred to in sections 2 or 3 of this Bill and that the definition should also include those holding bogus non-resident accounts.  I have used more felicitous language, but that is more or less what I am getting at.  The reason I make that suggestion is that I fear that the belt, which he has got, in the absence of the braces, which I am suggesting, could still allow people to slip through.  For example, if I have an account and am aware that this legislation is on the way through the system, am I not in a position to put mandates on the account to the effect that this may be my account but the only person who can draw from it under mandate will be, for example, Deputy Rabbitte?  Equally, Deputy Rabbitte may have an account and he might name me as the only person mandated to draw from it.  But since because of the mandates neither of us was the person entitled to draw from the account of which we were the beneficial owner, I do not know if the Minister's particular prescription would include that or not.  I made the issue explicit in amendments Nos. 6 and 73 and I recommend that the Minister consider a belt and braces approach.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, the amnesty started life as a way of bringing hot money from abroad into Ireland and it then matured into bringing hot money in Ireland into the system, because possibly people may have had bogus non-resident accounts.  It <Col N="1228" /> is important, if the amnesty relates to any such accounts, that those accounts should be subject to potential review in the future where there are reasonable grounds for such on the part of an inspector and where all the other conditions we spoke about earlier today apply.  Amendment No. 75 effectively covers the same point.  The Minister consistently makes the points that he is rewarding non-compliance up to 5 April 1991 with a view to encouraging better future compliance. My amendment No. 75 relates to these non-resident accounts and I suggest that, whatever about the practice that has occurred&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I had agreed to this at the outset, but I had to flick through pages to find out what was in amendment No. 73.  On Committee Stage Amendment No. 75 was related to amendments Nos. 3 and 73.  This completes the point, because it does not stand alone logically. It seems to me, whatever may have been the practice about opening a bank account to date for the future we should say, as stated in my amendment No. 75, that when opening a bank account within the State evidence should be produced of who one is, and giving one's ordinary residence.  Then whatever may have happened <i>vis-à-vis</i> such accounts in the past, at least it would not recur in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I might comment on Deputy Yates' remark that he would find it very difficult to imagine anybody in this country not having an RSI number.  I do not believe that Deputy Yates is as naïve as he says he is in this respect.  There are thousands of people who are not claiming unemployment benefit, dole or any sickness benefit and who do not pay any income tax.  Any Member living in a rural area will know that if one goes to pay such a person for repairing, say, one's washing machine or one's car, the mention <Col N="1229" /> of a cheque will mean that one's floor will be left flooded or one's car flat on four wheels, so that one will never call that person again in an emergency.</P>
      <P>I should like to see such people being brought within the system because they are making quite a good living but do not pay anything into the system. Indeed, I have endeavoured to encourage some of them to do so, for their own sake or that of their wives and children, so that, if the worst came to the worst their dependants would be catered for. There are very many people who have left their original jobs, or lived on small pensions who have vanished from the system, who just do not appear on the records.  The introduction of the composite RSI number by the Department of Social Welfare two years ago was a good move because all those people will now be recorded.  But the people to whom I first referred do not have bank accounts or accounts with credit unions.  To all intents and purposes they do not exist with the exception of those local people who have resort to their expertise and pay them in cash.  Otherwise people will not reap the benefit of their expertise in any given emergency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with some of the comments made by Members opposite, especially those remarks about an amnesty culture having grown up amongst the self-employed.  From experience of dealing with business people since 1988 I have encountered a much more responsible attitude on their part with regard to the payment of taxes, endeavouring to keep their VAT, PRSI and income tax payments up to date.  A number of people who will benefit under this general amnesty, comprised mostly of smaller shopkeepers, publicans, small garage repair people, who borrowed money in 1988 in order to bring their payments up to date, discovered that with increasing interest rates and the fall-off in business generally, they got into trouble again.  Even though I should prefer to see everybody pay on the due date &mdash; afterwards paying interest and/or penalties <Col N="1230" /> if necessary &mdash; in practice it is better to keep these people in operation rather than force them to close their businesses and have to claim social welfare benefits. It is important &mdash; and I am glad to see this happening again &mdash; that there be local collection units, with inspectors calling to business people to collect amounts due.  Indeed, the practice generally in business has been that if a creditor does not come knocking on the door, he or she will be the last person to be paid. Therefore, I am glad to note Revenue adopting a new attitude to collection procedures.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would say why a surcharge is not deemed to be a penalty. I understand that it is treated as a tax.  I suppose a Senior Counsel in our midst could explain the difference between a surcharge and a penalty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte asked earlier why I was wrong and he was right. I want to place on the record again that section 4 (3) (a) reads:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1) &ldquo;return of income&rdquo; and &ldquo;specified date&rdquo; have the meanings assigned to them by section 48 of the Finance Act, 1986.</P>
      <P>I might add that &ldquo;return of income&rdquo; in section 48 of the Finance Act, 1986, means a return, statement, declaration or list which a person is required to deliver to the inspector by reason of a notice given by him under any one or more of the specified sections.  While I do not wish to argue the point again with Deputy Rabbitte, there is a clear link between the two sections because section 4 (3) (b) reads:</P>
      <P>(b) The provisions of subsection (1) (b) of section 48 of the Finance Act, 1986, shall apply for the purposes of subsection (1) (a) of this section as they apply for the purposes of that section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This ensures that, in the circumstances outlined in those provisions, the fraudulent or negligent delivery of an incorrect return, failure to rectify a known error in a return which has been delivered to the inspector, and failure to respond to an <Col N="1231" /> inspector's inquiry in relation to a return which has been delivered to him, a person will not be regarded as having made a return of income on or before the specified date in relation to that return.  In reality that is what will happen down the road, that in due course we shall all encounter people who will wonder why this linkage obtains.  That is what will happen.  I do not wish to go back over all the arguments which have been made.</P>

      <P>Clearly there are still individuals outside the net who did not take advantage of the 1988 amnesty.  I <Col N="1233" /> agree with Deputy Yates that most of them are probably sole traders suppressing income because companies are excluded.  They do not have their house in order and have remained marginally outside the system.  They have a decision to make as to whether they want to get their tax affairs in order.  I hope they will cease suppressing anything and get absolutely 100 per cent credit.  We all want a compliance rate of nearly 100 per cent and we hope to achieve it.</P>
      <P>I should like to deal with the questions on section 13, referred to by Deputy Cox, that an inspection of taxes may lead to the appeals commissioners having access to the bank account of a person who by definition, must be ordinarily resident in the State.  When the provision was being framed consideration was given to a person making a bogus non-resident declaration where he or she has rights of access to a bank account when maybe in a non-resident's name.  If you are the beneficiary and have the power to withdraw you could still be caught.  We are trying to make it difficulty for people to open several accounts.  Deputy Rabbitte put it well this morning when he said there is a huge fear in the country.  Unfortunately the wrong people are frightened. The person who has very little finance is the one who panics.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I will examine that issue.  It is a complex and difficult area and if you alter one part you can run into difficulties.  The question of whether a person opening an account is a resident or a non-resident is always complex because people use other addresses.  We tend to think of bank accounts as being fairly static.  We think that when an account is open there will be many transactions in it over the years, this happens but it is not always the case.  In particular, money deposited in this country on the money market by non-residents is often deposited for short periods and the second deposit will generally be made to <Col N="1234" /> a new account.  It is a complex area but I will certainly look at it.  In the Finance Act, 1992, I addressed a problem of requiring declarations and auditors' certificates, including the tax reference numbers for companies opening DIRT free accounts.  I also introduced a significant declaration system on the opening of the special savings accounts and stringent reporting requirements on institutions and other financial intermediaries who help to open accounts abroad for Irish residents.  The Department of Finance and the Revenue informed the banks and building societies that if there is evidence of inadequate care in policing the new system they will take the necessary legislative or administrative action.</P>
      <P>I was responsible for introducing the Payment of Wages Act.  I amended the Acts dating from 1853 and 1879 and possibly also the 1798 Act which was one of the oldest Acts on the Statute Book and still in effect.  Trying to get people to open bank accounts is a complex matter. When I introduced the Payment of Wages Act Deputy Rabbitte was spokesman on labour affairs.  This case law was complex in that we had to go back to Acts dating from before the foundation of the State.  There was a reluctance on the part of well paid employees to open bank accounts.  We succeeded in getting them to open bank accounts without much difficulty.  FUE &mdash; now IBEC &mdash; finally got in-house agreements with trade unions to get them into the banking system.</P>

      <P>It is difficult to get people into the system voluntarily.  I do not intend to go over all the arguments I made about the 1988 amnesty except to say that excluding those who availed of the 1988 amnesty from the provisions of the incentive amnesty scheme would limit the proportion of the undisclosed liabilities being secured from an Exchequer point of view.  Acceptance of the amendment would not improve the system generally.</P>
      <P>The surcharge is a penalty and has to be pursued in the courts.  However, it can be enforced by the sheriffs without going to the courts.  Therefore, it is easier to collect as a tax than as a penalty and is more effective in ensuring compliance with the obligations to make timely and correct returns.  Returns filling is the key to the self assessment system and the reason for it.</P>

      <P>It is late in the day and late in the term and perhaps I have lost my ability to cross reference.  For the life of me I cannot understand the Minister's rejection of this amendment.  Specifically I do not understand what he means by &ldquo;individuals outside the net who did not take up the 1988 amnesty&rdquo; or how my amendment would cut across those people.  I fail to make the connection, but that may be my fault.  Of course there are people outside the tax net who did not take up the 1988 amnesty, but I do not understand why this amnesty should provide <Col N="1236" /> an inducement for them by giving those who benefited under the 1988 amnesty a second bite of the cherry.  I do not follow that logic.  People outside the tax net had an opportunity to avail of the main amnesty.  Unfortunately, Deputy Davern has left the House, but his ghost, like the ghost of Banquo, dominated the proceedings since the start of this debate. He spoke of a hot money amnesty.  Generally speaking, that was understood to mean hot money stashed away abroad, although, as Deputy Cox stated it has now come to mean hot money in another context.  The logic of extending this amnesty to people who already had the benefit of an amnesty in 1988 escaped me and how Deputy Michael Ahern can say that is not encouraging an amnesty culture defies logic.</P>

That man has been proved correct. The introduction of another amnesty has done untold damage to the integrity of the tax system.  I do not see how it would undermine the Minister's main purpose, which is to bring tax cheats who are outside the tax net into the system, if he refused the protection of this legislation to people who benefited in 1988.  In this case the Government seems determined to use its great majority, although there has been no evidence of the second partner in coalition since this debate started.

      <P>I will be brief.  I retabled this amendment for Report Stage.  It was discussed at some length on Committee Stage.  I was pleased the Minister gave an <Col N="1241" /> assurance, not that he would take this wording on board but that he agreed with the concept that it would be a bad idea to have a once-off windfall gain in Revenue next year and incur permanent expenditure in relation to that.  Payments are due under this amnesty by 14 January 1994.  It is important to avoid providing such windfall gains at the expense of current expenditure.  There are many worthwhile projects on which such money could be spent, but whenever there is a permanent increase in current expenditure there is a corresponding permanent increase in tax liabilities.  I am pleased the Minister accepted the principle of this amendment and I hope he observes that principle in respect of budgetary policy following any windfall amnesty.</P>

      <P>It is fitting that the point on which this debate will be terminated is the point at which the truth about this legislation is being brought home.  This legislation is nothing more than a cynical, crude, grubby stroke to grab whatever money this Government can on 14 January 1994 to shore up in a once-off way the public finances for next year.  If we wish to see how adept this Minister is at political strokes we need only consider how he has handled the deliberate suppressing of the Exchequer borrowing requirement of this year by the use of the sale of shares in Greencore and Irish Life.  There have been permanent increases in public sector pay and an <Col N="1242" /> underlying deterioration in public finances, but a short term depression of the Exchequer borrowing requirement has been brought about by the use of such strokes.  If the Minister collected £500 million he would be able to argue, on the Exchequer returns at 1 July 1994, how the Exchequer borrowing requirement was lower in 1994 than it was in 1993.  Following the tax amnesty in 1988 tax revenues decreased in 1989.  We are working here on the basis of getting to the next budget on time and using expedient strokes, whatever the long term underlying trends are.  The real truth is that this Bill is a desperate attempt by the Government to grab whatever money it can.  The money is not being put into this year's accounts, which would have been the more honest approach.  It is being put into the accounts with effect from 14 January 1994.  This is being done deliberately to ensure there is a presentable face when Government expenditure is under control, because it is a high taxing and a high spending Government.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Fine Gael rejects the Cahill rescue plan for Aer Lingus because it believes it will not work.  If implemented as presented it will be a botched affair and in less than two years time we will be back in this House <Col N="1245" /> debating a further rescue plan which will inevitably close down Aer Lingus or confine its activities to that of a minor commuter air service.  Aviation in Europe has developed on the basis of national carriers &mdash; Air France, Iberia, Lufthansa, KLM, Alitalia and so on.  It is in this league table of national carriers that Aer Lingus had a proud place.  These airlines became synonymous with national pride. They were a symbol of a country's sovereignty wherever they flew.  Aer Lingus fulfilled a similar role in Ireland.  Not only did it provide an efficient, courteous and good value service, but for generations of Irish people, especially our emigrants and tourists visiting our shores, the shamrock on the tail of the plane was synonymous with the national flag.</P>
      <P>The days of the national carriers are over.  There is now a web of new partnership arrangements in Europe and it is in this context that a commercially sound Aer Lingus must find its future.  I will return to this theme later in my speech but first I would ask how such a proud company as Aer Lingus, in which the pride and money of Irish people was invested and in which a job would secure the future of any young man or woman in high status employment, could have sunk so low that now even in the speeches of Government Ministers and the Taoiseach, Aer Lingus has become synonymous with bad management, colossal losses, unsustainable debt and questionable work practices?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The descent into bankruptcy has been quite recent.  Fine Gael, in partnership with the Labour Party in the 1982-87 Coalition, took on the task of restoring the commercial State sector to viability. Aer Lingus was put on a sound footing by that Government.  The company was prepared for the many challenges it would face as world aviation changed in the late eighties.  When we left Government Aer Lingus was in profit.  This year it will lose £116 million and the total accumulated debt is now £540 million. There is no doubt that if Aer Lingus was a United States aviation company it would be now in Chapter II and if it was <Col N="1246" /> a private European company a liquidator would be already installed.  How did a company which was profitable so recently decline so far so rapidly?  What were the key decisions that led to its decline?  Will anybody at management level in Aer Lingus, in the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications or sitting around the table in Government be held responsible for this debacle?</P>
    <P>In the late eighties the measures taken to cut the cost base of Aer Lingus were reversed by the then management and the then Minister.  Large numbers of extra staff were employed and the seeds of today's disaster were sown.  The shorthaul fleet was replaced at enormous cost and the Aer Lingus Holiday fiasco, which resulted in a book loss of of £17 million and an actual loss in excess of £20 million, took place.  The company tried to restore its monopoly on the Dublin-London route by cutting fares to a point at which it believed its competitors, Ryanair and British Midland, could not stand the heat.  By last year it had ended up in the totally ludicrous situation of selling every seat on every plane from Dublin to London below cost, incurring losses in excess of £23 million on the route.  The company got involved in the politics of the Shannon stopover, encouraged the Government to renegotiate the bilateral avaiation agreement with the United States to fly Dublin-Los Angeles, leased two 767s at a cost of $750,000 a month but never flew the route and has continued ever since to pay the monthly leasing charge for planes parked in Dublin Airport.  Yet nobody has been held accountable.  The then Minister, Deputy Seamus Brennan, presided over most of these decisions.  Neither he nor the then management or board have been brought to account.  Deputy Brennan's procrastinations, political interference and managerial incompetence have more than any other factor helped to sink Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, the present Minister for Justice, when Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, analysed the problems correctly and re-affirmed the status of <Col N="1247" /> Shannon Airport, but she did absolutely nothing to remediate the difficulties of the company.  Mr. Bernard Cahill, under whose chairmanship the present rescue plan has been brought forward, is no stranger to the Aer Lingus board.  He has been chairman of the board since August of 1991 and was a member prior to that. During all the period since 1987 the present Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, was either Minister for Industry and Commerce, Minister for Finance or Taoiseach &mdash; all offices relevant to the future of Aer Lingus &mdash; but he did nothing.  Is it reasonable to expect that those who contributed most to the fiasco at Aer Lingus are now especially endowed to rescue it, or must we rely on the business acumen of the new bornagain market-led Labour Party to restore commercial sense to the company?</P>
    <P>The Cahill plan proposes an equity injection of £175 million.  It makes no attempt to justify this injection or to reconcile it with the demand made by Aer Lingus last November, when Mr. Cathal Mullen was chief executive and Mr. Cahill was chairman of the board, that the appropriate equity injection was £400 million.  If Mr. Cahill felt last November that the company could be rescued only by an injection of £400 million, how can he make do with £175 million a couple of months later?  Forty three million pounds of the equity now proposed is earmarked for a redundancy package. A total of 1,530 employees at Aer Lingus will be made redundant.  Is it not extraodinary that a Government that claims that its top priority is job creation is using £43 million of taxpayers money to destroy so many jobs?  It is quite clear that some equity is needed.  No case has been made by anybody for any particular amount of equity greater or less than the amount proposed.  As it stands it is a figure plucked out of the sky, and any figure from £50 million to £400 million would have equal validity on the basis of the arguments put forward in the plan.</P>
    <P>The plan proposes to divide Aer Lingus into four business centres: the first to serve Britain and the Continent, the <Col N="1248" /> second Aer Lingus Express to the UK, the third Aer Lingus-Shannon for the transatlantic routes, and the fourth to manage ancillary services such as catering and baggage handling.  The proposers of the plan have produced neither market research nor financial projections to indicate how this proposed new format will rescue the company.  It is quite clear that the company hopes to carry extra passengers on both its transatlantic and UK Express routes, otherwise these services will not work.  Yet there is no information provided to suggest that the projections for increased load factors are based on other than a hunch.  It seems from published material that the new arrangements on the transatlantic route are expected to increase the number of passengers carried by 13 per cent.  A totally new company unit is proposed for shuttle-type flights to the United Kingdom.  Yet the expectation in the plan is that the number of passengers on all routes to the UK will increase by only 1 per cent.  How can a plan based on such flimsy projections ensure financial viability?  These figures simply do not stand up and it is difficult to project where Aer Lingus will be in two years time on the basis of the information provided.</P>
    <P>The proposal in respect of the ancillary services is quite clearly to prepare them for privatisation.  Baggage handling, catering and some other unspecified services will be distinct cost units.  Initially, Aer Lingus will avail of their services, but after three years they will have to compete with other service providers.  It is clear that if this is carried to its logical conclusion these services will be privatised and further substantial redundancies will be added to the 1,500 projected.</P>
    <P>All Aer Lingus assets other than the core business and TEAM Aer Lingus are for sale.  The only asset which could make a significant impact on the balance sheet is the Copthorne Hotel Group.  This has a book value of £215 million, and even though its market value is significantly less, its sale would have a significant impact on the balance sheet.</P>
    <P>The plan is particularly dishonest in its <Col N="1249" /> treatment of smaller subsidiaries such as CARA and PARC.  It is clear that these are for sale as soon as a buyer is found, and statements that they are not are extremely unfair to the workers of these companies.  In the case of CARA its privatisation will, I have no doubt, lead to redundancies which we can add to the total projected.</P>
    <P>The only reason TEAM Aer Lingus is not for sale is because it is not worth anything.  The Cahill plan projects 250 redundancies in TEAM, but this figure is very hard to reconcile with the industrial relations shambles at that concern over the past few weeks.  The announcement on Friday last that 300 workers were being let go on a so-called temporary basis and that a further 150 will be let go shortly is difficult to reconcile with a claim that redundancies at TEAM will be held at 250 when the plan is put into effect.  When we take into account the stated redundancies in the core airline business and at TEAM, the difficulties TEAM is experiencing now, the privatisation of ancillary services and subsequent redundancies, the sale of the subsidiaries and the redundancies that will occur as they are privatised, it is clear that the projection for redundancies is nearer 2,500 than to the 1,500 in the plan.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to understand how the Labour Party in Government can preside over the wiping out of solid jobs in a State company.  It is difficult to understand what motivates Labour backbenchers when they can stand idly by and watch the destruction of industrial jobs.  One would have to go back to the clearing out of the Highlands in Scotland or the rush from this country after the Famine for any destruction of similar proportions. Yet, the Labour Party will be sanctimonious and its members will say, &ldquo;we are in Government now and the promises we made at election time are null and void and redundant&rdquo;, like the 1,500 Aer Lingus workers.</P>
    <P>The decision to change the status of Shannon will have a very adverse effect on the west of Ireland.  Tourist traffic will be transferred from the mid-west region to Dublin, and the main plank of regional <Col N="1250" /> policy in the west of Ireland, will be removed.  The plan is quite ambiguous on its intentions in regard to the transatlantic fleet.  The Minister originally informed Deputies that the three 747's would be based at Shannon Airport, and that direct flights would be provided between Shannon and New York all the year round.  It is clear that one of the 747's will be based in Dublin and there will be no direct flights from Shannon to New York for eight months of the year.  It is clear that the Government has accepted this recommendation, and it is a sad day for the west of Ireland that such a momentous decision has been taken by the very people in which the electorate placed their trust in the last election.</P>
    <P>Last November the then Minister, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, announced that she was maintaining Shannon's transatlantic status after a thorough economic analysis of the benefits the status conferred on the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>The Government's announcement tonight will be greeted with dismay in the Shannon region, and those Deputies whose electoral success has been largely based on the commitments they made to preserve the status of Shannon, will have to make their position clear in the course of this debate.  I refer in particular to Deputies Killeen of Fianna Fáil and Bhamjee of the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>The last published accounts of Aer Lingus show the company's position up to March of 1992.  The transatlantic service was the only section of Aer Lingus then showing a profit, and in that financial year the profit was almost £10 million. The Cahill plan claims that the trans-atlantic route is now a major loss maker. I hope the rest of the plan is more soundly based than this claim, as the accountancy devices used to show losses on the route are such that no respectable accountant would put his name to them.  The substantial earnings on baggage handling for Virgin Airways at New York and Aeroflot at Shannon are not shown as revenue on the transatlantic route.  The £2 million revenue from fares on Shannon/Dublin and Dublin/Shannon on the 747s is not <Col N="1251" /> shown, even though all costs on this route are put down to the transatlantic.  The $9 million per annum leasing costs on the 767s, bought to serve Dublin/Los Angeles but which have never left the ground, is assigned to the transatlantic costs.  The 747s which now constitute the trans-atlantic fleet were sold and leased back, the leasing costs are assigned to the North Atlantic, but none of the benefits to the group from the proceeds of the sale are so assigned.</P>
    <P>The bilateral agreement between Ireland and the US controls all trans-atlantic air traffic.  All airlines may fly to Shannon but no airline may fly direct to Dublin.  If the Irish Government allows Aer Lingus to fly direct to Dublin, then all US carriers may fly direct to and from Dublin.  It has so decided tonight, and now we have an open skies policy under which any US carrier is free under the terms of the bilateral agreement to fly into Dublin.  The Minister is shaking his head in disagreement.  Does he intend renegotiating the bilateral agreement?  It took 18 months to re-negotiate the bilateral agreement to allow Aer Lingus fly Dublin-Los Angeles.  It will take as long to re-negotiate the Shannon agreement and in the meantime there will be many opportunities for the American carriers to come in.  Two years ago 40 per cent of all US visitors to Ireland came through London and this year 60 per cent will do so.  American air travellers are voting with their wallets and Aer Lingus cannot compete with the low cost fares to London.  How does the Government expect Aer Lingus to compete with the low cost US carriers who with the experiences of deregulation for the past ten years have cut their cost base?  How can Aer Lingus compete with those carriers if they decide to fly Dublin direct as is their right under the terms of the bilateral agreement?</P>
    <P>The Government has no aviation policy.  In an article I wrote for the <i>Irish Independent</i> two weeks ago, I set out my position on this matter and also on the necessity of Aer Lingus entering into a partnership arrangement with other <Col N="1252" /> European carriers.  I will repeat those arguments.  The decisions taken recently on aviation matters show clearly that we have no aviation policy.  SFADCo, whose statutory function is the development of Shannon Airport, was asked on behalf of the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs to promote Kerry Airport.  Gillian Bowler was appointed to head up a task force to promote Shannon Airport and the Cahill plan has proposed major changes in the status of Shannon, and action to reduce Aer Lingus' cost base. Aer Rianta announced about 6 weeks ago that it would increase that cost base by raising landing fees by 6 per cent next year while the ESRI warned against spending any further Structural Funds on regional airports.  Aer Lingus cancelled 25 transatlantic flights from New York to Shannon and Dublin and reduced their transatlantic fares in the past 3 weeks but forgot to announce this.  The company increased its Dublin/London fares in the same period by £20, but forgot to announce this also.</P>
    <P>Does that add up to an aviation policy when so many decisions about air travel are being taken, many of which are contradictory? There is no pattern to that kind of decision-making.  We had also the spectacle of the Government tonight accepting the Cahill plan in total when it is clear that even Mr. Cahill, Mr. Owen and the other architects of the plan had padded it in the expectation that the Government would turn it down.  Is it any wonder that Aer Lingus is in trouble when that is the kind of management it has and those are the type of ministerial decisions that are being taken and when the people around the Cabinet table will wave it through without adequately studying the issues?  We are a peripheral EC country.  We need an integrated transport policy and in that context a fully developed aviation policy is essential.</P>
    <P>As I said, the aviation business in Europe has grown on the basis of national carriers.  Deregulation of the air industry in the United States has completely changed everything.  Europe must follow and is following and even though it hopes to avoid some of the trauma which <Col N="1253" /> deregulation brought to the aviation industry in the United States it cannot avoid the inevitable competition which is coming with a vengence.  Airlines will close down &mdash; 22 airlines closed down in America last year &mdash; new airlines will open &mdash; 30 airlines opened in the United States last year &mdash; and national governments as the champions of national carriers are now in the &ldquo;Last Chance Saloon&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is in this new world that Aer Lingus must survive and, we hope, grow and prosper.  The European Community will allow one last restructuring of the balance sheet but only one.  It is in the new Europe that Aer Lingus will have to find its way and it needs a partner other than the Government to help it survive and return to prosperity.  A rescue plan which does not address the issue of a suitable partner for Aer Lingus is not a rescue plan; it is a trap for the company.</P>
    <P>Before the turn of the century Europe will have only five large carriers and as arrangements are already being made to organise these, then Aer Lingus, in order to survive, must move quickly.  It now looks like the carriers will be British Airways, Lufthansa, the SAS Group and Air France.  There will probably be a fifth with Alitalia or Iberia providing the anchor.  It is clear from the network of partnership arrangements already made that this will be the pattern of air carriers in Europe in the nineties.  Does anyone reasonably expect that Aer Lingus can go it alone against this web of relationships? Again, the procrastination of Ministers, before the present Minister, Deputy Cowen, has all but undermined the company's position.  No-one wants a bankrupt company for a partner and if Aer Lingus had been put on a sound footing two years ago it could now be actively seeking a partner.</P>
    <P>Do people realise what is going on? SAS, originally a combination of Danish Air, Swedish Air and Norwegian Air, has now taken on British Midland as a partner and it has an arrangement with Swissair and KLM.  British Airways has a network of arrangements across Europe and has a 25 per cent share in Qantas in <Col N="1254" /> Australia, while in the United States it has acquired a 25 per cent share in US Air.  Do the Minister and his officials realise what is happening in Europe and how can they accept a plan which does not address the crucial issue of a partner for Aer Lingus?  Aer Lingus will become a company providing a commuter service serving Dublin-London Heathrow and feeding into a major carrier unless the Minister moves quickly.</P>
    <P>Why should we accept this plan tonight when it has not been costed properly, there are no financial projections available to the House to reassure us and there is no market research available to show that there will be extra passengers on the transatlantic and United Kingdom routes?  There is no aviation policy and it is clear from the piecemeal decisions taken during the past five or six weeks that the first elements of an aviation policy do not exist.  The key European issue of who we link up with and what partner should we have to secure our future in circumstances where the Government can no longer be a partner, has not been addressed.  The Minister knows that the European Commission has told him that this is the Government's last opportunity to put Aer Lingus on a sound footing.</P>
    <P>This is a shambles and I am amazed at the lamb-like behaviour of Government backbench Deputies in north Dublin and in the west, particularly the mid-west, who know that this plan will have adverse effects on their constituencies.  We have heard about the &ldquo;Silence of the Lambs&rdquo; and we know what the theme of that film was, but at least Hannibal Lecter did not eat his own.  We have the &ldquo;Silence of the Lambs&rdquo; from the Government backbenchers while the chairman of the Labour Party on the 5 p.m. radio programme did a <i>mea culpa</i> in explaining why it is so hard to be in the Labour Party at present because one has no choice but to whistle a happy tune and support the awful decisions taken by Ministers in the lobbies.  The danger to Aer Lingus is imminent and I ask the House to reject this plan when it comes to the vote at 8.30 p.m. tomorrow night.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Noonan said, this plan cannot be described in any way as a survival plan for Aer Lingus.  It does not contain one new thought or a reaction to the reality that surrounds us.  Only today I was presented with a particularly worrying illustration of this.  Recently a number of my colleagues left this country on business.  They flew from Dublin to London by Aer Lingus and onwards by another airline on a route which Aer Lingus does not serve.  They are due to return in a few days time on a long flight via London.  They booked the most convenient flight from London.  This is not an Aer Lingus flight.  When they checked in at Dublin Airport somebody in Aer Lingus decided that they should ring the headquarters of my party in Mount Street to complain that they were not travelling by Aer Lingus.  This is an airline which hopes that people in other countries will choose Aer Lingus rather than an airline of their own country, in order to expand its business, but that is the attitude it is taking to the market place which the company has to compete in today.</P>
      <P>This is symptomatic.  We see the same thinking in the plan which has been put forward.  I do not know who put this plan forward.  Was it Mr. Cahill or the Minister who engineered the plan, or who is behind it?  This plan is not going to ensure the survival of Aer Lingus; far from it.  Even if the world aviation scene was not changing rapidly, as it is, this plan would still fail because it does not address any of the crucial issues which Aer Lingus has to face if it wants to survive.  There is no description in the plan of how Aer Lingus fits into the world aviation network.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if the briefing document which we have received is a fair summary of the plan.  We had to wait a long time and kick up a row in this House to get this briefing document from the Minister. Certainly, Deputies on this side of the House were going to be kept out of the loop.  If this is a fair or accurate summary of the full plan it is doomed to fail because, as I said, it does not address any of the major issues which face Aer <Col N="1256" /> Lingus.  It seems to assume that the world is going to remain exactly the same as it is today and does not take account of the fact, as Deputy Noonan said, that all over the world airlines are in difficulty and that there is an increasing trend towards concentration, specialisation and agreements between airlines in order to find a place for themselves in the market.  This plan does not address that issue.</P>
    <P>There are a few ritual obeisances.  For example, in paragraph 22 of the plan we find the blinding revelation that Aer Lingus will face even more intense competition on all its routes in coming years, but it does not state how this is going to be dealt with.  In paragraph 24 we have another blinding revelation, that Aer Lingus operates from a position of market strength on all its core routes. What does this mean?  If that is the case, why is the company going to lose £116 million this year?  If that is what operating from a position of market strength means I would hate to look at what the Minister might produce if he thought there was the slightest difficulty in the market.  This plan is fairyland stuff.</P>
    <P>As I said, the trend towards concentration is going to become increasingly pronounced in future years.  There are agreements, cross-shareholdings, the pooling of capital resources and co-operation agreements between airlines in order to survive.  One expert reckons that in about a decade there will be about 20 major airlines in the world and that smaller airlines will follow in squadrons, specialising in various niche markets. There is no definition in the plan of where Aer Lingus will fit into that complex.</P>
    <P>The plan seems to assume that Aer Lingus can and should continue to be the airline it has been up to now and that nothing will change; the world is going to stand still while we deal with this problem in Aer Lingus, but this is not true.  Small airlines &mdash; Aer Lingus is a small airline by world standards &mdash; can survive but only if they clearly define their place in the market and act accordingly.  All those that will survive will need a close working arrangement with at least one of the mega <Col N="1257" /> carriers.  To do that they have to become attractive, serve some function and in some way fit into the scheme of the megacarrier airlines which are going to emerge.  However, there is nothing in this plan that even begins to do that.  There is nothing in this plan which will structure Aer Lingus in a way which will fit it for the kind of arrangement it needs to survive.  There is nothing in this plan which will make Aer Lingus an attractive partner for any other airline operating at either a European or world level.</P>
    <P>There is a reference in the plan to alliances, but all it deals with is alliances with other carriers feeding into the Aer Lingus system.  It refers to code sharing deals which exist already and which many airline users know are another way in which airlines rip them off.  It also refers to joint ventures and to interline arrangements, another means by which airlines can in a hidden way, produce a service for consumers which they do not actually want or which they think is something different.  If this plan is put into effect will Aer Lingus be in a position to enter into a joint venture or bring equity of any kind to a joint venture?  If it is not, will anybody else be interested in a joint venture?  I doubt it very much.</P>
    <P>The generation of extra traffic between Ireland and North America and the future of Aer Lingus in that market depend on the opening of crucial extra routes.  Without extra routes we will not win back transatlantic traffic from London or Manchester.  Success in winning extra routes depends on vigorous action by the Government to secure the necessary changes in the US-Ireland Bilateral Air Service Agreement.  There is no indication in this plan or in anything that has been said by the Government that it has even begun to understand what is involved in this.  There is reference in the summary plan to that issue in three lines in paragraph 10 on page 28: &ldquo;The strategy requires a change in the Shannon stopover policy which will require negotiations with the US authorities to amend the Ireland-US air agreement&rdquo;. There is nothing about new routes, any agreements with American airlines or the <Col N="1258" /> way in which extra traffic will be generated.</P>
    <P>I have to confess that I am not a bit happy at the prospects of this agreement being renegotiated.  On the last occasion the agreement was negotiated, in 1990 it was signed by &ldquo;Mr. Gerard Collins, TD, Minister for Foreign Affairs for Ireland.&rdquo; All that modification did was simply to update the provision to which Deputy Noonan has referred that all scheduled flights on the north Atlantic routes shall serve stating Shannon and &ldquo;This requirement shall terminate if any other airline inaugurates scheduled services between Dublin and the United States in either direction without a traffic stop at Shannon.&rdquo; If we are to get out of this renegotiation of the agreement anything which will produce extra business either for Aer Lingus or any other airline or extra traffic in terms of people coming in here, we will have to have more service routes between North America and Ireland. The Government has said nothing about that.  If this does not happen we will not regain any of the traffic which has been lost to London and Manchester.  If the Government does not move quickly on this it could very well be too late.</P>
    <P>Somewhere in the depths of the Government machine there is someone who knows that the US and UK authorities are now discussing an open skies arrangement.  They want to renegotiate the bilateral agreement between them and they are looking at an open skies arrangement.  If we are not careful and they manage to put that open skies arrangement into operation before we do anything else, then all the north Atlantic traffic will go from north America to the UK and we will be lucky to get people backtracking here.  This will happen regardless of what this plan does or of the number of jumbos based at Shannon. It is laughable to hear an airline which says that landing in Shannon is the cause of part of its problems proposing that instead of flying Dublin-Shannon-New York, the airline will fly Shannon-Dublin-New York.  Who put the proposal together?  He should not be let next or near any airline.  That says much about <Col N="1259" /> the approach of this plan.  The EC Commission has approved new regulations for competition between European airlines which should open up possibilities for an Aer Lingus which is restructured, not for an Aer Lingus which is half bailed out by an arrangement of this kind.</P>
    <P>The record of Aer Lingus in terms of management has been very bad; it has always been slow to move.  Its reaction to the emergence of any new service has been to try to kill it.  The reaction to the emergence of any kind of new service has been to follow the lead of other people. It was behind everyone else in serving regional airports and in acquiring commuter aircraft.  It has also been behind everybody else in fare wars and it has paid the price of being the last one in in those wars.  It is stated in this so-called plan that it diversified into the problem because it diversified into activities which are pro-cyclical with the airline business. This plan will not save Aer Lingus.  This is a time of severe trauma for everyone working in Aer Lingus and the only result of this plan is that the Government will have let those people down by engineering all this pain without the slightest gain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose this plan, which I believe was put together by the Department, the Minister and Mr. Cahill.  Like my colleagues, I do not think this plan will work.  I say this mainly from my experience of the Department. Deputy Dukes referred to the prospects of Aer Lingus getting additional routes. On one occasion I visited the Department to see if the Minister would meet a group representing the Phoenix, Arizona, hub airport which was being developed.  They wanted to set up a route which would be serviced by an American airline directly into Shannon provided Aer Lingus flew from Shannon into Phoenix.  The Department looked at the plan and said that the Minister was prepared to meet the delegation.  However, when the people from Phoenix arrived in Dublin the then Minister, Deputy Brennan, refused to meet them.  I next visited the then Minister <Col N="1260" /> for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, who said he would see them. However, he was told by the people in his Department that Aer Lingus wanted to fly into Los Angeles and to forget about Phoenix.  Finally I was reduced to visiting a former Minister of State, Denis Lyons, who obliged me and met these people.  This plan was examined by a number of other people, including Dr. Garret FitzGerald, who called himself an expert in this area.  While he was not satisfied with the plan initially, he is now satisfied that it is a good plan.  However, its details never reached anyone's ears.</P>
      <P>So far as the Department is concerned, I believe it was decided that once the personnel in the Department was changed this plan would follow certain lines and would be anti the Shannon region.  The people of Shannon will be dismayed at the proposals in the plan, particularly as they are being put forward a few months after the then Minister, Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, answered them that the Shannon stopover would remain.  The people in my constituency, in particular, took out insurance: they elected Deputy Killeen &mdash; who had better credentials on this issue &mdash; instead of re-electing the former Deputy Daly who was supposed not to be as strong on the Shannon issue.  Of course, Deputy Bhamjee had the support of Deputy Spring and his party's policies.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In moving this amendment I recognise very clearly that everyone in this House and indeed anybody who has been <Col N="1262" /> involved in the wider debate on the Aer Lingus situation broadly shares the same aspiration that we must do everything required to ensure that the national airline not only survives but has a firm basis for successful operation in the future.  In this spirit I am coming to the House not only to participate in the debate but to share as much information as possible to help people understand the basis for the Government's decisions taken today.</P>
    <P>When I took over responsibility for the Transport, Energy and Communications portfolio in January it became clear within days that Aer Lingus was facing a rapidly deteroriating financial and operating position.  At the very outset it became an urgent priority for me to get an accurate and up-to-date assessment of the scale and nature of the company's problems.  I believe that in the strategy plan submitted in recent weeks by the company we have, for the first time, an accurate fix on the full magnitude of the company's problems.  The operating losses of the company are running at unprecedently and unacceptably high levels.  It was precisely because of the obvious gravity of the company's financial problems that I, equally, took unprecedented measures to share as much information as I could with the House short of releasing strategic commercially confidential information.  In addition, I also insisted on consulting with a wide range of interests concerned with the solution to the company's problems and told them in a straightforward way the problems with which I was confronted. This has been my approach from the outset in seeking solutions for the company's problems.</P>
    <P>The very magnitude of the company's problems swept aside a lot of hopes many people had to avoid difficult choices. Regrettably we no longer have the luxury of choice.  In particular, one area where choice has been closed down very rapidly since earlier assessments of the company and its related problems is that of time. The massive drain on the company's cash resources which the operating losses are imposing imperil its very survival.  Time is now of the very essence and decisions <Col N="1263" /> must be taken now to ensure the company can be repositioned in such a way as to ensure its future.</P>
    <P>The Deputies will already have received essential information on the company's financial position.  I do not think it would be helpful tonight to go into a line by line analysis of these underlying trading and financial difficulties but to repeat that I cannot overstate the gravity of the situation.  I want everybody to understand that there is not a menu which would afford us the ability to pick and choose solutions.  Suffice it to say that committed credit lines to the company have already been fully used up and the company's emerging cash position is one where the company may not have the cash resources to pay any of its bills including wages, as early as the end of next month.  It calls for courage to face the magnitude of this problem, courage in particular for the employees of the company to take on board the problems that they will have to solve in conjunction with company management.  I intend that the Government as shareholder will play its part to the maximum to facilitate the necessary solutions and adjustments to enable the company to be competitive once again.</P>
    <P>The motion put down by Deputy Noonan calls for the rejection of the strategy plan put forward by Aer Lingus, despite the general acceptance that the main strategy put forward by Aer Lingus must be implemented if we are to save the national airline.  There is general acceptance that the starting point of any action plan must be a reduction in the company's operating costs.  There is a gap of £50 million between company's revenue and its costs which must be reduced if the company is to remain in business.  That is an inescapable fact which must be addressed.</P>
    <P>In any company it is the responsibility of the board to ensure the continuing viability and development of that company. The board of Aer Lingus has fulfilled its obligation in this regard by presenting to Government, as shareholder, a strategy to return the company <Col N="1264" /> to commercial viability.  The specific proposals contained in this strategy are the produce of work by the senior management of Aer Lingus and especially, benefited from a series of recommendations which came from a special task force &mdash; with almost 40 consultative working groups &mdash; set up to make recommendations on every aspect of the Aer Lingus system.  They have also had the benefit of the input from staff through the company wide open forum consultative process initiated towards the end of March.  To suggest that the results of all this work be rejected out of hand is in my view irresponsible.</P>
    <P>In our Programme for a Partnership Government, we gave a specific commitment that we would ensure the commercial future of our national airline as part of our overall air transport policy.  I want to assure the House today that we have taken specific action to fulfil this commitment.  The Government at its meeting this afternoon decided to: (a) endorse the broad strategy set out in Aer Lingus's strategic plan for the future of the company; (b) authorise an injection of £175 million in equity into Aer Lingus: £75 million in 1993, £50 million in 1994 and £50 million in 1995; (c) authorise me, as Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, to bring forward legislative proposals, in the context of the further development of Government's plan for the Irish aviation sector, to make whatever amendments are necessary to the air companies Acts to give effect to this; (d) authorise the management of Aer Lingus to explore with the unions in the company means of financial participation by Aer Lingus employees in the future success of the company; (e) authorise me as Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to enter into discussions with the United States Authorities with a view to amending the Ireland-US bilateral Air Transport Agreements.</P>
    <P>The Government also agreed that the timing and amount of equity injections proposed be subject to the following conditions: (1) a full and comprehensive agreement having been reached between <Col N="1265" /> management and unions in Aer Lingus on the necessary £50 million annual reduction in cost essential to return the company to commercial viability; (2) production of satisfactory evidence that the necessary measures proposed are being implemented in full; (3) formal acceptance by the European Commission of the Aer Lingus strategy and the proposal for State equity injections.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the House that I will seek, as a matter of urgency, the formal approval of the EC Commission for the strategy.</P>
    <P>One element of the Aer Lingus strategy which the Government carefully considered and analysed was the proposal for a change in the Shannon stop policy. The Aer Lingus board advised the Government that if the financial crisis facing the company was not addressed it would force closure of its transatlantic operations which account for 70 per cent of scheduled services through Shannon. In support of this, the board pointed out that Aer Lingus's transatlantic operations lost £14.4 million in 1992-93&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Excluding the B767 operations, the losses, before interest, in 1993-94 will be about £12 million as compared with £9 million in 1992-93.  Aer Lingus have verified that these results are based on a uniform <i>pro rata</i> allocation of both costs and revenues on its transatlantic routes, and is in line with similar practice for all its other routes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Aer Lingus maintain that they must tackle losses on all routes if the company is to be returned to viability.  A change in the Shannon stop policy is an integral part of their strategy to return the transatlantic operations to profit.  They state that their transatlantic strategy has been specifically designed to protect their <Col N="1266" /> interests in Shannon and emphasise their commitment to the Shannon region.</P>
      <P>Despite these assurances, Shannon interests expressed their opposition to the Aer Lingus proposals.  I wanted to hear why and carefully consider their concerns before making any recommendation to Government on this very important issue.  Both I and my officials have met delegations representing public representatives in the region, the STATUS/SIGNAL groups and have had discussions with Shannon Development, members of the Shannon Task Force and Aer Rianta and members of local Chambers of Commerce and tourism and manufacturing interests in the region.</P>
      <P>The Government carefully considered these strongly-held views before deciding on a change in policy.  However, there were other considerations which had to be taken into account also, principally developments in world aviation.  While we have decided to seek a change in the Shannon stop policy, I want to specifically reassure the people of the west and mid-west that this Government's commitment to the development of their regions is firm and resolute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>A sham.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to emphasise that the Government's decision to seek a change in the Ireland-US Bilateral Air Agreements to modify the current Shannon stop policy was made in the context of developments in European and United States' aviation policies.  In addition, there is an increasingly strong movement within the International Civil Aviation Organisation &mdash; ICAO &mdash; the international organisation responsible for the regulation of world aviation &mdash; for a much more liberal regulatory regime worldwide for civil aviation in line with a freer trade regime for goods and services under the GATT.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, because of our commitment to the people of the west and mid-west we will manage the change proposed in a constructive manner by seeking to ensure that: Shannon will be sufficiently developed to a point where it can stand <Col N="1267" /> alone as an Airport operation; and the existing level of air services to the region will at least be maintained; we have already set up a Special Traffic Development Task Force for the airport with a budget of £1 million over the next two years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>And Aer Lingus are not represented on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>We will also ensure that the proposals in the Aer Lingus strategy concerning the maintenance of its trans-atlantic fleet at Shannon are honoured.</P>
      <P>I would also like to assure all the representatives that I met, that in negotiating the Bilateral Air Agreements with the USA, I will seek to ensure that traffic through Shannon can be developed to the maximum extent possible.</P>
      <P>Many of the misgivings expressed to me revolve around access transport to the mid-west region and to the west in general.  However access is not confined to air travel.  In this connection, I want to state the clear commitment that the Government will substantially increase investment in other transport infrastructure in the region.  Details of such investment will be announced in the National Development Plan, financed by EC Structural and Cohesion Funds, which will be published shortly.</P>
      <P>But let me return to the area of most concern, that is the future of Shannon airport.  The Aer Lingus survival plan is particularly strong on its commitment to Shannon.  The Government would not have had it otherwise.  Whatever about the past there is an absolutely clear commitment by the company to the further development of their operations at Shannon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what they said in March last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>This is best underlined by the fact that, for the first time, Aer Lingus will have a separate business unit to run its transatlantic services.  This unit will have its own management team based in <Col N="1268" /> Shannon whose absolute priority will be the championing of trans-Atlantic business in and out of Shannon.  As a substantial down payment of the company's new strategy Aer Lingus is committed to the location of the B747 fleet at Shannon as well as accompanying technical and cabin crew staff, where operations and marketing will be centred also.</P>
      <P>In focusing on our aviation problems it has often been easy to forget the wider canvas in which our national airline has to compete.  There has been a dramatic change in the aviation business worldwise with increasing liberalisation shaking major aviation companies to their very foundations.  While this problem has been noticeable for a number of years it has been exacerbated in recent times and for the first six months of this year airlines worldwide are digging deeper into their cost bases as never before.  Indeed this is one of the reasons the whole question of managing change now rather than have change forced upon us later is uppermost in my mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that context Deputies will be well aware that the pace of liberalisation has picked up even more so in the last year and that, increasingly, there is a movement towards the EC taking over competence in the area of air agreements rather than individual EC member states. It is also the stated intention of the United States to negotiate with the European Community on air agreements rather than deal with individual EC member states.  If we were to allow that to happen we would certainly be foregoing the sort of flexibility that is required in our dealings with amendments to existing bilateral agreements with the United States.  This we are not prepared to do. I am proposing that we take an active &ldquo;hands-on&rdquo; early action to manage the necessary change rather than have unilateral and abrupt change thrust upon us. Far better that we have control of our negotiating destiny than to accept what comes out of EC negotiations over which we would have very considerably less control.  Here again time is of the essence. My Department will be starting this process <Col N="1269" /> of negotiations with the United States authorities as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>Let me now allay Deputy Noonan's concern that we do not have an aviation policy in Ireland.  I have said before in this House and repeat that this is a myth. We have an aviation policy and I have clearly articulated what it is.  I acknowledge that it may not be the type of aviation policy for which some people hanker, which is basically a return to the preliberalisation era in Europe and elsewhere.  We cannot turn the clock back.  Times have changed, so must we.</P>
    <P>I feel it would be useful to remind Deputies how successive Irish Governments have managed changes in Irish aviation in recent years and how our current policy has evolved.  Aer Lingus has consistently maintained that its development was being constrained by the small size of the air transport market to and from Ireland.  Accordingly, it requested successive Governments to seek new opportunities to expand into new international markets.  Therefore Irish Governments have consistently supported moves for much greater international liberalisation in air transport with the specific aim of opening up new market opportunities for Irish operators.  That is the upside of liberalisation, the downside is that we must accept greater competition in our domestic market.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to repeat the full details of our plan and policies for Irish aviation. These are already on the record of this House.  However, in summary, let me reiterate that this Government's aviation policy is to gain access for Irish operators to as many international markets as possible and ensure that they can compete on an even pitch with other competitors in those markets.  That not only applies to air services but also covers the whole spectrum of aviation activities in which Irish operators are involved.</P>
    <P>In so far as aviation infrastructure is concerned, we have backed this policy with resources.  In recent years we have provided substantial resources to maintain and develop the infrastructure for Irish aviation to the highest international standard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1270" /> It has been gratifying to note that our efforts in this sphere have been publicly acknowledged by very reputable people in Irish business and commerce.  I would remind the House that the Government's plans and policies for Irish aviation have been unreservedly endorsed by both the Culliton and Moriarty Committees.  I have no doubt that these endorsements are due to the significant benefits for Ireland, in terms of wealth and employment creation, which have accrued from these policies.</P>
    <P>Let me give the House a few relevant statistics; visitor numbers to Ireland rose to 3.1 million in 1992, an increase of over 50 per cent on 1987.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>How much will that figure increase this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Over 27,000 jobs have been created in tourism between 1987 and 1992; increased income generated in both the tourism and air transport sectors amounted to over £500 million since 1987; travel by business travellers has increased by almost 50 per cent which undoubtedly has helped our merchandise export drive and at least 3,000 direct jobs have been created in the air transport and related industries since 1987.  Is the House being asked to assume that these all happened by chance?</P>
      <P>The basis for action by this Government is one of partnership.  In this context an essential element in this process was to consult with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on the emerging solutions to the problems of Aer Lingus.  As the House knows a meeting was held on 22 June between the Cabinet sub-committee on aviation matters and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  This meeting was an exceptionally constructive one when the willingness of both sides to look at what was in the best interest of the company was clearly evident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government accepted that the question of possible participation by Aer Lingus employees in the future success of the company should be explored as a tangible form of recognition for the additional contribution required of the <Col N="1271" /> workforce to save the company.  Equally, the Government accepted a proposal put forward by Congress for the urgent establishment of a special unit to identify new employment opportunities to counteract the inevitable job losses which is an intrinsic part of the company's survival strategy.  It was agreed that a special enterprise development unit would be set up right away with a mandate similar to the taskforce for Shannon Airport recently established by me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Another task force, God help them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The spirit and constructive nature of this meeting can translate into effective negotiations between the management and the employees and find the necessary solutions to the company's problems of competitiveness.  The Government as shareholder, as I have already stated, will be playing its part to the greatest possible extent in underpinning any such agreement with injections of equity amounting in total to £175 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the House to acknowledge that the crisis facing our national airline is the gravest in its history.  When the company was established in 1936 it took a rare form of courage and vision by Seán Lemass and his Government colleagues of the day and by the employees of the embryonic Aer Lingus.  That courage and determination led to the company which caught the imagination of the people who regarded it, justifiably, with pride.  The post war era which assured route exclusivity to national airlines in now over.  We are now faced with a rapidly changing era where there will be no such predictable constancy but the permanent challenge of change.  National airlines of other countries have also faced this challenge and have dealt with the problem now presented to us.  All the main stakeholders in our national airline, the employees, the company's board, management and the Government can draw from the inspiration of the past and match <Col N="1272" /> the best efforts of our country's airlines. We must take the measures necessary to ensure that Aer Lingus not only has a past of which we are proud but a future which should be based clearly on competitive commercial success.  Such a courageous and imaginative attitude, based on a collective self confidence, will be the best antidote to the current threat to our aviation industry.</P>
    <P>I have approached this important debate in a deliberately non-contentious way as I am convinced that a partnership and consensus approach is the best way forward.  I appeal not only to Deputies but to all the interests affected by today's decisions to work together to build the aviation sector best suited to meet the challenges Ireland faces into the next century.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Joe Jacob">

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister said in seeking support from all sides of this House to adopting a constructive attitude is rich in the absence of the plan presented to him being made available to members, notwithstanding that he could, if he wished, have deleted specifically sensitive information.  That has been a most unsatisfactory feature of this debate and it has frustrated us in trying to come to terms with a very serious situation. It is ridiculous and totally unsatisfactory that the Cahill plan &mdash; as it has become known &mdash; has not been made available. It would be laughable if it were not so serious for the future of Aer Lingus, for the thousands of people it employs and, in particular, the implications for the west which is facing an uncertain future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the failure of the Minister and the Government to publish the Cahill plan and if the reports are correct &mdash; and we have to believe they are &mdash; that Aer Lingus is losing in excess of £1 million per week, then it is clear that major corrective action is required.  Indeed, this <Col N="1273" /> may be the last chance to rescue the airline and restore it to operational profitability. If Aer Lingus is to be turned around and be capable of operating in a deregulated market than there must be comprehensive and meaningful negotiations with the workforce representatives. In this regard the recent agreed strategy involving the Government, the Aer Lingus unions and the Congress of Trade Unions establishing a framework for dialogue is indeed welcome. It is clear that the workers in Aer Lingus not only face a very worrying time but will also have to make many sacrifices if the airline is to be returned to viability and profitability.  In that context the Progressive Democrats support the suggestion from the trade union movement that the workforce be afforded some form of equity participation in the airline.  It would be a positive way of encouraging solidarity and a positive attitude and would, as one of the trade union leaders stated, mean that if the workforce is to share in the pain of restructuring &mdash; there will inevitably be severe pain &mdash; they should also share in the gain of an efficient competitive Aer Lingus down the road.  It is clear that if the workforce feel it has a direct stake in the future of this company as part shareholders then it will have the incentive to see a future over which it can have some control in developing Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>Second, Aer Lingus must concentrate on its core business and organise an orderly sale of some of its non-airline ancillary services.  This would allow the airline's management to apply its energies to its main business and would bring in much needed equity to reduce the mountain of debt that is such a drain on its annual interest costs.  The general taxpayer cannot come up with all the funds necessary for the rescue plan.  I also accept that the timing is an important consideration in the disposal of any particular asset.  For instance, it is reasonable that a virtual fire sale of the Copthorne hotel chain should be avoided.  It must also increase its revenue and reduce its costs.  If, as we have learned, 70 per cent of Aer Lingus costs are outside its control <Col N="1274" /> and 80 per cent of the remaining 30 per cent of the costs are, as reported, devoted to payroll costs, there is simply no way of avoiding significant redundancies.  It is obvious that the airline is top heavy with management personnel and that the staff restructuring and reductions must take full account of this factor.  I also hope that the necessary redundancies can be secured on a voluntary basis to the greatest extent possible.</P>
    <P>The provision of Government equity is obviously essential in helping to reduce the airline's debt mountain and to fund the redundancy programme.  However, banks must also carry some of the restructuring costs involved.  The provision of State equity on the scale proposed of £175 million, which is a major imposition on the State and the taxpayer, must be made conditional on the implementation of a comprehensive restructuring plan and the reduction in its costs to sustainable levels.</P>
    <P>The Aer Lingus unions regard the proposed equity injection as inadequate for the needs of the airline.  Clearly, one matter which the Government should explore is the question of the banks also sharing some of the financial pain to be endured by the general taxpaying public and the workers who will lose their jobs.</P>
    <P>I find it most peculiar that if a private sector blue chip company &mdash; of which we have plenty of examples &mdash; was in difficulty, the banks would restructure loans and make substantial changes in how payment was to be made and, indeed, would share in a substantial part of the cost reductions and in the pain that would have to be borne.  I do not see any pressure or public pronouncements being made by the Government with regard to the attitude of the banks who, for many years, have dealt with a blue chip company and have been paid handsomely for their investment in that company over the years.  In regard to the present situation in Aer Lingus, where the debt amounts to £0.5 billion it is legitimate to ask what role the banks will play in regard to future restructuring and what pain they will be asked to bear.  It is extraordinary that a Government, with a Labour Party in <Col N="1275" /> partnership, failed to ask any of those legitimate questions.  If it is legitimate in the private sector for the banks to take a particular attitude, it is equally legitimate for companies in the commercial and semi-State sectors to take a similar attitude. I would like the Government to play a more up-front role in regard to its consultations with the banks.</P>
    <P>Nothing the Minister said tonight will allay any of the legitimate fears held by people in regard to the Shannon stopover. The Minister is further compounding the Shannon stopover question by the manner in which he dealt with it this evening.  Tens of thousands of people are genuinely fearful about their future arising from any alteration in present policy and those fears will be seriously compounded by the apparent chopping and changing of the elements of the Cahill plan affecting Shannon Airport. For example, on Monday last the Taoiseach stated at Shannon that the Aer Lingus proposals will involve basing a fleet of three jumbos at Shannon.  A few days earlier, Messrs. Cahill and Owen of Aer Lingus circulated a document in Shannon stating that only two such aircraft would be based at Shannon.  As well as being at variance with what the Taoiseach stated, it is also at variance with what Aer Lingus told the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications three weeks ago.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that Shannon is the essential problem dogging Aer Lingus. Yet it appears that the Government is intent on doing a U-turn in regard to its policy on that airport.  If so, it must be in a position to offer legally binding and meaningful guarantees on future operations and agreed practice.  It appears to be assumed also, from much of the comment on the Aer Lingus proposals, that making changes in regard to Shannon is simply a matter that can be decided unilaterally and then enforced by the Government.  That, of course, is not the case.  The 1945 Ireland-US bilateral aviation agreement, as amended by a 1990 annex, makes it clear that the present arrangements about Shannon will be <Col N="1276" /> terminated if any airline inaugurates scheduled services between Dublin and the United States in either direction. That could, and would in my view, mean a transatlantic free for all involving a number of US carriers, irrespective of the consequences for Shannon, Dublin or Aer Lingus generally.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that the Minister did not spell out whether there will be a free for all now while he goes off to negotiate a new bilateral agreement.  Will he state unequivocally that there will be no change in the Shannon stopover position until such time as a satisfactory bilateral agreement has been reached with the United States of America?  The Minister must give us some answers because at present he is sending signals into the marketplace and whetting the appetites of a number of American airlines in regard to opportunities if he is unable to control events as they unfold.</P>
    <P>In this context, for Aer Lingus and the Government to give assurances regarding continuity of services to and from Shannon is meaningless, if the agreement under which they are operating allows free and unrestricted access to Dublin to all airlines, including those not serving Ireland at present.  The position, therefore, is that if the Government is determined on change, it is obvious that any change in the present stopover policy must be done on a controlled basis, necessitating detailed renegotiation and agreement with the Americans in advance of any changes being made.</P>
    <P>Apart from the transatlantic issue, it is essential that any Aer Lingus rescue plan must underline its commitment to Shannon Airport by developing an effective business service to London.  The airport needs a much earlier departure time to London than the present flight, which is too late for people planning a day's business.  Shannon should have a direct service to northern Europe.  Given, for instance, that 870,000 Germans came to Ireland last year, and that most of those want to go to the west of Ireland, a direct service to Shannon is the most sensible way of servicing this market.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not outline a cohesive <Col N="1277" /> development plan as to how Shannon, given that there may be changes, is to sustain itself, grow and compete on an international market.  I fail to understand, if the Shannon stopover policy is wrong, how reversing it and creating a Dublin stopover policy will improve the position.  That is an illogical statement for the Minister to have made this evening and it is not something he will be able to sustain and get away with.  The Minister and Aer Lingus must examine the precise objective in reversing a stopover policy to Dublin instead of Shannon.  In effect, that is what the Minister is stating.  In a broader context, nothing was said about the opportunities that should be opened up for Shannon as an important airport.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus needs to secure a partnership arrangement with another international airline.  Given worldwide trends in aviation and the general trend for airline amalgamation and partnership, it is essential for Aer Lingus to obtain a partnership arrangement that will allow it develop new markets.  Because of an ideological problem with the Labour Party, the Minister will not go the whole distance on this debate.  It is clear by any yardstick that if the plan is put <i>in situ</i> and agreed by all sides that Aer Lingus can survive, that that would only be the beginning in regard to the development of Aer Lingus.  It will immediately have to seek a cross-over relationship in terms of sharing with another airline or a partnership arrangement, a deal with international consequences.  That will immediately have to be put on the table.</P>
    <P>Are we to put the Aer Lingus workforce through the same trauma they experienced in the past few weeks and will continue to experience in the next few weeks and months?  That is a legitimate follow-on from this discussion but not necessarily in the context of this debate because who would want to form a partnership with Aer Lingus in its present circumstances?  However, that issue is relevant in terms of the development strategy of Aer Lingus as an airline and the Minister failed to deal with that issue. <Col N="1278" /> He is running away from the issues involved.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Cullen for allowing me to share his time.  Aer Lingus has an accummulated debt of £540 million, more than £.5 billion and is losing approximately £1 million per week.  The most serious indictment of its problems is that even on its busiest route &mdash; Dublin-Heathrow &mdash; which carries 1.5 million passengers per annum, it loses more money with every additional passenger it carries.  That illustrates clearly the seriousness of the company's problems. If it were a private company it would have ceased operations long ago. The present state of Aer Lingus is a dreadful indictment of all those who have had responsibility for it recently.  If we are to solve the problems of Aer Lingus we can only do so from a national interest point of view.  It should not be a question of whether one is pro-Dublin, pro-Shannon or pro anywhere else.  If Aer Lingus goes under, Shannon will go under; if Aer Lingus goes under it will be a question of whether or not we can fly Ireland direct, not to mention fly Dublin or Shannon direct.  There are a number of matters which should be stated clearly in this debate.</P>
      <P>I regret that the Cahill plan has not been published, but I welcome the fact that at last a plan is being formulated.  To be fair to the Minister, he has the capacity and determination to see that plan through and it is important that we realise that this may be the last opportunity to sort out that airline's difficulties.  If we miss this opportunity, we will pay a heavy price for doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am no aviation expert and I do not intend to repeat much of what has been said.  However, there is an onus on all of us not to play party politics on this issue and where we disagree we should put forward alternative points of view and make alternative suggestions.  I acknowledge that in respect of some sensitive commercial information &mdash; although I believe that is widely available &mdash; it may not have been possible to publish the plan <Col N="1279" /> in full, but otherwise it is regrettable that the Cahill plan has only become available by way of leaks of one kind or another or through a careful synopsis drawn up by the Minister.</P>
    <P>A number of factors caused Aer Lingus's difficulties &mdash; in the first instance, bad management.  In the late 1980s Aer Lingus became paranoid about Ryanair. It followed Ryanair into the regional airports and made sure neither of them succeeded. Aer Lingus became paranoid about Ryanair flying passengers to London and started serving meals on the flight.  The Dublin-Heathrow flight takes exactly the same length of time as it does for my family to make a bus journey from Newcastle to Dublin centre city and not even the most left wing Deputy would suggest that the passengers travelling from Newcastle to Dublin should be given a meal en route.  The obsession with trying to get rid of Ryanair caused many of Aer Lingus's problems and I regret that very much.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus flies into the premier hub in the world and still loses money on every single passenger.  That begs many questions.  We should not forget about the Aer Lingus Holidays disaster and so on.  If we are to put this company right we must look at what has caused the problems and ensure that the mechanisms are in place to prevent such disasters recurring.  A total of £17.5 million of taxpayers' money went astray in that Aer Lingus Holidays disaster and nobody has been prosecuted.  Why not?</P>
    <P>The decision to lease two aircraft, which were to fly to Los Angeles and that are sitting at Dublin Airport costing $750,000 a month, is another disgrace, another example of bad management and of the company going down the tubes. We have to address these fundamental problems.  While there have been substantial changes in the management of Aer Lingus we cannot expect the workers to make all the sacrifices.  One group of people not responsible for the problems of the company are the employees.  If there are bad work practices, if there is gross over-staffing, that is the responsibility <Col N="1280" /> of those charged with looking after Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>There has been much play by the Labour Party about selling the family silver.  However, a family that cannot afford bread and butter cannot afford the obscenity of having silver.  It is as simple as that.  We cannot expect the taxpayer to put in all the equity.  I know that distress sales, fire brigade sales, never make much money.  However, we have to organise the orderly disposal of Aer Lingus's non-airline assets and that is where most of the equity will have to come from for the future.  I see no great advantage to the Irish taxpayer, or to the average Aer Lingus employee, in holding on to the Copthorne Hotels which have a book value of £216 million, apparently a real value of £96 million.  If that money had been put in the bank last year it would have made more for Aer Lingus than it did by operating and running the hotels.  In addition to providing much needed equity, the disposal of such assets would allow the management to concentrate on the core business which is air transport.  The management will need all its time and energy to turn this company around.  If it is to do that it will have to concentrate exclusively on its core business.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not say much about redundancies.  I understand that there are 4,000 people employed in the airline.  As only about 100 redundancies are to be made in the United States, we are expecting more than 1,200 redundancies in Ireland out of the 4,000 employees.  That is more than 25 per cent of the total staff in the airline.  I wonder how realistic it is to hope that we will get these as voluntary redundancies.  Just over 400 employees in Aer Lingus are over the age of 50.  I do not believe the management will be able to get the redundancies by way of voluntary agreement.  Many people have compared Aer Lingus to Waterford Glass where the trade unions said one thing while the employees were queueing up for the redundancy package.  The Aer Lingus workers are far more realistic. They realise that there are no alternative job opportunities available.  I do not <Col N="1281" /> believe it will be possible, never mind easy, to get these redundancies through voluntary agreement.  I wonder what the Minister's attitude to that will be?</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Cullen in regard to the role of the banks.  When it came to the Goodman company and GPA the banks were forced to restructure the loans.  Why can the banks not be forced to restructure these loans?  Is it good enough that the banks should walk away from their responsibilities here.  They took the risks.  As I understand it only £23 million of that £540 million debt is secured; the rest was not given on the basis of any security.  The banks are in a high risk business and they too will have to be part of the restructuring proposals.  We cannot expect the taxpayers to continue to dip into their pockets for more money.  In the case of the ICI debacle a few years ago, I did not object to the money being provided but it was regrettable that the State took no equity in that bank at the time having put in more than £200 million.</P>
    <P>In regard to a partner for Aer Lingus, I believe a partner will only come the way of the company when it gets its house in order.  The Malév airline in Hungary, emerging from communist rule, attracted huge private sector interest because it was well run and had a strategic plan. Aer Lingus does need an international partner if it is to have opportunities to develop into the future.</P>
    <P>The way the Labour Party played politics with Aer Lingus during the last general election was a disgrace.  When the leader of that party addressed the workers of Aer Lingus in the hanger he knew the consequences of what he was saying.  He should realise that the difference between a halo and a noose is a mere eight inches.  The Aer Lingus employees were betrayed and I do not say that in any party political sense.  I went to a meeting recently where, as those who were there will agree, I probably said more difficult and unpalatable things than any members of the Government party who spoke on that night.  I am not trying to play politics or be all things to all men, but an air of unreality was brought into this whole debate by <Col N="1282" /> the carry on of the Labour Party during the general election.  It is not good enough for the Labour Party to keep their heads down and their Members to tell us that if a free vote were allowed, they would do one thing while they let the present Minister carry the can for everything. That is not fair or appropriate.  I would like to hear from the Labour Party in relation to that.  It is not good enough that they should keep their mouths shut and bury their heads in the sand.  This problem could have been sorted out a long time ago if there had been more honesty and realism in relation to this.</P>

      <P>The Minister mentioned courage.  He has the determination and the capacity to turn Aer Lingus around. I wish him well in that task which will not be easy.  He will have to bite the bullet. If redundancies do not come through voluntary agreement, I wonder what the Minister's alternative will be.  How will he achieve the £15 million reduction in operational costs if he does not get the £34 million pay-roll reduction annually? Will the Minister clarify that when responding?  By the time this House returns after the summer it will be too late.  Time is running out and all the parties to this dispute must play their part. I know the employees are more than anxious to play their part.  Their request for preferential shares should be granted. I agree with worker participation but, more important, if the morale of the workforce remaining after the redundancies are obtained is to be such as to allow the airline to succeed and thrive, we will have to allow the workforce to gain from any profit which might come the way of the airline as a result of the restructuring and reorganisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>In my brief contribution I <Col N="1283" /> wish to point out that in recent times the workforce of Aer Lingus has been exploited cynically by the Government parties for political reasons.  In the recent past the greatest offender has been the Labour Party who promised the sky and delivered hell for the employees and their families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy does not know what was promised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Plenty was promised.  This was matched in the recent past by the negligence of the two previous Ministers, Deputies Geoghegan-Quinn and Séamus Brennan.  While I agree with much of what Deputy Harney said, I would remind her that her party was in Government for much of the time Aer Lingus was going into decline and cannot exempt themselves from responsibility.  I agree with the Progressive Democrats that the banks must assume some of the burden. The taxpayer is being asked to put £175 million into Aer Lingus in the next few years, £43 million of which will go to pay for redundancies and the remainder going straight to the banks by way of repayments.  Therefore, the banks have a responsibility to shoulder some of the burden of salvaging Aer Lingus.</P>
      <P>There will be 1,200 redundancies in Aer Lingus and that will mean approximately 6,000 human beings here facing hardship, worry and despair in the next few months.  In attempting any rescue package consideration must be given to Aer Lingus's present operating costs. The amount of money paid to Aer Rianta by Aer Lingus must also be questioned and I would ask the Minister to consider this position.  Aer Lingus pay in excess of £20 million per year to Aer Rianta; indeed, the figure is nearer £26 million. Aer Rianta pay the Government in excess of £15 million per year by way of investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no domestic aviation strategy at present.  Tomorrow night I will ask the Minister what is the strategy for regional development.  At present Shannon is being downgraded, Farannfore is being <Col N="1284" /> upgraded and jobs are at risk at Cork Airport.  There was a full meeting of Cork Airport staff this morning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the despatch, pursuant to section 2 of the Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1960, as applied by the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1993, of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force for service outside the State to participate in the United Nations Operation in Somalia, known as UNOSOM II, as part of the International United Nations Force established by the United Nations Security Council.</P>
      <P>This motion is required under section 2 of the Defence Act, 1960, as applied by the Defence Act, 1993, which became law last week.  One of the purposes of the motion, in approving the despatch of a contingent from the Permanent Defence Force, is to allow the House to review the situation in the country or region to which the Irish troops will be sent.  I propose, therefore, to outline the background to the establishment of UNOSOM II before considering the issue of Ireland's participation in that mission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The modern history of Somalia is tragic, although the omens were good. While there are regional differences, Somalia is probably unique in Africa.  A country of one people, one language, one culture and one religion.  Somalis are divided into five major clan families which claim a common ancestry.  The Somali Republic came about as the union on 1 July 1960 of the former British Somaliland Protectorate and the former Italian-administered United Nations Trust Territory of Somalia, which was approved by a national referendum in <Col N="1285" /> June 1961.  A form of democratic government existed until 1969, when President Ali Shermake was assassinated on 15 October.  Six days later there was a military coup led by General Mohammed Siad Barre.</P>
    <P>Somalia's strategic position was ably used by Siad Barre during the Cold War period to play off the Soviet Union and the United States.  The result was that Somalia became one of the most heavily armed countries in Africa and this is one of the most difficult problems that the UN operation has to face today.</P>
    <P>During 1990 fighting between Siad Barre's Government and rebel forces escalated.  One of the rebel groups, the United Somali Congress (USC), entered the capital, Mogadishu, in late December and claimed, by 1 January 1991, to control large parts of the city.  Shortly afterwards it announced that it had taken control of the Government and invited all former opposition groups to participate in a national conference to discuss the democratisation of Somalia.  Siad Barre fled the capital, thereby ending his 23 year dictatorship.  Sadly, all attempts by the different groups to reach agreement on the future of the country failed. By mid-March 1991 southern Somalia had begun to disintegrate into anarchy.</P>
    <P>During 1991 there were several further attempts to reconcile the different Somali movements, particularly by Djibouti, which hosted two conferences.  Ceasefires were agreed but failed to hold.  In November 1991 the United Somali Congress split.  Its leadership and principal support come from the Hawiye clan, which is numerically Somalia's largest, and dominates the commercial and intellectual life of Mogadishu and its hinterland.  Fighting broke out between two factions &mdash; the supporters of interim President Mahdi and the partisans of USC chairman, General Aideed.</P>
    <P>Alarmed at the rapid deterioration in the situation and the heavy loss of life, the Security Council in January 1992 imposed an arms embargo on Somalia &mdash; a very necessary measure that has to be seen in the context of the vast quantity of arms already in the country.  Under <Col N="1286" /> the same Resolution, Resolution 733, the Secretary-General appointed a Special Representative for Somalia, who was charged with ensuring (a) the cessation of hostilities, (b) the unimpeded delivery of humanitarian assistance, and (c) movement towards national reconciliation.</P>
    <P>The imposition of the arms embargo and the appointment of a UN Special Representative was followed in April 1992 by the establishment of the UN operation in Somalia known as UNOSOM I.  This provided for 50 military observers to be sent to Mogadishu to monitor the ceasefire agreement and the deployment of 500 security personnel to protect the transport, storage and distribution of humanitarian assistance in Somalia.  The deployment of security personnel was blocked by General Aideed, whose agreement was only secured in mid-August.</P>
    <P>President Robinson, accompanied by the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, visited Somalia in October and reported on the situation to the UN Secretary-General, briefing him on what they had seen, on the inadequacy of the supplies getting through to those in need and on the unacceptable security situation.</P>
    <P>The Government decided in November, in response to a request from the United Nations, that Ireland would make available a transport unit to UNOSOM, subject to Dáil approval.  Unfortunately, it was becoming clear that in spite of the efforts of the UN special representative, UNOSOM would be unable to fulfil its mandate.  Its efforts were blocked by the warlords and bandits at every stage.  In December 1992 the Security Council authorised the establishment of the Unified Task Force (UNITAF) under United States command.</P>
    <P>The United Task Force was created as an interim arrangement to deal with the immediate problems of creating a secure environment for the delivery of humanitarian relief.  It largely succeeded in this objective.  But it was clear that a wider international effort would be required if peace and stability were to be restored to Somalia.  On 3 March the Secretary-General <Col N="1287" /> reported to the Security Council in some detail on the situation in Somalia and the efforts being made by the UN and UNITAF to restore peace.  He recommended the establishment of UNOSOM II with a wider and stronger mandate.</P>
    <P>The Secretary-General's recommendations were endorsed by the Security Council on 26 March when, by Resolution 814, it established UNOSOM II.  Resolution 814 is the key resolution governing the UN's current involvement in Somalia.  I believe it is worthwhile to set out the overall objectives of the UN in Somalia as provided for in that resolution. These are:</P>
    <P>to assist in the provision of relief and in the economic rehabilitation of Somalia, based on assessment of clear, prioritised needs;</P>
    <P>to assist in the repatriation of refugees and displaced persons in Somalia;</P>
    <P>to assist the people of Somalia to promote and advance political reconciliation, through broad participation by all sectors of Somalia society, and re-establishment of national and regional institutions and civil administration in the entire country;</P>
    <P>to assist in the re-establishment of Somali police, as appropriate, at the local, regional or national level, to assist in the restoration and maintenance of peace, stability and law and order, including in the investigation of and facilitating the prosecution of serious violations of international humanitarian law;</P>
    <P>to assist the people of Somalia in the development of a coherent and integrated programme for the removal of mines throughout Somalia;</P>
    <P>to develop appropriate public information activities in support of the United Nations' activities in Somalia;</P>
    <P>to create conditions under which Somalia civil society may have a role, at every level, in the process of political <Col N="1288" /> reconciliation and in the formulation and realisation of rehabilitation and reconstruction programme.</P>
    <P>Resolution 814 endorsed the Secretary-General's proposal that the UNOSOM mandate be expanded to include what he called &ldquo;military tasks&rdquo;. Again, I believe it is worthwhile to spell out in detail what these military tasks are. They are:</P>
    <P>(a) to monitor that all factions respect the ceasefire; (b) to prevent the resumption of violence and to take appropriate action against factions which violate or threaten to violate the ceasefire; (c) to maintain control of heavy weapons; (d) to seize unauthorised small arms; (e) to secure ports, airports and lines of communication; (f) to protect UN, Red Cross and NGO personnel and facilities, and to take such forceful action as may be required against attacks on them; (g) to continue the demining programme; (h) to assist in the repatriation of refugees; and (i) to carry out such further functions as may be authorised by the Security Council.</P>
    <P>The mandate and activities of UNOSOM II must be seen as part of an attempt to create a secure environment in which the UN's wider political and humanitarian objectives can be achieved. The Government, Irish NGOs and public and political opinion have pressed for action along these lines and for a stronger UN presence.  The mandate of UNOSOM II &mdash; disarmament, control of weapons, greater protection for aid personnel &mdash; corresponds to the requests that the Government has made directly to the UN and the US in recent months.</P>
    <P>Resolution 814 demanded that the Somali parties, movements and factions, comply fully with the commitments they entered into on 27 March, when they signed an agreement of national reconciliation formally ending the civil war. The agreement also includes the establishment of a Transitional National Council (TNC) to be made up of representatives from each of Somalia's 18 regions.  UNOSOM political officers are <Col N="1289" /> currently holding meetings throughout southern Somalia, seeking agreement on the election of representatives to the district councils, from which in turn the Transitional National Council representatives will be chosen.  It is important that the international community maintain pressure on the Somali leaders to work together for reconciliation and for a democratic national government.</P>
    <P>UNOSOM II, at full strength, will have 20,000 military personnel, 8,000 logistics personnel and a civilian staff of 2,800. More than 18,000 personnel are already deployed.  In addition, the United States provides a quick reaction force under UN command.  This is to be replaced by an international quick reaction force before the end of this year.</P>
    <P>The estimated cost of UNOSOM II, is $1.55 billion for the initial twelve months period.  Ireland's share is approximately $2.79 million.  This amount would have to be paid whether or not we decide to participate in UNOSOM II.  UNOSOM II will be financed through assessed contributions from UN member states.  Additional financing is to be provided through the UN Trust Fund for Somalia, which was established under Security Council Resolution 794.  Ireland contributed £115,000 to that fund in December 1992.</P>
    <P>Before taking up the UN's request to Ireland to participate in UNOSOM II, I would like to outline to the House some of the wiser implications of the use of Chapter VII in the evolution of UN peacekeeping as traditionally understood. It is this feature in particular which distinguishes our proposed involvement in Somalia from any other UN operation in which Ireland has previously participated.</P>
    <P>At the heart of the concept of collective security as contained in the UN Charter is the notion that, if peaceful means fail to prevent a breach of the peace or an act of aggression, coercive measures agreed by the international community, may be used.  In acceding to the UN, and in subscribing to the Charter, Ireland accepted that coercive measures, including military action, might need to be <Col N="1290" /> taken by the Security Council under Chapter VII to maintain or restore international peace and security.  That chapter empowers the Security Council to adopt preventive and enforcement actions ranging from economic sanctions and blockades to military action by air, sea and land forces.</P>
    <P>Because of the Cold War, the Security Council never made use of the most coercive of these provisions.  With the end of the Cold War, and the new mood of co-operation in the Security Council, the UN has been looking again at the possibilities open to it of dealing with serious international and regional crises. The decision to establish UNOSOM II under Chapter VII with a defined range of military tasks, in support of humanitarian and political objectives, can be seen in the context of the new co-operation in the Security Council and the desire to use the potential of the UN to its fullest in the search for peace in Somalia.</P>
    <P>Traditional UN peacekeeping operations are not specifically provided for in the UN Charter.  They developed out of the need for practical instruments to strengthen and underpin the efforts of the UN to bring about the peaceful settlement of disputes under Chapter IV of the Charter.  There is a general consensus in the UN that such operations can be considered as having a basis in the broad powers conferred by the Charter on the UN and especially on the Security Council. In this sense, they are seen as falling somewhere between the political and diplomatic means described in Chapter VI and the enforcement measures envisaged in Chapter VII.  In the case of UNOSOM II, the Secretary-General believed that the force would not be able to implement its mandate unless it were endowed with enforcement powers under Chapter VII.  In the circumstances of Somalia, the Government accept the Secretary-General's view that UNOSOM II should have such a capability.</P>
    <P>On 5 April, the United Nations Secretary-General formally requested Ireland to make available an 80-strong transport contingent to the mission.  A <Col N="1291" /> number of our EC partners have also been asked and some are already participating in UNOSOM II.  These include Belgium, France, Germany, Greece and Italy.</P>
    <P>I have set out on a number of occasions, including most recently to the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs last week, my view that Ireland should participate in UNOSOM II for the following reasons: participation would be a clear demonstration that Ireland is prepared to give operational content to its policy on Somalia; it would reaffirm our longstanding commitment to international peace and security and to upholding the role of the UN, even in difficult and complex situations; it would strengthen our position in demanding greater protection for our aid workers.</P>
    <P>I believe that, to withdraw our original offer made in November 1992, would be perceived as demonstrating a lack of political resolve and of acting in a manner that falls short of our publicly stated commitment to the people of Somalia.  Furthermore, participation in UNOSOM II would underline our view that peace keeping, and peace enforcement under the Charter, are international responsibilities shared by the entire UN membership and are not the preserve of the larger powers.</P>
    <P>In the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs last week, and during the debates on the Defence (Amendment) Bill, 1993, some concern was expressed about the involvement of Irish troops in a United Nations peace enforcement mission and the potential combat role of those troops. I wish to assure the House that, in proposing that Bill, the intention of the Government was that Ireland should adequately play its role in the international force established by the United Nations to respond to the horrific man made situation in Somalia and that we should play our part in the international effort, which we ourselves had demanded.  It was not, and is not the Government's intention that Irish troops should be placed in a combat role in Somalia.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1292" /> Ireland will provide non-combat troops to UNOSOM II.  I believe that, by acting in such a manner, we will be fulfilling a necessary and important role within the United Nations, a role that is in line with our proud tradition of peace keeping, but reflects the changes which have taken place in our world in recent years.  Such a role will permit us to voice, with authority, our views on the nature and mandate of this and future missions.</P>
    <P>I want to put on the record of the House the Government's deep regret and concern at the recent loss of life in Mogadishu. The killing and wounding of Pakistani members of the UNOSOM force on 5 June, the deaths of more than 20 civilians on 13 June, and the attack on Italian soldiers last week highlight the unstable and volatile situation in the city. These events must be fully investigated and the necessary measures taken by the UN.  I have already said that it would be deeply worrying if the UN force &mdash; whose objective is peace &mdash; becomes the focus of resentment or rejection by the Somali people.  I understand that the UN Secretary-General is to report shortly to the Security Council and I will ensure that a copy of his report is made available to Members through the Dáil Library.</P>
    <P>The debate on the Defence (Amendment) Bill has shown that there is wide political support for Ireland's participation in UNOSOM II.  I believe that this reflects the views of the vast majority of Irish people who have, time and again, demonstrated their humanitarian concern for the plight of the Somali people.</P>
    <P>The participation of Irish troops in Somalia is in the best tradition of Irish involvement in UN operations and it will, I hope, contribute to the restoration of peace in that troubled land.  I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael has no objections to the proposals set down in this motion.  Nevertheless, we find it regrettable that the Minister was not in a position to accept the amendment we tabled last week to the Defence (Amendment) Bill proposing that troops sent abroad go in a voluntary capacity.  Even at this late <Col N="1293" /> stage I urge that this matter be reconsidered and that troops sent on missions of this kind are volunteers.</P>
      <P>Ireland has long been one of the world's best members of the United Nations organisation in terms of participation in peacekeeping, support for the UN Charter and the various UN agencies.  The establishment of UNOSOM II last March is a necessary step forward in UN involvement in Somalia. Fine Gael supports the general intention and thrust of UNOSOM II, with reservations.  By agreeing to the Secretary General's request for a transport contingent of 80 personnel we would like it to be made clear that we are contributing not only to the military aims of UNOSOM II but to the wider aims, to bring an end to this internecine civil war, to assist in the reconstruction of the country by promoting political reconciliation and creating an environment in which political organisations and parties can grow, eventually leading to democratic government in Somalia.</P>
      <P>There are some who believe that normal political activity or indeed any form of national government can never return to Somalia given its history in the last 20 years or so.  The establishment of the Siad Barre military dictatorship, which resulted from a coup in 1969 following the assassination of the president, led to civil strife and savage repression &mdash; this was particularly characterised in the last five years of the Siad Barre regime.  The flight of Siad Barre from the country resulted in anarchy and secession, with people living in sheer terror of the warlords.</P>
      <P>This whole generation of political violence and total disregard for civil and human rights has led to a culture of vengence with power and authority coming from the barrel of a gun.  Many would rightly say this is not the most auspicious place to send our troops.  However, we must remember that Somalia was once a normal and peaceful country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For ten years after its independence, by drawing together the old British protectorate and colony and the Italian trust territory, it enjoyed relatively good economic <Col N="1294" /> progress.  Parliamentary democracy worked and elections were freely held. However, that position changed with the assassination of the president in October 1969 and the coup which resulted in Siad Barre coming to power six days later.</P>
    <P>I draw this matter to the attention of those who see no hope of normality returning to Somalia.  I emphasise that there is hope because for almost one third of this stricken country's modern history life was normal by African standards. Democracy worked there, and it can work again.  The United Nations, and we as a member of that organisation, must be careful in our approach.  The impression can be created that the US-led UNITAF operation, primarily a military operation intended to break the stranglehold of the warlords, is needed on an ongoing basis to maintain peace in Somalia. That is not so and let us have no part in that thinking.  UNITAF broke the blockade by the warlords on relief supplies and as a result the distribution of food and medicines saved many thousands of lives.  However, UNITAF could not address the wider problem of this stricken country and that is why the central purpose of UNOSOM II must be orientated towards the wider problem.  I am concerned that, as its largest component consists of 20,000 military personnel, it could see its role in terms of military intervention.  We all know that public opinion can turn against military solutions, and that is true even of countries like Somalia which we regard as not having informed public opinion.</P>
    <P>The overriding role and objective of UNOSOM II must be the restoration of a civil society.  This must be done by disarmament, an area in which UNITAF has failed.  There can be no effective progress without disarmament.  Somalia is the most heavily armed country in Africa, a country with no Government or central authority.  Therefore, disarmament, which is a most difficult task, should be a first priority.  This approach is crucially important.  We were recently reminded that there is no point in disarming a shopkeeper in Mogadishu who keeps a weapon for self-defence and defence of <Col N="1295" /> his business while not disarming the bandit whose aim is to rob and possibly murder.  The restoration of a civil society must be concentrated on humanitarian efforts.</P>
    <P>It is little known that in the last ten years of the Barre regime epidemic and endemic diseases such as tuberculosis, measles, dysentry and malaria killed more people in Somalia than famine.  The public health crisis in Somalia, one of the worst in the world, is related to the collapse of civil order.  UNICEF confirms that Somalia possibly has the highest child mortality rate in the world in terms of children who die at birth and before they are five years of age.</P>
    <P>According to reports compiled by NGOs such as Concern, Trócaire, GOAL, Oxfam and others, there are at least two million displaced people and refugees as a result of civil war and mayhem &mdash; more than 25 per cent of the total population of 7.5 million are displaced or refugees in their own homeland. The enormous logistical problem of resettling these people must be a priority of UNOSOM II, the same applies to the public health crisis.  I urge the Tánaiste to emphasise that in his contacts with the Secretary General.  Political reconciliation is at the very heart of bringing peace and stability to this broken country where political structures hardly exist at all.  It is so long since anything approaching normal politics existed that it is almost gone from living memory there.  The whole northern region has declared its secession and this is a major problem.</P>
    <P>While we welcome the meeting and agreement of the various Somalia political factions in Adis Abbaba last April, which pledged to work for reconstruction and ultimately the establishment of a government based on the rule of law, decentralisation of power, protection of human rights and the building of a democratic republic whose integrity would be protected, we see that that is very much an aim in the long term, given the circumstances that exist in the country.  Nurturing that political process <Col N="1296" /> towards those ends must be a parallel priority for UNOSOM.  We need to say over and over again that by sending our soldiers we are sending them not to impose some form of international military solution on Somalia, but to do our bit towards rehabilitation, reconstruction and restoration of the civil order to bring this impoverished almost destroyed State back into the international community.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister told us this evening that it would be a central part of the role of our transport contingent to protect NGOs.  There have been complaints by NGOs operating in Somalia at the lack of protection.  There has been hostility between the various international NGOs and UNITAF and I am informed that there is not a great relationship between NGOs operating in the country and the personnel of UNOSOM II who have now moved in. In contacts with the Secretary General, the Tánaiste should ensure that the role of UNOSOM II, which will run for two years initially, is closely linked with the various non-governmental organisations and the various inter-governmental organisations working in Somalia.  Let us not forget that when the UN abandoned this country in 1991 the only people to stay there to provide some kind of humanitarian assistance and some semblance of civilised order in certain places were these non-governmental organisations. It is important that they are given a role and that UNOSOM II sees it as part of their role to give a meaningful role to the non-governmental organisations.</P>
    <P>Complaints have been made that ordinary Somalis are not given a role in the present reconstruction process.  That must change.  A programme that excludes the local population is doomed to failure. I acknowledge that very often the people who write these things in various publications have their own agendas to promote, but I have read such reports in at least three internationally recognised and respected publications.  The Minister should bring these matters to the notice of the Secretary General.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that now that the <Col N="1297" /> United Nations has been freed of the restrictions and the shackles of the Cold War it can move to peace-enforcement in the world.  As I said before, at the behest of the UN I went to Angola last October to observe the elections.  The most tragic thing happened there.  For two years the UN worked in the setting up of what was needed to bring about a ceasefire between two major factions in that country.  The ceasefire was brokered and the leaders of the various factions were brought together several times.  A normal atmosphere was created in which a general election campaign could be fought and an election held.  The election was held under the auspices of the UN and other international organisations, but when the results were announced the losers could not accept the result and the country reverted to civil war.  Various accounts now claim that almost 500,000 people have been killed since the general election last October.  The UN was left toothless because its mandate did not extend to doing anything after the elections. The assumption was made that somehow the result of the election would impose normality on that unfortunate country, but it did not.</P>
    <P>We have made great progress in the reformed role of the UN.  This international organisation has seen further down the road.  We cannot create conditions in which elections can take place and then walk away and hope that everything will be normal in countries where normality was the last thing on the agenda for the previous ten or 20 years. I am delighted that that measure of commonsense has been brought into the conduct of the UN internationally.</P>
    <P>We agree with this proposal.  Two weeks ago, on the Estimates for the Department of Foreign Affairs, Fine Gael Deputies pointed to the horrible situation in which Africa finds itself. There are many countries in deep trouble, for example, Angola and Mozambique, and there are two countries where all forms of civil authority and government have disappeared entirely, that is Liberia and Somalia.  It is almost inconceivable in the modern world with <Col N="1298" /> modern communications, when people were, perhaps, never more politically aware, that all civil order and all government can disappear leaving total mayhem and lawlessness.</P>
    <P>UNOSOM II in Somalia is a contribution towards rolling back that awful tide that has beset that unfortunate continent over the last 15 years.  The winds of change that brought decolonisation and self-government to Africa have been for so many a terrible tragedy and much of that tragedy was contributed to by the powers who participated in the Cold War.  Both saw their aims being served by supporting various countries, one against the other, very often to the total destruction of the economic structures in that country.  Indeed, Somalia is a very good example.  The first Government in Somalia elected in 1960 after independence was pro-western.  When Siad Barre came to power he was pro-western for a little while, and then as he used to say himself, he was pro-Soviet bloc before being pro-western again.  The Soviet Union, the United States of America, the United Kingdom and others poured arms into these countries with the result that you now find in Africa children carrying AK47 rifles, due to the lack of control over weapons.  In preparing for this debate I read an article in which it was stated that it will take years to complete the demining programme in Somalia and that the number of mines runs to six figures and perhaps seven.  All of this military hardware was imported from the Soviet Union, the United States of America, the United Kingdom and other Eastern bloc countries, such as Czechoslovakia.  All we can say from these benches tonight is that the people concerned, whatever the purpose, have much to answer for.</P>
    <P>Having said that, we welcome the thrust of this motion.  However, we are sending our troops into a danger zone. While we should not shirk our responsibilities, they should go on the basis that they are volunteers.  Heretofore, to my knowledge, all the troops who went abroad on peacekeeping missions volunteered to go.  It is a pity this principle <Col N="1299" /> was not incorporated in the Defence (Amendment) Act last week.  We made the point that they will face great danger, that we face the prospect of body bags and that there would be greater acceptance if the troops go there as volunteers rather than by military order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>My party, the Progressive Democrats, supports this motion.  As far as we are concerned, membership of the United Nations carries with it an obligation to live up to the Charter of the United Nations in its entirety.  To some extent the 1960 Act, in so far as it confined Ireland to police type peacekeeping operations, shortchanged our fellow members &mdash; not that we have any major contribution to make in terms of military might to Chapter VII military actions which may from time to time occur.  The point is well made in the Minister's speech this evening that one is hardly in a position to criticise others for failing to do that which one is legally prohibited from doing.  Therefore our membership of the United Nations entails, as a corollary, a willingness to participate fully in Chapter VII operations when necessary, in the view of the Security Council, to secure international peace and vindicate the rights of member states of the United Nations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa has outlined his view in this House and at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs that there is nothing ignominious or dishonourable about being involved in peacekeeping operations and has queried, on a very clear line of argument, whether it is our duty to expand our role beyond peacekeeping for formal Chapter VII actions.  I cannot accept as logical that on the one hand a state could prohibit itself privately by its internal laws from living up to is obligations imposed by United Nations membership and, on the other hand, expect other states of a similar or greater size to participate in United Nations peace enforcement action.  Nor can I accept that any such state could ever ask for outside assistance when the need arose for Chapter VII action to preserve its own integrity, <Col N="1300" /> if it prohibited itself from doing the same in the case of other states in a similar set of circumstances.</P>
    <P>Lastly, and most forcibly in this context, whereas I agree that there has been much justified criticism that Chapter VII action has been dictated by geo-political forces not under the firm control of the United Nations, it seems that if small nations such as Ireland make a virtue out of not participating, they leave the way open only for those with large armies and the military capacity to deliver.  We cannot whinge if the United States takes a leading role, both politically and militarily, in Chapter VII operations if at the same time we say that under no circumstances will we participate in such operations.  Either we accept the Chapter VII aspect or we do not.  If we accept it we should be willing to participate to the best of our capacity and if we do not accept it we should in all honesty say as a matter of conviction that Chapter VII, which relates to the capacity of the United Nations to act internationally, should be removed from the United Nations Charter, because we cannot have it every way.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that Chapter VII was never used during the Cold War period; but I think, in a fit of stage politics on one occasion, the USSR left the United Nations and found that in its absence the Korean mandate was given under Chapter VII.  That was the only exception. As the Minister said, there was an unremitting failure to employ Chapter VII during the entire Cold War period.</P>
    <P>Anyone who has done some background reading in relation to the Horn of Africa would be sceptical that a United Nations force would have the capacity to establish a civil society on foot of a military mandate in present circumstances. It is noteworthy that the area in question was colonised late and was of little interest to the colonising powers apart from is strategic importance at the entrance to the Red Sea.  If one were to read Packenham's book <i>Scramble for Africa</i>, or Wilfred Thesiger's book <i>Arabian Sands</i> about the Horn of Africa as he found it in the twenties or thirties, one <Col N="1301" /> would see that it showed little promise except for those colonial powers who wanted to exclude others from making use of the coastline.</P>
    <P>We now find ourselves in the strange position where an area, part of which was the subject of a United Nations mandate, is effectively being militarily occupied by a United Nationas force for the purpose of establishing civil institutions in a process which, having read the documentation which has been furnished to me as a member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, I still fail to understand. It is all very well to talk about national and regional councils, but it is hard to understand how two well-armed rival movements in Somalia will be brought together and married in some set of institutions in a process sponsored by the United Nations in the presence of United Nations troops.  I do not believe that this process has been well thought out.  It might have been better if the United Nations had been more radical and established a mandate to impose civil rule rather than pretend it is going to weld together two well-armed factions who know that the capacity of the United Nations to remain in that country must be measured at a period of 24 months at the outside, after which the country will again find itself in a vacuum and these two contending groups will attempt to have their way by force of arms.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I believe the United Nations was correct to intervene.  I have listened to the points made on previous occasions by Deputy De Rossa about the dubious deployment of Chapter VII powers, given what he claims is the absence of any international dimension to the problems in Somalia.  Bearing in mind the previous conflict in the Ogaden Desert and the difficulties posed for Kenya on its border, I believe there was an international regional threat to order and security and that to allow the matter to simply continue uninhibited would probably have been a huge mistake in terms of international security and the security of the neighbouring states.  I believe it was right to intervene in the conflict and that the United Nations was <Col N="1302" /> correct to establish UNOSOM I, UNOSOM II, UNITAF, etc.</P>
    <P>However, what is needed now is a clear political programme and a set of political steps planned in advance as to how that programme is to be achieved.  I do not see from the documents furnished that such a political programme exists.  Therefore, I have doubts about the deployment of military force in support of what are, in the last analysis, somewhat ethereal and elusive civil political objectives.  The political mandate of the United Nations should be strengthened and all the necessary steps taken to create some form of civil administration in that territory.  The impression should not be created among the warring factions that the UN will have a go at doing that but will withdraw if that process fails.  That would be fatal and could create a huge conflict at a later stage.</P>
    <P>We are great at calling people we do not like warlords.  The suggestion that a warrant should be issued for the arrest of General Aideed and he should be made amenable to some form of justice, which the UN apparently claims to be entitled to administer in respect of certain major crimes, carries with it certain worries.  I am not happy as to how such warrants could be executed, how such trials could be conducted, where the persons involved could be detained or punished and what reality there is to such a process. It is the first time I have seen a warrant backed up by the use of bombers, fighter planes, etc.  I do not like the process which was adopted to deal with General Aideed &mdash; it was retaliatory and, to some extent, a deterrent.  This process was not evenhanded and I do not think in the final analysis it will win support for the UN mandate in Somalia.  On the contrary, the military intervention in recent times will obviously create resentment and bitterness towards the UN.  As a consequence General Aideed or, if he is taken out, his successor will be strengthened greatly by his claim that he stood up to the foreigners in the region.  We need to be more subtle about what we do in this regard in the future.</P>
    <P>I am most unhappy about the Pakistani <Col N="1303" /> incident.  I do not accept for one minute the suggestion that it was necessary to shoot women and children in order to get at armed elements in a crowd.  That is an age-old excuse in such situations and it is very clear that the excuse was contrived on this occasion.  Of course, I was not there but this incident has the smell, so to speak, of a justification which was not honest.  I have not known of any situation where it has been necessary to shoot down women and children in order to get at gunmen.  I do not recall seeing any clear evidence published thus far that there were armed gunmen using these people as human shields.  This matter should be investigated quickly, thoroughly and honestly and, unless there is convincing evidence to back up the Pakistania side, which I do not believe will be forthcoming, an aplogy should be issued at the earliest possible opportunity to the Somalia people for what I consider to be an actrocity.</P>
    <P>As previous speakers have said, this Chapter VII action is part of a wider role to which Ireland is now becoming alerted.  Some of the criticisms made by Deputy De Rossa are valid in so far as he has suggested that a Chapter VII action is motivated on some occasions and vetoed on other occasions by the strategic interests of the larger members, in terms of military and political strength, of the United Nations.</P>
    <P>The recent deployment of missiles in Baghdad, under the ostensible mantle of Chapter VII authority, was unlawful, was not an act of self-defence and was a flagrant breach of the rules of the United Nations and the Chapter in general.  It is not sufficient for Ireland and the other EC member states to express, as the Minister recently did, concern about the matter; it goes much further than that. The EC member states should, through EPC, have indicated very clearly to the United States that this attack was unacceptable, was never to happen again.  It has done tremendous damage.</P>
    <P>I accept that the Minister must play a diplomatic game and he does not want to step out of line for fear of overly offending <Col N="1304" /> the Americans because we have commercial and other interests in not offending them.  On the one hand we cannot take our relationship with America for granted in many different ways, but on the other, the European Community should make it very clear to Washington that there is to be no more of this type of retaliatory action to protect American interests under the mantle of the United Nations Charter and Chapter VII.  This practice must stop.  It has been mooted that similar steps will be taken if the Lybian Government does not surrender the hijackers who the Americans suspect were responsible for the Lockerbie aircrash.  If the last bombings of Tripoli and Benghazi were wrong &mdash; I believe they were wrong and I admire Deputy O'Malley for criticising them outright at that time &mdash; then the attack on Baghdad was wrong, and any further retaliatory steps under a Chapter VII mantle against Libya and other members of the Islamic world would equally be wrong.</P>
    <P>This brings me to my final point.  A fundamental mistake is being made in western and, in particular, American diplomatic circles in failing to understand the Islamic world, what makes it tick, the aspirations of the peoples of those countries and the dangers of treating them in a second-class way.  We are treating the peoples of the Arab worlds and the wider Islamic world in a way which sometimes borders on the contemptuous. The western world cannot afford to do that, first, on the basis of self-interest at the very lowest and, second, any sense of decency.  The Arab and Islamic worlds are entitled to be treated better than they are.  They are not second-class citizens and they are not obliged to sustain these unfair and unlawful discriminations at the hands of the greater states.  I believe that if Chapter VII means much, it should mean something being done for the Palestinians at some stage and enforcement of the United Nations resolutions in relation to solving the Palestinian problem.</P>
    <P>If we are becoming involved in Chapter VII activity on Somalia, it contrasts very much with the pathetic performance of <Col N="1305" /> the European Community &mdash; Ireland must take its share of the blame &mdash; in regard to Bosnia.  I know the situation in Bosnia is complex, but this country, among the other EC member states recognised the Republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina. We accepted that they should be admitted to UN membership and we saw, just as clearly as the other member states of the European Community, that it was proposed to dismember them by a campaign of war and genocide, and this country insisted on nothing being done to save them except futile humanitarian gestures.  In that context, if as I accept the Bosnian Muslims ought not be armed now and if they are not entitled to self-defence, they are entitled to call on the Community internationally to defend them.  International law and international politics cannot require that certain people be defenceless and that war be waged on them with impunity.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Tánaiste for the way his Department of Foreign Affairs and he have taken the role which is now much more obvious in this House in relation to foreign affairs and the courteous and supportive way in which they have interacted with the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs.  In that context, I want to pay a particular tribute to Deputy Lenihan, the chairman of that committee who has been unfailingly courteous, kind, reasonable, supportive and positive in the way he has chaired the committee to date.  Long may it continue.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To add the following to the motion:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Permanent Defence Force's participation in UNOSOM II shall be related only to performance of duties of a police character, including the protection of aid workers.  The approval of Dáil Éireann shall be required for (a) participation in a UNOSOM II mandate which has been altered, (b) an increase in the number of Irish troops participating in UNOSOM II, or (c) participation in UNOSOM II other than a transport unit.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1306" /> We are often told that because the Berlin Wall has fallen and the Cold War has ended we no longer have conflicts between the major powers.  That is utter nonsense.  It would be foolish for this country to pursue its international relations and foreign affairs policy on the basis that we are now living in a benign world, where only the good, the beautiful and the kind reign supreme.  Clearly, there are major regional interests: the powerful states in the world are anxious to maintain their interests and hegemony over resources in various regions of the world many thousands of miles away from their national territory.  That is the reality.  In debating the issue we should bear in mind how and when this country should become involved in peace enforcement, either directly under the remit of the United Nations or in some franchised way through the authorisation of the United Nations.  In my view it is wrong to pretend that the only role of the various elements that make up the decision-making process of the Security Council in relation to Somalia is that order and democracy be restored and that the people be allowed get on with their own affairs.  Clearly, that is not the case.  Even a superficial reading of the most recent history of Somalia indicates that the major powers &mdash; the US and the Russian Federation which now replaces the USSR &mdash; played a ping pong game with Somalia.  They supported the very warlords whom the United Nations is now being asked to suppress and to replace with a democratic system.</P>
    <P>I wished to make that point before proceeding to discuss the amendment I tabled to the motion.  The motion before us is far too general in terms of the mandate we are giving to the Minister for Foreign Affairs in relation to Somalia. We are being asked simply to approve the despatch of a mission under an amended Defence Act and it does not refer to the fact that it is a transport unit or that only 80 personnel will be involved.  Under the Defence (Amendment) Act the number of personnel can be expanded to any figure that the Government decides, and the Government does not have to come <Col N="1307" /> back to this House to get approval for the increased involvement.  Neither does the motion confine our troops to serving in a transport unit nor to a non-combatant role.  Although the Minister assures the House he has no intention of allowing Irish troops to become engaged in combat, the motion does not say that. There is no provision in the motion to ensure that the Government will return to the House if the Security Council next week, next month or next October, when the current mandate is up for review, decides to strengthen the mandate yet again.  There is nothing in the motion that obliges the Government to come back to the House again to seek approval for the continued engagement of Irish troops in that situation or to agree to a change in the role of Irish troops.  I tabled an amendment to address those issues.</P>
    <P>I contend that the United Nations in Somalia has stumbled into uncharted ground during the past few months.  It is not at all certain what exactly is the legal status of the United Nations involvement in the country.  Lawyers tell us &mdash; but Deputy Michael McDowell did not &mdash; that the nature of law is a constant dialogue between consent and coercion, between right and might and between <i>de jure</i> and <i>de facto</i> but legal authority without the power to enforce it &mdash; which is what is happening in the United Nations call for war crime trials in the Balkans, brings legality into disrepute. The deployment of raw power without legal sanction, which I believe is the state of affairs in Somalia, is the essence of anarchy.  Of course, there are two kinds of anarchy, particularly in Somalia.  The first is what used to be the case in Somalia where there was no effective central authority and piratical warlords competed with each other.  The second is what is happening now where there is a central authority &mdash; the United Nations forces &mdash; but they seem to be shooting first and thinking about their legal standing afterwards. The United Nations is operating in Somalia without legal precedent.  It has never before intervened, without invitation, in the internal affairs of a state <Col N="1308" /> but of course it is argued there is no Somali Government to issue such an invitation. There is nothing in the United Nations Charter to provide for such circumstances. Therefore the legality of what is being done is open to question. If the United Nations does have a legal case, it remains unstated and the Minister here this evening has not stated it either. It appears it is highly confusing; certainly that has been my experience in attempting to come to terms with it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Michael McDowell raised the question of Chapter VII and argued that we have no right to declare our commitment to the United Nations Charter and then say we have the right not to become involved in actions being taken under Chapter VII.  Of course, since the UN was formed, Chapter VII is probably noted more for its non-implementation than for its actual implementation.  If my memory serves me correctly, only since 1991 has the United Nations actually become involved in peace enforcement, with the possible exception of the Korean War.  It is notable that the history books make it very clear that that was a war in terms of one particular political view fighting another political view and had very little to do with the United Nations Charter.  Therefore, this question of Chapter VII does arise.  I might draw Deputy Michael McDowell's attention to an article which I am sure he has read in the <i>Irish Law Times</i> of March 1993 which I quoted in our debate on the Defence (Amendment) Bill, 1993, last week.  This article is written by Ms. Liz Heffernan, a lecturer in Law at Trinity College, Dublin, and entitled &ldquo;Military Action Under the Auspices of the United Nations&rdquo; in which she stated:</P>
    <P>The instigation and operation of each such licence&mdash;</P>
    <P>this is in relation to military intervention&mdash;</P>
    <P>raises a multiplicity of concerns but what is often overlooked is the fragile legal foundation on which the actual licensing power of the Council is based. The Security Council has never relied <Col N="1309" /> directly on Article 42.  Moreover nowhere in Chapter VII is the Council expressly empowered to authorise states to impose military sanctions. Rather, the Council seems to have assumed a power to do so, presumably on the basis of Article 39 and Chapter VII as a whole.  To date, that power has been limited to the formulation of recommendations rather than decisions.</P>
    <P>Of course that is also debatable in that we are told almost daily that if the United Nations Security Council takes a decision, we are obliged to pursue its implementation in any way it is possible for us to do, ignoring the fact that not all decisions of the Security Council are binding on all its members and that some are merely recommendations.  That was the case in respect of the franchising of the United States to engage itself in attacks on Iraq resulting from the latter's invasion of Kuwait.</P>
    <P>The practice has developed of arguing that, first, we must take the United Nations Charter at its face value and, second, that we must take a particular interpretation of Chapter VII on the basis of those who argue for peace enforcement as distinct from peacekeeping.  I have heard it stated a number of times that we have a moral obligation to support the Somalis in whatever way we can. Indeed, Irish people, both privately and through non-governmental organisations, have done so, as have our Government and President.  But I have not yet heard a convincing argument for sending a transport unit, which incidentally the Minister says will not be involved in combat operations.  He told us there is no intention that Irish troops would be involved in combat operations, but they would be involved in a peace enforcement mission.  It seems to me there is double speak, there.  We must be involved in peace enforcement in order to fulfil our moral obligations and to strengthen our case in arguing for assistance from the United Nations in other areas, but at the same time we will not allow our troops become involved in <Col N="1310" /> combat situations and will not send combat troops to Somalia.</P>
    <P>I have already said that the motion does not in fact preclude the sending of combat troops to Somalia.  There is nothing to prevent the Government deciding next week to send a battalion, brigade or unit of some kind of combat troops to Somalia.  Therefore there is a range of debatable issues in relation to this decision which I believe have not been given the public airing they require. We must remember we are affecting an historic change in the role of our Defence Forces and Ireland's role internationally. We are allowing it to slide through almost without a peep at 9.45 p.m. on a Tuesday evening.  It seems to me that the reservations expressed by Deputies Michael McDowell and Connor are very valid ones and should lead at least to an urging of the Minister to defer this decision and to support my amendment to the effect that out role should be a peacekeeping one until such time as we have had clarified exactly what is meant by the United Nations when it talks about peace enforcement.</P>
    <P>I might draw the attention of the House to the United Nations Security Council motion, which reads:</P>
    <P>5.  <i>Decides</i> to expand the size of the UNOSOM force and its mandate in accordance with the recommendations contained in the report of the Secretary-General of 3 March 1992, paragraphs 56-88, and the provisions of this resolution:</P>
    <P>In effect the mandate of UNOSOM is contained not merely in this resolution but in paragraph 56-88 of the report of the Secretary-General of 3 March 1992 to the Security Council.  I want to draw the attention of the House to the issues that are detailed in this report, in paragraph 56-88, which are quite astonishing. A simple reading of the motion is not sufficient to understand precisely in what activity UNOSOM II will be involved.  I might draw attention to page 34 of that report where it is stated:</P>
    <P>I have also received an understanding <Col N="1311" /> from the United States Government that a tactical quick reaction force would be available in support of the force Commander of UNOSOM II; a memorandum of understanding will be concluded between the United States and UNOSOM during the transfer phase.</P>
    <P>What exactly does that mean?  Does that mean that the quick reaction force will not be under the direct control of the Commander of the UNOSOM forces? It is not explained and is certainly not explained in the motion or in the Minister's remarks.</P>
    <P>On page 36 of the report it is said:</P>
    <P>I would like to stress, however, that the ability of UNOSOM to carry out its mandate will depend on critical logistical and other support from the United States, including a tactical quick reaction force.</P>
    <P>Again, there is no explanation as to where exactly the control will reside.  I pointed out in the course of the debate on the Defence (Amendment) Bill, 1993, last week that it is my belief that control will reside in the Pentagon.</P>
    <P>The whole question of legal authority is one which this House must address before agreeing to send Irish troops on a peace enforcement mission.  We are being asked to approve the commitment of Irish troops in circumstances in which the United Nations clearly sees its role as one of peace enforcement rather than its traditional one of peacekeeping.  There are many things we could be doing and supporting in Somalia which would not involve our troops being engaged in peace enforcement.  The fundamental aim of policy in Somalia should be to develop a partnership between the United Nations and the Somali people. That is not possible if they are engaged in bombing and responsible for civilian deaths.  The UN should help people to help themselves.  The UN should adopt a more sensitive approach rather than depending on the raw power and the <Col N="1312" /> fire power of the 30 states that will be engaged in this adventure.</P>
    <P>A number of essential preconditions should be set.  A high level inquiry has to be established into recent events and the killings and abuses since December. Those inquiries should be staffed by foreign and Somali representatives and be independent of the United Nations.  I do not think the Secretary General of the United Nations can investigate alleged abuses against his own forces.  There must be a curtailment of the rules of engagement of the UNOSOM forces which are extremely wide.  I fail to see how, in a civilised society, we can allow them to continue.</P>
    <P>An independent public watchdog over all international operations in Somalia must be created so that Somalias can highlight their needs and have their complaints investigated.  There should be support, constructive, independent and accountable initiatives as part of the political process.  The elders, religious leaders, women's groups and voluntary organisations all exist in Somalia.  It is not a society totally bereft of rational human beings.  It is not a country made up of so-called warlords.  The UN should stop following the dubious lead of the American Government in the invasion of Grenada, the bombing of Tripoli, the toppling of General Noriego and the recent bombing of Baghdad with Cruise missiles.  The US understanding of this distinction between right and might is shaky to say the least.</P>
    <P>I would draw the attention of the House to the fact that in recent years the United States was supporting the major side in the civil war in Somalia and helped to destroy that country.  Now the US is the leading force and we have been told they are the people who will bring about peace and democracy there.  It beggars belief.  We should be extremely cautious about being led down the road where we are seen simply as the pawns of the major powers in the world to continue to fight their battles in a proxy way in other countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support this <Col N="1313" /> motion approving the despatch of a contingent of our Defence Forces to Somalia as part of the UNOSOM II mission established by the United Nations Security Council.  One important element is that this UNOSOM force will be under the control and direction of United Nations command and is contrary to a suggestion by Deputy De Rossa that in some way there is a United States element involved. This is a United Nations international force under United Nations command and we are one of 32 countries playing a part.  It is important to emphasise that UNOSOM II was established by the United Nations Security Council on 26 March 1993 with the twin aims of a secure environment for humanitarian relief work and for political reconciliation.</P>
      <P>At all levels in Ireland, from our President to aid agencies and to this House we have called for a strong determined international effort to assist the humanitarian relief work in Somalia and to secure peace in that unfortunate country. The United Nations, through the Secretary General and the Security Council, responded.  In view of our consistent attitude can we turn our back on the people of Somalia or on the United Nations?  I agree fully with Deputy Michael McDowell in this respect.  We have been asked to supply a transport contingent of 80 troops in an international force of 28,000 troops, drawn from 32 countries.  That is a minimum response from us to help Somalia having regard to the strong attitude at all levels of Irish society.  We would be guilty of rank hypocrisy if we adopted any other attitude in the circumstances.</P>
      <P>As members of the United Nations, we have performed well.  We have pursued a positive policy of helping peace-keeping operations and other activities of the United Nations since we became members.  We are being asked to participate in a mission which is supported at every level in our society.</P>
      <P>The mandate and activities of UNOSOM II must be seen as part of an attempt to create a secure environment in which the UN's wider political and humanitarian objectives can be achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1314" /> The Government, Irish non-governmental organisations, public opinion and political opinion have pressed for action along these lines and for a stronger United Nations presence.</P>
    <P>The mandate of UNOSOM II which includes disarmament, control of weapons and greater protection for aid personnel corresponds exactly to the requests the Government made directly to the United Nations and the United States in recent months.  How then can we consider in any rational way Deputy De Rossa's amendment which seeks to confine our participation in UNOSOM II to duties of a police nature?  Have we, one of the 32 countries involved, a right to confine our involvement to what we regard as minimum police duties concerned only with the protection of aid workers?  Should Ireland with our minimum contribution of 80 personnel, seek to carve out some exception or exemption for ourselves under Chapter VII? With all due respect to Deputy De Rossa, that is not realistic and runs counter to what we want for Somalia.</P>
    <P>We should participate in the manner proposed by the Tánaiste.  That would be a clear demonstration of support for UN policy in Somalia and a re-affirmation of Ireland's commitment to international peace and security.  It would be a positive response to calls for greater protection for Irish aid workers and the workers of other countries.</P>
    <P>The core of Irish foreign policy must be the pursuit of peace through the application of the international rule of law based on the collective security of states under the Charter of the United Nations. Indeed, in 1936 the League of Nations ignored Eamon de Valera's advice and failed to deter Mussolini's aggression against Ethiopia.  From that year the League of Nations lost all credibility as an international organisation precisely because it was unable to take the necessary collective action against Mussolini.</P>
    <P>At the end of World War II the international community decided to make a fresh start and began the United Nations experiment.  Today, almost 50 years later, the end of the Cold War has made <Col N="1315" /> it possible for the United Nations to begin to function as its founders intended, as the guardian of international peace and security.  It has failed to perform that function over the years.  The divisions and confrontations in the Security Council prevented and frustrated the United Nations from acting in the manner the founders hoped, in place of the League of Nations and as a viable organisation maintaining peace and security on behalf of the international community.</P>
    <P>The Cold War division frustrated that purpose and since 1958 all UN interventions, in which we participated admirably, were confined by reasons of the divisions on the Security Council to operations merely of a police character. That was confirmed in the Defence Act, 1960, but it was not the purpose of the original framers of the United Nations. It was a minimum response from the international community because of the frustrations on its actions caused by division on the Security Council.</P>
    <P>The motion before us will enable our Defence Forces to participate in an international United Nations force, to use the phraseology of the Bill.  There is no mention of peacekeeping or peacemaking, merely an international United Nations force in which we are seeking to participate. Under the Defence Act, 1960, every mission of 12 or more Irish troops must have Dáil approval.  That safeguard is also enshrined in this motion.</P>
    <P>The mission to Somalia is a minimum response, but it involves our participation in a military group and, as Deputy De Rossa stated, it is a new step in that respect.  It involves our participation in a military group mandated under Chapter VII of the Charter which provides for a package relating to peace and security in a global sense in Somalia, Cambodia, East Timor or elsewhere.  Within Chapter VII of the Charter there is scope to provide for peace enforcement as part of a collective security concept that includes preventative diplomacy, peacekeeping and peace building.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the essence of what the Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, emphasised in a short report on the future of the United Nations.  In his view we must look on peace enforcement as part of a package which includes peacekeeping, which is preceded by preventative diplomacy, after peacekeeping and peacemaking operations it would then engage in peace building.  That is the composite package envisaged under Chapter VII and emphasised in an agenda for peace by the Secretary General.</P>
      <P>The essence of the concept of collective security, emphasised in the UN Charter, is that it must have one very pertinent capacity, that if peaceful means fail to prevent a breach of the peace or an act of aggression, coercive measures agreed by the international community may have to be used.  In joining the United Nations and subscribing to the Charter in the 1950s, Ireland accepted that coercive measures, including military action, might have to be taken by the Security Council under Chapter VII to maintain or restore international peace and security. The type of action now being undertaken by the UN forces in Somalia may rightly be taken under UN procedures in other areas of the world in future.  That is the historic nature of this step which I envisage being taken wherever regional conflicts disturb the peace, involve breaches of human rights, aggression or breaches of the international rule of law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When preventative actions, peace-keeping and all the efforts of diplomacy and sanctions fail, this type of action may have to be undertaken.  It is being undertaken at present in Somalia by the UN forces and, as long as it is taken under UN procedures and the force or commission sent is under the command of the UN, we should give it our full support.  Only in that can smaller countries ensure the observance of an international rule of law and not the law of the jungle as was the case in the 1930s when the world was at <Col N="1317" /> the mercy of real warlords prior to World War II.  We can always play our appropriate role with other nations, in this case with 31 other nations, on a collective basis in the cause of peace and security.</P>
    <P>Human nature being what it is, laws cannot function without sanctions.  Domestic law would be disregarded and anarchy would prevail in the absence of enforcement.  Similarly, if we are to achieve observance of an international rule of law to preserve peace and prevent aggression, the international community must be in a position to enforce its collective peaceful will.  That is a central principle which we must face up to.  There was a tendency to debate this matter in a woolly and fudgy manner.  We are setting a precedent where we can acknowledge that we, in a small way, can take our place with other nations in the interests of the collective security and peace we want and we can only do that through the observance and enforcement of an international rule of law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very interesting and significant debate, not just in the context of what we are proposing to do here, but from the point of view of what has been said this evening, particularly by members of the Government.  I say that with a good deal of satisfaction because I see tonight the emergence of something significant on which I hope we will reflect carefully and build on in future years.</P>
      <P>The remarks of the Tánaiste and Deputy Lenihan were significant because they were different in tone and content from what they said in the past.  We are seeing the evolution of a much more realistic and healthy approach to our place in the United Nations and in some of the wider activities on the world stage which, unfortunately, are necessary and, regrettably, will continue to be necessary for some time to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted we are taking this step. Although Deputy De Rossa has reservations, I fully support the motion, particularly as it is clearly centred on the mandate given to UNOSOM II by the UN Resolution.  Unlike Deputy De <Col N="1318" /> Rossa, I am wholeheartedly in agreement with it because it clearly states that we accept the full breadth and depth of the content of the mandate of UNOSOM II.  I do not accept that, faced with the position in Somalia, the rest of the world could contemplate standing by and doing nothing, nor do I accept that it would be moral in the light of the history of that part of Africa to stand aside now and not try, however difficult it might be, to restore some semblance of peace and order to that part of the world so that the people there can get on with the business of running their democracies and, above all, feed themselves, nurture their children and develop their societies.</P>
    <P>I agree with my colleague, Deputy Connor, who expressed the legitimate concern that the UN forces should adhere rigidly to the terms of the Resolution and to the mandates of UNOSOM and UNITAF because they would have no legitimacy in going even the slightest bit beyond the framework of those mandates. It is interesting to note that the provision of relief is a central part of Resolution 814.  That is why we are sending troops and why a logistical support facility is required there.  It is clearly a very sensible and proper part of the kind of operation that should be conducted.</P>
    <P>The situation in Somalia is volatile, to say the least.  There are dangers and hardships involved for everybody trying to assist in any way.  We should remind ourselves that Irish aid workers, and indeed people who work for non-governmental organisations of all kinds, voluntarily accept the risks and dangers of situations like that.  They enter that kind of scene to do the kind of job they are motivated to do and for which they get far too little recognition.  Tragically, there have been fatalities among the non-governmental organisation workers.  As far as possible, they deserve support from the rest of the world community and we should provide the framework for the work they are trying to do which is, essentially, peace building work, even though it may not always be presented or perceived like that.  Voluntary workers enter into that on the basis of their commitment <Col N="1319" /> to that kind of work, and on the basis of a voluntary commitment by the organisations for which they work, to do that kind of work without, necessarily, looking for any outside guarantees of their safety.  It seems that if voluntary workers &mdash; and there are many of them, thank God &mdash; voluntarily enter that kind of danger to carry out such work, the forces of order in states committed to international obligations should be prepared to support their work.  It is generally agreed that we should be particularly concerned with safety and security for all the personnel involved in these operations and for aid workers in particular. Again that seems to imply that where we can do it and where it is in accordance with the United Nations Charter and obligations we should give the kind of assistance provided by UNITAF.  Under the terms of the UNOSOM mandate member states of the United Nations should participate as fully as possible. That is a proper and legitimate part of the mandate and the operations of our Defence Forces, given the obligations we have freely undertaken.</P>
    <P>There is no basis for opposition to sending Irish troops to carry out the kind of logistical operation proposed for our contingent of 80 people.  It is impossible to predict what will happen and how that operation may develop but, again, there will be agreement all round on the legitimacy of the operation.</P>
    <P>The Minister pointed out the military tasks involved in the mandate of UNOSOM II.  Section (f) states: &ldquo;to protect UN, Red Cross and NGO personnel and facilities and to take such forceful action as may be required against attacks on them&rdquo;.  That seems to have a double significance in the context of what we are discussing this evening.  In the first place it is that provision, the requirement to protect UN, Red Cross and NGO personnel and facilities, on which Irish troops will rely &mdash; and on which we are told they can rely &mdash; if it comes to the point where our logistical unit needs protection from aggression.  Section (f) will ensure that other troops there will <Col N="1320" /> have the obligation to protect Irish troops.  In the expectation that it will protect aid workers we should, if we are serious about our acceptance of the UN mandate, accept, at least in theory, that if we were called upon to do so we would participate in providing that guarantee for UN workers, NGO personnel and Red Cross personnel.  It seems we accept the whole mandate or none of it.  There is no logical or moral argument about that.  That is a protection which we would like to see for our troops and, therefore, one which we should provide if we are ever called upon to do so.  It is important for our troops to know that is our view because their involvement in the operations in which they participate are wholehearted.</P>
    <P>I understand the reservations of people who hesitate to send Irish troops into dangerous situations.  It is something to which we can all very readily relate.  I live only a mile or two from the largest military establishment in the country and I have a great deal of contact with personnel there and their families.  I know the tensions and the strains to which they are subject and I know the fears that they all have, understandably, in cases like this.  They are the same fears and tensions experienced day in, day out, by the families and relatives of voluntary workers.  To the extent that we can make a commitment addressing those fears and concerns of people in relation to members of their families, we should be prepared to do it.  Our people and resources to give that kind of commitment and undertaking are in our Permanent Defence Force, that is a part of their mission.</P>
    <P>I will not argue any of the points made last week in the debate on the Defence (Amendment) Bill.  It would be futile to start that discussion again.  I simply want to make the point that all the people involved, the members of our Defence Forces, voluntary workers and the families of all those people deserve our wholehearted commitment to any operation in which they are involved.  That view is traditionally and rightly held by the members of our Permanent Defence <Col N="1321" /> Force and we owe them our support in telling them that is also our view.  It would be illogical to say that we would give that commitment where Irish people concerned are voluntary workers with non-governmental organisations but that we do not want to give it when the people concerned are members of our Permanent Defence Force.</P>
    <P>It is very interesting that the Minister and leader of the Labour Party who so eloquently made the point, which comes out very clearly from his speech, that peace enforcement under Chapter VII of the UN Charter is, if anything, more clearly and more formally a function of the United Nations and of its members than peacekeeping as we have traditionally known it up to now.  A rereading of the Minister's script, which I assume was very carefully put together, will demonstrate the force of that argument. I am not in any way criticising peacekeeping operations, far from it. Essentially the Minister said peace enforcement is a proper part of Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter.  Peace enforcement is a function the United Nations can, and arguably must, carry out while peacekeeping is a flexible and desirable response which has emerged over a period and in the context of particular operations.  It is something which latitude in the UN Charter provides for. It is not in any sense as clearly, formally or overtly a part of the UN Charter as the peace enforcement operation we are discussing now.  The logic of the position set out this evening by the Minister and shared by Deputy Lenihan is that it would be proper and in keeping with our obligations as a member of the United Nations under the UN Charter to provide troops in a combat role.  There is no point in denying that.  That is the essential logic of the obligation we have undertaken under Chapter VII of the UN Charter.</P>
    <P>Some people will say we have not had a debate on this until now because we have a particular view of neutrality which I believe is nonsense.  As the Minister and Deputy Lenihan pointed out, the reason we have not had this debate is that this is the first occasion on which this <Col N="1322" /> operation by the United Nations has become possible or, as the French would say, &ldquo;<i>Envisageable.</i>&rdquo; The circumstances where the UN could engage in such an operation with the type of mandate that is now provided under UNOSOM II have not existed up to now.  I would invite the neutralists among us, including many on the Government benches to reflect on that and to come to the conclusion, which I came to a long time ago, that what we have very often presented as neutrality has been more an accident of circumstances than a policy.  I do not wish to start a controversy but to appreciate the full significance of what we are providing for.  It is certainly something that was never envisaged by our ratification of the UN Charter.  Deputy Lenihan's expression of that principle deserves to be extracted from the record, and put up in lights wherever debates take place about these issues.  That very well expressed principle is different from past doctrine.  If I were being mischievous, which I have no intention of being, I would say it is very different from a great many things I heard Deputy Lenihan say in the past but that is a matter for another day.</P>
    <P>It would be worthwhile reflecting on the provisions in the United Nations Charter for regional arrangements, particularly in the context of the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty, but that may also be work for another day.  The Minister's point regarding the nature and extent of the obligations we have undertaken under Chapter VII of the United Nations would bring greater reality to the debate on many of these issues than we have seen to date.  Consideration of the provisions of the UN Charter for regional arrangements would inform much of the vague and pointless debate which has taken place for some time on what the nations of the European Community might or might not do about what is happening in the former Yugoslavia.</P>
    <P>This is an essential operation and an important part of it is to provide relief for people in Somalia.  Somalia, the Horn of Africa, East Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa are in the grip of famine and will <Col N="1323" /> be for some time to come.  I share Deputy McDowell's concerns about the vagueness of political objectives in regard to Somalia.  If those political objectives were miraculously to produce peace tomorrow, it would take seven or eight years' peace for a commercial agricultural sector to emerge in Somalia.  This would also be the case in East Africa and the position is more difficult in Sub-Saharan Africa where desertification has become a major issue.  We know that vast areas of Africa will need a massive food aid programme for as far ahead as any of us can see.  Unfortunately, I do not see any action being taken in the European Community, the United States or the United Nations to address that problem systematically with a five or ten year plan.</P>
    <P>I would ask our Government to undertake a campaign to sensitize the institutions of the United Nations to that problem and to begin by approaching the institutions of the European Community. I will not enter into a debate on this but there is plenty of room for this given the present agricultural policies and problems of the European Community and of North America.</P>

      <P>I worked in Africa for three years as a development worker.  In view of the comments about the role of governmental and non-governmental agencies, I would make some personal observations on the motion before the House.  The motion must be seen in the context of the commitment by the Government earlier this year to increase overseas development aid substantially in line with a general commitment to move towards the UN target.  That represents the Government putting its money where its mouth is and the Minister must be congratulated on the <Col N="1324" /> approach he has taken in that area.  This year will see a substantial increase in our development programme, particularly in Africa.  That is widely welcomed by people who worked in the development area and by the agencies working in that field at present.</P>
      <P>Africa runs the risk of being forgotten with the current emphasis on the problems of Eastern Europe.  Great as the problems of Eastern Europe are, we risk abandoning the poorest parts of Africa to their fate, which seems to be a combination of famine, AIDS and war.  Post-colonial Africa has potential for many tribal conflicts.  In Europe many parties, particularly parties of the left, have spoken and written at some length about the peace dividend, the end of the cold war and what that might bring for Europe.  It is important to recognise that instead of the end of the Cold War bringing peace for Africa it may have left fullyarmed factions in certain areas.  How that arming came about and which particular sides in the conflicts of the Cold War were involved is something which all parties in this House have on various occasions condemned, and as a country our position on that has been very clear down the years.  However, Ireland should participate in a determined effort to restore peace in Somalia.  The objective of the Irish participation in UNOSOM is to assist in relief efforts and, ultimately, the restoration of civil society.  Anyone who believes that civil society can be restored overnight or in a couple of years from a situation of warring clan factions, as is the case in Somalia, is taking too sanguine a view of what has happened there.</P>
      <P>Ireland has established a reputation in Africa as an independent neutral country. Many Irish people who have worked in Africa, whether in the development area or as missionaries, believe that they develop a special rapport in different African countries because of our own history.  Our culture and our approach to other people has certainly added to the contribution which Ireland has made to Africa and which, in many ways, is out of proportion to its size.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been vast public support <Col N="1325" /> here for a positive humanitarian effort for Somalia.  It is dishonest to pretend that Irish and other aid workers in Somalia can assist the Somali people in rebuilding their society without adequate protection while the level of armed conflict between the clans there continues as at present.  Everybody in this House would wish to see the conflict in Somalia end and the disarming of the various factions take place voluntarily and peacefully. However, a positive effort at peace enforcement by the UN is required. Without this it will be difficult for aid workers to assist the Somali people in their efforts to rebuild their society.</P>
    <P>The proposal that the Irish contingent going to Somalia should serve and assist Zimbabwean troops is interesting.  It is very significant that a substantial number of African countries will be sending troops.  For instance, Zimbabwe's emergence from a history of bitter racial conflict is a model for the rest of Africa.  I recall at one time, walking down a street in Harare and seeing a man whom I vaguely recognised.  I wondered who he was and thought that it was perhaps someone I knew.  Some time later it occurred to me that it was Ian Smith walking down the main street of Harare totally unnoticed. I felt that was a kind of tribute to what had taken place in that country for decades previously and it is important that it is the Zimbabwean troops whom the Irish contingent will initially be deployed to assist.</P>
    <P>There are no great strategic interests in this part of Africa.  The post-Cold War has changed forever in ways which some in this House may regret and in other ways which are infinitely for the better. The country which is probably at greatest risk from famine, war and AIDS, which is linked to the first two, is Africa.  We have a responsibility to the people of Africa not just to assist in a process of development, which is seen as easy and a logical development from one year to another.  In fact, Africa is many countries. It is an incredibly complex series of societies.  Somalia alone has a very interesting history.  It is worth noting that both the Germans and the British, particularly <Col N="1326" /> during their colonial period, admired the Somalis for their military bearing and what was seen by the British as their war-like stance.</P>
    <P>The Irish contingent to Somalia will face a certain degree of risk.  Once an army is in a situation where there is civil conflict and where there is the level of armaments which exist in Somalia, we are all aware that it is not risk-free.  However, the situation is not risk-free for Irish aid workers either.  Men with guns in any country are terrifying and in parts of Africa they are particularly terrifying because there is no clear idea of whose control they are under.</P>
    <P>In looking to a strategy of peace enforcement I believe we are making a serious contribution rather than simply paying lip service to the concept of restoring civil order in Somali society.  Unfortunately, the re-creation of a civil society in Somalia is probably some considerable years away.  The UNOSOM force has a clear mandate; it is a force which will be accountable and there will be a clear governance of it which is important. Retaining the confidence of the Somali people is important also to the future of the force.  Everyone involved in aid and development work deeply regret what happened to the Pakistani and Italian troops.  However, we cannot allow war and famine to continue to rage in Somalia and to say that we will contribute humanitarian aid but will not be party to a serious effort to ensure that that humanitarian aid gets through to the Somali people. In the first instance and for the coming period of time we are talking simply about relief work.  It will be some time before we can help to rebuild Somali agriculture, industry and civil society. The proposal put forward by the Government is very much in the tradition of the determination of people here to make a humanitarian contribution to the improvement of developing countries and, in this case, to the ending of the conflict in Somalia.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> When the tragedy that is now Somalia was first brought to our attention it was, <Col N="1327" /> as is usual in these cases, the non-governmental organisations who first alerted us to the issue.  It is interesting that from the very beginning they stressed the need for a wide-ranging response to the question of Somalia, in addition to the immediate need fo supplying humanitarian aid.</P>
      <P>This stress on the need for a wider intervention was highlighted to us and to the world by President Robinson's visit to Somalia.  This engaged us in support for the humanitarian efforts which were taking place at the time.  It is interesting that following the President's visit to Somalia she then went to the United Nations to report on the wider needs in the area of the Secretary-General. Anyone who is aware of development issues and the type of disasters and emergencies that arise periodically in developing countries knows that these emergencies are only symptoms of much deeper problems.  In the case of Somalia we have seen a breakdown of political and administrative structures, a breakdown in Government and in commercial and economic activity due to the country's post-colonial position and the fact that for at least two decades it served merely as a pawn in the super-power games between the former Soviet Union and the United States.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that the United Nations mission in Somalia will address this problem in a wide-ranging and fundamental way.  It is different from many of the firebrigade efforts of the past.  In the past two years there were a series of UN interventions in Somalia.  Those interventions were demanded by non-Governmental agencies and by public opinion in countries such as Ireland.  The UNOSOM II mission is the result of those demands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The actions of the United Nations in Somalia cover four broad areas.  First, the provision and organisation of humanitarian aid, the most basic need. What struck me when studying UNOSOM reports to United Nations headquarters in New York was the effort towards political development and humanitarian aid.  I was impressed by reports of work by political affairs teams <Col N="1328" /> who consult elders, local leaders, women's groups, religious groups and traditional leaders in an effort to build a form of district council administration. This effort to re-establish some form of political activity and local administration should be supported.  We tend to concentrate on the humanitarian aid and military aspects, but if there is to be a lasting solution local activity is very important.</P>
    <P>Efforts are being made to re-establish a climate for economic and commercial activity and they will be supported by military means if necessary.  Those who question the need for such military support should ask themselves whether Irish aid workers with NGOs or the United Nations should be provided with protection by the United Nations to allow them help the local people.</P>
    <P>Like other Members, I was concerned about the change in Ireland's role from the traditional one of peace-keeping to what is termed peace enforcement. However, I am satisfied that this change enables us to play a full part in the United Nation's effort and furthers the aims for which the United Nations was established. We had an opportunity last week in the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs to put our concerns to the Tánaiste and I was satisfied with his response then and when speaking on this motion tonight.  I am proud of the record of the Irish overseas development assistance programme in developing countries, particularly in Africa.  I was concerned that our neutrality and our no-strings-attached approach should be preserved in our operations in the United Nations and I am satisfied that will be done.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> I was also concerned about our participation in operations under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, particularly the operation in Kuwait which was led by a superpower in defence of what can only be termed imperialist interests. However, there is a fundamental difference <Col N="1329" /> between that type of operation and UNOSOM II which is being established directly by the Security Council of the United Nations.  I am satisfied we should participate in this mission.</P>
      <P>UNOSOM is not led by a superpower. It will consist of 30,000 troops and personnel and it is important to note that these people will be drawn in the main from developing countries, African countries and countries such as Sweden which has a proud tradition of neutrality.  Bangladesh will make a substantial contribution as will Egypt, India, Nigeria, Zimbabwe and Pakistan.  Our small contribution is needed.  If we are not prepared to participate we cannot look for protection of our people in Somalia.  The operation will involve an international force.  Our troops will not be involved in combat duty but will work in support of a Zimbabwean unit in an area protected by French forces.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that this motion is in accordance with the terms outlined by the Minister under the Defence (Amendment) Act.  Three principles were outlined: there would be no change in our fundamental position in that we would participate only in operations established by the Security Council or the General Assembly of the United Nations; Dáil approval for the despatch of contingents under the United Nations would continue to be sought &mdash; this worthwhile debate shows the necessity for such approval &mdash; and the Government would assess each request individually and carefully &mdash; that has been done.  We have an obligation to participate in this operation and I commend the motion to the House.</P>

      <P>Nobody should underestimate the importance of Irish involvement in the peace-keeping process around the world.  At present almost 1,000 Irish soldiers are stationed in other countries.  This is a significant number by <Col N="1330" /> any yardstick and is indicative of the level of commitment of our Army to the vital task of peacekeeping in the various troubled spots around the world.  We have a long peacekeeping tradition.  The request for our troops to go to Somalia is the latest extension of this positive tradition.</P>
      <P>Somalia is torn by civil strife and the people there suffer from starvation.  The country suffers as a result of disasters, both natural and manmade.  In short, it is a country crying out for help from other countries around the world.  We cannot ignore this plea and it is not in the nature of the Irish people to do so.  We have not shirked our responsibilities in the past and we will not do so now.  Somalia needs our help and morally we cannot refuse.</P>
      <P>Other speakers dealt with this issue from a broad political angle but I would like to deal with it from a personal viewpoint. Relatives of mine have been involved in peacekeeping forces in the past in Lebanon and Cyprus and I have personal knowledge of the commitment and courage this task entails.  Many of the soldiers stationed in Collins Barracks in my constituency will participate in this important mission to Somalia and have participated in missions since we first became involved in peacekeeping operations more than 30 years ago.  I wish to pay tribute to these men of whom we are proud for their valuable contribution to world peace.  There can be no more important task.  Peacekeeping is an onerous task and is not one to be taken lightly. Ireland, as a full member of the United Nations, has always taken seriously its responsibilities in this regard.  Somalia, and its suffering people, can expect no less of us at this critical time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish people have responded humanely and generously to Somalia's cry for help and actively support our participation in UNOSOM II.  Public opinion would be critical of a refusal to participate in this mission.  We have seen the horror, and the heart of the nation has been moved by the cries for help from Somalia.  From Bosnia, Somalia, Sudan and other places there have been calls for assistance from nations such as ours, and <Col N="1331" /> we have responded to the calls.  In Somalia along with 31 other countries we will provide troops and assistance.  Irish voluntary workers have put their lives at risk and have represented us proudly in Somalia in organisations like Concern. They have played a major contribution on our behalf.  Our military contribution although small in numbers is a major contribution having regard to the size of our Army and our nation and Irish troops are respected throughout the world, in the Congo, in Cyprus, in the Lebanon and wherever they have played a part in peacekeeping.  We can all remember the tragedy in the Congo.  Some people gave their lives there in the cause of peace, but we were never sorry for sending the troops.  Tonight we are ensuring that our troops will play their part once again on our behalf and on behalf of the UN.</P>
    <P>It is not always earthquakes and natural disasters which cause world tragedies, but greed.  We see the misery and the legacy of death and destruction which has been brought about in Somalia by greed. Out of a nation of four million people almost two million are in danger of death or serious illness.  Certainly people do not have a normal life.  We have an important role to play.  Following on the visit of our President, Mrs. Mary Robinson and our Minister, Deputy Andrews, our troops will be well received in Somalia.</P>
    <P>I commend this motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland has a long and noble history as a world peacekeeper. Irish men and women both through the armed forces and through the invaluable work of voluntary organisations, have contributed hugely to peacekeeping around the world.  This task continues today and there is hardly a trouble spot on the face of the earth in which the Irish are not actively working for peace.  I take this opportunity to offer a vote of thanks to all these men and women for their dedication and commitment to the cause of peace.  Theirs is a dangerous task which brings no great reward other than that of furthering the <Col N="1332" /> cause of peace.  Long may their work continue.</P>
      <P>The Irish have never shirked from a peacekeeping challenge.  For that reason the suffering of Somalia cannot be ignored.  Here the agony of civil strife is compounded by the misery of hunger and pain.  Already members of our voluntary organisations are active there carrying out invaluable work in brutal and inhospitable conditions.  There is an obvious need to supplement this with the participation of our soldiers in the UN forces there.  I have no doubt that our soldiers will perform this task with the same excellence with which they have carried out this work in other countries.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with Deputy De Rossa's amendment.  Ireland is a full member of the United Nations and has always fulfilled its obligations in a most responsible manner.  We can not act differently now when faced with such a crisis.  I have no doubt whatsoever that our soldiers feel the same way about fulfilling these important obligations.</P>
      <P>I wish our soldiers well in the challenges that face them in Somalia.  I also hope for the speediest possible solution to the problem of Somalia.  It is not in anybody's interest, particularly the long suffering people of Somalia, for this dreadful situation to persist.</P>
      <P>Somalia should not only be seen in a peacekeeping context but also in the broader overseas context.  There is much more to Somalia than securing peace, although this is a vital objective in itself. True peace is inextricably linked to the process of development.  I am happy to see that the Government in the Programme for Government is committed to increasing the level of Ireland's overseas aid.  This is significant.  Somalia's problems go very deep.  They can only be allayed by a serious process of development. Ireland must play its role in this process to the full and that also means increased levels of aid.  I have no doubt that the Government will build on this commitment in the most positive way possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From my constituency in Cork East, members of the First Motor Squadron, <Col N="1333" /> Fermoy, from the Fitzgerald camp who have served with honour and distinction over the years, will participate in the peacekeeping.  We are seen to be a compassionate and caring people and wherever Irish troops go there is always a welcome and a request for their return.</P>
    <P>Somalia, a poor state in Africa is unique in many ways.  Many Irish aid workers have gone there over the last couple of years to give advice and assistance. It is recognised that we have the best aid workers in the western world and we are always welcomed.  I was proud to see our President, Mrs. Mary Robinson and the Minister for Defence, Deputy Andrews, visit Somalia.  They laid the foundation for the participation of our peacekeeping soldiers who are anxious to gain recognition for the tremendous role they have played in the past.  I have no doubt that they will once more serve in Somalia with honour and distinction. I fully support the motion.</P>

      <P>I welcome the contributions from all Deputies.  It is a very important precedent in this House and a longstanding tradition that we discuss the implications of sending missions abroad. In that respect, I welcome the opportunity to have this debate tonight.</P>
      <P>Deputy Connor raised the question of the volunteer nature of our troops on UN operations abroad.  In our long and distinguished tradition of participating in UN operations, the Minister for Defence has never encountered difficulties in finding volunteers for UN missions and in practice, overseas missions are heavily oversubscribed by volunteers.  The personnel of the transport company will be volunteers and in fact their replacement in due course will also be volunteers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Connor also pointed to the vital role performed by the non-Governmental organisations in Somalia.  I agree with this point.  When much of the international community ignored the conflict and the famine the non-Governmental organisations remained active.  Their call was a call to conscience in Somalia.  The fact that today food is more readily available <Col N="1334" /> in Somalia is due in great measure to the activities of the non-Governmental organisations.</P>
    <P>It is vitally important for that reason to have good relations between the non-governmental organisations and UNOSOM, which is the case in most areas.  I should add that our troops have an unparalleled record in fostering and maintaining good relations with all sides in United Nations operations: the local population, other contingents and aid and other humanitarian workers.  I am confident that this will continue, given the reputation of our troops and the manner in which they handle themselves on these missions.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell pointed out that there is a need to uphold the authority of the United Nations and this point is well taken.  The amendment to the Defence Acts permits the Dáil to approve the despatch of a contingent to serve in a Chapter VII operation but the change does not restrict Ireland's continuing ability to participate in traditional peace-keeping operations in which I strongly believe we will continue to participate with distinction.  I have no doubt that the Army's standing internationally and at home will be enhanced by its role in Somalia.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell also mentioned that the United Nations had encountered difficulties in Somalia in recent weeks.  In my opening statement I outlined my concern about recent events in Mogadishu. Shortly after the killings I called for the urgent restoration of calm and order and our concerns were raised at the United Nations headquarters in New York.  I expect the Secretary General's report to the Security Council to be available shortly and it is my intention to make sure it is available to every Member of this House through the Dáil Library.</P>
    <P>I read Deputy De Rossa's proposed amendment with interest but I do not believe it is necessary or desirable.  The purpose of the change to the Defence Act which has been debated extensively in this House and in the Seanad is to enable Ireland to take part in the United Nations operation established under <Col N="1335" /> Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. This is the reason the provision in the original Act, which restricted participation to operations of a police character, has been removed.  Without that necessary amending legislation a contingent of the Defence Forces could not participate in any capacity in UNOSOM II.  I have made it clear to the House that our troops will participate in the Somali operation in a non-combatant role and that their duties will be logistical. That position is understood by and agreed with the United Nations.  I do not, therefore, see a need for the provision suggested by the Deputy which reverts to language which has been excised from the Defence Act.</P>
    <P>The safety and well-being of Irish aid workers in Somalia is a matter of vital concern to the Government.  When the force was being established we put it to the United Nations that the mandate should provide for the protection of aid workers and this has been specifically included.  One of the principal purposes of our involvement in UNOSOM is to help create a secure environment in which humanitarian aid can be delivered and in which aid workers can operate in safety but it is a matter for UNOSOM to determine how best and with which elements of the force the protection of aid workers can be ensured.</P>
    <P>In so far as the proposals for a Dáil review are concerned, the Government has already accepted an Opposition amendment which has been included in the new legislation requiring the Minister for Defence to report to the Dáil each year on Ireland's participation in United Nations operations.  This will provide an opportunity for a full annual review of our involvement in the Somali mission and of our wider role in the United Nations.  That is of importance to this House and the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa asked what the legal basis is for the Somali operation.  This is in Chapter VII of the Charter and in Resolution 814 of the Security Council. Under Article 39 the Security Council is specifically empowered to arrive at a <Col N="1336" /> determination on the existence of any threat to the peace, a breach of the peace or act of aggression and it is on the basis of this determination that the Council is empowered to take decisions under Chapter VII.  In the case of Somalia the Council in Resolution 814 determined that the situation in Somalia threatened peace and security in that region.  This determination was arrived at after an extensive debate in the Council and a detailed report from the Secretary General.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy De Rossa that the end of the Cold War did not bring an end to conflict.  In fact one of the great international challenges facing us today is how we should deal with the problems which did not surface during the Cold War.  These include old conflicts, territorial claims, ethnic differences and minorities.  These are on the agenda on a daily basis and we have to find responses to them.  UNOSOM is an example of the efforts of the United Nations to find ways to deal with these conflicts.  Cambodia is another example.</P>
    <P>The success of these operations depends on the resources made available to the United Nations.  In this regard pressure is being put on all governments at present.  We are placing a burden on the United Nations which it never carried before in relation to its operations and it is the responsibility of all governments to honour their obligations to the United Nations.  If we want to resolve these complex conflicts and play our part, this will test our response.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell mentioned the challenge to the world order.  In the past we played a constructive role in the United Nations and the changes in recent years require the Government to play a new role.  That is the reason the Defence Act was changed last week under which our 80 strong transport division will participate in UNOSOM II.</P>
    <P>I commend the motion to the House. Not only is it in our interests, it is in the interests of the United Nations.  It faces a difficult task which will not lessen to any degree given the complexities of the problems in the former Yugoslavia, Somalia, <Col N="1337" /> Cambodia, other African nations and the emerging democracies.  This country has a proud tradition since we joined the United Nations and we are honouring that tradition by passing this resolution in the House this evening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Cork has been invaded by travelling traders during the past few weeks.  The traders who have invaded the technology park on Model Farm Road have already had an injunction served against them for illegally parking in the technology park in Wilton. Another group of traders has taken over the Ballinure GAA club pitch at the Mahon in Blackrock in Cork.  This means that the camogie and youth teams from that club cannot play on the pitch.  An adjunct to that group have sighted themselves <Col N="1338" /> on a council site at the entrance to Ballincollig.  In gaining admittance to that site they broke a padlocked gate and ignored all the barriers to entry.  I went to visit the site last night and I noticed that the cars and the vans being used by these traders had 1992 and 1993 registrations. The traders seem to be well heeled.  Their caravans were modern models with British registration numbers and appeared to be expensive.</P>
      <P>The dilemma facing ordinary people is that if they invade private property they are prosecuted but when traders invade there are no such prosecutions as they seem to be able to ignore the rights of ownership, both private and public.  They can be shifted only by means of an injunction, which is an extremely expensive process.  It is sad to say that one of the families who has entered on to the council site in Ballincollig has been the subject of an injunction on three previous occasions and has thus occasioned a cost to the proprietor of private property, to a local authority and the IDA of £10,000.  The cost in this instance has to be borne by private companies, by the IDA or by the local authority.  Oddly enough those who have transgressed have not been asked to bear a proportion of the costs of these injunctions.  Is it any wonder then that they could sneer at me and others who visited the site last evening.  In my view they think they are beyond the law.</P>
      <P>Is it not time to change the law to meet the emerging situation?  Does the Minister appreciate the bad example of operating safely outside the law that has been given to the children of these families? Does he appreciate the anguish that is being caused to decent and upright citizens who wring their hands and ask is there one law for the taxpaying private individual and another for those for whom the law does not seem to cater and who do not mind flouting it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a genuine sympathy for itinerant families who genuinely are looking for a house or halting site to live in permanently. However, the vast majority of the people who are trespassing on private or public property are only on a jaunt for the summer and this happens every <Col N="1339" /> summer.  The law needs to be changed.  I have no sympathy for those who have houses &mdash; I believe many of them have &mdash; and give them up during the summer period to take to the roads in order to trade.  They ignore the rights of others, indeed they live off the backs of innocent victims who have paid a hefty price for their factory premises or depots.</P>
    <P>The law needs to be amended and I urge the Minister in the strongest possible terms to examine this law with a view to putting regulations in place to ensure that the law of the land is obeyed by everybody.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the concern that the people of Cork have expresed about this matter.  Cork Corporation has housed in excess of 100 traveller families and therefore it is very disappointing to see that well-heeled travellers can come into an area and invade the IDA estate without concern about the damage they are doing.</P>
      <P>This is not just a matter for the Department of Justice.  The Departments of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the Environment also have an important role to play.  I appeal to the Ministers in the three Departments to come together to deal with this problem once and for all. All local authorities should play their part.  As Deputy Batt O'Keeffe said most of these traders have their own homes but they like to take to the road for the summer and they do not give a tuppeny damn whom they upset as long as they get their own way.  It certainly appears to law-abiding citizens that they can do what they like and get away with it.  I hope the Minister will have something positive to say about this problem.</P>

      <P>I take this opportunity to outline to the Dáil the responsibility of both the Garda Síochána and the Department of Justice in relation to encampments set up by travelling traders.  We fully appreciate the difficulties faced by all those who are confronted with this unfortunate problem. <Col N="1340" /> However, the resolution of the issue is usually a civil matter rather than one of law enforcement and as such there are strict limits to what the Garda can do. Breaches of the law such as illegal parking of caravans or mobile homes which come to their notice are dealt with by the Garda Síochána as appropriate.  It is a matter for the Garda to enforce the law in such cases in the same way as they do when other breaches of the parking or the traffic law are detected.</P>
      <P>In order for a parking offence to be committed, the person or persons concerned must have parked their vehicles on a public roadway.  It is important to point out that no breach of the parking regulations occurs unless the vehicle in question is parked on a public roadway. Persons who park vehicles on property which is owned either privately or by a public body such as a local authority are not committing any offence under the parking laws and are therefore immune to the criminal law.  Removing caravans and travellers from private property is a civil matter and as such it is not open to the Garda to intervene.  In such circumstances it is a matter for the owner of the property to seek a court injunction to have the trespassers removed.  If requested, the Garda will, of course, attend the scene to prevent breaches of the peace.</P>
      <P>Let me assure my colleagues, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe and Deputy Dan Wallace, that I will bear in mind Deputy O'Keeffe's suggested changes in the law and I will take note of Deputy Dan Wallace's suggestion of co-ordinated action by the three relevant Government Departments.  I will communicate with the Deputies privately on the matter.</P>

The setting of a fixed interest rate is also important in that families on low incomes can budget for their repayments over a 20 year period.  However, I predict there will be major disappointment at the level of discount being allowed compared with that under the 1988 tenant purchase scheme.  Many of the people who contacted me to press for the introduction of this scheme believed that its provisions would be similar to those in the 1988 scheme arising out of the promises made in the course of the general election. People expected a similar scheme and will be gravely disappointed.  Some people will not be able to participate in the scheme but those who will may have to borrow from local authorities.  There was no reference in the Minister's announcement to the fact that such families or buyers will be able to avail of first time buyers' housing grants which, I understand, were made available to participants of previous schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I predict that the Minister's statement that local authorities will be given a capital injection following the introduction of this scheme will not be realised.  The Minister said the scheme would boost the provision of new dwellings and the improvement of existing ones.  However, it must be remebered that local authorities will no longer receive rents on such dwellings.  Most of these dwellings <Col N="1342" /> will be bought out through the use of local authority housing loans.  Taking into account the costs of the local authority, the net income from these sales will be less than half the value of such dwellings, that is, if the local authorities do not have to advance loans.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to the homes of single parents and so on is not clear.  The Minister said that homes for the elderly would not come under the provisions of this scheme but some of them are being used by single parent and young families who, perhaps, should be allowed participate in the scheme.</P>
    <P>If there is money available for house repairs I would make a special plea for one house in Monaghan, bought under a tenant purchase scheme as long ago as 2 July 1975, by a couple who were bombed out of their home in Fermanagh Street &mdash; which may be relevant to some of the television reports this evening &mdash; and promised at that time that cracks in the walls would be repaired.  Despite much effort by this widow &mdash; her husband died in an accident &mdash; nothing has been done. She borrowed money from the local credit union to instal central heating and has had windows and doors fitted.  If there is one penny available under this scheme for repairs in Monaghan this house must be given priority.  The Minister of State should use his influence to ensure that work is carried out.</P>
    <P>While welcoming the scheme and hoping its provision will appeal to many applicants I doubt that the funds the Minister suggests will be available for new houses and repairs of others will be forthcoming.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Crawford for raising this issue and giving me an opportunity to outline, in the short time available to me, some of the details of this latest local authority tenant purchase scheme.  Full details were announced today.  They are available in the Dáil Library and were sent to Members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This afternoon I announced the introduction of a new tenant purchase scheme <Col N="1343" /> for the sale of local authority dwellings to tenants.  Tenants to local authority houses and flats, who have held a tenancy for at least one year, may now apply to purchase the dwellings in which they live. The principal terms of the scheme are the purchase price of the dwelling will be its market value in its present state of repair as determined by the local authority; a discount of 3 per cent will be deducted from the market value of the house for each year of tenancy subject to a minimum discount of £3,000 &mdash; equivalent to the new house grant &mdash; and a maximum of 30 per cent; houses and flats will be sold under the scheme excepting dwellings provided for and occupied by elderly persons and demountable/mobile dwellings &mdash; a local authority may, at its discretion, also exclude dwellings because of their structural condition or if it has proposals to carry out remedial works to them.  Houses designed or specifically adopted for persons with disablements are also included; also houses occupied by single parents &mdash; though originally designed for old people &mdash; will also fall within the provisions of this scheme. Under the scheme the purchase price will be payable at the point of sale; stamp duty is not payable on the sale of the dwelling; legal and transaction costs associated with the sale of the dwelling to the tenant will be borne by the local authority; the costs associated with the mortgage loan will be borne by the purchaser; and the scheme will be ongoing with no fixed closing date.</P>
    <P>The scheme differs from previous schemes in two major respects.  First, the current scheme is a permanent one which does not have a closing date which was a normal feature of previous schemes.  It will operate until a new or revised scheme is notified to authorities.  Therefore, tenants who cannot afford to purchase at present will be able to apply to do so in their own time, and as their circumstances allow, without being constrained by any artificial cut-off point.</P>
    <P>Second, for local authorities the immediate capital injection received by full payment of the purchase price at the <Col N="1344" /> point of sale will boost the provision of new dwellings and the improvement of existing ones.</P>
    <P>My Department has held discussions with the commercial lending agencies who have agreed in principle to provide mortgage finance for tenant purchasers. If a purchaser does not get a loan from a building society or bank he or she has the option of applying to the local authority for a loan.</P>
    <P>In addition to the generous discounts available, the overall cost to the purchaser is further reduced in a number of ways.  The exemption from stamp duty represents a significant saving while the legal and other costs of the sale of a dwelling will be borne by the authority. Purchasers may also qualify for the usual income tax relief on mortgage interest. The costs associated with the mortgage will be borne by the purchaser but where possible, will be rolled-up into the loan.</P>
    <P>In this new scheme, our aim is to achieve a balance between the desire of tenants for home ownership and the ever present need for accommodation of applicants on local authority waiting lists. The sale of a large number of dwellings at greatly discounted prices could not be justified at a time when the size of the local authority waiting lists requires an expanded housing construction programme.</P>
    <P>The new tenant purchase scheme is further evidence of the Government's commitment to the encouragement of home ownership which is a key factor in the stabilisation of housing estates and in promoting a better quality of life for the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>I hope that many tenants will purchase their dwellings under this attractive new scheme.  I am confident that the scheme launched today will be successful in achieving its objectives and will herald a new phase of life for the tenants and their families who avail of it.</P>
    <P>My Department is issuing explanatory brochures on the new scheme to all housing authorities.  Tenants wishing to apply to purchase can obtain all the necessary details from their housing authority.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1345" /> Deputy Crawford will find there will be widespread acceptance of and welcome for the scheme.  If the Deputy contacts me about the case to which he referred, I will see what I can do to assist that person.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise with the Government the need to include in the terms of reference of the telephone users advisory group a provision to enable it to investigate and report on the discrimination that exists in that Dublin city, county and adjacent areas all are being classified as one local telephone call area while Cork city and county are not similarly classified.</P>
      <P>There is a great sense of grievance in many parts of County Cork because the city and county are not classified as one local telephone call area.  As many Members know, the local code for Cork city is 021, covering not just the city but towns nearby such as Kinsale, Midleton, Fermoy, Mitchelstown and Mallow. Outside those towns, trunk calls, at a greater cost, are necessary if one is calling Cork city.</P>
      <P>The real sense of grievance arises because Dublin is treated differently.  In the local Dublin 01 call area there is Dublin city, county and, indeed, parts of counties Louth, Meath, Kildare and Wicklow.  The view in Cork is that what applies to Dublin should apply to Cork. The city of Cork is the focal point for business and commerce for the people of the city and county.  It is altogether unfair that those living in large parts of the county are not able to make contact on a local call charge basis if they want to do business in Cork city.  I raised this issue with Telecom Éireann but I got no great saisfaction.  The first response I received was:</P>
      <P>Your comments in relation to discrimination of Cork city and county <i>vis-à-vis</i> Dublin city and county have been noted.  However, I feel it is not a true comparison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1346" /> I was not satisfied with the reply and I pressed the issue further.  I received a further response from Telecom Éireann which states:</P>
    <P>The fact that the Dublin area is regarded as one local call area is due solely to the configuration of the telephone network which has fewer and larger exchange areas in Cork.</P>
    <P>I did not regard this explanation as satisfactory. In fact these replies amount to the type of gobbledygook one can expect from a monopoly.  I do not expect those responses.  I have good relations in most instances with Telecom Éireann but it is a monopoly.  A monopoly has a special duty to exercise its functions fairly and without discrimination.  There is an even greater onus on a Government to ensure that a State monopoly does that.  That is why I believe the Minister should intervene in this situation and he has the power and the authority to do so.  What is needed is the inclination and the political will for the Minister to intervene in what is a blatant case of discrimination.</P>
    <P>I am raising this matter in the context of the establishment of the Telephone Users Advisory Group for two reasons. First, I tried to raise it previously and I found, with the usual wall of protection which Ministers build around themselves nowadays, that the question was rejected as having nothing to do with the Minister, that it was a matter for Telecom Éireann. Raising the question of the terms of reference of the Telephone Users Advisory Group is a device that enables me to get the matter on to the floor of the Dáil. Second, there is the question of the establishment of this group.  It is an appropriate time to raise the question of the terms of reference of that group.  If the Minister is not prepared to intervene directly he is in a position to include, as one of the terms of reference of the Telephone Users Advisory Group, a provision to enable it to investigate and report on the discrimination which I have outlined and, indeed, any other instances of discrimination which telephone users in different parts of the country feel <Col N="1347" /> should be investigated.  It is appropriate and timely to raise the matter here now.</P>
    <P>Finally, one way or the other people of Cork county have had enough.  We have been paying over the odds for telephone calls for far too long and we now demand the same treatment, in relation in telephone charges, as is available in Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to our predecessor's response to Dáil Question No. 189, Volume 408, column Nos. 1678-1679 of the Official Report of 21 May 1991, in which he outlined the fact, that Telecom Éireann had exercised the power given to it, under section 90 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, to make a scheme covering, <i>inter alia,</i> the classification of telephone exchanges into groups and to determine in relation to each group what telephone groups, if any, are to be regarded as adjacent to it and the point, which is to be used for measuring distances for the purpose of charging for local telephone calls.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that the responsibility for this function has been assigned to Telecom Éireann by statute, neither myself nor the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Cowen, have any function in this matter.</P>
      <P>I would also refer the Deputy to the Minister's speech on the telephone tariff rebalancing issue on Tuesday 18 May, 1993, when he advised the House of the contents of the Government decision, relating to the Telephone Users Advisory Group as follows:</P>
      <P>The Government has decided to establish a Telephone Users Advisory Group to provide independent monitoring of the operation of the new tariff, its effect on different categories of customers and report to me on its deliberations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be clear that the intention of the Government was to confine the advisory group to issues arising from the telephone <Col N="1348" /> tariff rebalancing.  The proposal put forward by Deputy O'Keeffe does not arise from rebalancing and would therefore be inappropriate for the group to consider.</P>
    <P>I am sure it Deputy O'Keeffe reflects on the totality of his contribution he will concur with the very positive decision taken by the Minister on the whole rebalancing situation.  I trust this information will be of assistance to him in appraising the honoured telephone consumers of the city and county of Cork of the great modern service available to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>For the record I would like the Minister to indicate our Government's involvement in the consultation process now being offered by British Nuclear Fuels Limited while the commissioning of the THORP Plant at Sellafield has been postponed.  As is now known, the Secretary of State for the Department of the Environment, Mr. John Gummer, MP, announced in the British House of Parliament on 28 June that the British Government would hold a further round of public consultation on the thermal oxide reprocessing plant &mdash; THORP as we refer to it &mdash; at the Sellafield site in Cumbria.  This statement was based on the inspectorate's report which Mr. Gummer had received on 21 May. Basically, it would appear that the large number of submissions received by the British authorities against the siting and commissioning of THORP at the Sellafield site in Cumbria means that further consultation time is necessary.  I would like to know how our Government would be involved and what case they will bring forward to represent the Irish viewpoint at that consultation process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>THORP was originally proposed in the seventies when fast breeder reactors looked like becoming a commercial reality.  As of now there is no justification for recovering plutonium and uranium from nuclear waste.  Even the Science <Col N="1349" /> Policy Research Unit of Sussex University decided that the economic advantages lay in storing spent fuel rather than providing additional reprocessing capacity at THORP.  Radioactive Waste Management Committee, an independent UK body, has stated that reprocessing actually complicates nuclear waste management by increasing the type and volume of waste left to be dealt with rather than simplifying the problem.  It follows that there is no economic justification for the commissioning of THORP now or at any stage in the future. There is no economic reason as far as the UK authorities and the UK public are concerned and there is certainly no justification for increasing the risk to the health and safety of the Irish public.</P>
    <P>I wish to put on the record again my concerns about the number of nuclear plants which the British authorities have decided to locate on their least populated west coast in peripheral areas.  If there was no risk to the health and safety of the British public why are these plants, including the new proposed THORP plant, not sited in downtown London or downtown Birmingham?  The Minister and I know that they are not sited in densely populated areas because of the risk factor associated with the location of nuclear plants.  Why then should they be located on the least populated west coast of the UK directly down wind, some, such as Sellafield, as near as 60 miles from the most populated east coast of our country?  Why should the UK authorities put the Irish public at increased risk to their health and safety on the basis of minimising risk to the British public?  At least the British public are getting some economic benefit from the nuclear programme in that nuclear-generated energy contributes to their electricity grid.  There is no benefit to the Irish public and no justification for the present risk to our health and safety let alone increasing that risk by the commissioning of the proposed THORP plant.</P>
    <P>There are many other reasons why this proposal is totally unacceptable.  We cannot accept increased atmospheric emissions nor increased marine discharges <Col N="1350" /> from THORP.  The long term storage of highly toxic and radioactive substances is unacceptable.  The increased shipping activity of nuclear waste in the Irish Sea is also totally unacceptable to our country and I hope the Minister of State, on behalf of the Government, will confirm this.  We need a full public inquiry, promised during this consultation process, a public inquiry which I hope will point out that there is no economic justification for proceeding with THORP in the UK and no justification for the increased risk to the health and safety of the Irish public by so proceeding.</P>
    <P>Planned increases in radioactive discharges from THORP would be in direct contradiction of the Paris convention's stated objective to eliminate marine pollution, and the Environment Ministers of all PARCOM countries who instructed the commission to &ldquo;adopt specific objectives and timetables for the programmes and measures for the prevention and elimination of pollution by substances, including radioactive substances&rdquo;.  Was the Government's proposal to the June PARCOM meeting in Berlin accepted? That was a worthwhile proposal and I tabled a parliamentary question on that matter earlier.  It proposed that radioactive discharges into the marine environment should not exceed the average level of that reached in the past three years as a first step towards the elimination of radioactive nuclear discharges into our marine environment generally. Was that proposal accepted at the Berlin meeting of the Paris Convention?</P>
    <P>Concerned local authorities on the east coast, among whom was Wexford County Council, made a joint submission to British Nuclear Fuels Limited and the British authorities in relation to the proposed construction of THORP.  Can Wexford County Council be included as part of the consultation process over the next three months or so?  I request that it be included in any consultations that take place.  As we have the expertise in Wexford since the seventies &mdash; when the proposed nuclear power plant was mooted for Carnsore &mdash; we would like to <Col N="1351" /> be part of the consultation process to support the Government's view of no justification for the commissioning of THORP either from a UK point of view or from the point of view of the increased risk to the health and safety of our people.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister confirm that a public inquiry is the least he will accept from British Nuclear Fuels Limited and the Department of the Environment in the UK?  Will he ask them to give a commitment not to commission THORP, even though they may have to accept the £2.8 billion white elephant as a big mistake given the major change in the nuclear industry since it was originally mooted in the seventies?  It is no use to them in economic terms and it is a major risk to the health and safety of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, will the Minister state how we will take part in the proposed consultation process and will he indicate also that we will insist on the postponing indefinitely, if not abandoning of the prospect of commissioning THORP?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will be aware that Minister Cowen sent a detailed and wide-ranging submission to the UK Minister for the Environment and the UK inspectorate of pollution, regarding British Nuclear Fuels Limited's proposed THORP extension at Sellafield.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This submission conveyed, in the strongest possible terms, the Government's total opposition to the continued operation of all nuclear activities carried out at Sellafield and to any expansion of these activities.  Without prejudice to that position, in the submission Minister Cowen considered that, in general, the proposed liquid discharge limits for gaseous and liquid radioactive wastes, being proposed by the inspector of pollution, were grossly excessive in relation to the margins between the likely discharges and the proposed limits.  Minister Cowen advised that these margins should be drastically reduced so that the authorisations should accord more closely <Col N="1352" /> with actual performance and thereby oblige British Nuclear Fuels to minimise and, where possible, eliminate discharges to conform with the International Commission for Radiological Protection principles of dose limitations.</P>
    <P>The submission also considered that, having regard to the existing accumulation of long-lived radionuclides such as plutonium on the bed of the Irish Sea, and to the major uncertainties about the ultimate fate of these radionuclides, future discharges of long-lived radionuclides should not be permitted &mdash; particularly in view of the commitment under the recent Convention for the Protection of Marine Environment in the north-east Atlantic, to apply the precautionary principle where there are grounds for concern.  The Government's submission also called for the draft authorisations for liquid discharges to be amended, to require British Nuclear Fuels Limited to use best available technology to control discharges, in keeping with commitments under this convention. It was also proposed that the THORP plant should not be allowed to proceed without krypton-85 gas removal technology being in place and that this technology would be retrofitted to the existing Magnox reprocessing plant.</P>
    <P>In particular our Government has expressed grave concerns about commissioning the proposed new THORP plant on the site and the proposed new levels of authorised discharges from Sellafield into the atmosphere and the Irish Sea and called for a full public inquiry to be held before any decision is taken to proceed.</P>
    <P>UK legislation provides that the Secretary of State of the Department of the Environment, must allow a hearing to take place in the case of the draft authorisation limits, if British Nuclear Fuels Limited should wish it.  The Secretary of State, and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food also have the statutory responsibility for considering whether local authorities or other persons should be given the opportunity of a hearing. There is nothing in the legislation to limit the scope of the hearing, so on this <Col N="1353" /> basis Minister Cowen called on the UK authorities to hold a full public inquiry, in his Government submission, on the THORP plant.</P>
    <P>However, it would appear from the announcement of 28 June last, made in the House of Commons by the Secretary of State for the Environment, that rather than holding a public inquiry the UK authorities have now decided to engage in a further consultation process.  As I stated, Minister Cowen will continue to press for a full public inquiry to be held, before any final decision is taken on THORP.</P>
    <P>In the House of Commons announcement referred to above, the Secretary of State for the Environment said that, after consideration by him and the UK Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, of the report presented to them, by the UK inspectorate of pollution, it has been concluded that no points of substance have been raised that should cause them to reconsider the terms of the draft authorisation, except for some minor amendments.</P>
    <P>In the original consultation the UK inspectorate of pollution was only empowered to deal with the environmental acceptability of radioactive discharges from the Sellafield site. However, many of the submissions, including ours, raised questions as to the basic justification for THORP, including the economics of the plant and the need for the plutonium that would be produced. These matters will now be considered in the further round of consultations being undertaken by the UK authorities.</P>
    <P>It is understood that a paper on the implications of reprocessing will be prepared by the UK Department of the Environment and sent to British Nuclear Fuels for its comments.  This paper and BNFL's response will be made public and the consultation will then take place, over a ten week period.</P>
    <P>The submissions will then be considered by the UK Secretary of State for the Environment and the UK Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, <Col N="1354" /> before a final decision is taken on THORP.</P>
    <P>We have objected in the strongest possible terms to the conclusions reached, with regard to the draft discharge authorisations and have written to Mr. John Gummer, Secretary of State for the Environment.  In that letter Minister Cowen expressed our Government's disappointment at the inspector's conclusions that no points of substance had been raised in the prior consultation process, which would cause a reconsideration of the terms of the draft authorisation for liquid and aerial discharges.</P>
    <P>In addition, while our original submission raised important questions on the basic justification for THORP, we will be making a further submisison to the UK authorities after consideration of any material made available, as part of the further public consultation process. Deputies can be assured that we will also continue to press the UK authorities to hold a full, open and independent public enquiry on THORP.</P>
    <P>The Government has maintained consistent pressure on the UK authorities to halt the commissioning of this plant. There has been some success so far.  As I said, we sent a detailed and comprehensive submission about THORP in January this year to the British Minister for the Environment and to the inspector of pollution in the UK.</P>
    <P>At a European level, copies of our submission were made available to the EC Commissioner for the Environment, Mr. Paleokrasses, and to the Energy Commissioner, Mr. Matutes, as well as to all MEPs and the diplomatic corps.</P>
    <P>The Irish delegation also played a very active part at a meeting in Berlin last month of the 13 member Paris Commission for he Prevention of Marine Pollution from land-based sources, where the THORP question was raised.  At the meeting, the Irish delegation expressed its deep concern that the commissioning of the THORP reprocessing plant at Sellafield, will cause additional radioactive discharges into the Irish Sea and to the maritime area, generally covered by the Paris Convention.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1355" /> At the end of the discussions, the Commission adopted an Irish proposal, cosponsored by Denmark, which agreed, that a new or revised discharge authorisation for radioactive discharges from nuclear reprocessing insallations, should only be issued by national authorities, if special consideration is given to information on the need for spent fuel reprocessing and other options to reprocessing and on having a full environmental impact assessment.  It has also to be demonstrated that the planned radioactive discharges are based upon the use of the best available techniques and observe the precautionary principle.  There should also be consultations by national authorities with the Paris Commission, on the basis of these considerations.  The British <Col N="1356" /> delegation alone maintained a reservation on the recommendation.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that participating States have been made aware once again of Ireland's concern about the nuclear industry generally and specifically in relation to our concern with regard to radioactive discharges into the Irish Sea and the continuing operation of nuclear fuel reprocessing plants, particularly at Sellafield.  We will continue to raise our objections to the commissioning of the THORP plant at all appropriate international fora and I know we will have the support of all Members of the Oireachtas for our efforts.  I thank Deputy Doyle for raising this important matter in such a positive and vigorous manner.</P>

      <Quest>his views on whether the gap between male and female earnings is acceptable considering that it is almost 20 years since the enactment of the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974; the Government's plans, if any, to strengthen anti-discrimination measures to reduce the differential; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The most recent statistics for gross earnings and hours of work of industrial workers (adult rates) indicate that the average female hourly earnings in manufacturing industry is approximately 70 per cent of average male hourly earnings.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply to a previous Dáil question from Deputy Máirín Quill on 4 March the existence of such a gap between the earnings of female and male workers in industrial employment indicates the persistence of inequalities between men and women in this employment area.  Factors contributing to this gap include not only differing occupation patterns as between men and women but also differing work organisation patterns, and remuneration systems.</P>
      <P>While this disparity in earnings is a problem in manufacturing industry the extent of any disparity in male/female earnings for other sectors is not as clear. Fortunately research on this has been commissioned jointly by the former Department of Labour and Employment Equality Agency which the ESRI are expected to complete in the next few months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the solutions to any differential in pay between men and women does not lie in equal pay legislation alone, I am proposing a number of changes to the provisions of the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, and the Employment <Col N="1113" /> Equality Act, 1977, to improve the position. These include provision for the removal of requirements that employees claiming equal pay must be employed in the same place of work or contemporaneously with the comparator cited.</P>
    <P>I am also examining proposals, in the context of the amending legislation, to strengthen the existing provision on positive action.  Over and above the anti-discrimination measures inherent in employment equality law I consider that there is scope for tackling the male/female differential issue through enlightened positive action measures targeted by employers together with workers at removing barriers to recruitment and advancement of women at work.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34, 35 and 36 together.</P>

    <P>According to the Garda authorities there are 125 Border crossing points which are at present open to vehicular traffic.  Information received from the British authorities indicates that 103 <Col N="1117" /> Border crossing points are subject to closure order under the Emergency Provisions (Northern Ireland) Act 1991.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the serious difficulties which the closure of cross-Border roads causes for communities on both sides of the Border.  In view of the importance which I attach to this issue I have discussed fully the question of Border road closures with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland at each of the meetings of the Anglo-Irish Conference which I have attended since my appointment as Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs.  In the light of these discussions both Governments have agreed to keep the situation regarding road closures under close review, taking fully into account the wider social and economic factors as well as the security considerations involved.</P>
    <P>I believe that as a result of these discussions within the Conference there is a greater understanding by all concerned of the complexities of the problem, and of the need to ensure that the economic and social dislocation caused to local communities is kept to a minimum consistent with security.  I can assure the Deputy that these matters will continue to receive close examination within the framework of the Anglo-Irish Conference.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the statement made by Commissioner Van den Broek on 4 June 1993 which dealt with the role of the European Community in trying to resolve the Yugoslav conflict.</P>
      <P>Since the beginning of the crisis in former Yugoslavia, the European Community has played a leading role in the search for a negotiated settlement to the complex and tragic problems of the Yugoslav region.  Initially, these efforts were channelled through the EC Peace Conference.  Since August 1992, our efforts have been directed through the International Conference on Former Yugoslavia, which is co-chaired by the EC and the UN, on the basis of the principles agreed by all parties at the inaugural meeting of the Conference in London.</P>
      <P>Ireland is a member of the International Conference, and is playing its part fully in the formulation of EC policy on former Yugoslavia, and in efforts at the United Nations and within the framework of the CSCE to end the conflict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland participated actively in the discussions on former Yugoslavia at the meeting of the European Council in Copenhagen on 21-22 June and the elaboration of the Declaration adopted by <Col N="1119" /> the European Council which set out the views of the European Community and its member states on the grave situation in the region.</P>
    <P>This Declaration expressed full confidence in the Co-Chairmen of the Steering Committee of the International Conference, David Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, and encouraged them to pursue their efforts to promote a fair and viable settlement, acceptable to all three constituent peoples of Bosnia-Hercegovina.</P>
    <P>The European Council reaffirmed its conviction that such a settlement must be based on the principles of the London Conference and that a territorial solution dictated by the Serbs and Croats at the expense of the Muslims, would not be acceptable.  The Council also confirmed that sanctions would remain in place and would be tightened until the conditions for their lifting had been met.</P>
    <P>Some 23,500 UN peacekeeping troops and related civilian personnel are now deployed in former Yugoslavia.  These include over 12,000 from the member states of the European Community.  The Secretary General is making arrangements for the deployment of a further 7,600 personnel to deter aggression against the towns which have been designated as safe areas and to ensure that these receive urgently needed humanitarian aid.  Ireland particularly welcomes the emphasis placed by the European Council on the need for speedy implementation of the UN Security Council resolutions on safe areas.</P>
    <P>The Government believe that the policy and approach taken by the European Community as outlined above provides the best hope for a resolution of the Yugoslav conflict.  An attempt to impose a military solution would jeopardise the humanitarian effort, could involve a high degree of casualties on both sides and would increase the possibility of a wider war in the Balkans.</P>

      <P>President Mitterrand and Chancellor Kohl met on 2 June and called for an extraordinary European Council to be convened when the Maastricht Treaty is finally ratified, in order to consider the future direction of European integration.  France and Germany have not yet formally conveyed this suggestion to their partners.</P>
      <P>Ireland is prepared to give positive consideration to the proposals which, in the first instance, is a matter for the Presidency.</P>
      <P>With regard to European Monetary Union, it is the Government's intention that Ireland should be among the first group of countries to participate in the third stage, which as the Deputy says, could begin as early as 1 January 1977.  It is following the necessary policies towards that end.</P>

      <P>A major review of the Ordnance Survey mapping programme was undertaken in 1989, as a result of which the then Minister for Finance instructed that the following programmes be undertaken: an urban mapping programme (1:1,000) which covers towns with a population 1,000 and over.  These maps are now for the most part up-to-date and available in printed or digital form; a rural mapping programme (1:2,500) involving a full resurvey of rural Ireland.  This is currently under way; a small scale mapping programme (1:50,000) aimed at the tourism industry and comprising 79 sheets. To date, nine sheets have been published with a further nine expected to be published at the end of this year.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the discrimination against general practitioners in the General Medical Service because withholding tax deducted from their payments is not allowable against tax liability until the following year, unlike other categories of self-employed; the changes, if any, he proposes to make to this system; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The withholding tax applies to the medical profession in exactly the same fashion as to other professionals.  It does not impose any additional tax liability on doctors or on the other professionals to which it applies.  It involves no more than the withholding, on account, of an amount against tax due.  Full credit for the amount withheld is given in computing the final tax liability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the tax was introduced in 1987, the self-employed (including doctors) and companies were being taxed on a previous year basis.  The withholding tax was held on account to be set against the <Col N="1122" /> actual tax liabilities which came due the following year.  When the self-employed moved to a current year basis in 1990 the Government decided that there would be no change in the withholding tax &mdash; the credit continued to be available the following year.  If the withholding tax had been changed to a current year basis, it would have been at a cost to the Exchequer of about £46 million.</P>
    <P>There are safeguards to ensure that no adverse effects arise from its operation. Principal among such safeguards is the provision for the payment of interim funds.  The availability of interim refunds puts a limit on the amount of the withholding tax that can be retained on account by the Revenue Commissioners. That limit is the equivalent of the income tax liability for the previous year.  Once the withholding tax exceeds the taxpayer's tax liability for the previous year, he or she may apply immediately for a refund of the difference.</P>
    <P>I have no intention of revising the withholding tax as it currently operates.</P>

    <P>With regard to stamp duty, prior to 1 November 1991 this was not in general a directly enforceable tax.  Collection and enforcement depended exclusively on indirect means, such as the fact that an unstamped instrument could not be registered. Accordingly, there are no general stamp duties up to 5 April 1991 which were disclosed to the Revenue Commissioners and which were collectable.</P>
    <P>Companies capital duty is, however, an exception to the general unenforceability of stamp duties prior to 1 November 1991.  This is a stamp duty payable on the setting up or an increase in the capital of a limited company and certain other corporate structures.  The amount of duty outstanding on assessments made in respect of transactions occurring prior to 5 April 1991 is approximately £1 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The fishery was part of the gift to the nation of the Muckross Estate made by Senator Arthur Vincent in 1932.  The fishery itself is, however, outside the boundaries of the National Park.  In view of this and in order to allow park staff concentrate on park-related duties, the Office of Public Works agreed to grant a letting of the fishery to the Central Fisheries Board (CFB) for a trial period of two years.  This arrangement provides an opportunity for the development of the fishery by the body with the greatest level of expertise in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agreement requires that the same level of access for the general public is <Col N="1127" /> to be maintained as heretofore.  In this regard, the Office of Public Works agreed that the CFB would sublease parts of the fishery to the Regional Fisheries Board and to a local angling club (The Laune Salmon Anglers Association), both of which are obliged to maintain the level of public access.  This arrangement is, as stated above, for a trial period only and will be subject to review.  The Office of Public Works therefore continues to have control over the way the fishery is managed. The agreed arrangements came into operation on 1 January, 1992.</P>
    <P>This arrangement has proven to be very satisfactory to date; both the Regional Fisheries Board and the Laune Anglers have carried out improvements to the fishery and further development works are being planned at present.</P>
    <P>The dispute to which the Deputy refers involves three fishermen who are protesting that they cannot fish on the fishery other than on payment of a daily permit fee of £8.  This fee is reasonable in comparison with the daily rates charged in other fisheries.  There is no problem with them fishing these waters on payment of this fee, as the fishery is open to all visitors at this rate.</P>
    <P>There was a season permit system in operation previously when the Office of Public Works controlled the fishery directly.  This was very limited in scope and the days on which fishing could take place under the permit was limited.  Furthermore, there was no guarantee that any individual would be allocated such a permit each year, or at all.  The vast majority of permits issued by the Office of Public Works were day permits.  The season permit arrangement was not feasible if the proper development of the fishery as an amenity resource was to be undertaken by the Central Fisheries Board and the sublessees.</P>
    <P>While it is unfortunate that this small number of individuals are not happy with the arrangements, I have to say that all the parties to the new arrangements are very pleased with the progress made to date on improving the fishery, which has made it possible for more people to fish <Col N="1128" /> there in improved conditions without detriment to the resource.  I am satisfied, therefore, that the present arrangements are the most appropriate for the proper development of the fishery for the benefit of the public as a whole.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 48 and 49 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is hoped that the transfer of Castletown House to the Office of Public Works will take effect on 1 January 1994.  The extent of the renovation works necessary will depend on the results of a detailed architectural survey which is about to commence.  The property will form part of the portfolio of the National Monuments and Historic Properties Service, be advertised as such and will continue to be open to the public with a full guide service.  As details about the renovation works, maintenance programmes and services have yet to be decided it is not possible at this juncture to estimate <Col N="1129" /> employment potential.  Neither is it possible at this stage to give a realistic estimate of the capital and running costs which will arise.</P>

      <P>The cost of the Information Newsletters being circulated as part of the consultation process on three Visitor Centres at the Burren, and Wicklow National Parks and the Boyne Valley is 32p per copy approximately.</P>
      <P>The cost of bringing the County Councillors in Wicklow to Glenveagh and the Ceide Fields will not be known until the visits take place.</P>
      <P>The newsletters form part of the consultation process required by Government and are aimed at the widest possible dissemination of information about the three centres in the relevant countries.  I need the views of the widest cross section of the population in the three areas concerned and accordingly I have made a direct appeal to the general public to let me have their comments.  In the circumstances I do not see how the literature could be described as politically personalised.</P>

      <P>Seventy-two National Nature Reserves have been established to date under the Wildlife Act, 1976.  The majority of these (46) contain wetlands, which covers bogs, coastal sites and estuaries as well as inland water bodies such as lakes.</P>
      <P>The sites designated as National Nature Reserves receive the full protection of the Wildlife Act and are managed generally so as to conserve the ecosystems they contain.  In addition appropriate management objectives are set for each reserve, having regard to the conservation status of the lands and waters within the reserve.  These objectives vary from site to site, reflecting the diversity of habitats contained within the various reserves.  The reserves are managed by the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Office of Public Works and a budget for the management of the reserves is provided out of the annual vote for the Office of Public Works.</P>

      <Quest>the criteria which private bus operators must meet in order to participate in his Department's free travel scheme for pensioners; if such participation is reviewed periodically; if so, the frequency of such reviews; if a register of such operators is compiled by his Department; and if so, if such a register is available for public scrutiny.</Quest>

      <P>Under the free travel scheme, arrangements have been in place for many years with a number of private bus and ferry operators for the conveyance of free travel passholders in certain parts of the country which are not being serviced by the CIE group of companies. Of the total estimated cost of the scheme in 1993 (£29.684 million), a sum of £0.858 million is expected to be paid to these private operators.  The remainder will be paid to CIE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is open to any bus operator to apply <Col N="1131" /> to my Department to participate in the free travel scheme.  Each application would have to be accompanied by documentation to verify the licensing, tax, insurance and safety position of the bus fleet in question.  My Department would also have to be satisfied that there are no existing free travel scheme bus services in the same geographical area proposed by the application which adequately meet the needs already of people entitled to free travel.  In addition, before a decision on an application could be made, sufficient Exchequer funds would have to be available to pay the additional cost of any proposed new bus service.</P>
    <P>Individual participants in the scheme are reviewed by my Department to ensure that they comply with the various licensing and tax clearance conditions outlined above.  These reviews normally are conducted each time bus operators seek a change in the rate of payment due them for the free travel services which they provide.  Following a reappraisal of existing procedures earlier this year, the licensing and other conditions applicable to participants in the scheme are being reviewed every six months.  As circumstances warrant, my Department also conducts surveys of the numbers of free travel passengers who use the bus fleets of scheme participants.  These surveys are intended to ensure that the level of payment being made to the bus operators in question corresponds with free travel passenger volumes.</P>
    <P>A list of the 30 private bus and ferry operators currently in the free travel scheme is available to any member of the public on request from my Department. I have arranged for this list to be forwarded to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme is designed to encourage elderly people to remain active in the community by giving them access to spare capacity on the various public transport systems.  Time restrictions have been a feature of the free travel scheme since its inception. They are especially necessary on city routes because the services concerned are under severe pressure from commuters travelling to or from work or school in the morning and evening and they would be unable to cope with the additional volume of passengers arising if the restrictions did not apply.</P>
      <P>I should mention that time restrictions do not apply in the case of mentally-handicapped people who are in receipt of disabled person's maintenance allowance and certain disabled or blind people attending long term rehabilation courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any easing of the current time restrictions which apply in the morning or the evening would have significant cost implications for the carriers involved who in <Col N="1134" /> turn would seek compensation from my Department.  The task of estimating the cost involved would be a time-consuming and expensive exercise both for the carriers and for my Department.  Expenditure on the free travel scheme will amount to almost £30 million this year and a further increase in this expenditure for any reason would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>Credit Unions are obliged to make by the end of February each year, an annual return to the Registrar of Friendly Societies made up to 30 September of the previous year.  I am advised by the Registrar that at this point in time, 395 Credit Unions out of the 419 on the register at 30 September 1992 have submitted the required returns for the year ended 30 September, 1992.  All returns in respect of previous years (i.e. up to and including the year ended 30 September, 1991) have been received by the Registrar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Registry is being managed in a competent and effective manner.  For example, even though <Col N="1139" /> Registry staff numbers have been reduced in recent years, the existing staff have continued to carry out their work load efficiently.</P>
    <P>I am advised by the Registrar that the Irish League of Credit Unions has never paid for any holidays or other perks for himself or his staff.  The Registrar and one or two members of his staff (the number has varied from year to year) have traditionally attended the Annual Conference of the Irish League of Credit Unions as guests of the Irish League.  The Conference which normally takes place during the last weekend of April is a valuable source of information and understanding of the Irish League of Credit Unions' approach to operating within the existing Credit Union legislation and to the workings of the Credit Union movement in general in Ireland.  I understand that the Registrar of Friendly Societies for Northern Ireland and his Assistant Registrar have also traditionally attended this Annual Conference as guests of the Irish League.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that there has been competent and effective supervision of the Credit Union Act, 1966 by the Registrar over the years.  The best measure of effectiveness in the regulation and supervision of Credit Unions would probably be the avoidance of a Credit Union failure.  In this connection, no Credit Union has failed to date.</P>
    <P>I expect to be in a position to present a Credit Unon Bill to the Oireachtas in the near future.  In this regard the good working relationship which exists between the Irish League of Credit Unions and the Registrar of Friendly Societies has contributed significantly to the preparatory work.</P>

      <P>The European Commission have agreed a global grant of ten million ECU for local development in Ireland.  Area Development Management Ltd. (ADM) has been designated by the Irish Government in agreement with the European Commission as the intermediary responsible for the management of the global grant.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the grant is to support the development of indigenous potential at local level.  It will focus on measures which encourage and support local economic development initiatives, stimulate new economic activity, and support for local community-based socio-economic development.  In particular, the grant will aim to support and tap fully local enterprise initiatives and to promote integrated economic, social and community development of local areas.  It will aim to support the main forces of local development by providing funds to develop local leadership and capacity where required.</P>
      <P>The procedures for use of the global grant are the subject of an agreement concluded between the European Commission and ADM, in agreement with the Irish Government.</P>
      <P>ADM Ltd. publicised the availability of grant assistance for local community bodies through advertisements placed with the national press in early June and an extensive number of applications has been received.  In selecting proposals for grants, ADM must, <i>inter alia,</i> respect the following guidelines:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1) Eligible bodies are required to prepare an integrated area action plan drawn up in consultation with such other local groups and bodies, public agencies and local representatives of the social partners, <Col N="1141" /> as the eligible body sees fit.  This plan will set out the basic strategy whereby it seeks to achieve its objectives of economic and social revitalisation in its area.</P>
    <P>(2)  The plan must also include a statement on executive capacity; on proposals for the implementation of projects; and on the consultation process whereby other local groups and bodies were involved in the preparation of the area action plan.</P>
    <P>(3) Evidence of commercial relevance will be sought in respect of enterprise ventures, and the basis of the policies whereby individual projects are approved and selected locally must be established.</P>
    <P>(4)  In selecting proposals for support, priority will be given to quality proposals which aim to realise economic benefits and promote viable forms of economic activity and the qualitative upgrading of social activity necessary to improve the viability of the area.</P>
    <P>The names of the directors of ADM Ltd. are as follows:</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 71 and 72 together.</P>
      <P>The European Commission has drawn up a proposal for a Council Directive on the maximum design speed, maximum torque and maximum net engine power of two or three-wheel motor vehicles. This proposal includes a requirement to limit the maximum permissible power output to 74 Kw.</P>
      <P>The specific requirement to limit power output was included on the grounds of road safety and is supported by the vast majority of member states.</P>
      <P>The proposal was submitted to the Internal Market Council on 14 June 1993 and was adopted as a Common Position. However a derogation was agreed whereby member states could allow the registration of motor cycles up to 94 Kw for a period of five years from the date of application of the Directive.  The Commission is obliged to re-examine the situation and to submit a new report to the Council within three and a half years.</P>
      <P>We do not have a motor cycle manufacturing industry in Ireland.  Consequently the impact of this proposal in Ireland would occur mainly in relation to first registration of these vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been informed by the Department of the Environment that there are <Col N="1143" /> no Irish statistics available linking motor cycle accidents to the engine power of the motor cycles involved nor are there statistics to show the age profile of motor cycle riders.  Moreover, I understand that only three per cent of motor cycles currently licensed in Ireland have an engine power in excess of 74Kw.</P>

      <P>A recent study carried out on behalf of the EC Commission found that Ireland had the highest pretax prices for motor fuels &mdash; about 20 per cent above the weighted average.  The study identifies a number of contributory factors including low population density, low throughput at service stations, higher shipping costs, and the cost of Whitegate. The data used for the study is contained in the EC Bulletin Petrolier.</P>
      <P>The level of distributor and retailer margins is determined by market forces, since the removal of price control on petrol on 1 October, 1991.  My understanding, however, is that these margins are high compared to other EC countries.</P>

      <P>The interest rate on local authority fixed rate house purchase loans is related to the cost of long term funds prevailing at the time the loans were advanced and is fixed for the life of the loan.  A fixed interest rate of up to 12½ per cent applied to loans issued before 1 December, 1987.  It is not possible to reduce the interest rate on these loans as the cost involved would be substantial and would have to be borne by the Exchequer and local authorities. However, borrowers of these loans may redeem them without penalty and refinance in the private sector, if they consider it advantageous to do so.  This is a significant concession.</P>
      <P>The interest rate on local authority variable interest rate house purchase and improvement loans are being reduced on an ongoing basis to a level which reflects current building society mortgage rates.</P>

      <P>At its meeting on 28 and 29 June, the EC Council of Environment Ministers reached agreement on a Directive concerning the incineration of hazardous waste.  The text of the Directive will be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities when it has been formally adopted by the Council in due course following its final editing.</P>
      <P>The Directive lays down stringent new standards and operating conditions for hazardous waste incineration plants throughout the EC.  It provides for regulation of all discharges from these plants on an integrated pollution control basis so as to prevent transfer of pollution from one environmental medium to another.</P>
      <P>The other main provisions of the Directive are as follows:</P>
      <P>&mdash;all new and existing hazardous waste incineration plants will be licensable;</P>
      <P>&mdash;controls will apply to the reception and handling of wastes;</P>
      <P>&mdash;very stringent emission limit values are set for a range of atmospheric pollutants together with detailed monitoring procedures to ensure compliance;</P>
      <P>&mdash;in particular, provision is made in respect of emissions of dioxins and furans;</P>
      <P>&mdash;requirements are also specified for waste water discharges from incineration plants and for dealing with the disposal or recovery of any residues arising.</P>
      <P>The Directive will apply to new incineration plants from 1995 and to existing plants from 1999.</P>

      <P>The Defence Forces (Pensions) Schemes provide for the payment of a special increment of £3.46 a week in addition to his basic pension to a soldier for each year of his pensionable service in excess of 21 years but not exceeding 31 years. As a general rule, this special increment continues to be payable until the pensioner becomes entitled to a Social Welfare retirement pension (at age 65) or to a contributory old age pension (at age 66), at which stage the increment ceases to be payable.  (The personal rate of either Social Welfare pension is considerably greater than the maximum special increment).  Exceptionally, the increment continues to be payable up to 70 years of age in the case of a pensioner who was discharged prior to 1 August 1978, provided he is not in receipt of a Social Welfare retirement pension.</P>
      <P>The withdrawal of the special increment is in accordance with the principle of co-ordinating occupational pensions in the public sector with Social Welfare pensions in the case of employees who are fully insured under the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
      <P>This matter was examined by the Commission on Remuneration and Conditions of Service in the Defence Forces. The Commission did not recommend any change in the present arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person in question who is in receipt of a contributory old age pension, <Col N="1151" /> was discharged prior to 1 August 1978 and will reach 70 years of age on 3 January 1994, from which date the special increment will cease to be payable in his case.</P>

      <P>Member states of the Community are obliged to bring into force, by 31 December 1994, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with Council Directive 92/29/EEC, on minimum safety and health requirements for improved medical treatment on board vessels.  The Directive is designed to ensure that ships carry, and properly maintain, adequate medical equipment and medicines to permit the effective treatment of crews. The Department is currently engaged in consultations with the National Health and Safety Authority and the industry with a view to implementing the Directive within the required timeframe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the Commission has proposed a number of draft Directives under the recently adopted action programme of priority measures to improve maritime safety and prevent marine pollution. They include, notably, a draft Directive on minimum reporting requirements for ships carrying dangerous and polluting goods; a draft Directive on common rules <Col N="1156" /> and standards for ship inspection and survey organisations; and a draft Directive on minimum levels of training for maritime occupations.</P>
    <P>The Council of Ministers committed itself, on 8 June last, to make concrete progress on these proposals before the end of the year.  The actual timeframe for implementation by member states cannot, however, be determined at this stage pending finalisation of the Directives themselves.</P>

      <P>Mayo County Council in their submission in respect of the Fishery Harbour Development Plan 1994-1999 have identified Ballyglass Pier as their No. 2 priority for development.  Their proposal is to extend the pier by 30 metres at a cost of £250,000.</P>
      <P>A new pier and approach road were completed at Ballyglass in 1977 at a cost of £408,291 towards which the Department provided an Exchequer grant of £237,603 and Mayo County Council contributed £170,687 which included a FEOGA grant of £68,615.  In 1987 the Department contributed 75 per cent towards funding the installation of five working lights on the pier along with the provision of an electric crane.</P>
      <P>Ballyglass Pier is being considered for possible inclusion in the Fishery Harbour Development Plan.  However, pending finalisation of the plan and clarification of the funding to be made available under it, it is not possible to indicate at this stage whether further development work will be undertaken at this location but arising from the Deputy's ongong concerns in the matter he will be kept in constant touch with all future developments.</P>

      <P>The advice available to me based on the conclusions of the broad range of scientists participating in the Sea Trout Working Group is that on the basis of scientific evidence to date it has not been possible to show a casual link between sea lice on farmed salmon and infestations on wild white trout.  I have arranged to have a copy of the 1992 report of the Scientific Working Group forwarded to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Following my consideration of that report earlier this year, I put in place an expanded Research, Conservation and Management Programme to address the decline in white trout numbers.  I have further augmented these efforts in recent weeks by establishing a task force with a mandate to secure the survival of the white trout.  The task force, which is compact and representative of all relevant interests, has direct access to all monitoring and scientfic information emerging from the 1993 programme.</P>
      <P>This information includes the sampling data emerging from ongoing surveys of rivers around the country in order to quantify the 1993 level of stocks and degree of lice infestations in white trout populations.  I am advised that definitive conclusions in this regard will only be possible towards the end of the season for returning white trout.</P>
      <P>I have made it clear that differing perceptions as to the cause of white trout declines must not stand in the way of concerted action to solve this complex problem.  I am confident that the task force will deliver on its remit in a spirit of consensus and goodwill.</P>

      <P>First, I would stress that there has been no change in the Irish position on the agriculture agreement negotiated between the EC Commission and US negotiators.</P>
      <P>Since details of the agreement became available late last November the Government has consistently stated that, while the agreement contained some positive elements relating to the safeguarding of the Common Agricultural Policy compensatory payments, it has major difficulties regarding other aspects.  The main concern is the proposed volume restriction on subsidised exports which would have a very severe impact on the beef sector in particular but also on other livestock sectors and the economy as a whole.</P>
      <P>The Government has voiced its concerns on the agreement in the various fora at every available opportunity and most recently at the Special General Affairs Council on 2 July.  In the ongoing negotiations the Government will continue to seek to have Ireland's concerns fully addressed, with particular regard to Ireland's agricultural and food interests.</P>

The measures provided for in ALTENER range from defining standards to establishment of an international information network.  They do not include pure research and development work but do provide for pilot actions, studies and training and information activities which will be of value in this country.  Four Irish projects with a total value of almost 800,000 ECU have been submitted in response to the Commission guidelines for projects in this first year of the programme.  A decision on these is expected in the autumn.</P>

      <P>At its recent meeting, the board of the RPII considered what action the RPII should take arising from this incident. The board decided, primarily because there was no hazard to the public arising from the incident, that a prosecution was not warranted and that the issuing of a strong letter of reprimand to UCD would be the appropriate action to take.  Such a letter did issue and the RPII have received an acknowledgement from UCD with an assurance that the college will continue to observe all requirements and conditions of the licensing system for radiological substances.</P>

      <P>The current annual rental charge approved for Cablelink Ltd., in respect of relay of the basic service to homes in the Dublin area is £80.80 inclusive of £9.36 copyright charge.</P>
      <P>In July 1988 the annual rental charge was £63.95.  On 1 March 1990 this was reduced to £62.93 following a decrease in the rate of VAT applicable to cable television rental charges from 25 per cent to 23 per cent.  An increase to £68.83 was approved with effect from April 1990. With effect from 1 March 1991 there was a further reduction in the relevant VAT rate to 21 per cent and at the same time Cablelink received approval to pass on an annual copyright payment of £9.36 to each subscriber.  These two changes resulted in a revised annual rental charge of £77.  The current annual rental charge of £80.80 was approved in February 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is currently considering applications from Cablelink for increases in subscriber charges as follows: an element of subscriber charge increase arising out of an agreement between Cablelink and a number of satellite operators for the return of a range of satellite channels to the Cablelink network which had been available free of charge to cable companies such as Cablelink and hence to subscribers from the late eighties until recently when satellite operators began <Col N="1171" /> to demand a subscription in respect of such channels, and a small annual percentage increase in subscriber charges from 1994 to 1998, inclusive, to contribute towards the cost of a major upgrade planned for the Dublin system.</P>

      <P>The number of hip replacement operations carried out so far in 1993 in the Southern Health Board area is 189.  As part of the £20 million major action programme on hospital in-patient waiting lists, the Southern Health Board will receive funds of £1,736,500 in respect of an additional 1,370 procedures.  This includes provision for an additional 340 hip replacement operations at St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital, Gurranebraher and Tralee General Hospital, bringing the projected number of hip replacement operations in the Southern Health Board area in 1993 to 709.  The increased activity permitted by the major action programme on waiting lists will reduce the average waiting time for patients.</P>
      <P>The admission of a patient to hospital is a clinical decision for the consultant in charge of the case.  Waiting lists are kept under review and priority is given to urgent cases.  If the patient's condition is causing concern, she should contact her general practitioner who would be in the best position to stress the urgency of the case to the consultant concerned with a view to expediting matters.</P>

      <P>The patient concerned is on the out-patient waiting list for assessment at Mayo Gener <Col N="1181" /> eral Hospital, Castlebar but it is not possible for the hospital to give an appointment date at this stage.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the scheduling of appointments is a matter for the consultant concerned and urgent cases are always accorded priority.  Should the patient feel concerned about his condition he should return to his general practitioner who is in the best position to emphasise the urgency of his case directly to the consultant.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the £20 million major action programme which I recently launched in relation to hospital in-patient waiting lists which was specifically targeted at those areas of hospital treatment where long waiting times are causing the greatest hardship.  The Western Health Board has been allocated £2,192,600 from the waiting list fund. This will enable the board to carry out an additional 1,884 procedures this year of which 160 will be orthopaedic.  This should impact significantly on the average waiting times in these areas.</P>
