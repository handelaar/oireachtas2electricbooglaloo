      <P>Before commencing with the Order of Business today, may I say in view of what has occurred on the Order of Business in recent days, in that some Deputies seem to be under the impression that the Order of Business is a form of instant Question Time, I feel it would be an opportune time to restate the long-standing rulings of the Chair in regard to the appropriate questions that may be raised on the Order of Business.</P>
      <P>The Order of Business is governed by Standing Order 25 and established practice. The practice of raising questions on the Order of Business has traditionally been allowed over the years subject to criteria laid down in rulings of the Chair, the standard one as such was given by my predecessor on 29 January 1981 at columns 541-543, Volume 326, of the Official Report; the principal points of which are that the Chair has permitted questions to be asked concerning: (i) business of the day; (ii) the taking of other business on the Order Paper; (iii) the taking of business which has been promised and which therefore can be anticipated; (iv) arrangements for sittings and (v) when Bills or other documents needed in the House will be circulated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This practice has evolved in that <Col N="698" />&ldquo;promised legislation&rdquo; has been greatly expanded upon to constitute business promised under heading (iii), namely, the taking of business which has been promised and which therefore can be anticipated.  However, promised legislation must be promised in the House in accordance with the ruling of 20 July 1989 at column 746, Volume 391, and should relate to the current Dáil.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Bills or other documents&rdquo; refers to those items on the Order Paper and not otherwise.  That is a ruling made on 28 April 1982, column 1643, Volume 333, of the Official Report.</P>
    <P>My predecessors have ruled that to raise other matters is disorderly and in that regard I should say a Deputy requesting the Government to make a statement on a matter does not put it in order on the Order of Business.</P>
    <P>As I indicated to the House last Tuesday, it is a matter for the Dáil itself &mdash; through the Committee on Procedure and Privileges &mdash; as to whether procedures should be changed, or whether the raising of topical matters can be accommodated under a more appropriate new procedure to be devised under Dáil reform.  Needless to mention, whatever changes the House recommends, I, as your Ceann Comhairle, will faithfully implement.</P>
    <P>I also have to say that the Chair is placed in a very disadvantageous and, indeed, inequitable position by being expected by Members on the one hand to implement Standing Orders as they are, yet on the other hand being ignored or even criticised when he attempts to do so.</P>
    <P>Until procedures change, I earnestly appeal to the House to co-operate with the Chair and ensure the orderly transaction of business in this House, in accordance with the present procedures which, admittedly, have been in operation for a long time and perhaps should now be reviewed.</P>
    <P>I will arrange to have my statement here today circulated to every Member of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, Members face a particular problem in complying with your ruling, Sir, in view of the fact that Dáil debates are not being published and that therefore Members are not in a position to peruse the records of the House to establish whether legislation has been promised.  Your ruling, therefore, is impossible to implement in the absence of the availability of records of proceedings to Members&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the point made by the Deputy that there is an industrial dispute and that documents and reports are not as readily available as perhaps they ought to be.  However, the rulings I made are consistent with the rulings made by my predecessor over a long period of time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of concern to me that this House is not seen to be irrelevant.  It is also a matter of concern to all that the circumstances which applied when the rulings were made no longer apply in that Members do not now have records available to them to establish whether legislation was promised in this House.  Sir, you must take account of that reality in interpreting the ruling in this case, because without the record it is impossible to establish whether a particular question complies with your ruling.  I respectfully submit that it is also impossible for you to do so because we do not have records, which is not the fault of Members of this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite what may appear, everybody in the House agrees, Sir, that you have on occasion an impossible job.  That is appreciated.  However, is it not the case that the difficulty in raising major events in the Dáil is the prime defect in procedures?  Perhaps consistently applying the precedents of the past, as you have done, is not the way to deal with this major defect.  Indeed, 1991 may as well be as long ago as 1881 because we should be looking forward. Irrespective of Dáil reform, you should not be afraid to create new precedents in terms of the interpretation of the particular Standing Order to enable us to raise major pressing matters in the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not feel I should do that on my own volition as I would much prefer to have the support of this House and the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I am not prepared to act outside that as I do not have a mandate to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are talking about precedents, may I draw to your attention, Sir, that in the last Dáil it was <Col N="703" /> accepted that commitments to introduce legislation in the then Joint Programme for Government were considered proper to be raised on the Order of Business? From what I can gather from what you said this morning the commitments in this document are worthless and cannot be raised on the Order of Business.  I suggest therefore that if we are to follow precedent we should be entitled similarly to raise with the Taoiseach on the Order of Business the specific commitments to introduce legislation outlined in the programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would much prefer if these matters were tidied up in the appropriate way.  In reply to Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, I am aware that a former Taoiseach decided to answer questions here in respect of his policy document&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I <Col N="704" /> believe, Sir, that you were the Ceann Comhairle when the previous Taoiseach was allowed by you to answer these questions. It seems to me that if you now prevent these questions being asked you are effectively handing over to the Executive &mdash; the Government &mdash; the right to interpret Standing Orders.  Under the rules that is your prerogative and if you allowed it in the past you set a precedent which you can now follow.  I suggest that you should allow questions on the Programme for Government because it is ludicrous to allow a Government to be formed on the basis of a programme and not to allow questions on it.</P>

      <P>The rights of the Opposition need to be protected.  The Chair has said we are governed by precedent but it seems he is selective as to what <Col N="707" /> precedents we are governed by.  The Taoiseach is passing the buck now and he is certainly not following the precedent of the former Taoiseach.  May I ask the Taoiseach why he feels he has the right not to carry on the precedent that has been set, and, second, if he is going to pass the buck in relation to introducing legislation arising from the Supreme Court decision in the X case?  That decision has an impact on legislation and will we see a rolling back on the Supreme Court decision?</P>

      <P>I listened with interest to the Chair's statement and found it helpful in the context of the issues we have been trying to resolve over a number of weeks.  The Chair has offered to circulate his statement but would he consider making further clarification on the change since 1989 when the procedures were tightened up a great deal?  It was from that point that we experienced frustration in trying to raise questions about legislation which was promised outside this House.  Will the Chair clarify how this change came about?  Was it as a result of a request from the Office of the Taoiseach of the day?  What was this decision based on?  This is one of the major sources of frustration in the House.</P>
      <P>I accept that the other issues raised can only be resolved by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  The Chair's decision in 1989 altered the procedure and frustrated many of our attempts to raise commitments made by the Government to introduce legislation.</P>

      <P>Most Members have not heard the Chair's statement this morning in which he indicated that the time has possibly come for change in some of the restrictive areas.  The Opposition must be aware that the Whips have discussed at length the possibility of such changes in <Col N="708" /> future Dáil reform but this has been opposed vehemently by the Opposition. It was suggested that we should have the opportunity to discuss topical matters on a daily basis instead of misusing the time on the Order of Business.  This removes the opportunity to debate the budget which everybody is supposed to be so interested in.  May I suggest that the Leader of the Opposition consult with his Whip who has been privy to all the discussions with the Whips over the past number of months?</P>

      <P>One of the most constant recurring themes identified repeatedly in the past, reiterated by experts inside and outside this House, in Culliton and re-echoed last week in the wake of the Digital debacle, is the need for greater investment in research and development.  One of the most rewarding investments of public money has been in the development of research facilities in our universities, colleges, institutes of technology and the regional technical colleges. <Col N="712" /> Research and fellowship grants have enabled post-graduates to participate in research and development work.  Up to now, despite the obvious flow of benefits from such investment, the amount given by the State for such work has been pitifully small.  One of the much vaunted purposes of the Regional Technical Colleges Bill and the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill, which we debated at length in this House before the summer recess, was to allow these colleges to find their feet, as it were, in this area and enable them to engage in research and development and in partnerships with industry.  How blind and ironic it is that the very week Digital should go to the wall and with the axe hanging over other foreign enterprises whose research and development facilities are elsewhere, instead of making a grand gesture of increasing money for research and development this Minister and Government should decide to cut research and development by 1 per cent. We should be encouraging investment in research and development and using the universities and colleges as incubators for industrial ideas and for the germs of growth instead of cutting the meagre resources allocated to this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am appalled that the Minister for Education recently informed a delegation from the Mayo regional technical college group that there is absolutely no prospect of that project going ahead.  The former Minister for Justice, Padraig Flynn, on behalf of the Taoiseach and the Fianna Fáil Party, gave a clear commitment prior to the general election that third level courses would be available in Castlebar as and from next September. The decision to renege on that commitment will not be easily forgiven.  Castlebar Regional Technical College was to be next in line after Tallaght.  Tallaght has now been built, is open and operational. My colleague, Deputy Enda Kenny, when Minister of State at the Department of Education, identified and purchased a site in 1987.  The courses were devised and evolved.  It was Fianna Fáil who scuttled the project and left it on the back boiler from 1987 until the <Col N="713" /> November election.  What we were offered in November and what the people bought was a watered down version, but at least it was seen as a stepping stone to a full regional technical college.  This has been reneged on by this Government and it can expect a clear electoral message from the people of Mayo when they arrive <i>en masse</i> for the by-election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was appointed Minister for Health some weeks ago, I was determined that I would change the image of the Department.  Unfairly, the Department of Health has come to be seen as an over-bureaucratic agency, which is more concerned with saving money than almost anything else.  The truth is that the Department is, and deserves to be seen as, a caring Department, concentrating all its efforts on the rapid delivery of services to people who urgently need them.  Since my appointment, I have been impressed more than anything else by the quality of the people who work in the service, and by their determination, at every level, to ensure that the delivery of care is the first priority.</P>
      <P>Health professionals often talk of the inverse care law.  This law describes how those most in need of good quality health care, the poor and the disadvantaged, are often the least likely to receive it.  It is my aim to ensure that the message of care gets across and that those who need the public health service most will come to know that they have a right and an entitlement to the highest possible level of care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even before the additional amounts announced in the budget are taken into account, the 1993 provision for the health service clearly indicates the Government's concern that the needs of the health service are accorded the highest priority in the allocation of resources. The 1993 Health Vote, as reflected in the Abridged Estimates, is for more than £1,700 million.  This figure represents an increase of £183.1 million or 12 per cent over the original net Estimate for 1992. The provision for health represents more than one-fifth of all Government spending <Col N="714" /> on supply services this year.  The allocation of such a large share of our national resources in the current difficult economic circumstances cannot but emphasise the importance which the Government attaches to the provision of an effective and responsive health service.</P>
    <P>Despite the large increase in health spending which the Government has approved, we face a difficult task this year.  In order to maintain services at the 1992 approved levels health agencies will need to meet the targets which are being set in relation to income and savings.  In addition, there will have to be specific agreement on the target level of work in major acute hospitals.</P>
    <P>In the area of hospital in-patient waiting lists, it is accepted that the reduction in acute hospital beds over the last number of years has led to an unacceptable rise in the numbers of people who have had to remain for excessive periods on waiting lists for elective surgery.</P>
    <P>I am especially concerned that long waiting times for admission to hospital should be reduced to the greatest extent possible, particularly for children and the elderly.  For this reason the Government has allocated a special earmarked sum of £20 million for a major action programme specifically targeted at those areas of hospital treatment where long waiting times are causing the greatest hardship. These include orthopaedics &mdash; hip replacement and other procedures; ophthalmology &mdash; Cataracts and other procedures; ear nose and throat; cardiac surgery &mdash; by-pass operations; vascular surgery &mdash; varicose veins and plastic surgery.</P>
    <P>The overall aim of this major action programme will be to eliminate waiting lists in excess of 12 months in these particular specialties and to set a maximum period of six months for children awaiting ENT or eye treatment.  The Government is determined that these objectives will be achieved and is confident that this action programme represents a significant start in dealing with some of the problems facing our public hospital services. <Col N="715" /> We will be adopting a planned approach which will ensure that the extra resources will only be provided where satisfactory output targets have been agreed in advance with my Department. The intention is to reward those hospitals who are doing their everyday business well and build on their strengths rather than reward inefficient units.</P>
    <P>One of the issues which has been pushed to the top of the political agenda in recent years &mdash; and quite rightly &mdash; has been the issue of the rights of people with a disability.  For too long it is an issue to which we have all paid lip service.  Lip service stops now and action begins.  We are firmly committed to eliminating inequality for all groups in society that have suffered from disability, disadvantage or discrimination.  People with a disability are equal citizens of Ireland. The full expression of that citizenship requires the mobilisation of community resources and an injection of political will.  We intend to ensure the equality of people with disabilities by ensuring that the services they need are theirs as of right.  We will ensure that people with a disability and their families have as much choice as possible in the use of services and that they are consulted about policy and service issues.  We will encourage the integration of services with those for the community as a whole, to the extent that people with a disability and their families so wish.</P>
    <P>The Government is determined to develop and expand the services for people with mental handicap.  The Programme for a Partnership Government includes a commitment to the provision of additional funding to enable the recommendations of the Review Group on Mental Handicap Services &mdash;<i>Needs and Abilities</i>&mdash; to be accelerated.</P>
    <P>The number of people with mental handicap has increased by an estimated 25 per cent in the period since 1981. There are probably more adults with mental handicap now than at any previous time in our history.  This increase has of course resulted in a consequent increase in the age of those caring for <Col N="716" /> these adults, leading to a growing number of elderly parents caring for children with mental handicap.  It has also resulted in an increased number of people with mental handicap who suffer from behaviourial disturbance and whose care presents one of the most fundamental challenges to our services.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Needs and Abilities</i>&mdash; the report of the Review Group on Mental Handicap Services, which was published in 1990 &mdash; provides the guiding principle for the future direction of the mental handicap services, which is the development of each person's potential to live as full and independent a life as possible.  I will be working closely with my colleague Deputy Mervyn Taylor, to ensure that this principle is put into practice throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I am happy to say that, with the funds which were provided in the Estimates and the special additional allocation of £8 million announced by the Minister for Finance in his budget speech, it will be possible to put in place this year significant improvements in services for people with disabilities.  This extra allocation is the largest additional allocation ever made in this area.  I intend to address the shortfall of services in a broad manner to ensure that as many people benefit from these additional funds as possible. I am proposing to implement a package of measures which will address the most acute needs for service developments. Additional funds will be made available throughout the country, with particular attention to the health boards with the greatest number of clients without services. This funding will be on top of the additional funding of £6 million made available in 1992 which is being repeated this year.</P>
    <P>There will be wide consultation with the agencies providing services to people with mental handicap in the context of the regional co-ordinating committees.  It is my aim that parents will play a key role in future in the development and planning of services and will be fully consulted in respect of all policy initiatives at national and regional level.  The representation of parents on each of the <Col N="717" /> mental handicap co-ordinating committees, which has recently been achieved, is a major step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>The following additional services will be put in place for people with a mental handicap and their families: an additional 70 residential places; an additional 200 day places; an extension of respite services to support families.  This extension will make progress towards the point where planned respite breaks will be available on a regular basis to all families and carers; additional home support services for 800-900 families; improved services for those who are behaviourally disturbed; further transfers of people with mental handicap from psychiatric hospitals to more appropriate placements within the mental handicap services and an extension of early intervention and child development services.  I am confident that these additional services will make a major contribution towards achieving the principle of developing the potential of each person with a mental handicap to live as full and as independent a life as possible.  It will provide a firm foundation on which to build in future years.</P>
    <P>I recently received an interim report from the Review Group on Services for People with Physical or Sensory Disability on the most urgent needs within the services.  This report identifies considerable unmet needs in community and residential services for people with physical or sensory disability.  I am pleased therefore to begin the implementation of the interim report's recommendations this year.</P>
    <P>The additional services which are to be put in place this year will include: the opening of additional independent living residential units together with appropriate support services; the extension of support service to people with disabilities living at home; respite services for families and relatives caring for people with disabilities; additional day care places and extra community based therapists.</P>
    <P>Provision has also been made for the capital investment necessary to support the initiatives which I have just <Col N="718" /> announced and to lay the ground work for the further development of these services. Priorities include the purchase of hostels in the community and the conversion of existing accommodation to cater for more dependent people.</P>
    <P>The European Community has designated 1993 as European Year of Older People and of Solidarity between Generations. The Community has chosen this year to honour its older citizens, to focus on the challenges and opportunities of an ageing Europe and to reinforce links between the generations.  As a mark of support for the objectives of the European Year, I have made £440,000 available to the National Co-ordinating Committee to fund its programme of promotion and sponsorship of activities to celebrate the year.  The committee has sought proposals from organisations at national, regional and local level and will carry out and fund a number of programmes throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The Programme for a Partnership Government includes a commitment that provision will be made in 1993 to begin the phased implementations of the Nursing Homes Act.  It is my intention to bring the Nursing Homes Act into effect as soon as possible.  I have already had discussions with nursing home interests and I have indicated my intention to proceed with the implementation of the Act by 1 May this year if that is achievable.  I have had discussions with the Nursing Homes Association.  A provision of £4 million has been made available for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, creates an important new legal framework for nursing home care in this country.  The purpose of the Act is to provide for the registration of voluntary and private nursing homes by health boards and to introduce a new system for the subvention of dependent people in nursing homes.  Drafting of the regulations needed to implement the Act is at an advanced stage.  I hope this can be achieved and fully implemented by the target date of 1 May.</P>
    <P>The provision of dental and orthodontic care for special needs groups &mdash; for example, the handicapped &mdash; and <Col N="719" /> schoolchildren will continue to be a priority and towards this end a sum of £2 million is being provided in 1993 towards the implementation of the provisions contained in the Programme for a Partnership Government for the development of the dental services.  In accordance with this programme, the process to put the necessary framework in place for the introduction of vocational training for dental graduates will commence in December 1993.  I envisage that vocational training will, initially, be offered on a voluntary basis to dentists graduating in November 1994.</P>
    <P>I propose to extend eligibility to schoolchildren up to age 14 with effect from 1 December 1993 and to extend such eligibility up to 16 years over the course of the programme.  I also intend to keep up the momentum generated over the past few years in relation to the orthodontic services.  In this regard additional funding has been provided for the development of orthodontic services since 1989.  As a result, consultant orthodontists have now been appointed to six health boards and the remaining boards continue in their efforts to make appointments.</P>
    <P>I have also examined the role of dental auxiliaries.  A scheme for dental hygienists has been agreed and the grade will be introduced in the health services this year.</P>
    <P>The situation about AIDS and HIV in Ireland continues to be a distressing problem both for persons who have contracted the illness and for their families and friends.  To date, a total of 315 persons have developed AIDS and, of these, 143 have died.  A total of 1,313 persons have tested positive for the virus under the Department of Health's voluntary HIV testing programme and it is estimated that a significantly higher number of persons have actually contracted the virus.</P>
    <P>It is essential, therefore, that we have in place a framework of programmes and services appropriate to respond to the evolving epidemiology of the illness.  In this context, I will continue to <Col N="720" /> implement, on a phased basis, the recommendations of the National AIDS Strategy Committee.</P>
    <P>As regards prevention, I propose to take initiatives on both the legislative and health information fronts.</P>
    <P>The Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Act 1992 was passed in July 1992.  It provides for the sale of condoms in a variety of outlets and for their provision, free of charge, for the purpose of preventing HIV or other sexually transmissible diseases.</P>
    <P>I am on the record of this House as saying that I am not satisfied that this Act goes far enough in making condoms more freely available and I intend to act on that in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Higgins, even though he then left the House, for calling a quorum and for allowing me to inform the House of the decision of the chief executive officers of the health boards in relation to the assessment of eligibility for medical cards.  As all Deputies will know, the health boards award medical cards to those whose incomes are within certain guidelines. Where these guidelines are exceeded, a medical card may still be awarded if the health board consider that, due to medical or other circumstances, undue hardship would otherwise result.</P>
      <P>A particular bone of contention for many years has been the practice of basing the assessment on gross income, before deduction of PRSI payments.  This was regarded as being particularly inequitable to those in employment, and may in certain cases have been a disincentive to taking up employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chief executive officers have the statutory responsibility for determining eligibility and have decided that, with <Col N="721" /> immediate effect, all applicants will be assessed on the basis of net income after PRSI deductions.  The measure is significant in that the basis for determining whether a person has an automatic entitlement to a medical card will now be seen to be fairer.</P>
    <P>I very much welcome this decision by the chief executive officers.  I am aware that they have been reviewing the medical card assessment procedures and have gradually been introducing a number of improvements in the interests of both equity and consistency.  I understand that it is their intention to make a guide to these procedures widely available in the near future.  I am sure that all Deputies will welcome this and that it will greatly assist them in dealing with inquiries from constituents.</P>
    <P>In settling the 1993 Estimates, the Government took a number of decisions in relation to the restructuring of the cost-sharing arrangements which operate in the public hospital sector.  To fund some small part of the major initiative I have outlined the charge for in-patient services was increased to £20 per day, up to a maximum of £200 in any 12 month period.</P>
    <P>In addition to the changes in the in-patient charge, the current charge of £10 per episode of treatment for out-patient services was replaced by a charge of £6 per out-patient visit with a limit of £42 in any 12 month period to apply to this charge.</P>
    <P>I am anxious that the payment of this charge should not lead to hardship for either the individual or the family.  There will undoubtedly be a small number of cases in which members of the same family have occasion to avail of out-patient services on numerous occasions within the same year.  I has asked the chief executive officers of health boards to be particularly conscious of such circumstances in exercising their discretion. I have suggested that, as a general guideline, the combined charges for any one family should not exceed £60 in any 12 month period.  In the case of both the in-patient and out-patient charges, the <Col N="722" /> revised arrangements have taken effect from 1 March 1993.</P>
    <P>Exemptions will apply to particular groups, including medical card holders, women receiving treatment in respect of motherhood and children under six weeks of age, children referred from child health examinations, children receiving treatment in respect of certain long term conditions and persons suffering from infectious diseases.</P>
    <P>The House was shocked and horrified by the relevations earlier this week of the brutal ill-treatment and abuse of a young women in County Kilkenny over a 16 year period.  Everyone who watched the television interview with the unfortunate victim must have been deeply moved by her heartrending account of the terrifying suffering she endured.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, I have directed the South Eastern Health Board to carry out an immediate investigation of the circumstances of this tragic case in so far as the health services are concerned and to report back to me as a matter of urgency.  I am particularly anxious that this investigation should establish whether the girl's plight could have been brought to light earlier so that appropriate action could have been taken to protect her.  An investigation team is being appointed by the South Eastern Health Board in response to my direction. This will be headed by Catherine McGuinness SC.</P>
    <P>I am concerned to ensure that every measure possible is taken to prevent a recurrence of what happened in the case. Towards this end, I will be discussing the matter with the chief executive officers of the eight health boards when I meet them this week and later next week.  In particular I will be stressing the necessity to ensure that satisfactory arrangements are in place in their areas for the identification, investigation and management of child abuse cases and child care services generally.</P>
    <P>In the light of these consultations and the results of the investigation being carried out by the South Eastern Health Board, I shall be reporting to the Government at an early date with recommendations <Col N="723" /> for the introduction of whatever new measures are deemed necessary to improve existing services and procedures for dealing with child abuse.</P>
    <P>We will face many challenges in various aspects of economic and social policy in 1993.  Strict control of the public finances and prudent management of the economy will continue to form key elements of the Government's approach to public policy.  We in the health services have a special part to play in ensuring the success of overall Government policy to ensure that the large proportion of national resources, one fifth which is spent on health services is used wisely and effectively.  Our primary task remains to provide the best possible standard of service for those who depend on the treatment and care provided by the health services.</P>
    <P>In framing the 1993 Estimate the Government has made every effort to ensure that both these objectives are met in 1993 and that the current high standard of service is not only maintained but where necessary enhanced and developed.  The special provisions made in the budget for the health services are concrete evidence of the Government's commitment to the health services and I look forward to a year in which, working together, we will continue to provide services of the highest standard responsive to the needs of all who depend on our health services.</P>

      <P>Tá sé deacair a thuiscint go bhfuil fear nua sa phost.  This Government, with the largest majority in the history of the State, now shows all the signs of becoming one of the shortest administrations in the history of the State.  Within two months of coming to office this Government already shows all the signs of confusion, indecision, internal division, backbench dissent and political decay normally seen only in the dying days of the life of a Government. Before the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, Deputy Burton, leaves the House I should like to <Col N="724" /> say that I hope she can return before I conclude my speech because there are a few points I wish to make regarding the position of the poor in Irish society.</P>

      <P>Never has a Government which promised so much turned out to be such a disappointment. We were promised change but nobody believed it would be change for the worse.  Those who, during the election campaign, were promoted as political Messiahs have already shown that they have feet of clay.  The first 100 days of any government in office anywhere in the world always receives close scrutiny because this period is normally regarded as establishing the brand or stamp of a government.  We are now more than 50 days into the life of this Government and the sense of public disappointment and letdown has been palpable. Most people expected a flurry of announcements, policy initiatives and new legislation during the early days of the Government.  Instead we have had from this Fianna Fáil-Labour Government a humiliating U-turn on devaluation, an inept and botched attempt to save the Digital jobs, a budget that has disappointed virtually everybody, a decision to sell the remaining public shareholding in Greencore and a legislative cupboard that is virtually bare.</P>
      <P>The sense of public disappointment has been compounded by the apparent preoccupation of Members of the Government and, unfortunately, Labour Ministers, with appointing extra advisers and staff drawn, in the case of Labour, from party supporters or family circles. What is even worse is that all of this is adding to the public cynicism and disillusionment with politics which was at such a high level anyway and which contributed to worryingly low turn-outs at recent elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The potential annual cost of the special advisers, assistants and programme managers for Ministers and Ministers of State &mdash; I am not identifying solely the Labour Party element, because this applies right <Col N="725" /> across the board to the Government as a whole &mdash; may amount to more than £2.25 million, according to information supplied to my colleague, Deputy Gilmore, in written replies to Dáil questions.  The potential cost to the taxpayer of that exercise, should the Government last its full term, is more than £10 million.  Ministers and Ministers of State are, of course, entitled to the support necessary to enable them to do their job but the appointment of special advisers and assistants has now got out of hand.  Some control will have to be introduced.</P>
    <P>According to the replies received from the Minister for Finance each Member of the Government is allowed to appoint a special adviser at a maximum salary of £40,500 per year and a personal assistant at a rate of up to £21,500 per year.  If those appointed are paid at the full rate &mdash; and it is expected that most will be at or close to it &mdash; the total cost of the 15 advisers and special assistants will be £607,500 and £344,000 respectively.  Each Minister will also have a programme manager, also at a rate of up to £40,500, accounting for another potential £607,500.  In addition each of the 15 Ministers of State are entitled to a special adviser at a rate of up to £32,500 and a personal assistant at the rate of £18,500, accounting for another £757,500.  The total potential cost, therefore, in respect of Ministers and Ministers of State is £2,316,500.  It should be noted that this amount does not include the cost of personal secretaries or of those employed in the constituency or private offices of each Member and Minister of State which, in some cases can be as many as six, nor does it include the cost of paying two drivers for each Minister of State, but even without these it is an unacceptably high cost.</P>
    <P>We have been told repeatedly by Ministers from both parties in Government that times are extremely difficult and that there will have to be cutacks but there seems to be no difficulty in finding public money to employ extra advisers and managers. Ministers will now have to accept that these appointments have got out of <Col N="726" /> hand, and they must make greater use of Civil Service staff.</P>
    <P>The budget presented an opportunity for the Labour Party to recover some ground and to show those who had voted for it that it was going to have a real influence on economic issues.  When the Programme for Government was published we acknowledged that the Labour influence was evident in regard to its commitments on the liberal agenda but that the econmic sections reflected Fianna Fáil conservative thinking.  Now, again, Fianna Fáil conservative thinking on economics has determined the shape and format of the budget.  Indeed, any Labour influence is hard to detect.</P>
    <P>Judged against the major economic issues facing the country &mdash; mass unemployment, widespread poverty for those on social welfare and low pay, and privilege and inequity in the tax system &mdash; this budget has to be considered a total disappointment.  That is not just our judgment.  The headlines in the newspapers on the day following the budget give a flavour of the responses: &ldquo;Employers Unions join in Criticising Income Levy&rdquo;; &ldquo;Concern over Health Increases&rdquo;; &ldquo;Worst in Years says ICMSA&rdquo;; &ldquo;Hotels Group Voices Dismay at VAT&rdquo;; &ldquo;Tourism Federation sees Increased Costs&rdquo; and so on.  The list is endless.</P>
    <P>One of the most objectionable features of the budget has been the decision to apply the 1 per cent levy to many low and middle income earners.  The sum of £9,000 is below the average industrial wage so that many ordinary workers who are already substantially overtaxed will have to cough up more.  I doubt that the 1 per cent levy will cause much concern to the self-employed or to farmers or professionals who are able to massage their income down to artifically low levels for the income tax man but it is an unacceptable additional burden for many in the PAYE sector.  It will also create another poverty trap and encourage low pay. A person earning just below the weekly threshold of £173 will find it a virtually valueless exercise to apply for an increase.  They will not only have to pay <Col N="727" /> tax on the increase but if it takes them over the threshold they will have to pay the 1 per cent levey on all of their income whereas before they would have been exempt.  This will even be the case if they receive the 3 per cent increase due to most workers under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> agreement this year.  The Minister claims that the increase in the general exemption levels will remove 13,500 lower paid from the tax net but the increase in exemption level is so small &mdash; 2.8 per cent &mdash; that even if they receive wage increases in line with inflation, workers would be back in the tax net within a matter of months.</P>
    <P>Each year we go through the ritual of shuffling the rates a little here, changing the bands a little there and so on but that is not tax reform.  This has been done year in, year out, yet the average tax paid by a PAYE worker in the period between 1989 and 1991 increased by 14 per cent compared with an increase of 1.6 per cent for the self employed while the average tax paid by farmers decreased by a staggering 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear the Taoiseach's remarks the other day in regard to tax and the discovery he has now made that reducing tax rates does not create jobs.  I can recall over the last number of years in this House listening to the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach, both in his role as Taoiseach and as Minister for Industry and Commerce, supporting proposals to reduce the top tax rate bands on income on the basis that this would provide an incentive to create jobs and an incentive to work.  The other day the Taoiseach castigated the Progressive Democrats for this philosophy and said this was never his philosophy.  However, he is on the record of this House as claiming it was his philosophy.  Over the past number of years he introduced and supported budgets based on that philosophy.</P>
    <P>I appreciate very much that Fianna Fáil is the great chameleon of Irish politics and can adjust itself very quickly and easily to the environment in which it finds itself, but I was fascinated by another statement the Taoiseach made in his <Col N="728" /> speech.  The Labour Party may be interested in this statement because not too long ago when it was on this side of the House it criticised Fianna Fáil for its Thatcherite policies and the implementation of those policies.  The Taoiseach said, and I quote:</P>
    <P>Neither my party nor our partners in Government have ever subscribed to the view that it is sufficient to keep the economic fundamentals right and to leave the rest, and especially job creation, entirely to the market.</P>
    <P>If that is the new found philosophy of Fianna Fáil I applaud it.  I know that when the Labour Party was on this side of the House it was its philosophy, and I hope it is still its philosophy.  If that is the effect the Labour Party has had on Fianna Fáil, I applaud it.</P>
    <P>I ask the Labour Party in the role it now has of riding shotgun on Fianna Fáil that it will seek to ensure that the policies pursued reflect the philosophical statement made by the Taoiseach the other day and that it is not just presented as cotton wool to reassure the Labour Party element in Government, while at the same time the Government introduces budgets which are, by and large, Fianna Fáil budgets and which, by and large, pursue the philosophy that it is only necessary to get the fundamentals right and that the market will do the rest.  That is the fundamental theory underlying this budget.  I will deal with other aspects of the budget later.  As I said, the Labour Party needs to be very careful with regard to the statements being made for public consumption and the actual underlying philosophy which exists when decisions are made, particularly decisions in relation to the budget and social welfare issues.</P>
    <P>The social welfare increases are barely in line with inflation.  This would be fine if the basic social welfare rates were adequate, but this is clearly not the case. Indeed, I would draw the attention of the House to another statement made by the Taoiseach and I quote:</P>
    <P>The social welfare measures in the <Col N="729" /> budget are well targeted, and they continue the practice established since the 1989 budget, of doing more than is strictly required for the least well off in our society.</P>
    <P>What does he mean by &ldquo;doing more than is strictly required?&rdquo; What does the term &ldquo;strictly required&rdquo; mean so far as Fianna Fáil and the Taoiseach are concerned? Where are the limits that he sees, or is he denying already what he said in the earlier statement to which I referred, that things should not be left solely to the market and that, in particular, the poor and unemployed should not be left to the market?</P>
    <P>As I said, it would be fine if the social welfare rates were adequate but this is clearly not the case.  In addition, the payment of the paltry increases has again been put off until the end of July, a practice which was roundly condemned by the Labour Party last year.  It is sometimes forgotten that up until the early eighties the increases were paid from April and that they have been pushed back further and further each year.  On the other hand, the increases in VAT have come into effect already; in other words, those on social welfare have to pay now for the increased cost of food and clothing but have to wait for five months for their extra few bob.</P>
    <P>Of course, the budget represents only part of the picture.  Many of the decisions impacting on the economic wellbeing of people have been taken outside of the budget.  The increases in hospital charges announced by the Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, on the eve of the budget have received considerable public attention and criticism, especially in view of the strong opposition to those charges by Deputy Howlin and his colleagues when they were on this side of the House.  I should like to quote from a statement made by Deputy Howlin on behalf of the Labour Party in 1987 when he moved a motion in this House which proposed that the health services regulations should be annulled.  He said:</P>
    <P>Not content with bringing about a situation which threatens to produce <Col N="730" /> chaos in the service the Government propose also to charge all but the very poorest members of our community for access to a service which has for many years been free at the point of delivery.  The three regulations to which this motion refers were published on 14 April last.  They are the concrete expression of decisions taken and announced by the Minister for Finance in the budget.  When they are put together they add up to an outright and vicious attack on a fundamental principle.  That principle has underpinned the health services for a generation. It has provided a basic bottom line guarantee to those who are ill or infirm, to the parents of small children, to the aged and to those who sought the assistance and support of the State in times of great distress.  It is the principle that health care should be free at the point of delivery for those in need.</P>
    <P>On the eve of the budget, the Minister for Health, a member of the Labour Party, introduced increased charges for hospital services.</P>
    <P>I make these criticisms not because I bear the Government any ill will.  In particular, I do not bear the Labour Party any ill will.  The Labour Party is part of a Coalition.  It is not a Coalition I would have joined.  I believed the Labour Party was mistaken in joining this Coalition.  If the Labour Party does not watch itself I believe it will be out of Government very soon because there is a ground swell of concern outside the House among those who supported the Labour Party during the election.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I wish to bring one other matter to the attention of the House.  I am referring to the decision announced by another Labour Party Minister on the eve of the budget which received virtually no public attention, that is, the scrapping of the community employment development programme, which was an enhancement of the SES scheme.  This decision effectively goes against the decision of the social partners with regard to the 12 area based programmes <Col N="731" /> seeking to deal with the long term unemployed.</P>
    <P>The other point I wanted to make &mdash; I do not have enough time to deal with it now &mdash; is that last week the Minister for Social Welfare gave me a commitment in the House that the restrictions on the use of supplement by community welfare officers in terms of giving help to people with ESB bills was reversed.  I understood that is what the Minister said in the House.  Community welfare officers have informed me that they cannot breach the instructions in the letters which were issued, 14/92 and 18/92, unless they receive a further letter from the Minister specifically instructing them that those two circulars no longer apply.  I am appealing to the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, to ensure that a letter goes out to the community welfare officers informing them that circulars 1492 and 1892 have been withdrawn or else to tell us honestly that they have not been withdrawn.  There are people depending on community welfare officers to keep lighting and heating in their houses.  If the community welfare officers are not able to help them, they should know exactly who to blame.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Ms Burton) Joan Burton">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to address the question of Labour's input into this budget.  We had to accept and work within the basic framework that the Single Market imposed on VAT and DIRT tax revenues.  Within that framework we sought and obtained a dramatic switch in policy for the express purpose of job creation.  The injection of funds into the public capital programme was a central theme of our election programme and we have delivered on the first phase of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The specific allocation to boost the public housing programme adds a vital social element, again reflecting our election theme of introducing justice into economics.  I find it amazing that Deputies from other left parties can so smugly dismiss this.  It was part of their programme too, and to dismiss the allocation <Col N="732" /> of large-scale budget funds to capital investment with a social content as of no relevance to jobs is to denigrate the very same programme they also presented to the electorate.</P>
    <P>On the social expenditure side labour put a lot of emphasis on child benefit as an instrument to overcome family poverty. It is a costly instrument but is money &mdash; paid directly in most cases to mothers &mdash; which is well spent.  This year's 27 per cent improvement seems to have passed unnoticed as a Labour input, but it will be a valuable boost to many families in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>Some measures such as the income levy are obviously unpalatable and some Opposition Deputies are milking it for all it is worth, oblivious to their own oft repeated demands for tough measures that could not be shirked.  I would like to hear what this toughness really means from those who put all their emphasis in Government on tax reform that concentrated solely on reducing rates at the top bands.</P>
    <P>I keep hearing of the Culliton report and the tax reform urged in it, quite rightly, as an essential ingredient of industrial growth.  I am sure Mr. Culliton and his colleagues are thrilled by the universal approval of their plans.  I would be more impressed if that approval was honestly rooted.</P>
    <P>Do the Fine Gael and Progressive Democrat parties genuinely stand for the changes in the structure of taxation sought in the report?  I certainly have read many of their mentors in various newspapers cast aspersions on the various built-in tax breaks for health costs, educational covenants, mortgage interest &mdash; to mention only some of the more notorious &mdash; that together add up to a mighty sum that puts a definite serious barrier in the way of a full-blooded restructuring of direct taxation.</P>
    <P>If there is all party agreement that Culliton is the way forward on industrial policy, then we need an equivalent consensus on the associated tax reforms.  An honest approach is to recognise that many, perhaps all, of the individual measures would be very unpalatable <Col N="733" /> indeed and would attract far less universal approval than has been suggested. There is room for honest debate.</P>
    <P>I am charged by this Government with promoting an integrated tax and welfare code and I welcome the challenge this offers to achieve fundamental reforms.  I know the search for such an integrated code has become as elusive as the search for the Holy Grail.  Neither the Commission on Taxation nor the Commission on Social Welfare found it possible to propose a way to achieve this aim.  I propose to seek the advice of experts in this area and will be announcing shortly the establishment of a working party on the integration of tax and social welfare codes.</P>
    <P>I want to make special reference to the needs of disadvantaged areas.  While the overall level of unemployment is at 20 per cent, this figure masks a much higher level that prevails in many communities. Any policy to overcome the jobs crisis must also specifically address the particular needs of these communities.</P>
    <P>The proposed county enterprise boards and the programmes to be funded under the EC Structural Funds must be part of such a targeted policy to empower communities to address local and community unemployment.  The county enterprise partnership boards have enormous potential in this area as they represent a broadly-based, integrated approach to local development.  They could act as the mechanism through which the needs of disadvantaged areas could be addressed.</P>
    <P>Given the several different objectives of boards, they will need clear objectives and responsibilities for targeting the disadvantaged if they are to have any real impact on poverty.  This will not happen automatically.  Specific programmes for the long term unemployed and the most disadvantaged will be necessary.  Otherwise, there may be a tendency to rely on &ldquo;trickle-down&rdquo; effects or to focus on creating enterprise outside disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>I want the partnership boards to have four responsibilities, so that they have a focus on social need and long term <Col N="734" /> unemployment.  These are: to target the long term unemployed and those at risk of becoming long term unemployed, including women, single parents and minority groups; to identify the most disadvantaged communities in their area; to develop area-based responses in these communities; and to &ldquo;exclusion-proof&rdquo; all other actions they take, by which I mean that they examine all their actions from the point of view of their effects on poverty.</P>
    <P>If the boards are to be successful in addressing the needs of the long term unemployed and other disadvantaged groups, it is vital that the interests of those groups are represented at board levels.</P>
    <P>I believe the same philosophy should govern the way we invest the European Structural and Cohesion Funds.  I share the view of the Combat Poverty Agency that all of the mainstream measures in the plan should be subject to this &ldquo;exclusion-proof&rdquo; examination so as to maximise the impact of the spending on poverty.  As part and parcel of this approach to disadvantage, there has been a substantial increase in the Department's support for voluntary and community activity in this year's budget.</P>
    <P>The primary role of the Department of Social Welfare is conventionally regarded as one of income maintenance. What is important, as far as I am concerned, is the wellbeing of people and facilitating communities to deal with the problems which are facing them.  The Department has a number of programmes which are designed to encourage people in receipt of welfare payments to make the transition to employment or self-employment and also to foster personal and community development in disadvantaged areas as a precursor to social and economic development.  The Department has allocated £600,000 for grants to locally-based women's groups and an extra £150,000 for three specific projects under the European NOW programme. This total of £750,000 goes a long way towards meeting the recommendation in the recent report of the Commission on the Status of Women that <Col N="735" /> this allocation be increased to £1 million. In addition, we have allocated £1.75 million for the community development programme.</P>
    <P>The cycle of disadvantage and dependence on the social welfare system can only be broken by an intervention which seeks to mobilise the energies of disadvantaged people themselves, particularly women, and empower them to change their situation.  Far from being superfluous or marginal to the real world of work and the economy, support for voluntary and community self-help activity is vital.</P>
    <P>I would now like to say a few words about the reviews of the social welfare measures introduced last year.  There is no doubt that some of the measures in question had certain harsh effects and these have been radically changed.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare Bill will include provision to enable an increased disregard of earnings from part time employment when claiming unemployment assistance.  The longterm unemployed will no longer be excluded from disability benefit when they fall sick. In addition, there are substantial adjustments being made to last year's restrictions on eligibility for dental and optical benefit.</P>
    <P>I want to say a few words about the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which has been the subject of controversy.  The scheme has experienced a rapid increase in expenditure and in take-up.  Expenditure was £44.8 million in 1989 and £113.6 million is provided this year.  This is a 14 per cent increase over last year and is one of the largest increases in the whole budget and reflect Labour's commitment to the scheme.</P>
    <P>Despite the substantial increase in expenditure, there are aspects to the scheme which are frequently criticised.  These are perceptions of secrecy surrounding the scheme; perceived lack of uniformity and consistency; the quality of the service to clients; and the absence of adequate information on how the <Col N="736" /> scheme is being used.  Any Deputy who deals with families using the scheme will be familiar with all these criticisms.</P>
    <P>A complete review of the scheme is currently underway and, in particular, I am examining the exceptional needs payments for fuel costs.  Exceptional needs payments are not not the best way of dealing on a regular basis with periodic household bills.  I believe we need to find new ways of dealing with the problems of families with chronic on going problems of money management.</P>
    <P>There will always be a need for a scheme of last resort which will cater for any gap which arises in the main-line social welfare schemes, meet special ongoing needs and cater for the unexpected. The supplementary welfare allowance scheme has many strengths, which must be retained.  It is local, immediate, flexible and personal.  It is the scheme which responds most directly to poverty.  Our aim is to develop its strengths and eliminate its weaknesses.</P>
    <P>In social welfare, in housing construction, in health, in aid to the Third World, in job creation through the Capital Programme, Labour has put its stamp on this budget.</P>
    <P>I worked on the Irish development programme in Africa for three years in the past decade.  I was horrified at the recent death of Valerie Place.  Regardless of our own preoccupations &mdash; and we have every reason to have preoccupations with real poverty and real unemployment in our society &mdash; we cannot afford to lose touch with a broader reality.  I take great pride in the positive change of policy the Tánaiste has initiated in the allocation of greatly increased resources for the developing world &mdash; very definitely another Labour stamp on this budget. This is something that Deputies of the left might duly recognise.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In terms of managing the economy and the affairs of the nation our first responsibility is to manage the affairs of this House.  From that point of view the Labour Party has insisted on an ethics Bill.  It is absolutely essential that every elected Member of Parliament declares <Col N="739" /> his or her relevant interests.  We have been highly negligent in relation to all appointments in this House.  We have never established proper procedures, proper criteria or an appointments commission in relation to anybody who has been appointed here.  New Deputies coming in are allowed, in an informal way, to appoint their own secretaries. There is no consideration of those who have been here before.  The informal agreement whereby the last in is the first out was ignored with the result that we have had the secretaries here on strike already.  It was an absolute disgrace that neither Fianna Fáil nor Fine Gael were prepared to take on secretaries on the basis of last in, first out.  We saw exactly the same thing take place in relation to some of the smaller parties, where two Members of the Democratic Left lost their seats but the incoming Member &mdash; a woman, might I say &mdash; was not prepared to take either of the secretaries on.  That is unacceptable procedure.</P>

      <P>In this budget we have increased the public capital programme by £500 million and that is at the core of what the Labour Party has promised it would do at an early stage.  As a result there is a downside and there must be sacrifices, which I do not like.  The sacrifices include the 1 per cent levy, the hospital charges and the sale of certain property.  I want to assure the House that the Labour Party will ensure that the State assets in which we have an interest, whether it is a majority or a minority interest, will not go outside this country to multinationals who do not have the interests of this country at heart.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason we are ensuring there is a proper public capital programme is because it is necessary.  We had a number of years during which scarcely a house <Col N="742" /> was built by the local authorities.  Now 3,500 houses will be started this year alone.  This will help to relieve the misery which is caused when people have to live in overcrowded conditions, in old, unrefurbished flats and who end up homeless on the streets.  If young people are living in overcrowded accommodation and if the quality of their lives is bad, they will move out.  That results in greater numbers of young people roaming the streets.  We must ensure that the young and old, as well as growing families, have suitable accommodation and that the waiting lists of people in inadequate accommodation, or without accommodation are eliminated as soon as possible.  That is an essential provision in this budget and the Labour Party have stood by our manifesto promises on that issue.</P>
    <P>The increase in child benefit is another important issue.  It concerns those who are the most vulnerable in our society. We will ensure that the payments go directly to the mother and that it is an adequate amount which can be properly utilised for the benefit of the family.</P>
    <P>For the first time there is now an attempt to deal with the problem of the long waiting lists for hospitals.  These made it impossible for certain people to undergo major operations without having to wait months or even years.  The money which will be made available to help reduce these waiting lists is essential, particularly in this year of the elderly, because the elderly often require hip replacements and other forms of surgery which can improve the quality of life of people in their later years.</P>
    <P>To address my specific area of education, I was delighted to hear the Minister announce yesterday that the full terms of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> will be adhered to in this regard.  The pupil-teacher ratio will be reduced to 19 : 1 which will result in several hundred new jobs in the teaching profession.  Emphasis will be placed on disadvantaged children who will avail of the services of more remedial teachers, who are badly needed.  There will be a further 97 career guidance teachers <Col N="743" /> coming into the system who are also badly needed, as teachers had been let go in the past due to cutbacks.  Vice-principal posts will be filled from within the quota which will create further jobs and honour the terms of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>Obviously there are down sides to this budget; sacrifices will have to be made.</P>

      <P>I welcome Deputy Costello's comments in relation to the appointments of advisers and the need for more transparency.  This has certainly become very obvious given the scale and cost of the appointments made recently. I seriously question whether the appointment of such advisers with the task of liaising between Government Departments is, in fact, an effective mechanism. I am very concerned about the undermining of the Civil Service to which, I believe, this could lead.</P>
      <P>I support Deputy De Rossa's request to the Minister of State in relation to the withdrawl of the circulars because I take her point that the scheme is fraught with difficulties.  However, the reality is that despite the £11 million increase, there are women in families today who will suffer because the discretion is no longer available to the social welfare officers who implement these rules.  I agree that with the review under way, the circulars should be withdrawn until the results of that review are published.</P>

      <P>Minister of State Burton described this budget as a dramatic switch in policy.  I do not agree with her.  In fact, the Tánaiste and, I believe, the Minister for Finance, said it was not a radical budget.  Why was it not a radical budget when, in fact, it was needed, given our present rate of unemployment, and the desperate need to tackle job creation?  This is what was required. Those who sought a change and who thought they had voted for change must be very disappointed with this budget.</P>
      <P>I wish to comment on the new income levy.  I would describe this as crude and unfair.  The blanket application of the levy and the new probate tax, without reference to family size, will result in additional hardship.  I wish to highlight some examples where families will be less well off in 1993 as a result of this.  A single person with a salary of £12,000 per annum and a mortgage of £25,000 will suffer a decrease since September 1992 of £49 per month.  A married person on a salary of £15,000 per annum with a mortgage of £25,000 will suffer a decrease from September 1992 of £45 per month. We hear much about the mortgage relief that will be given but did I actually hear Minister of State Burton describe mortgage interest relief as &ldquo;notorious&rdquo; in a phrase she used concerning the various reliefs available to people?  I certainly heard the words &ldquo;notorious&rdquo; and &ldquo;mortgage interest relief&rdquo; mentioned in the same sentence.  I would like her to clarify that.  Mortgage interest relief is desperately needed by families, given the increase in interest rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The broad brush approach to taxation contained in the budget is particularly unfair to thousands of families whose disposable <Col N="745" /> income is already stretched to the limit.  I am disappointed that the Minister has shown such little imagination at a time when there was great hope and a willingness by those who can afford to make some sacrifice which might contribute to longer term prosperity.  We have seen this in the United States where President Clinton has appealed to people to make sacrifices, given the difficult circumstances there.  I believe Irish people are willing to make those sacrifices if they believe that the strategies being put in place will lead to improvement.  Unfortunately, I do not believe that people have such faith in this budget.  The mood of people to make sacrifices was not tapped appropriately in this budget.</P>
    <P>The income levy and the increase in indirect taxation will disproportionately affect families, especially those on lower or middle incomes.  The indirect taxes will quickly eat into the small increases in social welfare payments, which do not come into force until July, while the VAT increases apply immediately.  A more imaginative approach in relation to much needed tax reform to encourage investment in job creation and to ensure that those who could least afford to pay were protected would have been an impressive beginning to this new Government's sojourn in office.  The opportunity has been lost and the confidence of the electorate, those struggling to make ends met on low incomes and those who are dependent on the social welfare system, has been badly shaken.  The income levy perpetuates the budgetary tradition in Ireland of creating traps, anomalies and injustices within our tax system.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase in child benefit but I would point out that it is several years since there has been such an increase and that we have the second lowest child benefit rate in Europe.  It represents a 27 per cent increase, which is valuable, but why is there no budgetary provision, as recommended in the report of the Commission for the Status of Women for child care provision? Would it have taken more courage to target finance to disadvantaged areas and begin to develop a Government <Col N="746" /> policy on child care, which is badly needed and which we have not yet seen? In terms of redistribution, that type of measure would have been extremely important and would begin to deal with some of the poverty traps experienced by people who are dependent on social welfare.</P>
    <P>The levy is particularly galling for people who have been funding other levies, for health and for youth, without ever having an indication of where the levies were going or whether they were having the intended effect.  People are irritated by what they consider to be a lazy solution &mdash; or not even a solution &mdash; and they are not confident that the levy will have a special impact on job creation. Perhaps the Minister would consider reporting to the Oireachtas on the levies that have been in place, to reassure taxpayers that this new tax is based on sound experience and achievement.</P>
    <P>I welcome the extension of the business expansion scheme but it is my view that perhaps the time has come to extend the categories of businesses eligible under the scheme and include additional sectors. There is much talk about the cap on the scheme but consideration should be given to a widening of the categories eligible.  There are risks associated with most businesses but it is vital to encourage the entrepreneurial spirit in people working and skilled in different areas and it may be that the categories eligible have been unnecessarily limited.</P>
    <P>The budget provides an amount of £25 million for the county enterprise partnership boards.  That figure represents less than £1 million of State funding for each board.  I wonder what level of impact the Minister feels could be made by that amount of money.  I realise that the Minister has other investment intentions as well but it is my experience that there is a great deal of cynicism as to whether the boards will be effective. People are concerned that the boards will be merely another layer of bureaucracy. I hope that that does not prove to be the case but it is my opinion that innovative action will be needed to ensure that the target of job creation is achieved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="747" /> I am desperately disappointed that not a single penny has been allocated to cover the implementation of the provisions of the Child Care Act.  The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> contained a commitment that that would be done through a seven-year period.  Provision for this should have been made in the budget but it was not.  Particularly in this week, when it has been brought to our attention just how vulnerable children can be within the family and how difficult it can be for them to escape violence, we should recognise it is critical that more than 17 of the 74 sections of the Child Care Act be implemented.  When the Dáil passed that legislation it would not have intended that by this stage only 17 sections of the legislation would be implemented.  I suggest that some aspects of the Child Care Act be implemented even at a pilot level to develop local community projects.</P>
    <P>In relation to the increase in the carer's allowance, I should like to ask the Minister to review the system urgently and to commit himself to making sure that all carers are acknowledged for their invaluable work and have access to some remuneration.  While I welcome the increase in the allowance, I also recognise that the percentage of carers receiving it remains tiny.</P>
    <P>Equally, the renewal of the tiny grant to the family mediation service is a far cry from funding that service on a nationwide basis so that it can deliver its much-needed assistance.</P>
    <P>The budget has no provision for the implementation of any of the proposals contained in the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women.  It must have been self-evident that implementation of the commission's proposals would involve some costs in the current year.  I hope the Cabinet do not intend to long-finger work in that area because of a lack of budgetary provision.</P>
    <P>I welcome some of the recommendations mentioned by the Minister for Health this morning.  I regret, however, that paediatric services are not included in the list of priority services for <Col N="748" /> reducing waiting lists.  Many families are experiencing difficulties in having very basic operations &mdash; in particular, ear, nose and throat operations &mdash; carried out on their children.  The area of paediatrics should have been given priority.  I welcome the statement made by the Minister this morning that if at all possible the nursing homes legislation will be implemented from 1 May.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude by saying that many hard-pressed middle income families will bear the brunt of the budget.  The budget will do little for job creation.  The VAT increases, which have come into play immediately, will affect the very families that we are trying to protect from further poverty.  It is unfortunate that children's clothing and footwear will, because of problems relating to sizes, be affected by the VAT increase.  It will be an extra blow coming now, as it does, with First Communions and Confirmations due in the next few weeks.  Studies have shown that families on social welfare have very little discretionary income available to spend on clothes and other such items. The Minister should determine whether anything can be done to ensure that the VAT increases do not apply to children's clothing and footwear.  I welcome the support for community development and women's groups.  That support is very valuable, gives great encouragement and could lead to job creation.  It is my hope that the links between those groups and training will be further explored and developed in the coming year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the limited increase in support for those in receipt of social welfare payments.  It should be pointed out, however, that a Government that has to rely on helping out those on social welfare &mdash; and their number is increasing &mdash; is in a serious state.  The biggest single problem facing Ireland is unemployment; more than 300,000 sign for the dole each week.  Of course, the figure of 300,000 does not take into account all those on special training schemes or those graduates who because of their family's income are not eligible to draw social welfare payments.  Those <Col N="749" /> graduates are in a worse position than graduates who are eligible for dole payments in that they cannot get help in any way because they come from reasonably well-off families.  Their parents make great sacrifices to give their children the opportunity of a third level education so that they might enjoy good jobs on this island.  This budget imposes a 1 per cent levy on the income earned by those families; they have also had their PRSI contributions increased and have to pay higher telephone bills and increased clothing costs.  It is only a few months since we were promised, especially by the Labour Party, that there would be a change for the better.</P>
      <P>In my own constituency of Cavan-Monaghan those involved in the concrete business &mdash; those who were supposed to be going into a period of boom, according to Minister Ahern, with the new housing programme to be put in place &mdash; suddenly find themselves in a period of gloom. They were promised that there would be more building work available but the Minister has increased the VAT on concrete products from 10 per cent to 21 per cent, and that is done in an area that already has a serious black market problem. Those who are involved in the legitimate end, the production of readymix and concrete brick, will be forced out of business &mdash; not because of our EC colleagues but directly as a result of decisions taken by our own Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an air of desperation in the clothing industry.  The Government has a complete lack of response to the currency problem.  Members of the Government were more interested in finding themselves a position in Government than they were in the decline in exports or the loss of jobs in the clothing industry.  What does the budget have to offer in that regard?  We had been promised that this would be a budget for jobs.  Possibly it was a budget for jobs for the brothers, sisters and aunts of the Ministers but it was not a budget for jobs for those in the clothing industry.  People in the clothing business now have to pay 21 per cent VAT.  Someone who imports clothing or other goods from Northern Ireland or <Col N="750" /> other EC countries does not have to pay VAT at the point of entry, that person has to pay the VAT only when the goods are sold.  However, someone who chooses to buy from an Irish manufacturer &mdash; which manufacturer is, of course, providing jobs &mdash; has to pay the VAT within a few weeks.  When one considers the amount of capital involved and the exorbitant interest rates that have to be paid, again as a direct result of the mishandling of the currency crisis, one can easily recognise the position of our manufacturers as against their European and Far Eastern competitors.  On that note, I welcome the decrease in interest rates announced by the Central Bank in the past 24 hours.  It is important for the Government to take a strong line in this regard and maintain decreases in interest rates to improve job prospects.</P>
    <P>The budget was supposed to improve the health service, and we welcome the moneys allocated to help the long term problems in the area.  However, the real budget for the health service was revealed the day before the Minister introduced his budget in the House when it was announced that the cost of attending an out-patients' department would increase and that those in hospitals would have to pay £20 per day or £200 for ten days.</P>
    <P>Insurance is one of the hidden costs of employment.  The Minister made sure that these costs would increase further by introducing extra levies.  There are also increased taxes on motorists.  We had all hoped that the Government, with its 101 seats, could have made tough decisions. However, many tough decisions were announced in the days preceding the budget so that when the budget was introduced people would think it was quite an easy one, not half as bad as they had expected.</P>
    <P>We had hoped to see people put back to work by increasing our output, but the Government is more interested in jobs for itself than in creating them for the unemployed.  I welcome the improvements in relation to the capital acquisitions tax because it will ease the burden on the transfer of land, especially from <Col N="751" /> father to son, or daughter, as the case may be.  However, the imposition of a 2 per cent probate tax means that if a breadwinner dies at an early age as the result of an accident or disease, those who inherit the property will not only have to cope with sudden death but also with this penal tax at a time when they can least afford it.</P>
    <P>We had hoped for a budget which would give our people an opportunity of getting back to work, but this budget will prove the opposite.  This is a sad situation for everyone.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The budget has been framed against a difficult and uncertain international economic background. Recent indicators confirm that weakness in the international economy persisted throughout 1992.  Output in the OECD area increased last year by only 1.5 per cent.  In the EC growth slowed to around 1 per cent, from 1.5 per cent growth in 1991.</P>
      <P>The Irish economy, by contrast, performed well in many respects last year despite the unfavourable European and international environment.  With Irish Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth of about 3 per cent our national output growth was well above the EC and OECD averages for last year.</P>
      <P>While high interest rates dampened down investment growth there was strong growth in personal spending and manufacturing output.  The numbers at work remained broadly stable which is not the case in many other countries.  Although this compared well with other countries' employment achievements, it fell far short of the job requirements generated by the strong growth in the Irish labour force and the already unacceptable level of unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of other developments <Col N="752" /> worth mentioning.  Inflation was kept down to a 3 per cent level last year. The public finances were kept under control, with the debt-to-GDP ratio declining again last year.  In short, we more than satisfied the Maastricht criteria. Unfortunately, the international economy is likely to continue to grow at a slow rate this year.  For our small open economy this makes it all the more difficult to capture increasing shares of foreign markets.</P>
    <P>In addition, exchange rate developments continue to impact on Ireland's competitiveness despite the recent adjustment of the Irish pound within the Exchange Rate Mechanism.  The Minister for Finance pointed out in his budget speech that our exchange rate policy will continue to focus on maintaining the existing bilateral exchange rates within the narrow band of the Exchange Rate Mechanism.  This certainly offers the best prospect for long term economic growth within a stable low inflation environment. Indeed, the whole strategy of the budget in seeking to bring down interest rates but proved successful after only two weeks since it was introduced.  Interest rates are falling and will continue to fall.</P>
    <P>The 1993 Estimates were published recently.  The Estimate for my Department at £111 million shows an increase of 9 per cent on the 1992 outturn.  This reflects the importance which the Government attaches to the sectors in question.  The Public Capital Programme for the sectors also shows a considerable increase of over 50 per cent to £840 million. I will have something to say later about the major projects to be undertaken.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to the international policy aspects of air transport. As part of a strategy to promote direct job and wealth creation in the Irish airline and aviation industry my Department has been pursuing in recent years the liberalisation of European air transport, including air freight services.  This policy has been endorsed by the Culliton Group which recommended that Ireland should press at EC level for further deregulation of European aviation, including air <Col N="753" /> freight services.  My Department has also been pursuing the conclusion of liberal air transport agreements with countries with whom there is the potential to develop new business.</P>
    <P>In his budget speech the Minister for Finance referred to the commitment in the Programme for Government that the Government would ensure a commercial future for the national airline.  He also said that, subject to the constraints in the national finances which rule out very large injections of equity in the group by the Exchequer, the Government would be prepared to support a viable and convincing recovery plan.</P>
    <P>I received the report of the Aer Lingus board on proposals to address the financial problems of the company on Friday, 12 February 1993.  It is currently being assessed by my Department.  The problems which face Aer Lingus did not occur overnight.  It would be most unwise therefore to seek instant solutions.  A meticulous and thorough examination of all the issues is necessary and that is what is taking place at present.  This task is being addressed with utmost urgency and will be completed as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The liberalisation policy has boosted air traffic.  I am happy to report that passenger numbers at the three State airports rose by 9 per cent to 8.16 million in 1992.  The Government recognises the importance of ensuring that the infrastructure at our State airports should be capable of handling the growth in traffic and responding to the opportunities and challenges presented by the completion of the Single European Market.  The Public Capital Programme this year provides for £23 million to be spent this year on the development and improvement of facilities at the three State airports.</P>
    <P>I turn now to transport.  The grant provision to CIE has been maintained at the 1992 level.  The Public Capital Programme provision at £68 million shows a substantial increase.  This will be devoted to work on a number of important projects, including: upgrading of the Dublin/ Belfast line and the provision of long distance commuter rail services to and from Kildare, which are scheduled to <Col N="754" /> commence early in 1994.  The service, operated with a new fleet of diesel railcars similar to DART, will serve Kildare Town, Sallins (Naas), Hazelhatch (Celbridge) and Clondalkin.  There will be new railcars and locomotives, continued development of Rosslare Harbour at a total cost of £19 million and new buses for Bus Átha Cliath and Bus Éireann. This expenditure will be financed from a combination of EC funds and CIE's own resources, including borrowings.</P>
    <P>Under the joint programme the Government has acknowledged that the railways are an essential element of the economic and social fabric of the country. A detailed assessment of the strategic options for the railway has been carried out by the Department in conjunction with the Department of Finance, CIE and private sector transport consultants. I am now considering the outcome of this work with a view to presenting to Government an investment programme for the development of the railway.</P>
    <P>The recently published interim report of the Dublin Transportation Initiative&mdash; DTI &mdash; contains major recommendations for public transport investment in Dublin, including the development of a light rail system and significant enhancements of existing bus and rail services. The strategy also involves a series of traffic management and strategy support measures, including park and ride facilities, bus priorities, parking restraint, enhanced electronic traffic signalling and detection systems and a range of other measures.  The cost of the public transport investment package recommended in the DTI is expected to be of the order of £300 million.  Clearly, major EC assistance will be essential if investment on that scale is to proceed.  The reports of the DTI will form an integral part of the Government's input into negotiations of EC funds for the period after 1993.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention that a pilot wheelchair-accessible bus service, part-funded by the EC and operated by Bus Átha Cliath, is planned to begin operation in June 1993 on a route from Clontarf to Finglas linking with the DART at Killester Station.  This will be the first <Col N="755" /> wheelchair-accessible bus service open to all members of the public in the State and I wish it every success.</P>
    <P>I expect the Minister of State with special responsibility for energy matters, Deputy Noel Treacy, will deal with energy matters at some length.  I would like, however, to say a few words about energy utilisation and policy in general. We must use energy resources wisely. If we fail future generations will rightly damn us.</P>
    <P>A source of energy with which we are all familiar is electricity.  The growing demand for electricity must be met in the most cost effective way.  A well thought out demand side management programme can yield real results through better use of electricity to the advantage of the consumer and the electricity supplier. In accordance with the Programme for a Partnership Government my Department is actively pursuing options such as combined heat and power &mdash; CHP &mdash; plants where suitable, not just for industrial concerns but also for health care institutions and other large users.  I am glad to say the ESB now has a policy of supporting CHP projects.</P>
    <P>The ESB's capital expenditure programme at £227 million for 1993 includes expenditure on a new combustion turbine at Poolbeg and necessary network upgrading, replacement and refurbishment. The network in some locations is 50 years old and requires attention if the needs of a modern developing economy are to be met.  The need to maintain ESB's financial stability while funding this essential improvement work will inevitably put pressure of prices.  In this context a price increase application from the ESB is under consideration by my Department. My Department is studying all aspects of the price increase sought and the implications for the consumer.  My intention is to find the optimum balance between the need for financial stability and the very obvious importance of minimising cost increases for customers.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna makes an important contribution to our primary energy requirements and is a significant <Col N="756" /> employer, particularly in the Midlands region.  It also provides an indigenous resource in addition to natural gas from Kinsale Head.  The Government is committed to a strong peat industry.</P>
    <P>There has been criticism of the high cost of electricity produced from peat. Bord na Móna has made great progress in recent years in reducing costs and increasing productivity.  This, combined with the new efficient generating station which is being examined, should have the effect of significantly reducing the apparent diseconomy of using peat for electricity generation.</P>
    <P>The third sector for which I have responsibility is communications.  Most of the provision in the telecommunications capital programme, costing an estimated £190 million in 1993, will be spent on developing the telephone service in Ireland.  Work includes the provision of sophisticated data communications systems and the upgrading and expansion of coverage of the mobile communications network.  Telecom Éireann will also cater for growth in demand for telephone lines, replacement of obsolete exchange equipment, enhancements to existing exchanges to provide new services and an increase in the proportion of digital transmission.</P>
    <P>The costs of telecommunications services provided by Telecom Éireann continue to be high by international standards.  This is a trend which will have to be reversed in the interest of existing subscribers and because of adverse impacts in attracting industry to set up in Ireland.  It is essential that Ireland not only be in a position to offer telecommunications services of as high a quality and sophistication as elsewhere but also at a competitive tariff level if industry is to be attracted to the country and retained here.  Both Telecom Éireann and officials of my Department are currently addressing this issue and I expect to be in a position to make a decision on the matter in the very near future.</P>
    <P>Our postal charges are also high by EC standards.  It is clear that these charges will have to be reduced in real terms to <Col N="757" /> at least average EC levels if the postal service is to provide an efficient and cost-effective support for economic and social purposes.  At the same time we must have regard to the financial position of An Post.  Detailed management and union negotiations on recovery proposals for the company are continuing under the general auspices of the Labour Relations Commission.  Some progress has already been made in the introduction of measures to reduce the huge overtime bill.  There is an urgent need for the introduction of a range of further cost reduction measures being negotiated at present with the unions.  These measures are necessary for the achievement of sustainable surpluses for An Post in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance in his budget speech stressed the need for jobs and to step up our economic performance in a sustainable way.  The sectors for which I have responsibility are significant employers.  Their importance, however, goes far beyond that and I am determined that they will play a full role in facilitating a stepping up of economic performance. The challenge facing us is considerable but I know we can face the future with confidence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Job creation is certainly at the core of this budget.  We need to realise that it is not the shortage of finances alone but the structures and attitudes that have caused many of the difficulties we have experienced in creating jobs.  For many years vast sums of money have been invested in our economy, but side by side unemployment has been increasing to the present unacceptable level.  The strength of our economy seems to be measured in terms of our exports, the success of multinational companies and the level of bank profits, to name but a few.  The strength of our economy may also be reflected in the fact that we are able to carry the 300,000 unemployed, something we could not have dreamt of 20 years ago.  However, that viewpoint is seriously flawed when one considers the negative effects, in social and economic terms, unemployment <Col N="758" /> is having on society and which is reflected in crime, drug abuse, suicide, broken marriages, alcohol abuse and the ever increasing demands on our overburdened health services, the Garda, the courts and on the voluntary organisations, without whose services we could not provide many of the facilities that are so urgently needed today.</P>
      <P>Admittedly there are other factors which we now recognise as having an impact on job creation: urbanisation, rural depopulation, the disappearance of small farms and farming as a way of life, the use of technology and the rightful &mdash; I say &ldquo;rightful&rdquo; in case it would be misunderstood &mdash; entitlement of women to retain employment, as well as the increase in population over the years.</P>
      <P>Major reform, including electoral reform, is an essential ingredient if we are to be able to tackle the problem. There are things we can do.  I am pleased to see that the budget puts the emphasis on development and the Minister has put specific emphasis on the development of the rail link and road infrastructure.  We have a seriously defective rail system in the west.  Recently I had the honour of taking part in an all-party deputation to the Department of the Environment on the Dublin to Sligo and the Dublin to Galway railway lines.  We met with the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Stagg and the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Noel Treacy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Both railway lines are seriously defective and need upgrading. The rolling stock and the signalling need to be improved.  This is causing significant difficulties in the midlands and west in our efforts to promote job creation.  It is very important that I refer to this point in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be recognised that rural development is retarded if we do not have a proper communications infrastructure, and this encompasses roads and rail transport.  It must also be recognised that <Col N="759" /> rural development must not be undertaken in a piecemeal fashion.  Because of the lack of the necessary prime funding it has been particularly difficult for private project promoters to find the resources to develop products, particularly small enterprises that employ one, two or three in the agri-tourism or tourism sectors. Assistance must be provided for them.</P>
    <P>The Structural Fund cannot continue to be used to support and provide greater opportunities for the larger hotels and businesses catering for the tourists. Moneys from the Structural Fund should be provided for refurbishing small family owned hotels with up to 40 or 50 bedrooms. These small hotels reflect Irish culture and give the tourist a true and candid reflection of Irish life.  I would like to see more emphasis being placed on that type of business in the future.  We have neglected to provide facilities around these hotels.  The larger hotels have enjoyed structural funding under the European Regional Development Fund programme to develop 18 hole golf courses.  Many towns in Roscommon, Longford, Cavan, Sligo, Galway and Mayo could enhance their opportunities in tandem with small family owned hotels if nine hole golf courses were extended to 18 hole courses, but there is no money available to do that.  The grant-aiding of golf courses has, in the main, been linked to large hotels.  It would be regrettable if in ten years' time many of these hotels became the new Digitals.  The importance of creating jobs in the development of small industrial and tourism opportunities is well recognised.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the ESB on launching a video on the Shannon Basin for secondary school pupils.  It is a work of art and reflects the qualities and potential of the River Shannon.  We should seriously pursue a demand I have made over the past number of years, that the River Shannon be designated for investment thereby creating jobs in an area that has lost more than 5,000 jobs in the past 25 years.  We can do that only by acknowledging that the River Shannon, and surrounding areas, are equally entitled to <Col N="760" /> the opportunities of attracting investment which applied to the Temple Bar area in Dublin.  The enormous potential of the Shannon has not been exploited. The river needs to be protected and developed and I urge that in the years ahead Structural Funds be allocated and the necessary legislative changes be considered. I met some county managers, and I corresponded with others, in regard to drawing up a plan for the development of the River Shannon.</P>
    <P>There are a number of matters we must take account of in relation to research and development.  In view of what has happened in Galway I suggest that we consider seriously the designation of Galway city as a national research and development centre.  It is ridiculous to invest millions of taxpayers' money in educating thousands of young men and women only to lose them to other countries where their talents, skills and experience are exploited.  We should provide funding for a major research and development centre in Galway, a university city and an ideal location.  We could then invite our graduates, who are scattered all over the world, to return and we should give them the facilities to carry out research.  We must afford these people the opportunity to return home to engage in the production of goods for the Irish market and create more jobs.</P>
    <P>Enterprise boards and local authorities can be linked more successfully in order to create jobs.  The decision to remove tourism from the business expansion scheme should be reversed.  I would like to have had time also to refer to the accounting system &mdash; which is a burden on all small operators &mdash; and the need for seed capital for the creation of jobs. Perhaps I will have another day to deal with those matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to contribute to this important debate.  First, I congratulate the two Ministers opposite and wish them every success in the future; we will offer them constructive advice, but not too much assistance.  Before the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications leaves <Col N="761" /> the House I should like him to know that in my area he is regarded as the Minister who presided over the closure of the Lullymore briquette factory.  I acknowledge that that is an unfair remark and I am sure the Minister will agree.  However, last Monday night a number of people inquired about when a replacement factory, which was promised during the recent election campaign, is likely to be built.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>A feasibility study is taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no public outcry in regard to the proposed product but people are inquiring about when a replacement factory will be built.</P>
      <P>One positive measure in the budget is the lowering of VAT on confectionery products.  More than 3,000 jobs were lost in that industry in the past few years. That is the only positive remark I can make on a budget which is a fitting culmination to what I regard as a tragic comedy of errors.  Last November when the rest of Europe was considering what to do in regard to job creation, European integration and so on, we were involved in a general election.  Following the election there were long drawn out negotiations on who should be in Government and who would be the best person to lead the country.  As a result of the time lost on such discussions the currency crisis crept up on us.  The Government was bemused by what had happened.  It took no action.  In fact, when the currency crisis was at its peak the Government parties were negotiating as to who should get the jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following those discussions the Ministers decided to appoint a plethora of advisers, the largest number in the history of the State.  I presume that was also more important than the serious currency crisis.  However, the currency crisis continued and, regrettably, while the Government expounded daily that it had no intention of devaluing the punt, it did nothing to prevent that happening.  Its members would not humble themselves <Col N="762" /> by going to Europe and consulting with EC colleagues to find out how they might prevent devaluation.  Finally, the punt was devalued at enormous cost to the State and caused serious damage to the prestige and moral fibre of the Government.</P>
    <P>We then had the crisis in Digital.  What happened?  People outside this country observed the Government's negative reaction to the currency crisis.  They recognised that the Government was weak, did not have a concerted opinion to offer on anything, was divided on many issues and did not know where it was going.  As a result, Digital decided to relocate with a considerable loss of jobs to this country.  Jobs are supposed to be on the top of the agenda in both parties. Why did the multinational decide to relocate?  It recognised that, despite the fact that we are supposed to be committed Europeans, we did not have any influence.</P>
    <P>It discovered that, despite repeated manifestations of toughness emanating from Government in relation to the currency crisis, it could prove nothing at the end of the day and had to back down. We should contrast that with the reaction of the Danes when their currency came under pressure.  That is the acid test. When people ask why Digital moved, they should be told that the international community recognised that this Government had no clout or clear objective in terms of promoting this country in Europe as a location for investors.  The result is now evident and is the most serious aspect of the activities of the Government, culminating in the budget.</P>
    <P>We are aware of the promises in regard to the health services highlighted in the Programme for Government and the other flowery aspirations, all of which are laudable but, given previous performances, I wonder how attainable they are, if they are attainable at all, and what do they mean?  For example, do they mean as much as the references in the budget speech of the Minister of State, Deputy Joan Burton, who referred to people on this side of the House.  We <Col N="763" /> are very pleased the Government keep referring to this side of the House because it is a sure sign it is worried about us.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>Do the Fine Gael and Progressive Democrats parties genuinely stand for the changes in the structure of taxation sought in the report?  [Referring to the Culliton report].  I certainly read many of their mentors in various newspapers cast aspersions on the various built-in tax rates for health costs, educational covenants, mortgage interest, to mention only some of the more notorious, that together add up to a mighty sum that puts a definite serious barrier in the way of a full-blooded restructuring of direct taxation.</P>
    <P>I am not very clear about what that means, nor, I am quite sure, is anybody else in this House.  Therefore will somebody call in the advisers from some quarter who might tell me what it means? That is the kind of confused response we are getting at present and about which I am very concerned.</P>
    <P>There is a lack of confidence outside this country in our ability to look after our own affairs.  From being the best run, best kept and most motivated member of the European Community we are now regarded as a doubtful addition to the Community who go cap in hand, begging bowl at the ready, crawling, grovelling and looking for money by way of Cohesion Funds at every hand's turn, but with nothing to offer by way of input into the Community.  It is a sad and serious situation.</P>
    <P>I will return to the question of jobs, which has been mentioned in every possible area in the last few weeks.  There are 302,000 people on the live register, 60,000 on various other schemes, 20,000 on apprenticeships and courses and a further 20,000 on pre-retirement pension, totalling almost 500,000 people.  Our total workforce is approximately 1.2 million people.  Do we fully recognise the seriousness of this matter?  I made a prediction on the night of the election count in my constituency, which the Minister <Col N="764" /> opposite will recall.  I do not readily make prophesies but I stand over those I do make and I am usually proven correct. On that occasion the Minister, Deputy Charlie McCreevy, said, &ldquo;Whatever happens from now on Fianna Fáil are not going to be in Government&rdquo;.  The present Minister, Deputy Stagg, said at that time he was not sure what would happen and did not clearly indicate what was likely to happen.</P>
    <P>I predicted that unless the Government elected to office seriously addressed the problem of unemployment they would not last long.  I repeat that now without any fear of contradiction.  While cosseted inside the walls of this House the Government suggest they will be in office for four years or eight years, but that is a dream and it will turn out to be a nightmare. Without the slightest doubt, unless the unemployment problem is tackled in the very near future it will disintegrate into turmoil.</P>
    <P>The people at work had hoped for some small recognition in the budget. The income levy which was introduced as a temporary measure will probably be temporary for about ten years and will be increased each year as budgetary demands require.  We all heard, during the negotiations for Government, about the golden circle which was going to be hit; they were going to be made pay the piper and carry the can of financial responsibility.  However, those who were hit were the people on incomes of about £9,000 a year.  There is an old story that you should pick on the weaker groups before you flex your muscles with the stronger groups in the community.  The Government could be compared with the man at the football match who, instead of hitting the biggest fellow a box in the eye hit the smallest fellow at the back, hoping nobody sees him.  Similarly, the Government hit the weakest group first in the knowledge that many of those people do not hold medical cards &mdash; there is an exclusion option for people with medical cards &mdash; and many of them have mortgages.  They are the group of people who have been hammered repeatedly in the last six months in terms of interest <Col N="765" /> charges and so on.  Despite all the manifestations of pity, outrage, outcry and dirty dozen cuts of the last six months the Government, when framing the budget, did not recognise the difficulties of that group.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to labour the point but surely it should have been possible for the combined talents of both parties in Government to recognise that our huge unemployment problem would become even greater if a further burden was placed on those already at work.  I listened recently to a person on the radio who had invented a robot &mdash; costing £100,000 &mdash; to milk cows.  With the present taxation system it would be more beneficial for a person to buy such a robot than to employ ten people to do the work. This is a serious matter that needs to be addressed but there is no recognition of that being done in Government circles.  I know that people over there think they will be in Government for four years &mdash; a few weeks ago they were talking about being in Government for eight years and maybe ten years &mdash; but as time goes on they will become a little more realistic and will recognise the limitations within which they operate.</P>
    <P>A friend of mine, a small businessman in a provincial town, recently mentioned that he has employed 40 people for the last ten years but nobody has ever congratulated him on his huge input into the economy or assisted him by way of grants.  This person said he recently heard that the Taoiseach went to some part of Kerry to open a small industry employing 12 people.  On the basis of that performance he believe he was due at least two or three visits from the Taoiseach in recognition of the employment he has given.  On past performances, there is a very good chance that this industry which employs 12 people, and was rightly commended by the Taoiseach, could go elsewhere. There is scant regard &mdash; the Government has shown this quite clearly in the budget &mdash; for those who consistently give employment such as the local public house, supermarket, restaurant or whatever.  These employers keep people off the dole queues but there <Col N="766" /> is no recognition whatsoever of their efforts.</P>
    <P>I will now refer to the clothing industry. A little more than ten years ago the major partner in Government had great difficulty differentiating between children's and adults' clothing and footwear. They went into a tailspin and spent weeks, months and even years referring to a famous budget that fell in this House, allegedly on the basis of children's clothing and footwear.  However, time is a great healer and there is no doubt it has healed one problem because now both parties in Government seem to be at one in recognising the difference between children's and adults' clothing and footwear. They have increased tax on these items, thereby creating further problems for people.  If anybody wants to know how bad things are in the clothing industry now as a result of increased taxation and VAT, one only has to look of their difficulties of six months ago and multiply them by six.  It is a serious problem.</P>
    <P>Because of changes that took place last year hard pressed motorists hoped for a small percentage decrease in insurance premiums, particularly young people, who find it hard to get insurance anyway. Both Government parties have repeatedly commited themselves to assisting the young and those who are in difficulties. The young people expected some assistance, but all that happened was that the Government reached out its greedy paw and grabbed the few quid available.  The Government took the money away in another levy which increases motor insurance and public liability insurance here, now almost the highest in the world.  That was some contribution to job creation.  It resembles the lifting of the cap in RTE.  When the Government loudly proclaimed its intention of lifting the cap there were vague suggestions as to where the money might be disposed of afterwards; but again out came the long, hairy paw to take it &mdash; a further contribution to job creation, I am sure.</P>

      <P>I would love to go into areas covering agriculture, housing and selling the household silver.  Deputy Stagg has always bemoaned the policy of selling the household silver adopted by previous Governments.  This Government gives every indication of doing the same.  It is even included in the budget under &ldquo;sale of assets&rdquo;.  Would that refer to selling the household silver or to polishing it before selling it?</P>
      <P>Deputy Stagg has responsibility for housing.  I wish him well in that area, but I would not make a big deal about the increased number of houses that will be built on foot of this year's allocation. There is still a housing crisis and there will be a housing crisis this time next year because, on the basis of projected progress in the current year, it will take the Minister 18 years to make even the smallest dent in the housing crisis.  To give an idea of the housing problems, four weeks ago I reported to my local authority a burst boiler in a house with four children, one of whom suffers from cerebral palsy.  Despite four or five telephone calls and four or five letters I have not received a response.</P>

      <P>This is the first budget of the partnership Government on course to implement an agreed programme until 1997.  Under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> we already have an agreed programme with the social partners.  We have agreed targets under the social and economic headings and we have now come together as two major political parties concerned about social improvement to ensure that we have the political stability to enable us to implement change and reforms.  Having implemented our programme over a four to five year period there will be no reason why we cannot continue it for another four to five years along with a programme on the social and economic front in conjunction with the social partners, particularly the trade unions.</P>
      <P>Our first priority in the budget is to introduce measures to immediately stimulate job creation.  Commentators on the television last night said that there was no evidence of a particular approach to job creation.  Over a four to five year period further reforms will be required, particularly in areas relating to social welfare, job sharing and tax reform.  Those reforms can be implemented by the Government, but as a first step in their first budget the Government did what could be done to immediately stimulate job creation and economic activity designed to ensure job creation.  There has been a £500 million increase in public capital expenditure, a 27 per cent increase designed to improve the essential infrastructure of the economy in terms of roads, railways, ports, housing, water supplies and sanitary facilities.  This is positive Government intervention of which I and this House should approve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extension of the business expansion scheme will encourage enterprise in the private sector in tandem with the improvement in the Government programme <Col N="769" /> for capital expenditure.  The county enterprise boards will be financed in a joint programme from the State and financial institutions.  The immediate effect will be an increase in jobs in the construction industry of the order of 3,000 to 4,000 in the coming 12 months. That is practical evidence of our immediate grappling with the jobs crisis in the budget.  This increased expenditure is below the expenditure permitted under the Maastricht Treaty guidelines.  We have substantially increased capital expenditure in the public sector and have encouraged the private sector while keeping within the Maastricht guidelines. Our Exchequer borrowing requirement is at 2.9 per cent of GNP whereas 3 per cent is permitted under the Maastricht guidelines.</P>
    <P>One positive immediate consequence of this disciplined approach within our Government interventionist policy has been evidenced today in the reduction in interest rates.  Now, the declared inflow of funds into our reserves has been confirmed and our reserves are now back to the high level at which they stood before the financial difficulties started last September. The public finances are firmly under control.  This is not just the Government view but the view of the international money markets that have started the recycling of funds back into our external reserves.</P>
    <P>I would emphasise the importance of the increased funds in the budget for developing our human resources through education and training.  European funds will now be invested in our education and training systems.  These additional resources will be used to widen the access of all students to third level education in the interests of social justice and equity. That is very important.  Indeed, the Provost of Trinity College, Dr. Mitchell, recently referred to a &ldquo;caste system&rdquo; in effect in operation in Trinity where only 1.3 per cent of Trinity students came from a semi-skilled or unskilled background. Surely, this reflects an intolerable situation that requires positive discrimination measures to encourage students from a wider spectrum of <Col N="770" /> society.  There is a declared aim in the Programme for a Partnership Government to rectify this and ensure we have real equality of education opportunity and treatment for all.  Our social objective of equal opportunity and equal treatment in education must go hand in hand with financial and economic targets.</P>
    <P>Another matter I would like to address &mdash; it will be a matter for consideration in the future and I appreciate there was not time for the Government to consider it in this budget &mdash; is how economic activity can be stimulated for those in the lower income group whose earnings are a little above the social welfare rates.  There is a need to legitimise much of the part-time and weekend work in what is called the black economy.  There is scope for allowing social welfare recipients to do part-time work without being brought into the tax net.  The tax take from those at the lower end of the income scale should be reduced to help those people promote and stimulate small entrepreneurial activity.  Those people could promote a whole range of economic activity that would be good from a social point of view, would remove people from the unemployment register and give them the dignity of work.  If this is approached by the Government in a sensible and practical way &mdash; it cannot be done in any top-of-the-head fashion in a matter of weeks, it requires deep study &mdash; we could stimulate economic activity.  By starting at the bottom of the social scale and working upwards we can encourge part-time entrepreneurial activity for those in receipt of social welfare.  People who derive income from social welfare and part-time work should be allowed to proceed in that way rather than be penalised by taxation.  The tax system should be adjusted accordingly.</P>
    <P>I would like to add my voice in support of the Government who have made a positive start, in a matter of weeks, with the expansion of the public capital programme, the county enterprise boards and the business incentive scheme.  It will ensure immediate action in the creation of jobs in the public and private sectors. A good start has been made and I am <Col N="771" /> sure further improvement will follow under this stable Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to make a short contribution on the budget.  A measure of the interest among Members is that there is a restriction on the time that each individual has to speak.  While ten minutes may seem sufficient, it is too short if there are a number of points which Deputies wish to make in relation to the economy and, indeed, areas of specific interest to their constituencies.</P>
      <P>The budget was framed against the background of the problem of the national debt, the high level of unemployment which has bedevilled us for a number of years and the difficulty with the current budget deficit.  I do not think any Member will disagree that the principal consideration in this budget should be the overriding need to create jobs in our economy.  The Minister for Finance has, within the constraints under which he is operating, introduced various initiatives to stimulate employment.  The additional provision made under the public capital programme is particularly welcome.  It goes without saying that there is a great need for a worthwhile local authority housing programme.  I hope it will commence soon.  There are very few sectors in the economy that will respond as quickly as the building sector in terms of job creation if the resources are made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to dwell on industrial development.  I have long held the view &mdash; it may be an eccentric view &mdash; that there is a need to focus on the labour intensive industries in our economy.  In my constituency the footwear industry in Dundalk provided many employment opportunities for generations of people who live in and around north Louth.  I made some inquiries of the Central Statistics Office recently regarding the number employed in the footwear industry and I was given approximate figures. In 1973, 7,000-plus people were employed in the footwear industry in Ireland.  The latest available figures indicate <Col N="772" /> that there are 700-plus people employed in that industry.</P>
    <P>Most industries have undergone a process of rationalisation following a process of investment in technology and jobs have been eliminated right across the board.  That process has, undoubtedly, improved the competitiveness of many of those industries at a time when competition was very keen and that investment has been justified.  However in sectors such as the footwear, tourism and textile industries there are, undoubtedly, opportunities to create jobs by way of import substitution or market share recovery.  To do that there is a need for a more focused and integrated approach. There is a need for investment and support, and a need to examine the cost structure that can envelope and, in many instances, overwhelm entrepreneurs who are working in those areas.  That positively discourages them from developing.</P>
    <P>In a previous political incarnation I had responsibility for the horticultural industry.  The figures from 1987 up to the end of 1991 show that thousands of jobs were created in that sector.  These jobs were created because a special State board was established and there was a political focus on the industry.  This created a new sense of awareness and realism and released the dynamic which led to investment and the creation of jobs.  If we focus on the labour intensive industries in our economy I do not see why we cannot at least recover some of the ground we have lost.  Obviously one has to have regard to consumer demands and requirements which are ever-changing. Of course, the age structure of our population is very important when it comes to deciding the type of product, particularly footwear and textiles, which will be bought.  I believe a case can be made for the appointment of a co-ordinator who will focus on these areas and release the dynamic which is so badly needed for the creation of jobs.</P>

      <P>I wish to briefly refer to one other issue.  I hope I will have an opportunity to deal with this point at a later stage; I had hoped I could develop it now in view of the fact that the Minister of State with responsibility for housing is present in the House.  I have long held the view that there is a need to ask the NESC or the ESRI to examine the level of investment in our housing stock and the conventionally accepted housing designs.  During election campaigns all Members of this House have the opportunity to see at first hand our excellent quality of housing.  However, given family sizes nowadays, I believe there is a need to look at the possibility of introducing greater variety in the design of houses.  A conventional three bedroomed house is fine for a family for, say, the first 20 years but when the children leave home these houses are too big for the parents.  I do not think anyone could argue that there is not a waste of resources in this area.  I regret very much that I cannot develop this point further, particularly in view of the fact that the Minister of State with responsibility for housing is present in the House.  As I said, I hope to get the opportunity at a later stage to develop this point further.</P>

      <P>The overriding claim made about this budget by both parties in Government was that, more than anything else, it was a job creating budget. That is what was said a week ago. However, looking at the measures contained in the budget one week later it now has to be admitted that not alone is this budget not a job creating budget but that the opposite is the case.  As a direct result of the taxation measures taken in the budget, and the taxation measures not taken, jobs will be lost, not created. That is a fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is universal agreement by all sectors of the community outside this House that if we are ever to tackle our unemployment problem we must dismantle our present anti-labour taxation system.  That was summed up well by Culliton.  The Culliton report gave us a blueprint for job creation; it showed us <Col N="774" /> the way.  What did this budget do?  It ignored Culliton.  We are now being told that the Culliton report will be looked at down the road.  However, every year lost will have serious consequences for the people of Ireland, those who are and those who are not so young, who looked at the change of Government and this budget &mdash; the first and most important measures introduced by the new partnership Government &mdash; for measures which would, first, stem job losses and, second, lead to job creation.  Going into this budget there were four separate taxes on labour and coming out of the budget there are five taxes on labour.  The 1 per cent levy is the fifth and additional tax on labour.  How could anybody who has any respect for the truth go out and proclaim that this budget is pro-jobs when, as I said, the opposite is the case?</P>
    <P>Let us look, for example, at the impact the increased rate of VAT will have on the retail trade, particularly on the clothing and footwear sectors.  That trade has predicted that as a direct result of the VAT increases in the budget as many as 2,000 jobs will be lost in the clothing sector during the next 12 months.  How can that measure be justified?  Let us look at the prospects facing people who are working at present in the manufacturing and retail sectors of the Irish clothing trade.  Let us look at the competition to which they are already exposed and what the next 12 months holds for them.  It is more than likely that their prediction will be correct and that at least 2,000 jobs will be lost to that sector during the next 12 months.  It is just as important for us to realise that if we are ever going to make inroads in tackling our unemployment problem we must hold on to what we have as well as create new jobs.  This fact has not been given recognition in the VAT measures introduced in the budget. I will come back to the Culliton report, about which much has been said.</P>
    <P>While the Culliton report has shown the way, additional to and parallel with Culliton we will have to put in place a job creating strategy.  If we are ever going to make inroads in tackling our unemployment problem, with its economic <Col N="775" /> effects and its ugly social side effects, we have to initiate job creation programmes from the ground up as well as from the top down.  People are ready for such an initiative.  They are psychologically and culturally ready.  All they want is a series of measures by this Government which will enable it to harness and tap the energies, initiative, intelligence and good ideas of people at local level and direct them towards job creating projects locally.  Nothing was done in the budget to acknowledge the importance of local initiatives and to foster and promote local job creating projects.  In fact, the opposite was the case.  I am referring to the increased insurance charges on all voluntary activity in the community sector.  I will refer later to this point.  I will also outline, as I see it, the adverse impact that that measure, coupled with the increases in the cost of electricity and telephone charges, will have on all voluntary effort at community level.</P>
    <P>We have the highest ratio of dependency of any country in Europe.  The facts were given at a seminar on unemployment which I attended yesterday. They are as follows: for every ten persons paying into the Exchequer in 1993 there are 21 persons drawing out and depending on the contributions of those ten for the provision of decent educational and health services, decent local authority services and services of every kind.  That is a devastating ratio which must not be ignored.  In the United Kingdom the ratio is 10:11; for every ten persons paying tax there are 11 depending on the services the tax provides.  The European average is 10:14, while our ratio if 10:21.  We have an alarming dependency ratio and a culture building up around it.  One would have thought this budget would have addressed that fact and would have introduced measures to help break the dependency syndrome and to move the ratio in the correct direction.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that it is at community level through local initiative that the dependency syndrome can be broken. I have listened to what has been said repeatedly by the President, who has <Col N="776" /> made a point of visiting people in a community setting.  She is constantly encouraged by the scale of local energy, intelligence and goodwill and the movement among people towards doing something for themselves.  Instead of enabling and encouraging people, we are penalising them by imposing the 1 per cent levy on non-life insurance which will make the day-to-day running costs of all sorts of voluntary activity much more expensive in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>In Northern Ireland a different approach is taken to community work and better funding is available for community groups.  Fulltime professional staff are being appointed to community support groups and as a result a great many worthwhile jobs are being created at local level and a number of admirable social advantages are developing.  We have never looked at what is being done in Northern Ireland in this respect. Occasionally we give handouts and Deputies run around the country giving once-off, <i>ad hoc</i> grants to groups who ought to be fully funded on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>The 1 per cent increase in stamp duty levied on non-life insurance policies replaces the temporary little arrangement, the insurance compensation levy of 1 per cent imposed to cover the cost of the collapse of the PMPA and later the Insurance Corporation of Ireland.  It had been understood that after these bills were paid stamp duty on non-life policies would return to 1 per cent.  That has not happened.  Within eight weeks of the end of the insurance compensation levy the stamp duty has increased to 2 per cent. While for existing policyholders there will be no increase, the Government has silently replaced a temporary levy imposed for a specific reason with a permanent levy for which no justification has been given.  The immediate introduction of this levy, combined with the increase in VAT charges on electricity and telephone service charges, leads me to question the Government's commitment to voluntary activity.</P>
    <P>Voluntary workers in community associations and residents' groups are <Col N="777" /> already crippled by insurance and other charges.  This levy constitutes a tax on a tax.  Volunteers, having earned their wages, are expected to pay out of whatever is left towards the upkeep and maintenance of buildings and insurance cover on those buildings.  It is becoming more apparent that only through locally based activities can areas become better places to live and the community spirit be developed.  Why is the Government penalising voluntary efforts in this way? Residents' associations organising fund raising dinner dances and groups trying to finance all kinds of sporting clubs will have to confront the additional running costs which will result from this levy.  All this is happening at a time when it is universally acknowledged that it is within the community that solutions to community problems can be found.  A local spirit can be devloped by people working together.  Without voluntary day care centres the cost to the Exchequer of caring for the sick and the elderly would rise enormously.  Without local youth clubs and weekend discos, staffed and managed on a voluntary basis by local people, there would be little or nothing for many teenagers who would otherwise be roaming the streets of our towns and villages, vandalising public buildings and causing all sorts of depredations.  Voluntary workers try out of their own resources to put alternative recreational facilities in place for them.  Without voluntary groups the illiteracy rate would be more appalling than it is.  I look to family support centres, many of which are thriving in my constituency, for a better future for all our people, young and old.</P>
    <P>I call on the Government to address itself to the value of such groups as I have mentioned &mdash; literacy groups, family support groups and groups that organise recreation for young people.  Groups of that nature ought to get active assistance from the Government if we are to attack the problems of vandalism, lawlessness and family breakdown.  These groups ought to be properly financed on an ongoing basis so they can plan ahead rather than on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis from budget to budget.  They should not be <Col N="778" /> penalised by the imposition of three additional charges for insurance, electricity and the telephone service.  They ought to be exempt.  They ought to be given the kind of resources that are given to similar groups in Northern Ireland where professional people are being seconded from areas like the Department of Industry and Commerce and local authorities to assist these groups and enable them to get their socially based programmes and their employment generation programmes off the ground.  We should be giving them assistance and not penalising them like this.  I will have a good deal more to say about this matter tomorrow when we are discussing aspects of juvenile justice and juvenile crime.  By putting additional tax on this body it has taken a backward step and has helped to kill off the kind of local energy, intelligence and idealism that will enable the people of this country to break the dependency culture, to break through the frightful barrier of unemployment and begin to become self-sufficient, as our fathers and grandfathers once were.</P>
    <P>We must look to the voluntary sector in parallel with the recommendations of the Culliton report.  Shame on the Government for not making proper provision in this budget for the great work being done locally by voluntary groups in every county, That omission will haunt this budget and I will be on my feet again and again in the course of this year to ensure that the mistake that was made in this budget will not be repeated in next year's budget.</P>

      <P>Minister Walsh, in his <Col N="779" /> contribution, has dealt in some detail with the major developments in farming here, in Europe and at the wider international level.  I would like to avail of this opportunity to concentrate on a number of areas which fall within my remit.</P>
      <P>As the House is aware, the European Community adopted last July what was probably the most radical reform of the Common Agricultural Policy since the policy was put in place.  The reform extended across most product sectors but was more extensive in the cattle and crops sectors than others.  My Department fully accepts that the reform package is relatively complex and we have undertaken a number of initiatives in order to ensure that farmers fully understand the new arrangements.  Firstly, my Department, with the assistance of Teagasc, held a series of public information meetings last autumn on the cross sector and in January and February of this year on the livestock sector to explain the new arrangements to farmers.  These meetings were very well attended and it is estimated that approximately 40,000 farmers in all managed to attend them.  My Department has also produced booklets on Common Agricultural Policy reform in the two sectors to explain the details of the new arrangements and the procedures for claiming the grants.</P>
      <P>In addition to this, Teagasc, at the request of Minister Walsh, has put in place a package of measures to assist farmers in dealing with the complexity of the Common Agricultural Policy arrangements while also advising them on how to secure optimum income under the various schemes.  The Government has provided an extra £1 million to enable Teagasc to extend its small farm development service and this should contribute significantly to the efforts of Teagasc to inform farmers of their entitlements under the schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, the Common Agricultural Policy reform package has radically overhauled the cattle premium schemes and has very significantly increased the amount of money to be paid directly to farmers under these schemes.  By 1995, <Col N="780" /> when the new higher rates of payment come fully onstream, payments under the cattle premium schemes, along with payments to farmers under the ewe premium scheme and the various headage schemes in the disadvantaged areas, will be of the order of £650 million.  Clearly, these direct payments will represent a very substantial proportion of the income of producers of cattle and sheep and my Department accepts that it is essential that farmers receive their entitlements as soon as possible within the time constraints laid down in EC regulations.  I am extremely pleased, therefore, that the Government has provided a substantial sum of money to enable my Department to take on additional staff to operate these schemes.  These additional staff are required because of the increased number of applications expected under the special beef premium scheme, the introduction of individual quotas in the suckler cow and ewe premium schemes and the increased complexity of the schemes generally.  Additional staff are also required for the implementation of the Common Agricultural Policy reform in the arable crops sector.</P>
    <P>As Minister with responsibility for rural development, I was particularly pleased that significantly increased funding has been provided for the two rural development initiatives currently in place.  The provision for the measures in the operational programme for rural development implemented directly by my Department has been increased by 19 per cent to £12.8 million this year.  In the case of the Leader and Interreg programmes the amount allocated is £15.8 million, an increase of 182 per cent on the 1992 outturn.</P>
    <P>These increases demonstrate the Government's commitment to the regeneration of rural areas.  The investments to be aided with these allocations will help to sustain existing employment and to increase new employment in rural communities.</P>
    <P>I would also like to draw attention to the fact that the budget provided for the allocation of an additional sum of £10,000 to Irish Rural Link to support its efforts <Col N="781" /> in assisting the most disadvantaged rural communities.</P>
    <P>It will be particularly important for the future of agriculture and rural development in this country that the early retirement scheme proposed under the accompanying measures of Common Agricultural Policy reform be successfully implemented.  The uptake under earlier efforts to introduce retirement schemes has not been high for a variety of reasons, not least of which was a deep rooted reluctance on the part of farmers to retire.  Every effort must be made, therefore, to maximise the overall impact of the scheme which is at present being drawn up and it is intended that it will provide sufficiently attractive financial inducements to encourage older farmers to consider early retirement.</P>
    <P>An amount of £1 million has been allocated to the scheme in this year's Estimates, but as the scheme becomes fully operational significantly larger allocations will have to be made in future years.</P>
    <P>Turning to the forestry part of my portfolio, the House will be aware that forestry has been identified by the Government as one of the key development areas.  In the short time I have been exercising responsibility for forestry it has been very evident to me that the forest industry experienced very serious problems on the trading front in 1992. The year just past has been, by any standards, an extremely difficult one.  Even before the turmoil on the currency markets in the latter months of 1992, prevailing economic conditions were difficult.</P>
    <P>The Government's commitment to the development of forestry is reflected in the amounts included in the Public Capital Programme.  Provision is being made for a substantial increase in new planting in 1993 by both the public and private sectors.  Last year almost 21,000 hectares was planted.  This year the aim is to plant in excess of 24,000 hectares.  It is an ambitious target but I am confident that it can be achieved.</P>
    <P>The forestry accompanying measure under the reform of the Common Agricultural <Col N="782" /> Policy provides for a programme covering afforestation, woodland improvement and premia payments.  This programme is currently being prepared and will be submitted to the EC Commission for approval in the near future.</P>
    <P>This is the last year of the existing round of Structural Funds and a national plan which will be the basis for the period 1994-97 is currently in preparation. My aim will be to make maximum use of these funds by, first of all, continuing with the agricultural and rural development measures already in operation under Ireland's existing community support framework.  In addition, we will be seeking to have a specific integrated operational programme for the food sector with a view to developing the industry to meet an increasingly competitive market and one that is more oriented to value added and diversification rather than basic commodity trading.</P>
    <P>Our farmers will also need encouragement by way of financial aid to carry out the substantial investment necessary in the dairy sector to bring their premises and equipment up to new EC requirements in the health and safety areas.  This is something which will also have to be taken on board in the next round of the Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>Our aim would also be to expand small and community based rural enterprise measures of the Leader type with a view to providing farmers and other rural dwellers with an opportunity to increase their income through new enterprises, both on and off farm.  Such initiatives will be essential in the face of Common Agricultural Policy reform and reduced market support, because small rural communities must be given the opportunity to reach an acceptable standard of living and to develop their potential.</P>
    <P>Underpinning all of these measures will be the need for effective research, training and advisory services and I will be looking for the necessary structural funding to enable Teagasc carry out its activities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank my <Col N="783" /> colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Hyland, for sharing his time with me. In the short time available to me I will endeavour to address as many issues as possible.</P>
      <P>This budget has been framed in the midst of a recession that has been raging worldwide and it is in that context that this budget must be perceived.  The UK, our nearest neighbour and major trading partner, is into its third year of deep and continuous recession and this has serious economic implications for us.  It is in that context the Minister for Finance and the Government have framed the budget and, indeed, achieved the ultimate in responsibility and balance.</P>
      <P>Job creation must be at the top of our agenda.  The 27 per cent increase in capital spending announced in the budget is therefore most welcome, particularly in the context of the employment it will generate.  Much needed infrastructural improvements &mdash; for example, in road and rail projects and the upgrading of ports &mdash; will provide jobs in the construction process and thereafter.</P>
      <P>In relation to upgrading ports, in the past EC moneys and other available funds have tended to be directed towards our four or five major ports.  This has been to the detriment and neglect of other important ports around the country. Without being too parochial, I am mindful of parts like Wicklow and Arklow which are vital to the economy of the eastern area of our country, particularly County Wicklow and north Wexford. Those ports have been starved of funding.  With the infusion of further EC funds over the next few years the pattern of allocation of funds will change and funding for the upgrading of ports like Wicklow and Arklow will be available to enable them to compete in the Single Market.  That is vital.  I urge that this area be given attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The announcement of the building of 3,500 local authority houses is important. It will be a start in dealing with the major housing problem we have at present which is of major concern to all of us.  It will generate necessary jobs in the construction <Col N="784" /> industry.  We all know that when that industry is vibrant; it more than any others, has the ability to give a boost to the economy, directly and indirectly.  I welcome the focus on job creation in the budget because the jobs fund was a vital part of my own party's election manifesto.  I am extremely grateful that this has been honoured within the framing of this budget.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the area of remedial teachers.  I was pleased to be present in this House earlier today and yesterday to hear the Minister for Education and the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare announce their meritorious measures and aspirations to help the disadvantaged sections of our community.  In that regard I appeal for the provision of additional remedial teachers for our primary schools.  There is a need for those professional people in rural Ireland and perhaps their services could be shared among a number of small schools.  Their appointment is something we should aspire to achieve.  In the western part of my county, in rural west Wicklow, there are a number of schools who have applied for the appointment of a remedial teacher and are hopeful of their request being met.  I hope the Minister for Education and other Ministers concerned will address this area of education.</P>
    <P>In the jobs context the ongoing growth in our tourist industry is a very important factor.  Jobs have been created in the tourism sector in recent difficult years. The potential scope for job creation in that sector is great.  In my own constituency of Wicklow and east Kildare many efforts are being made to promote tourism.  The aim is to establish Wicklow as the quality tourism location of the country and we are making great progress in that direction.  Ireland, as an island, could be a tourism Mecca and Wicklow could excel in that regard; but to achieve this goal we must have assistance.  We have the will and the commitment of the people, but we also need ongoing tangible assistance.  To date we have received substantial help via the regional tourism mechanism.  The regional tourism boards are currently under review <Col N="785" /> and I appeal to the Minister for Tourism and Trade to take serious account of the expertise, experience and track record of the people on those regional tourism boards before he takes any action that may be detrimental to the boards or to the progress of Irish tourism generally.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the Minister for Finance did not increase the price of alcohol in the budget as this would have important implications for the tourism sector.  Many small pubs have been struggling for some time to survive, as I am sure my colleague, Deputy Sheehan, is aware.  It is good that an additional bind is not placed on them by an increase in the price of alcohol at this time.  In the tourism context the Irish pub is an integral part of the Irish scene, the foreign tourist who comes to our shores expects the pub to be here.</P>
    <P>In the area of agriculture, I welcome the increase in inheritance tax thresholds. I have spoken many times in the House about capital acquisition tax.  The measures taken in the budget will substantially improve the incentive to pass on the family farm to the younger men and women in Irish farming.  Those young people are eagerly awaiting possession, they have educated themselves beautifully to prepare themselves to better utilise their farms, and it is vital that the process of handing on the land to the young be made increasingly attractive to ensure that the younger generation have not themselves grown old before acquiring the family farm.</P>
    <P>I should like to make brief mention of agriculture disadvantaged areas, a subject very close to the heart of Deputy Sheehan and about which I am sure he will have something to say.  My own constituency has done rather well in that 84 per cent of the constituency is now deemed to be disadvantaged.  Anomalies do exist, however, and I should like to think that the cases under appeal, in Wicklow and elsewhere, will be addressed expeditiously.</P>
    <P>The increase in the carer's allowance is welcome.  There is no greater value for money than that provided by the carer who is looking after an older person at <Col N="786" /> home.  I have experience of that in my own domestic scene.</P>
    <P>However, I suggest that the administration of the scheme might be carried out better by the Department of Health than by the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>After listening for the past 20 minutes to Minister Hyland and Deputy Jacob, one would gain the impression that everything in the garden was rosy.  I assure both of them that nothing could be further from the truth.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak in this debate.  The budget was to have been one of the toughest in recent years, with employment creation its principal aim.  However, the Minister for Finance, in trying to balance his books, was like a panicked sailor trying to shift the deck-chairs on a sinking ship instead of trying to refloat the vessel. The budget could be described as a nonevent. It did not contain any radical proposals, anything for job creation or anything to indicate a lowering of Irish interest rates in the current international climate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is widely acknowledged that the biggest problem in generating employment in Ireland is the tax wedge between the amount forked out for wages by an employer and the amount a worker takes home after tax.  The imposition of a new 1 per cent tax on all incomes in excess of £9,000 has served to widen the gap.  It is amazing that the Government and the Minister for Finance were so naive as to take that measure; there had been a clear consensus that the narrowing of that tax wedge was a key ingredient towards increasing employment.  The new levy is an indication of the laziness and incompetance on the part of the Government's policymakers; either they were too lazy to look elsewhere for the revenue, which they did not really need, or they were incapable of understanding the workings of the labour market.  It will now cost an employer £2.59 per week to give £1 extra to an employee earning about £2,000 less than the average industrial wage.  A single person earning more than £10,661 <Col N="787" /> gross a year now moves into the higher 48 per cent tax band and will have to pay also 7.75 per cent PRSI contributions and the new 1 per cent levy on income. Meanwhile, the employer has to pay 12.2 per cent in PRSI contributions for the privilege of giving that worker a low-paid job.  For so long as the Government insists on imposing those kinds of tax levels on employment it cannot realistically claim to be serious about job creation.  The Italians have a more sanguine attitude to tax rates; in Italy one does not pay the top marginal tax rate until one achieves a gross income the equivalent of approximately £151,000 a year.  The German Government applies its top tax rate only to gross incomes in excess of £98,400.  In Spain the maximum rate of income tax applies to incomes higher than £63,000.  In socialist France, the tax threshold is £61,000.  We Irish are deemed to be good Europeans but the Community attitude disappears when it comes to taxes and labour.  Here in Ireland we are much more relaxed than are our European neighbours.  Perhaps it is because we have taxed one-fifth of our workforce out of employment that we now reckon we can tax two-fifths of those who remain working at rates other European countries reserve for millionaires.</P>
    <P>On 25 November the Irish people voted for a change, but what change has the Minister given the electorate?  He has relied on the old formula, &ldquo;If it moves, tax it&rdquo;.  Middle income workers earning £20,000 a year gross got the clear message from the Minister in this budget that they would give the State another £200 in employment generating levies and then they and their employers would give a further £200 in PRSI contributions. Taken together, those measures represent another £8 a week in taxes on productive labour.  The increasing unemployment figures will add £100 million more to the social welfare bill this year, but the Government insisted in the budget that that money be recouped by higher taxation.  In so doing, the Government managed to make work less attractive than unemployment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="788" /> The budget is also a disaster as far as agriculture, tourism and fisheries are concerned.  Those are the three main natural industries that offer some glimmer of hope for the creation of jobs in the foreseeable future.  Alas, no effort was made by the Minister or his Government to generate new plans for creating extra jobs in those three native industries. The Minister allocated only £1 million to Teagasc towards an advisory service.  That move could be described as a drop in the ocean for Teagasc; it was an insult.</P>
    <P>A sum of £400,000 was allocated for a pig evaluation programme, not a big deal, when you consider that our pigs and bacon industry is in a shambles.  The Minister boasted that he had allocated £250,000 for research in the food industry. Who is he codding?  What does he mean by allocating that paltry figure which will not do anything to foster and promote food production, while at the same time we are importing millions of pounds worth of fresh and frozen foods from the EC each year?</P>
    <P>Why is the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry dragging his heels in regard to a decision on the continuation of stock relief for farmers, which is due to expire on 5 April 1993?  I urge him &mdash; and the Minister for Finance &mdash; to come clean on this matter and announce a continuation of stock relief for our farmers, at least until the end of the century.</P>
    <P>The increase in the VAT rate from 10 per cent to 12.5 per cent will have a devastating effect on our tourism industry as it will affect all hotels and holiday accommodation, car hire and building services.  It will completely stifle any chance of creating extra employment in the tourist industry.  The fishing and mariculture industry was completely ignored by the Minister in his budget speech. There is no light at the end of the tunnel for that major industry, which is capable of generating a huge volume of new jobs, if the necessary finance is allocated by the Minister.  Why did the Minister not spell out the Government's policy on the fishing and mariculture industry?  Will he outline the future plans for the development <Col N="789" /> of this industry?  Will it benefit from the Structural and Cohesion Funds which are promised over the next seven years? These funds must be channelled to the development of our three main natural industries because, when all is said and done, they are the only industries with job potential of any consequence in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>In his budget speech the Minister did not mention anything about providing necessary finance to extend the disadvantaged areas during 1993.  How long more will the countless thousands of our farmers, who are awaiting inclusion in the disadvantaged areas, be denied the rights and benefits which acrue to farmers in disadvantaged areas?  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry should not take no for an answer, he should insist at the Cabinet table that the necessary finance be made available for the extension of the disadvantaged areas and that the red tape which has delayed the extension of these areas for the past three years is cut through once and for all.  As a Deputy from the same constituency as the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry I call on him &mdash; and the Minister of State who is in the House &mdash; to act before it is too late.  The Minister for Finance should make the necessary finance available to enable the extension of disadvantaged areas to go ahead.</P>
    <P>The increase in VAT from 10 per cent to 12.5 per cent on the Irish newspaper industry is diabolical.  Why did the Minister inflict such a heavy VAT rate on Irish newspapers while their British counterparts can flood this country with cheap tabloids which carry a zero VAT rate? The Minister for Finance must realise that he has dealt a crippling blow to the Irish newspaper industry and I urge him to rectify this serious anomaly.  He should reduce the VAT rate to zero, thereby allowing our newspaper industry to enjoy the same concessions as their British counterparts.</P>
    <P>The Minister's outrageous decision in raising the VAT rate from 16 per cent to 21 per cent for adult clothing will devastate the clothing manufacturing industry. Because of the global recession <Col N="790" /> clothing manufacturers' margins have been squeezed to almost zero, leaving no room to absorb the extra VAT rate. Retail prices will not move upwards to allow for these increases and, consequently, the buyers will increasingly switch their purchases to imported clothing, which will be disastrous for our clothing industry.  It is clear that the Minister for Finance does not realise one cannot dig one's way out of a hole in the ground.  If that is the case his civil servants are writing his speeches and advising him.</P>
    <P>It was clearly a budget of missed opportunities. Will the Minister state which Government party had the bigger input to this budget?  Was it Fianna Fáil or Labour?  Perhaps it was the well-groomed officials from the Department of Finance who won the day.  The Minister should have outlined a correct formula to reduce the number of unemployed and correct policies for a job creation programme and the return of prosperity.  Instead, he went to great pains to try to explain to the House the good deal he had struck by reducing the rate of VAT on flour, confectionery and other bakery products &mdash; and non-chocolate biscuits &mdash; to 12.5 per cent.  Is the Minister allergic to chocolate biscuits and does he think that the majority of taxpayers are also allergic to them?  Do milk chocolate hob-nobs interfere with the digestive system of the Minister for Finance and his associates? Is he allergic to marietta and petticoat tails?  The budget will go down in history as the &ldquo;cookie crumble&rdquo; one, it takes the biscuit to realise that it took marietta &mdash; backed by Jacobs &mdash; to ensure the great deal he had done in regard to the plain biscuit industry.  God help this country and the people who rely on that kind of Minister for Finance to steer our economy through such a turbulent time.  For a sheer display of bunkum and bureaucracy, Bertie takes the biscuit.  Action &mdash; not pious platitudes &mdash; is needed.</P>
    <P>The western seaboard, from Mizen Head to Malin Head is fast becoming denuded of its people, if Government policy is allowed to continue the west and south-west regions will become a wildlife park and wealthy Europeans will make <Col N="791" /> safari trips to view the wild animals which will roam the area.  We are told that this country will benefit to the tune of £3 million per day for the next seven years. Where will this money be spent?  Will it be allocated to non-productive purposes which will not have any impact on our unemployment crisis?  Bypasses, flyovers and dual carriageways are the name of the game in the greater Dublin area while the roads in rural Ireland are disintegrating. Our piers and harbours need dredging and extensions and our roads are in need of urgent repair to bring them up to standard.  We now have a problem where the bulk milk lorries cannot collect the milk from the farmers owing to the condition of the roads in question.  We are talking about introducing an MOT test for vehicles this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>A large number of appointments to public office occurs in the lifetime of any Dáil.  These range from the 166 secretarial assistants, individually appointed by Members of the House, to members of State boards, the Judiciary and some appointments in semi-State companies.  Included in the total would be the personnel appointed by political <Col N="792" /> parties, either out of their Oireachtas entitlement or with salaries paid for from the moneys paid to political parties by the Exchequeer for research and other purposes &mdash; which in 1993 amount to £90,645 in the case of Fianna Fáil, £38,990 in the case of the Labour Party, £256,658 in the case of Fine Gael and £127,512 in the case of the Progressive Democrats.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to introduce legislation which would debar family members who are otherwise appropriately qualified for appointment to posts serving Government, Ministers, TDs or political parties. It should be borne in mind that these appointments will cease with the departure from office of the Government or Ministers concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Will the Minister agree with me that in the context of this Government, and particularly the Labour Party members of the Government, that an unprecedented number of family members have been given positions by senior and junior Ministers?  Would he further agree that the main contribution this Government has made to date in solving the unemployment crisis is to provide positions in ministerial offices?  Will he indicate to the House if, as Minister for Equality and Law Reform, he has intervened to ensure that non-family members, people who are not related to current Ministers, have been given equality of opportunity in applying for the jobs that have been allocated to family members by his colleagues in Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree with the conclusions that the Deputy draws.  The <Col N="793" /> position has always been that these appointments are made by the individual TDs concerned and in many cases the appointments were made by them when they were still TDs and continued when the Deputies became Ministers.</P>
      <P>Each case has to be considered on its merits.  There are no procedures in place at present for an examination to take place for appointment as a TD's secretary. Perhaps there should be.  Perhaps there should be a review of the appointment of secretaries in all political parties to see what connection they may have with their Ministers or what secretaries were retained on the change of Government and those who were not.  It could then be considered whether any arrangements for a selection process could be devised for those secretaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that the majority of those appointed by both senior and junior Ministers were either sisters or daughters of the Minister and were not previously employed by them as secretaries or in another formal capacity?  Would the Minister further agree that the manner in which the relationship between Ministers and those whom they have appointed emerged was somewhat unfortunate in that when parliamentary questions were tabled the true relationship was not in most cases disclosed in the written replies given, that at the very least that was disingenuous and undermined the claim made by members of this Government that they were going to change Irish politics to a more open and straightforward style of politics?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the question is a rather regrettable jibe at the Leader of the Labour Party.  It was no secret to anybody that the Tánaiste employed his sister, Maeve, as his constituency secretary for the past ten years while he was a Member of the Dáil.  A similar situation certainly applies in the Fine Gael Party in many cases and perhaps in other parties as well, but the matter has not been examined.  She continued to act as his secretary in the constituency when he <Col N="794" /> became a Minister.  I do not know if a suggestion was made that she should have been sacked from that position because he was appointed a Minister.</P>
      <P>In any case the question put to me is whether I intend to introduce legislation to debar family members from taking up appointment, but I do not think that will be appropriate.  It could well be that at some future date &mdash; unlikely, I know, but you never know &mdash; should Deputy Bruton become Taoiseach the question would arise whether he would be debarred from appointing his brother, if merit so required, as a Minister or a Minister of State.  I do not think anybody maintains that suggestion.  Perhaps all parties should have a look at appointments of secretaries in this Dáil and in previous ones and if the question arose of establishing a system of merit for secretaries. That certainly could be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the Minister's juxtaposition of Deputy Bruton appointing his brother to ministerial office at some stage, which hopefully will come about, I presume the Minister agrees there is a difference between the status of a Member of this House, someone who has been elected to this House, and the status of someone who has not gone before the electorate and been elected but simply happens to be a sister, brother, daughter or son of a Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite simply, he is elected.  However, as against that, 166 Members are elected to this House, but the number of Ministers is fewer than that and consequently the person making the appointment makes a selective decision from among those elected.  The Deputy must well know that the question of debarring a person who happens to be a relation from office is not the point, but whether they are appropriate, qualified and suitable for the office.  In the case of secretaries nobody knows better than the TD who is best qualified to run the affairs in their constituency during the period that the TD serves because these secretaries are expected to give round the clock service.

      <P>Generally, I will undertake my duties in line with the normal procedures relating to collective responsibility in Government.  For the first time in the history of this State there will be a Minister whose primary responsibility will be to ensure that women's issues and problems affecting disadvantaged groups in our society are voiced at the Cabinet table.</P>
      <P>Ministers and Departments have direct responsibility in their own areas of activity for compliance with the general equality principles adopted by the Government.  I will undertake a general monitoring role with the assistance of my partnership programme manager, Mr. Paul Mulhern.</P>

      <P>When vacancies arise on State boards, prior to the new appointments being made by the Minister responsible for the board concerned, will the Minister for Equality and Law Reform submit to that Minister the names of the people proposed to be appointed so as to ensure that there is gender proofing, that men and women are treated equally and that there is greater representation by women on State boards in the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has agreed that gender proofing will apply in regard to such appointments.  It is my responsibility to monitor that.  All Ministers have agreed at Cabinet that close attention will be paid to the issue of gender representation when new <Col N="796" /> appointments are made.  That applies equally to the constitution of new boards being set up to ensure that the appropriate proportions are strictly adhered to. It will apply also to the filling of vacancies. Since my appointment as Minister some appointments have been made and I can assure the House that in all cases the requirements in regard to gender proportions have been strictly adhered to.  I will continue to ensure that that is the case.  Indeed, all Ministers have indicated their willingness to comply with that principle, which is Government policy.</P>

The Government's objective is to ensure that this programme is not put on a shelf and forgotten. It contains many important Labour Party policies which Labour Ministers are anxious to have implemented within the timespan of this Government.  For example, I have referred already to some of the 210 recommendations in the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women and the major undertaking it will be to advance as many of those as possible, not alone within my Department but in all the Departments of State. My programme manager has been given the task of liaising with all Departments to ensure that a careful watch is kept on <Col N="799" /> the activities in all Departments to ensure that those recommendations, which we all want to see implemented, are implemented as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 12, 19, 20 and 33 together.</P>
      <P>My role in relation to persons with a disability will be essentially a co-ordinating one.  I would hope to achieve a sharper focus and increased effectiveness in the various services provided by the Departments of Education, Health and Environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Programme for a Partnership Government, the Government committed itself to eliminating inequality for <Col N="800" /> all groups in society including persons with a disability.  Responsibility for seeing that such equality becomes a reality through various reforms rests with me, on behalf of the Government.</P>
    <P>The programme outlines the Government's broad proposals to enhance the rights of persons with a mental handicap and to ensure the full expression of equality for persons with physical and sensory disabilities.</P>
    <P>As regards employment for disabled persons, the Government has undertaken to give a lead by honouring the pledge whereby the 3 per cent quota for employment in the public service for those with a physical or other disability will be observed.  My colleague, the Minister for Finance, has responsibility for employment in the Civil Service.  The overall percentage of persons with disabilities employed in the Civil Service is currently over 2 per cent.  Civil Service Departments with a low representation of staff with disabilities are being encouraged to increase that representation where feasible, taking into account their overall staffing needs.  No person with disabilities has been recruited to the Civil Service since I took office on 12 January 1993.  Details of the number of persons with disabilities recruited to the public service since I took office are not readily available.</P>
    <P>Serious consideration will also be given, in consultation with the social partners, to formulating legislation for an employment quota throughout the economy.</P>
    <P>Up to now, most of the services for the disabled have been administered by or on behalf of the Minister for Health and are closely linked with the general health and medical services.</P>
    <P>Discussions have already taken place between staff of my Department and officers of the Department of Health to explore how the proposals in the programme could best be implemented.  Subjects under discussion include the degree of integration in current service arrangements, the effectiveness of service and impact on client groups, implications of <Col N="801" /> possible changes and ensuring clarity of respective responsibilities in the future.</P>
    <P>The conclusion of the current round of discussions should enable me to clarify my role and responsibilities in relation to disabled persons.  In that context, I hope to ensure that, despite the very difficult unemployment situation generally, the employment prospects of disabled persons will be safeguarded and, if at all possible, enhanced.</P>
    <P>The question of extending to disabled people the protection given against the gender discrimination will be examined and appropriate legislative action will be taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that at central and local government level there has been no adherence to applying any real quota in the recruitment of disabled people?  As well as seeking to ensure that the 3 per cent quota, to which Governments in the past were committed, will be observed, will the Minister take an initiative to encourage local authorities when recruiting new employees to specifically seek to provide jobs for the disabled?  Would the Minister agree that at a time when there are more than 300,000 people unemployed it is even more difficult for disabled persons to obtain employment within the general economy and that approximately 80 per cent of those who are disabled and available for employment cannot find it?</P>

      <P>I agree with the comments of Deputy Shatter.  I will inquire of local authorities as to what plans they have to increase the proportion of disabled people working in local authorities.  As public authorities they have a major responsibility in this area.  As regards increasing the number of disabled people in Government Departments, the overall numbers taken on have been negligible with the result that it has not been possible during the period of non-recruitment to redress the imbalance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="802" /> The old Department of Labour was among the best of all Departments in recruiting disabled people.  In the building in which my office is situated there are many disabled people at various levels fulfilling their jobs in a first class way. They are just as effective as people with all their faculties.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the commitments in the Programme for a Partnership Government I intend to examine the feasibility of legislation to prohibit discrimination on a wide range of grounds including age.  My Department will engage in extensive consultations during the preparation of the legislative proposals as regards the employment and non-employment issues concerned.

      <P>Will the Minister agree that discrimination is essentially a matter to be dealt with by him?  Would he agree that the Programme for Government gives a commitment to bring in equal status legislation prohibiting discrimination on the grounds of age? Would he agree that to have an age barrier <Col N="804" /> in recruitment to the public service generally, particularly an age limit as low as 27 years, is discriminatory against people of both genders?  Would he agree that as Minister for Equality and Law Reform he should take responsibility for ending discrimination and that it is not a matter for another Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in that the question of discrimination, which is a complex matter, has been deputed to me and is under close examination in my Department.  It is my intention to bring in an anti-discrimination measure as soon as possible to unravel the complexities of all aspects of the matter.  In the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> the Government gave a commitment to a policy of substantially raising recruitment age limits throughout the public sector and, following that commitment, the upper age limit for recruitment to most posts in the Civil Service, local authorities and health boards has been increased to 50 years.  In keeping with the partnership approach reflected in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> it is hoped that these initiatives will provide a stimulus for similar action in the wider public and private sector.  The question of age discrimination generally in the field of employment and so on is under examination in the Department and I hope to devise some measures in that regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that illogical age discriminations are applied in a wide variety of walks of Irish life? For example, is the Minister aware of, and does he intend to take action in relation to the apparent approach of local authorities and the Garda Síochána whereby persons under the age of 35 years are not appointed to the position of traffic warden on the basis that they are temperamentally unsuited to the position whereas those over 35 years magically qualify for such a position?  Would the Minister agree that in the context of the numbers unemployed at present, when the position of traffic warden becomes available vacancies should be filled on <Col N="805" /> the basis of merit rather than of age and that discrimination in this regard should end?  Would he also agree that discrimination by health boards, in not placing children for adoption with couples where the husband or wife is over 35 years of age, should be prohibited and that suitability for adoption should be based on people's suitability as parents rather than on age?  Will the Minister look in a comprehensive way at some of the rather odd, <i>ad hoc</i> and arbitrary age discriminations that a variety of bodies funded by the State are applying throughout society?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree broadly with the Deputy's comments.  It would not be a matter of looking at specific examples of age discrimination in a particular institution. I am concerned about general discrimination on the grounds of age.  It is inappropriate that it should be assumed that because a person is either below or above a certain age he is not suited for a job or to carry out a duty.  I agree that there can be discrimination on the grounds of age where that, of necessity, will disqualify a person; but the basis of appointments ought to be the capability of a person to carry out the job concerned.  However, it is not quite as simple as that, since there are complex situations which must be looked at.  We are looking at legislation on this question and how this is operated in other countries, particularly in the US and Australia where there is quite a lot of legislation on this.  It has worked well in some areas, although in others difficulty has ensued. It forms part of the anti-discrimination Bill on which we are working.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 21 together.</P>
      <P>The subject of family courts is at present being examined by the Law Reform Commission.  Once the commission's report has been received the matter will be considered fully by Government.</P>
      <P>The designation of individual judges to specialise in one category of case would raise the question of how this could be achieved having regard to the independence of the Judiciary from the Executive and to the functions and responsibilities that the Chief Justice and the President of the other courts have for the overall allocation of the business of their courts.</P>
      <P>Proposals for alteration in the day-to-day operation of the courts' services, including the arrangements for the hearing of family law cases, as well as questions regarding training for the Judiciary, would essentially be matters for the Minister for Justice to examine in consultation, where appropriate, with the Judiciary.</P>
      <P>I will, of course, be liaising closely with my colleague, the Minister for Justice, in an endeavour to ensure that the service offered by our family courts matches to the greatest possible extent the requirements of those who need to avail of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that all judges are not suitable <Col N="807" /> to hear family law cases, that a certain sensitivity is required to hear the kind of cases involved and would he agree that there be no interference with the independence of the Judiciary if the Chief Justice were asked to designate members to hear family cases only?  Will the Minister further agree that the all party Committee on Marriage Breakdown recommended this?  Would the Minister further agree that to wait for another report from the Law Reform Commission is not satisfactory, given the great trauma and distress being caused to many people who have to go before our family courts at the moment, given the lack of facilities, the manner in which some cases are held and the lack of understanding many members of the Judiciary have of this area, which many of them regard as being something that should not be brought before the law?  Some members of the Judiciary have an inferior attitude to the whole question of family law.  This is unsatisfactory and it places many families who are already in distress in an even worse situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that some judges have not practised in that area during their careers as solicitors or at the bar and perhaps do not have as great an interest in this branch of the law as they might.  It is open to the Chief Justice or the Presidents of the High Court, the Circuit Court or the District Court to appoint particular judges and designate them to attend in the courts hearing family law cases.  It is desirable that they should exercise great care in whom they appoint.  I hope they will do that.  I have no problem with asking the Minister for Justice to suggest to the Chief Justice and the Presidents of the courts that they might take the utmost care in designating particular judges to hear family cases. Ideally we should have special family courts and a judge with particular qualifications and training to deal with cases that require great sensitivity and specialisation. In the UK they have special family law divisions which permanently sit on that basis.  Judges could not be <Col N="808" /> compelled to attend training courses but they could be invited to attend seminars and discuss their work with social workers and other specialists in that field. These measures would be progressive and I would suggest them to my colleague, the Minister for Justice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms F. Fitzgerald Ms F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has more or less answered by question, which was if the Minister supported the idea that the Judiciary should have access to special training and seminars, particularly in the areas of sexual abuse, violence in the family and child sexual abuse, as their counterparts have access to such training in the UK.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said to Deputy Harney, I agree that that would be essential, particularly since the operation of the Separation Act, 1989, and the vastly increased volume of work now passing through the courts as a result of that Act, which Deputy Shatter piloted through the House and which has been a great help to so many people.  It is particularly important that the judges should be specialists in this field.  It requires a specialised knowledge in more than just law.  It requires a knowledge of family circumstances.  Fortunately, we have specialists in various fields who could be of great help to the Judiciary in their work, not only with spouses but with children.  These courts are concerned with the care and custody of children, their advancement and so on.  That would be an ideal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister believes that the ideal is to establish family courts &mdash; and the Minister supported that ideal when both he and I were members of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Marriage Breakdown &mdash; will he introduce legislation to establish special family courts, as this is now an area which comes within his Ministerial competence?  If the Minister introduces legislation to provide for the establishment of family courts he will have the wholehearted support of this side of the House.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is not quite right in stating that it comes within my ambit.  It is a reserve function of the Department of Justice to set up courts. The administration of the courts system remains with the Department of Justice and has not been devolved to me.  The whole question of family courts is being examined by the Law Reform Commission and I hope they will make recommendations to the Government.  I am sure they will recommend the establishment of family courts and will give suggestions as to the <i>modus operandi</i> of this court.  When the report comes through I will ensure that it is fully considered by the Government and I hope it will be possible for the Minister for Justice to introduce legislation to implement its recommendations.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that from time to time there have been inappropriate judgments and methods in court in relation to family law and that this will continue until we get the report from the Law Reform Commission?  At the moment part of the difficulty people experience in court is the onus on the individual to have legal representation.  Is the Minister aware that for many people going into court on a traumatic family issue, particularly in relation to domestic violence, the individual is totally unprepared and very often unable to deal with the court process?  Would he consider that the inclusion of more women in the Juciciary would be beneficial?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in stating that inappropriate decisions are, on occasion, handed down by family law courts but inappropriate decisions are not the prerogative of the family law courts. From time to time inappropriate decisions are handed down by all courts and that is the reason we have appeal procedures and frequently decisions are overruled.</P>

Would the Minister agree that it would be preferable to introduce this new legislation and if we are to have another divorce referendum the Government should take steps prior to that referendum to establish a specialised system of family courts so that judges asked to deterimine such cases are fully qualified.

      <Quest>the reason no additional money was provided for the Council for the Status of Women in the 1993 Estimates, in view of the important work undertaken by the Council and the importance attached to enhancing the rights of women in the Programme for a Partnership Government 1993 to 1997; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The Council for the Status of Women received a grant of £114,000 in the 1993 Estimates, the same provision as for 1992.</P>
      <P>When I met the Council on 16 February of this year I explained to them that no increase in their grant was possible this year due to the tight fiscal situation. I also assured them that the Government would try to consider their funding situation sympathetically in future years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that his grant represents a net reduction when inflation is taken into account and that the work of the Council for the Status of Women is of vital importance to the achievement of equal rights for women?  Is the Minister, due to the huge demand on the councils services, disappointed with the allocation which represents a reduction in real terms?  Would he agree that women on low incomes who are caught in the poverty trap and who could benefit most from the work of the council will suffer? Unless additional money is given to the council it will not be able to target these people.</P>

      <P>I fully agree that the Council for the Status of Women is doing excellent work and is worthy of the full support of the Government.  The Estimate concerned was virtually concluded before my appointment.  Unfortunately, the timing was wrong from that point of view.  When I met the Council for the Status of Women on 16 February they also raised the question of funding to other schemes with which the are concerned, namely, the civil legal aid scheme and the family mediation service.  The funding for those services was increased by 7 per cent in 1993.  Increased funding is also provided for locally based women's groups with which they are concerned.  Grants have been increased by 50 per cent from £500,000 in 1992 to £750,000 in 1993 and the carer's allowance allocation was increased by 5 per cent, from £10.5 million in 1992 to £11 million in 1993.  The Government is concerned to make the optimum use of the limited resources available and certainly next year I will be keeping the needs of the Council for the Status of Women under close review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's indication of further support for the council in the future.  The allocation for this year does not reflect the commitment given in the Programme for Government to equality.  It is one thing to accept equality in principle but to put it into practice is another matter.  There should have been an increase in the allocation. The demands on the council have increased greatly in terms of women seeking information and advice.  I understand it has submitted a lengthy programme to the Minister and, perhaps, he would consider financing some of the projects through partnership seminars or other means.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Equality and Law Reform</askee>
      <Quest>if he will accept that, despite the implementation of equal pay legislation, the average earnings for women at work is approximately 70 per cent of men and that this arises because of the difficulties in defining work of equal value; and if so, the action, if any, he proposes to take on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Recent statistics for gross earnings and hours of work of industrial workers (adult rates) indicate that the average female hourly earnings in manufacturing industry is approximately 70 per cent of average male hourly earnings.</P>
      <P>The existence of such a gap between the earnings of female and male workers in industrial employment indicates the persistence of inequalities between men and women in this employment area.  The extent to which this arises from difficulties in defining work of equal value has not been adequately established.  Factors contributing to this gap include not only differing occupational patterns as between men and women but also differing work organisation patterns and remuneration systems.</P>
      <P>While the disparity in the male-female earnings shown is a problem in industrial work where many women find themselves in low pay areas and confined to a restricted range of jobs the exent of any disparity in male-female earnings for other sectors is not as clear.</P>
      <P>I have noted the acknowledgment in the Report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women of the body of expertise built up by equality officers and the Labour Court in the evaluation of different jobs using sex-neutral factors in the application of equal pay law.  I consider that this is an important factor of our adjudication process.</P>
      <P>In an effort to determine the reasons for differentials in the earnings of male and female workers across employment sectors the former Department of Labour, in conjunction with the Employment Equality Agency, commissioned research by the ESRI.  I hope this work will be completed later this year and that it will provide a valuable insight into problems of unequal pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must stress that finding the solution to the differential in pay between men <Col N="814" /> and women does not lie in equal pay legislation alone but in improved access for women to a wider range of jobs. Nevertheless there are a number of changes I am proposing to make to the provisions of Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974 and the Employment Equality Act, 1977, in the context in the general review of the employment equality legislation. These include provision for the removal of requirements that employees claiming equal pay must be employed in the same place of work or contemporaneously with the comparator cited.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's commitment to make some changes.  Can the Minister confirm whether there is a proposed European Community directive on work of equal value?  In conjunction with the research by the ESRI will his Department examine the pattern in Scandanavian countries where this problem does not arise?  Will the Minister agree that in many cases, particularly in the retail trade, women are grossly discriminated against and many of them are working for as little as £1.50 per hour? Would he agree that this is unacceptable in 1993?  What action can he take?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree wholeheartedly with the Deputy that that is totally unacceptable. I am not aware of a pending EC directive on the subject but I will include some useful amendments in the legislation which I intend to bring in to consolidate the 1974 and 1977 Acts.  As I said, some of those amendments will be helpful.  When that Bill reaches Committee Stage we can look at the issue in greater detail and if any legislative means can be devised for improving the situation further I can assure the Deputy I will consider it sympathetically.  I am hopeful that the ESRI report, which we will ask the institute to expedite &mdash; I understand it may be published before too long &mdash; will contain some helpful suggestions.  If any of those suggestions can be incorporated in the new legislation I will be happy to try to do so.</P>

Will he agree to act immediately to open up VTOS schemes to women who are excluded at present because they cannot go on the live register as they are dependants?  Is the Minister aware that many thousands of women &mdash; from the many cases I am aware of this certainly seems to be the situation &mdash; who want to get training skills and want to be able to get good quality jobs are barred from getting places on VTOS schemes simply because they are on the book system of social welfare rather than claiming the dole?</P>

      <P>The VTOS scheme comes under the Department of Enterprise and Employment and I suggest that the Deputy put down a question to the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  I agree that there has to be positive discrimination on the training issue in favour of women and that one of the reasons women earn low wages is the level of work women in industry, in particular, still do.  Unfortunately they still tend to be segregated in low skill and restricted areas of work.  That has to change and everything has to be done &mdash; so far as my Department is concerned everything will be done &mdash; to ensure that discrimination takes place on a positive basis to try to remedy that problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>In case there is any misunderstanding, I wish to make the point that what I am concerned about in regard to this matter is that where women and men do the same job very often the discrimination exists because of the titles which are given to the jobs.  For example, a female cook and a male chef sometimes get paid very different rates of pay for the same work, maybe because they work different hours or patterns.  In cases where the qualifications are similar will the Minister make it discriminatory to pay different rates for the job?</P>

      <P>The equality officers and the Labour Court have built up a large area of expertise on this subject and they are adept in cases of that nature, of ensuring that there is equal pay for equal work. If the Deputy is aware of particular cases these should be referred to the equality officers, who are skillful and have done first class work in achieving the level of success achieved so far in this area.  The position in this respect has been substantially <Col N="817" /> improved over the past ten years but more needs to be done.

    <P>I am also aware of reports made by various bodies for the improvement of the scheme and I am, indeed, in sympathy <Col N="818" /> with many of the proposals made by these bodies.  My concern is to secure the development and expansion of the scheme to the maximum possible extent in so far as the financial resources at my disposal will allow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to his first round of Question Time. I wish to stress to the Minister my interest in the question of access to our courts. First, does he not accept that it is quite outrageous, after 70 years of independence, that we have a system of unequal access to the courts and would he not accept that it should be a basic right of democracy to have such equality of access?  Does he not accept also that the commitment in the Programme for Government is inadequate to provide that equality of access?  The programme contains a commitment to put the legal aid scheme on a statutory basis, which is fair enough, and a vague commitment to provide additional resources.  However, there is no guarantee that there will be an adequate system to ensure access to the courts for all citizens in all circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to say that I sympathise fully with the statements made by the Deputy.  However, I do not agree that the Programme for Government is not on the right lines.  It is very important that the scheme be put on a statutory basis.  In that way people will at least have their rights delineated in a statutory manner and will know exactly where they stand, something which has not happened since the scheme was brought in. The resources needed by the scheme are a very important aspect of the matter. There has been a modest increase this year which I do not put forward to the House as being adequate to meet the needs which arise.  I intend over the term of the Government to do my utmost to <Col N="819" /> ensure that increased resources to the maximum possible extent, consonant with available Government resources, are directed towards the scheme.  It is important that access to justice is not denied to people on the grounds of lack of funds.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that the income limit of just over £6,000 is grossly inadequate?  Would he agree that if the Pringle report was to be implemented in full approximately £7 million per year would have to be spent on the scheme, and not approximately £3 million as is the case at present?  I should say I welcome the 7 per cent increase in the funding for the scheme.  Does the Minister intend to extend the scheme to cover defamation cases, test cases, cases before inquests and tribunals, landlord and tenant matters and matters relating to civil bills under £150?  Does he agree that the scheme is much too narrow at present?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Since taking office a few weeks ago I have initiated a review of the entire civil legal aid scheme as it operates. I am meeting with the full Legal Aid Board next week to discuss with it a number of ideas I have to expand the scheme and get better value for the money which is available this year to operate the scheme.  I will also be meeting with the Law Society to discuss some aspects of the matter.  It has issued a report on the subject and made a number of suggestions which I want to discuss with it.  It will be my intention to ensure that the maximum possible resources are obtained every year for this scheme.  The extent to which it will be possible to expand the availability of the scheme, as requested by Deputy Harney and with which I agree, will, of course, depend on the resources which can be made available to the scheme from public funds. That will depend on the budgetary position in each year.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that this system is not operating, <Col N="820" /> that many people do not have access to free legal aid because of waiting lists and because of geographic distance?  I know of many instances in Wicklow where women taking cases in the family court are dependent on the goodwill of local solicitors.  It is a kind of Vincent de Paul approach to the law and it is not suitable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy. I am well aware that the scheme as it has operated has not adequately met the needs of the situation.  A substantial expansion of this scheme is necessary. That means money, which depends on budgetary provisions.  It will be my intention to secure the maximum possible extension of the scheme during the period of the partnership Government.  I also intend to investigate ways of getting better value for money in order to expand the scheme.  The Law Society is anxious to involve private practitioners in the operation of the scheme and I have a meeting scheduled with the Law Society within the next couple of weeks to discuss this matter.  It seems that private practitioners will have an important role to play in the scheme but I have to discuss a pilot arrangement to see how it will operate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding civil legal aid, will the Minister agree that what we have in place is a bare skeleton of what was originally proposed in the Pringle Report?  I am not critical of those who work in the scheme but it is so inadequate that we cannot be proud of it.  We need more resources to expand the existing centres in urban areas, but consideration should also be given to the vast tracts of <Col N="821" /> countryside where there is no access.  Will the Minister take a radical approach?  If he accepts the concept of entitlement to access to justice for everybody he has a huge job on hand and I would urge him to get on with it and make sure it is done in a fresh, radical way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>

      <P>I have identified as an immediate priority the introduction of new employment equality legislation. The existing proposals for legislation in the area are under examination in the light of the commitments in the Programme for a Partnership Government and the recommendations of the Second Commission on the Status of Women.</P>
      <P>In particular, I am concerned to ensure that all options are fully examined for broadly based legislation that will prohibit discrimination, not only on the grounds of sex or marital status, but on a wider range of grounds.

Other institutional changes may be necessary.  For example, the Employment Equality Agency may have to be extended to cover areas other than employment.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to set a deadline for such complex legislation.  One has to be careful to set its parameters just right so as not to catch more than one intends or allow to escape things one wishes to catch in the legislation.  It is a complex matter and it requires great care.  I do not want to bring in legislation that will face challenges in the courts, or may be found to be unconstitutional or present other difficulties.  For those reasons I am reluctant to give any deadline to the Deputy except to say that I, and the Government, regard it as a matter of priority.  My Department will be working on it all the time.  We intend to look at comparable legislation in other countries, particularly the UK and the United States, to see what they have done and learn from their mistakes.</P>
      <P>I would point out that we are, and have been, very slow in bringing in legislation of this type.  Similar legislation was introduced in the United Kingdom, for example, as far as back as 1975, and it is high time we tackled this issue.  I do regard this as a matter of some importance.</P>

In particular, I will be giving special attention to legislative proposals relating to anti-discrimination in employment and to family home protection legislation.  I will also be introducing legislation on adoptive leave.</P>

      <P>The preparation of an equal status Bill, which will afford anti-discriminatory protection in relation to education in the provision of goods, facilities and services and in the disposal of accommodation will also be on my priority list.  However, this measure raises very complex issues and extensive consultation with affected groups must take place before details of legislation are formulated.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to hear that included in the Minister's hierarchy of projects for 1993 is the implementation of the recommendations in the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women.  I recommended to the Minister &mdash; I hope he will confirm this &mdash; that he set up a monitoring committee to link with the respective Ministers so that they will take a pro-active role in implementing the recommendations of the report.  That is vital.  The Minister did not mention reform of the law on nullity.  How far down on the Minister's list is that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The reform of the law on nullity is at an advanced stage of preparation. It will probably be broadly in line with the proposals contained in the White Paper on marital breakdown.  We are looking at that and advancing it to the legislative process.</P>
      <P>So far as monitoring the implementation of the recommendations of the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women is concerned, I confirmed to the House on Friday last that it is my intention to set up some form of monitoring arrangement to oversee the implementation of the 210 recommendations. Deputy O'Rourke, the Minister of State, indicated that she had set up a small monitoring group in her Department.  I will be encouraging other Departments to set up either a similar type of monitoring group or at least designate one senior official to monitor those developments within their Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, I have asked my programme manager to accept responsibility and he has agreed to keep a constant watch on other Departments and ascertain from them from time to time what progress they are making on the implementation of the recommendations. <Col N="827" /> It is a major task but, with the co-operation of the Departments concerned and of the Members of the House who are interested, we hope to make substantial improvements during the term of office of this Government.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister propose to have discussions with his ministerial colleagues who also will have a huge bearing on the implementation of his equality proposals, particularly equality of opportunity in relation to housing?  I note his recommendations in relation to the family home.

      <P>That is precisely why that is provided for in the agreed programme for Government.  The Labour and Fianna Fáil parties in this agreement for Government, recognised the necessity for those provisions.  Certainly, we will be preparing legislation which will deal with the question of discrimination in relation to access to premises.  All relevant Departments will be consulted in the course of the prepartation of that legislation, particularly the Departments of Justice and the Environment.  We are working on that legislation.  I look forward to bringing it before the House soon and, in particular, to the debate on Committee Stage.  Due to its complexity we will need to examine it carefully and, perhaps, one of the special committees will be in operation then.  I will look with sympathy at constructive amendments to the Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Would the Minister agree that it is important, that all of the matters in the <Col N="828" /> White Paper that require legislation be legislated for well in advance of the public debate on the divorce referendum? Would he agree also to pursue within Government, perhaps with the Government Chief Whip, the possibility of having a debate in this House, such as we had last Friday, on the White Paper as that would be very useful for all the Members?  Perhaps we could have such a debate some time in the next six weeks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank Deputy Harney for the kind comments which I very much appreciate.  Obviously it will be essential, in the context of the divorce referendum, that the necessary legislation be in place.</P>
      <P>The main item will be the Matrimonial Home Bill, as it will be called, to put the family home into joint names.  That is at a very advanced stage and, hopefully, it will be possible to introduce it, if not this term, certainly next term.  The Family Law (No. 1) Bill, as scheduled in the White Paper, will be the other item, having regard to the fact that it sets out the property position and the position that the courts would have in dealing with property distributions on separation.  The same situation will apply in relation to divorce.</P>
      <P>It is important, and I agree absolutely with Deputy Harney, that the debate on the issue in the country as well as in this House, get under way as quickly as possible so that people will be given the opportunity to understand what is involved.  I think that was one of the problems on the last occasion.  Deputy Harney's suggestion about a debate on the White Paper in the House is a very good one.  Such a debate could play a very important role in advancing the debate generally in the country.  I will certainly have a word with the Chief Whip about it and I suggest that Deputy Harney also ask her party Whip to raise the matter at the next Whips meeting.  It would be appropriate to put aside a Friday as soon as possible to debate it.</P>

      <P>The Minister and the Government are talking about introducing an MOT test on vehicles here during the coming year.  I urge the Minister to delay introducing this mandatory test on vehicles until such time as the standards of our roads are equal to those on the European mainland.  How can vehicles being used here be up to European standard when the roads they are traversing daily are not up to European standard?  We should be advocating the provision of additional finance to bring the condition of our county roads, our national and primary roads up to standard. Then and only then should a mandatory MOT test be introduced.</P>
      <P>I wish to remind the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Hyland, that it is obvious there is something seriously wrong in his Department regarding the payment of cattle headage, beef premiums, suckler cow grants, etc.  I am led to believe that these payments have been delayed because of frivolous errors in the completion of the application forms.  This is something that could easily be eradicated in the local district veterinary offices if they were given the go-ahead from the Department.  There is too much bureaucracy attached to these schemes. Young farmers today would need to be professors to complete these forms to the satisfaction of the European bureaucrats. Who are they codding?  Why can the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry not introduce flexibility into the system for the plain, ordinary people and not penalise them for a frivolous mistake while completing the applications form?</P>

      <P>The 2 per cent probate tax introduced by the Minister could be described as negative and regressive.  I am sure it will have a very serious consequence as far as the transfer of property <Col N="856" /> in this country is concerned.  It is only the forerunner of a large imposition of tax in the years to come.  There is nothing to stop a future Minister for Finance increasing that probate tax to an unbearable limit for people wishing to transfer their properties.</P>
      <P>The carer's allowance is a sham.  Only someone who is completely penniless can avail of it.  Who are we fooling?  In my view we do not have a carer's allowance; it is an allowance by false pretence.  I urge the Minister to take steps immediately to rectify those anomalies, to let commonsense prevail and give those people an opportunity to care for their elderly relatives at home without having to go through the rigours of a means test.  The Department's officials are under orders to investigate cases, and even if a housewife has only two hens they would be considered for income tax purposes.</P>

      <P>I welcome the injection of £20 million to the health service to alleviate waiting lists in the orthopaedic, cardiovascular, ophthalmic and ENT areas.  The dispersal of additional moneys to health boards is anxiously awaited.  I hope those moneys will be used for the purpose for which they were intended that, for instance, they will be used to provide an orthopaedic service in the county hospital in Castlebar and to allow the appointment of two orthopaedic surgeons to deal with the chronic orthopaedic problems that exist in the Mayo area, particularly in relation to hip replacements and general orthopaedics. I also look forward to the initiation of the second phase of the county hospital in Castlebar.  The provision of long stay beds for geriatric patients must be encouraged.  District hospitals can play a major role in freeing up acute beds in <Col N="857" /> general hospitals by accepting long term patients from the acute institutions.</P>
      <P>The allocation of £8 million for the handicapped and disabled is very welcome. The handicapped must always be one of our main concerns.  I commend the Minister for Health and the Minister for Social Welfare for their efforts in that area.</P>
      <P>The £6 casualty and outpatient consultation fee probably does not represent a step forward because of the administration problems that will be created.  It is my belief that a patient who has a referral letter from a GP should not have to pay any fee for casualty services or urgent care in a hospital.</P>
      <P>The across the board increase in social welfare payments in line with inflation is to be commended, and I especially welcome the increase in child benefit. The carer's allowance merits special attention.  Recognition must be given to the benefit to those who are cared for and also to the benefits that accrue to many a family and society in general.  The creation of a respite fund is a new and welcome initiative.</P>
      <P>In the long term, however, the social welfare system will have to be overhauled to incorporate an element of work and work ethic into some social welfare payments. I am sure the Minister for Social Welfare will have some thought-provoking suggestions in that regard during the life of this Government.</P>

      <P>The injection of £500 million for the capital works programme is beneficial for the creation of jobs.  I hope that some of the money for infrastructure will go west, especially to my constituency of Mayo East, in order to promote industry and tourism in the area. Mayo has no national primary road leading to the coast and it is my hope that the N57 roadway will be designated a national primary route from Swinford to Ballina in order to provide proper access to north Mayo.  Such designation would help in the development of industry and <Col N="858" /> tourism and would help to facilitate the development of the new deep-sea port in the Killala Bay area, as envisaged in the Programme for a Partnership Government.</P>
      <P>The increase in housing allocations will alleviate the pressure on all county councils and urban councils.  I compliment Minister Stagg for his efforts in this area of his responsibility.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that the urban renewal programme is to be extended for only six months as the economic conditions that have prevailed and still prevail do not lend to speedy development in these areas.  I am also disappointed that some areas were designated before others.  My own area of Ballina was designated only in 1990 whereas other areas had schemes up and running before then.  I ask the Minister to review the urban renewal programme in order to extend the time available for completion of projects commensurate with the time that the projects were first designated.</P>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister for Finance desisted from increased borrowings and I congratulate him on not borrowing excessively.  He has adhered to the guidelines of the Maastricht Treaty and that adherence will prove beneficial.</P>
      <P>In general the budget is a holding budget, one that waits for the international recession to subside and for money markets to stabilise yet gives the economy a worthwhile injection.  The budget has proved to be worthwhile exercise that will steer our country towards further social, economic and other success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I first congratulate my colleague, Deputy Moffat, on his maiden speech in the House.  He made a valuable contribution, dealing with issues in his own constituency and with national issues.  I hope that he will be in the House for many long years to make many more contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must all endorse the central theme of the budget, the creation of jobs.  I do not have to dwell on the very serious position we are in, with 300,000 people unemployed.  The budget goes a long way <Col N="859" /> towards creating many jobs, particularly through the new jobs fund and through the county enterprise partnership boards. The Government is committed to the creation of jobs.  Because of the short time available in the debate, I shall deal with one or two aspects of job creation.</P>
    <P>The first question I should like to address is whether the State by its actions and activities brings about a loss of jobs at any time.  In referring to the State, I include Government Departments, State organisations, semi-State organisations and local authorities.  I recognise the commitment and the dedication of those who work throughout the public service and I recognise the tremendous job they do on behalf of the people of this country. Nevertheless, there is a gap between the theory of job creation and the implementation of policies.  I believe that each and every branch of the State apparatus should examine its own policies for job creation and determine whether in any of its activities it might sometimes bring about job losses.  While Government Departments and local authorities make a major contribution to job creation, there are times when for a variety of reasons job opportunities are lost.  In this regard, I think of a meat factory that received an order for 20,000 tonnes of beefburgers to go to a country outside the EC but lost the order because of a delay by two Departments of State in implementing a European Directive.</P>
    <P>The anti-pollution regulations are another area that could be examined.  I am very much opposed to the pollution of our waters.  We were handed on clean water and there is an obligation on us to hand it on to those who come after us.  I ask, though, whether at times the law might be implemented too rigorously if account is taken of the impact on job creation.</P>
    <P>I question whether State and semi-State bodies have achieved the right degree of co-operation and co-ordination in their activities so that every opportunity is taken to create jobs and to make sure that no jobs are lost.</P>
    <P>Perhaps local authorities should examine <Col N="860" /> the planning process.  While I fully support the planning legislation passed by the House, which is important in the interests of the people, I wonder whether there might be times when delays in processing planning applications, resulting from an overly bureaucratic approach, may cause a loss of jobs or a postponement in the commencement of jobs. It is important for all of us to recognise that every applicant for planning permission is a potential job creator.  Even if someone is applying only to build a wall at the front of a house and even if he or she intends to build it himself or herself, there are jobs involved with the companies that produce the blocks, the cement and so on.  Because everyone who applies to a local authority for planning permission is a potential job creator it is important that the authorities take a very positive approach to ensure that everything possible is done to maintain existing jobs and to create new jobs.</P>
    <P>The same principle could be applied to the health boards.  Environmental health officers have a big responsibility and I fully support the job they have to do and the work they are doing.  But again there has to be a balance between implementation of the law and the provision of opportunities for job creation.</P>
    <P>We could also say the same in regard to legislation passed in the House.  The House recently passed legislation, required by the European Community, relating to part time workers.  There were reports of the case of an elderly couple who owned a shop and employed a girl to work in it.  Because of the rules and regulations laid down the couple were no longer able to employ the girl, even though she wanted to continue working for them.  Every Member of the House wants to protect workers &mdash; there is no question about that &mdash; but it is important that we do not unnecessarily make legislation that might in any way impede opportunities for job creation.  I represent a Border constituency and I recognise that it is important that we try to effect the implementation of European regulations at the same time as they are implemented on the other side of the <Col N="861" /> Border.  However, when implementing these regulations we should not put people at a disadvantage.</P>
    <P>Consideration should be given to the construction industry and the method of tendering.  When European funding is involved there is a system of open tendering and every builder is entitled to tender for such work.  Indeed excellent work has been done by many builders &mdash; some of them small businesses &mdash; around the country.  They got State contracts and did excellent work.  However, if European money is not involved it appears that there is selective tendering, the names of the same three or four big builders seem to appear all the time.  Small builders who have done excellent work for the State have complained to me about the different rules for different State schemes.  I should like to see open tendering because it is unfair that good, small builders have to lay off men while the big builders are taking them on because of the methods of selective tendering.</P>
    <P>In regard to Border trade, I compliment the Minister for Finance for not increasing the price of petrol.  I am sure every Deputy realised the problems in the Border economy in the early eighties when the price of petrol increased very rapidly on this side of the Border, which meant that people crossed the border to do their shopping.  Indeed busloads of people went from all over Ireland and the effect on Border towns was devastating. In the 1987 election Fianna Fáil committed itself to redress that situation.</P>

      <P>The Leader of Deputy Creed's party at that time went to Clones, told the people that goods were cheaper on the other side of the Border and to do their shopping there.  That was his contribution.  The 48 hour rule which, as I said, the then Deputy MacSharry introduced, redressed the imbalance.  I am glad that we now have towns along the Border with good economies.  It is Fianna Fáil policy to keep them that way and that is why I compliment the Minister for Finance for not increasing petrol, which could have caused a problem for Border towns.</P>

      <P>Currency and direct selling are causing problems.  The Single Market also needs to be monitored and I hope that will be done.  The Department of Finance must monitor very carefully its effect on trade.  To date I have not had any complaints, although I have made a number of inquiries to traders regarding the Single Market.  There are two aspects to it: one is the impact it may have on Border towns and the second is the impact it may have on employment generally in the State.  I am concerned about the second aspect because many goods are coming across the Border, which may lead to the displacement of workers.  It is something we must watch and we must work very hard to ensure that we maintain jobs in our part of the island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main thrust of Deputy Sheehan's contribution was that we should spend more money on our roads and agriculture, indeed everything, but that we should not levy new taxes &mdash; in other words, that we should not pay for anything. That is the kind of policy which the Government from 1987 to date has had to address.  It has done so very well, but it cannot provide services without paying for them.  I agree with Deputy Sheehan &mdash; and I am sure all Members <Col N="863" /> agree &mdash; that more money should be spent on our roads.  However, it should only be spent if it is available.  The same applies to all services.  I should like the Minister to work with his colleagues in Government and the European Commission to ensure that some of the vast sums of money allocated to this country for national primary roads will be transferred to county roads.</P>
    <P>I referred to the problems associated with Government Departments, semi-State bodies and local authorities in maintaining jobs or creating new ones. There should be a rapid response mechanism to deal with problems when they arise.  I gave an example of the meat factory which had the export order. There should be some way whereby contact could be made with a group like that to ensure that every effort is made to support and facilitate them in finding and fulfilling their export orders.  Fianna Fáil has a very long and caring tradition, which is evident in the budget in the increases in social welfare in keeping with policies of Fianna Fáil Governments over the years.  Extra money will also be spent on the health service and the jobs fund, to which I have already referred and which was promised in the election runup, will be put in place.  Fianna Fáil never shirk any challenge or responsibility.</P>
    <P>A root and branch examination should be carried out in every Department, State and semi-State organisations and local authorities to see how a more positive contribution might be made to ensure that we maintain existing jobs and create further employment.  Indeed, one example which springs to mind is the area of health in which we have a very long and proud tradition.  I am sure that my colleague, Deputy Moffat, will agree that Irish health care is recognised worldwide, our nurses and doctors are accepted everywhere and there are opportunities to sell services abroad.  I know that the main thrust of the Department of Health is to provide services for our own people, nevertheless there are opportunities for selling health services abroad.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="864" /> Deputy Sheehan criticised the carer's allowance.  When Deputy Woods took office in 1987 there was a prescribed relative's allowance in place which paid £28 per week to a very limited number of designated relatives.  Deputy Woods, as Minister for Social Welfare, introduced the carer's allowance at a minimum payment of £50, an increase of £22 on the amount paid when Deputy Sheehan's party was in power.  Since the Minister for Social Welfare introduced this payment he has extended the range of people who qualify for it and in successive budgets the rate of payment has increased, in keeping with the traditions of Fianna Fáil to improve the services for our people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to be associated with your last remarks.  Before Deputy O'Hanlon leaves the House I should like to remind him that he has a very selective memory in regard to the 1982-87 administration.  It must be remembered when that Government came into office it inherited an economy in ruins, with inflation at 21 per cent. Deputy O'Hanlon also ignored the reality of price increases for petrol of 9p per gallon, according to today's newspapers. He criticised my colleague, Deputy Sheehan, in relation to spending without taxation.  If that is what Deputy Sheehan meant he had very good mentors.</P>
      <P>I am sure that the Minister of State, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, has good memories of the administration led by former Deputy Garret FitzGerald and the behaviour of her Government colleagues in terms of destructive Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Budget Statement is the backdrop to the political year and is significant for that reason.  It was awaited with bated breath as it was felt in many quarters that <Col N="865" /> this Government would be the Government to beat all other Governments. Public expectation was high; the people wished this Government well.</P>
    <P>The present situation is horrendous, over one million people are living in poverty, 300,000 are unemployed, crime levels are unprecedented and there is a general disillusionment with the political process.  Nobody contributed more to the level of expectation than the Labour Party and they have now disappointed more people than has any Government in the past.</P>
    <P>In my short time here I had the opportunity to listen to the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht Deputy Michael D. Higgins, then Opposition Deputy speak about the &ldquo;dehumanised economy&rdquo;.  I thought it was a very apt phrase as we were led to believe that the economy was going great guns but at the same time we had appalling levels of human despair and historic levels of unemployment and poverty.  At present in excess of 300,000 people are unemployed. In addition to the 300,000 unemployed, 40,000 people are on FÁS or preretirement schemes.  The budget provides for an additional 30,000 people on the live register.  In other words, this Government promises that level of increase in unemployment in its first year in office. That is an appalling starting point, the Government has thrown in the towel before it even started.  It has to be a lesson in the practicality of Labour Party politics that they can speak out of each side of the mouth at the same time.  In Opposition they can champion all the causes that need so badly to be addressed but when they join the &ldquo;mercs and perks brigade&rdquo; they forget completely about those whose causes they championed and upon whose backs they built their electoral success.  That is an appalling betrayal of the trust people placed in the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>During the recent election campaign we heard a great deal about the politics of exclusion and how this Government which comprises the Labour Party would end the politics of exclusion.  It is interesting to note, however, that public sector <Col N="866" /> pay has increased by 54 per cent since 1986 yet the numbers employed remain more or less static.  The public service pay bill for 1993 is £4.35 billion.  The social welfare bill has increased by 51 per cent since 1986 yet there are an additional 100,000 people dependent on social welfare. It is against that backdrop that people realised the Government would have to take radical steps to deal with the huge problems facing the country.  The reality is that this budget is a budget of inaction and aspirations rather than reality and will ultimately do nothing to help those who are so badly in need of assistance.</P>
    <P>Of course, this was not helped by the prolonged gestation period &mdash; the mating dance between Labour and Fianna Fáil took so long that the economy was dealt two knock-out blows in the intervening period.  The devaluation debacle cost us dearly and we then had the further blow from Digital in Galway which has added an additional 1,000 people to the live register.  That was a direct consequence of this Government's inaction because it was more concerned with positions of power and influence in the new Government than real politics.  That is nothing short of a national scandal.</P>
    <P>There are elements of the budget that I welcome.  For many years we campaigned for changes in the capital acquisitions tax and indeed the provisions in the budget go a certain way to alleviating the burden that people face when inheriting property.  The State expended millions on training young farmers who achieved the Green Certificate but the reality was that many were forced to walk away from their natural inheritance because they were liable to tax on inheritance.  The proposals in the budget go some way to alleviating that problem.  There is also provision for an early retirement scheme for farmers but this is part and parcel of the Common Agricultural Policy.  Many of the carrots in the budget have been announced so many times they have been flogged to death.  The £1 million provided for the early retirement scheme for farmers though inadequate is welcome.  It is a step in the right direction to encourage <Col N="867" /> land mobility.  It will enable those on whom the State has expended a great deal of money in training to take their place in agriculture.  That will be beneficial to production and should create jobs downstream.  This is a welcome development.</P>
    <P>However, this is destroyed in one fell swoop by the introduction of a 2 per cent probate tax on estates over £10,000 with the exclusion of the family home if it is inherited directly by the spouse.  This is an arbitrary figure and next year it could be 5 per cent or 10 per cent.  The tax on a holding valued at £250,000 &mdash; and this is not an extraordinary figure because for the purposes of this tax, the quota and the stock will be included in the valuation &mdash; will be £5,000 and this must be paid before a certificate of probate will issue. I think that undoes the good achieved by the reforms in the capital acquisitions tax. I appeal to the Minister to reconsider this measure.  The changes in capital acquisitions tax and the £1 million provided for the early retirement scheme will be undone in one fell swoop.  Personally, I do not recall the time when death duties were the scourge of those unfortunate enough to be afflicted by a death in the family but this probate tax is a step backwards, a step into the past.  It is a tax on death which will cause undue hardship to a great many families.  When one inherits a farm or a business, it is only of benefit when one can generate an income.  If one realises the asset to pay the tax then one no longer has an asset which can generate an income.  This is a hasty measure which has not been properly thought out.</P>
    <P>I would now like to deal with the educational provisions in the budget.  They are totally inadequate.  It is quite apparent the Minister for Education is incapable of fighting her corner at Cabinet. The reluctance of the Taoiseach this morning to stand over the Programme for a Partnership Government casts a dark shadow over its contents.  There are a number of commitments to education in that document.  It states that the priority at primary level is a reduction to 22 in the pupil-teacher ratio by September <Col N="868" /> 1996 and no class should be bigger than 29 pupils.</P>
    <P>I was interested also to note the proposed recruitment of 500 additional remedial teachers by September 1996. There is no provision in this year's Education Estimate for increasing the number of primary school teachers. Therefore, although the aspiration is to employ additional remedial teachers, none will be employed in 1993.  I am sure the Minister, and other members of the Government, are aware of the necessity for remedial teachers.  If children go off the rails in terms of education in primary school it is practically impossible to bring them back within the system at second level.  A commitment was given in this year's programme to provide additional counselling facilities at second level. However, if it is a case of deciding between primary and secondary, I urge that the resources be targeted at primary education because counselling at second level is merely fire brigade action.  One can maintain discipline and an interest in the educational system among pupils if they are identified and resources provided at primary level.  Given the documented evidence of the link between employment prospects and educational attainment, it would be a prudent investment in the future to appoint additional remedial teachers.</P>
    <P>The allocation for the school building programme, though increased, is inadequate. I have lobbied with relatively little success for improved facilities in a number of two-teacher schools in my constituency.  However, it appears from the Green Paper that the Department's view is that two-teacher schools should be phased out in favour of larger ones. That is totally unacceptable, particularly because two-teacher schools are, by and large, situated in rural areas.  As in the case of discrimination against rural communities in regard to the appointment of remedial teachers, the reluctance of the Department to finance improvements in basic conditions in two-teacher primary schools in rural areas is further proof that the thinking in the Green Paper is holding sway.  The two-teacher schools in rural <Col N="869" /> areas are being thrown to the winds in terms of achieving resources so that pupils and teachers can work in a comfortable environment which is conducive to good education.</P>
    <P>This is the European Year of the Elderly. A Cork nursing home with capacity for 93 beds &mdash; there are approximately 60 patients there at present &mdash; will close on Friday because of inadequate financing from the Department of Health.  The Minister for Health met the proprietors and relatives of patients in that nursing home last Monday, yet, it will close on Friday.  That shows scant regard for the elderly in our community and flies in the face of the principles of European Year of the Elderly.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision of £20 million for the reduction of hospital waiting lists. On numerous occasions I have had to make representations to the Southern Health Board on behalf of constituents seeking cataract operations, hip replacement operations and so on.  I acknowledge the good intentions of the Minister for Health, but unless additional consultants are appointed we will be unable to take up the additional resources because, at present, theatre facilities are being used to their full potential and there is still a waiting list for surgery appointments.  Not alone do we need financial resources, we also need investment in personnel to enable health boards avail of the extra resources.  The question of resources for accommodation for long term and acute geriatric patients is undoubtedly the biggest single issue facing health boards.  The resources invested in this area in recent years bears no relationship to the ageing profile of the population.  We have talked a great deal about targeting resources at particular areas, but that is the biggest crisis area in the health services at present.</P>
    <P>On a regular basis I meet relatives of patients who have financed their stay in private nursing homes for a number of years.  However, relatives of those patients can no longer afford to do so.  It may not be possible to care for the patient at home and even when that must be considered the support services from the <Col N="870" /> health boards such as community nurses and home help facilities are inadequate. Health boards are not in a position, due to financial constraints, to offer any type of support to such patients.  I appeal to the Minister to target additional resources into this area of the health services. This could still be done as the Finance Bill has not yet been published. This is a cause of great concern to many patients and their relatives, many of whom contributed to the support of their relatives in private nursing homes.</P>
    <P>A sum of £4 million is to be provided by way of subvention for public patients in private nursing homes.  That is a welcome start but there is a danger, as happened in the United Kingdom, that it would be like the new house grant, it would be added to the fee.  Therefore, we must be careful to target that resource at the patient rather than incorporate it in the fee.</P>
    <P>We have heard a great deal about the politics of exclusion.  This budget excludes an additional 30,000 people from having a say in Irish society.  There are two fundamentals in regard to creating jobs.  First, it must be attractive for prospective employers to invest money in job creation.  To date it has been more attractive to invest in technology, but that must change.  Second, it must be more attractive at all times for an unemployed person to take up a job offer than to remain unemployed.  It is unfortunate that this budget has failed to integrate the tax and social welfare systems so that the anomalies which exist, and which in many circumstances make it financially unattractive for people to take up work, can be tackled.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increased allocation for local authority housing, but we should learn from past mistakes.  Directives should be sent to local authorities so that we do not have the knee-jerk response we had in the past of constructing large ghettoes housing people from the lower socio-economic sector.  What we should instruct local authorities to do is purchase in the private market and take an integrated approach to resolving the local authority housing problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of an opportunity to say a few words on this matter. In drawing up his budget the Minister struck an even balance: on the one hand he provided for the old, the infirm, the deprived and the unemployed while on the other hand he sought to increase job opportunities.  One could say it was a job creation budget.  Many people, particularly on the other side of the House, were amazed that the Minister could come up with an additional £500 million, an increase of 27 per cent, for capital spending at a time when, with the elimination of VAT at the point of entry together with devaluation hundreds of millions of pounds were lost.  The Minister has targeted for development the construction industry, housing, roads, rail and ports.  There has been much talk about the rail service &mdash; in my area that service was discontinued in 1958 &mdash; and about regional airports, but the emphasis must be placed on roads.  A good road structure is required in order to develop industry, agriculture and particularly tourism, which is a high priority of the Government.</P>
      <P>I will not talk about potholes today because we have heard enough about that matter in the last couple of years.  There has been much talk about giving additional power to local authorities to maintain county roads.  I appeal to the Minister to give local authorities power to take out a term loan over a certain period in order to repair road surfaces. There is not sufficient funding available at present for this purpose and our road surfaces are deteriorating.  If, for example, Monaghan County Council was allowed take out a £1 million loan over, say, three or four years the money would be well spent and the roads would not be allowed deteriorate.  The Minister for the Environment should examine the complete road structure, particularly regional roads &mdash; a direct allocation is made in the case of national primary and national roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have for a long time advocated the idea that local authorities should be allowed take out loans for the maintenance of roads.  Monaghan County <Col N="872" /> Council had large repayments to make in respect of the courthouse, which was damaged by fire in the 1981 atrocity, but that loan has been paid.  The Department has taken responsibility from local authorities in many areas of expenditure. Therefore since there will not be as great a demand on local authorities in terms of repaying loans in future years the Minister should seriously consider allowing them to take out loans, for the repayment of which they would have full responsibility.</P>
    <P>There is provision in the budget for housing.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has given local authorities an opportunity to commence work on 3,500 houses straight away.</P>

      <P>Deputy Pat Rabbitte gave me notice of his intention to raise the matter as to the discovery of major inaccuracies in official Government statistics which overstated the strength of the Irish economy in the past five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to raise this important matter.  The eternal puzzle as to why our apparently respectable growth rate figures over recent years have not translated into commensurate job creation has finally been answered by two official reports published recently.  The first is the CSO disclosures of last week of major inaccuracies in our trade statistics, forcing drastic revisions in our balance of payments figures since 1986 and, second, the NESC report, entitled <i>Association between Economic Growth and Employment Growth in Ireland</i>, published in December 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Talk about Ireland's economic fundamentals being sound is now proven nonsense, as has been suspected by the lay person looking at the ever-lengthening <Col N="873" /> dole queues.  Alarm bells clearly went off in October 1990 when the NESC report of 1989, entitled <i>A Strategy for the Nineties</i>, was published.  That report commented: &ldquo;Huge outflows of profits, dividends and royalties reflect the remarkable structure of Irish industry&rdquo;. The remarkable structure described by the NESC refers to the role of the multinational corporations in the Irish economy and their extraordinarily high levels of profits repatriation.  The report concludes: &ldquo;There is a sense in which Ireland's trading balance should be calculated net of this profits repatriation.  To do so would show an unambiguous trade deficit for every year between 1976 and 1989&rdquo;, the years covered by the report.</P>
    <P>We now know we do indeed have an unambiguous trade deficit.  If we take, for example, the corrected trade figures as published by the CSO last week for 1990, the original CSO methodology would have given, under CSO table 1A, an apparent balance of payments surplus of £1,814 million from which must be subtracted £213 million for services, leaving an apparent surplus of £1,601 million for 1990.  However, the new CSO methodology shows that in 1990 the multinationals repatriated £2,507 million in profits, dividends and royalties.  When these outflows are reconciled with our assumed surplus of £1,601 million we get a deficit of £906 million for 1990.</P>
    <P>I listened with disbelief to &ldquo;Saturday View&rdquo; last Saturday when Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Progressive Democrats politicians were falling over themselves in an attempt to claim that the revelations of what the NESC calls an unambiguous trade deficit does not really matter.  If you tried telling your bank manager that the profit you reported for last year was really a deficit you would see whether or not it matters.  The CSO is not to be blamed.  The remarkable structure of Irish industry, as described by the NESC, means we cannot take macro-economic aggregate at face value without looking behind them.  The new CSO methodology will do that.  Unfortunately, what crawls out from under this CSO rock does not recommend itself to those <Col N="874" /> parties who sold us Maastricht and monetary union on the basis that our fundamentals are sound.</P>
    <P>When the CSO disclosures are taken together with the findings of the NESC report, entitled <i>The Association between Economic Growth and Employment Growth in Ireland</i>, the full implications for our economic performance are horrifying. When I questioned the Taoiseach on this at Question Time yesterday his defence was to resort to self-delusion about our otherwise sound economic progress. The time for self-delusion is over. These reports help explain why the jobs are not materialising.  It is time to go back to the drawing board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Dempsey) Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Dempsey)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>On Friday, 26 February 1993, the Central Statistics Office published new balance of payments data for the second half of 1991 and the first half of 1992.  The publication also contained revisions for previous periods back to 1986.  The new data showed that for the 12 month period to end-June 1992 there was an estimated net credit balance on the current account of almost £1.8 billion.  This arose from a surplus of over £2.9 billion for merchandise trade offset by a deficit of almost £1.2 billion for invisibles, that is services, factor incomes and international transfers. This was an excellent performance on the part of the economy by any standards.</P>
      <P>The release also contained revisions for earlier periods back to 1986.  These revisions reduced the previously estimated culumative current account surplus of over £2.5 billion for the six year period 1986-1991 to virtually nil.  These revisions were necessary because of new information, obtained directly from companies, which disclosed unexpectedly large imports of services, that is R &amp; D, management fees, IT and so on, which appear to be connected with changes in the American corporate tax regime since 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The background to the revisions is that in the latter half of the 1980s it was recognised that problems were emerging for <Col N="875" /> the balance of payments data collection and compilation system on a number of grounds, but particularly in relation to the gradual relaxation of exchange controls and their complete elimination in January 1993.  Early in 1990 the CSO requested the standing interdepartmental committee on balance of payments statistics to carry out an in-depth examination of alternative balance of payments systems.</P>
    <P>The committee, which comprises representatives of the Central Statistics Office, Central Bank, Department of Finance and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, consulted extensively with other countries and international experts.  Its report in September 1991 recommended that a new, comprehensive data collection system should be developed, based largely on the reporting of transactions with nonresidents settled through the banking system.</P>
    <P>This type of general direct reporting system is used in all other EC countries with the exception of the United Kingdom.  The committee also recommended that, as is the practice in most countries using a GDRS approach, administration and responsibility for balance of payments statistics on the new basis should be assumed by the Central Bank.  The various institutions involved accepted the recommendation of the committee and the Central Bank is progressing with the necessary legislative preparations.  However, the establishment of this new system is a major undertaking and it is unlikely that it will be in place before 1996.</P>
    <P>In the interim period the CSO initiated a range of new statutory surveys to maintain the balance of payments estimates. The highest priority was given to surveys relating to certain current account items which had deteriorated, both in quality and coverage, as the exchange controls were progressively relaxed.  Three surveys fell into this category, namely: (1) profits, dividends and interest of inward direct investment; (2) international trade in services and royalties; (3) outward <Col N="876" /> portfolio investment by Irish institutional investors.</P>
    <P>The response to these surveys has been very satisfactory and a first set of revisions, based on surveys (1) and (3), was published in the April 1992 balance of payments release.  This release also signalled very clearly that large revisions were in prospect arising from survey (2); these are the revisions which have now been published.  The current account estimates for these items are now firmly based on the survey data and are of a much higher quality than heretofore.</P>
    <P>A considerable amount of work is still required on the capital account.  A statutory survey of foreign assets and liabilities was initiated in mid-1992, but because of its complexity this is still being developed.  It is expected that the estimates for private capital in particular will be substantially improved when the results of this survey are finalised.</P>
    <P>The net residual is a balancing item which captures all omissions and errors elsewhere in the balance of payments.  It should ideally oscillate randomly around zero.  At the time of the previous &ldquo;Black Hole&rdquo; controversy to which Deputy Rabbitte referred, in the early 1980s this residual was consistently a large negative figure.  For the three years 1989-1991 the net residual has been large and consistently positive.  This implies that for these years the statistical system has not been adequately covering some large net inflows into the State.  It is expected that the planned improvements to the private capital item referred to earlier will reduce the size of the net residual.</P>
    <P>There are no budgetary implications inherent in the revisions.  The Department of Finance was represented on the interdepartmental committee and was aware of the underlying concerns about the quality of the balance of payments data.  Furthermore, following the previous release in April 1992, all users have been aware that large revisions were in prospect.  Finally, the CSO was able to indicate a broad order of magnitude for the revisions to the Department of Finance in advance of the recent budget.</P>
    <P>In the national accounts, gross domestic <Col N="877" /> product is calculated by adding estimates of trading profits to wages and salaries.  Estimates of the trading profits of companies are derived from the company accounts submitted for corporate tax purposes and have already fully discounted the extra service imports identified in the new balance of payments surveys.  Accordingly, the revisions in the balance of payments do not change the level of GDP.  The increased value of net factor outflows will reduce the level of gross national product, but the amounts involved are small and have very minor implications for economic growth rates.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to stress that because of the new surveys the balance of payments current account is now much more firmly based than previously.  There is a strong surplus on the current account since 1991 and, though the revisions for earlier periods are sizeable, they are now fairly historic.  They have insignificant budgetary, GNP and growth rate implications and no impact on our reserves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Chair for allowing me to raise this important issue.</P>
      <P>Galway city is still reeling from the shock announcement made here last week by Minister Ruairí Quinn that manufacturing was to cease at the Digital plant in Galway with a loss of 780 jobs in the factory and a possible further loss of 1,500 jobs in other enterprises supplying Digital with goods and services.</P>
      <P>The Galway economy has been dependent on Digital to an exceptional degree and the effect of the withdrawal of 780 jobs at the factory within the next 12 months will have calamitous consequences unless immediate measures are put in place to minimise the impact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the IDA task force that has been set up under the chairmanship of Mr. Séamus Keating, a man with wide administrative and industrial knowledge and experience in the County Galway <Col N="878" /> region.  Galway will fight back, but it will be a hard struggle.</P>
    <P>My immediate concern today is to ensure that the State does not contribute to the financial hardship facing the 780 workers who are about to lose their jobs by taking away in tax up to 50 per cent of the lump sum payments that the Digital Corporation are offering their workers in compensation for loss of their jobs.</P>
    <P>Minister Quinn promised in the Dáil debate last week that the Government would give sympathetic consideration to any proposals that might alleviate the financial hardship confronting the Digital workers.</P>
    <P>I request that regulations be made, under the existing tax code or else legislation introduced immediately, whichever is considered necessary, to grant exemption from income tax for all compensation lump sums paid on involuntary loss of employment.  In the case of Digital, Galway, the company has agreed to pay six weeks' salary for every year employed and the average length of employment among the workforce is 11 years.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of Section 10 of 1980 Finance Act only £10,000 can be deemed exempt from tax in these circumstances. In the United Kingdom the current exemption is £30,000.  If the 1980 figures were indexed to inflation here since 1980, our exemption figure would also stand at £30,000.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil debate on the 1980 Finance Act, the then Minister said</P>
    <P>the effect of the 1980 Act was that there would be no tax charge on the lump sum compensation and any tax free superannuation benefits which did not exceed £10,000.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, it seems there has been no change in that figure over the past 13 years.  I am asking that it be changed now.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that the Minister could also deal with this matter by altering the formula for calculating standard capital superannuation benefit by dividing years of service by ten instead of 20 as at present.  I understand the present formula <Col N="879" /> to be: years of service over 20 multiplied by annual salary.</P>
    <P>Another way the Minister could come to the aid of redundant workers in the Digital case would be to pay an agreed portion of lump sum direct to financial institutions to clear or reduce mortgage liability of workers.  In this way it would not be assessed as part of workers' income.</P>
    <P>Whatever action the Minister decides to take must have the effect of allowing the redundant workers retain the full amount of the compensatory lump sum.</P>
    <P>It would be perverse to suggest, as I believe some officials have, that the granting of tax exemption would only result in the employer reducing the amount of the compensatory sum.  The amount paid in compensation is something worked out in negotiations between workers and their employers.  The cost to the employer is the same whether tax is charged or not.</P>
    <P>It is the State that is denying the worker the full benefit of the amount being paid at full cost by the employer.  I do not believe the State can morally justify what they are doing.  In my personal view there is no moral justification for the State taking away in tax a substantial portion &mdash; in this case 50 per cent &mdash; of a lump sum paid by the employer for the loss of an income through involuntary loss of employment.</P>
    <P>The tragedy for Digital workers will be twofold if as well as losing their jobs they also end up losing their homes because the State insists on stealing half their compensation.  If something is not done about this whole question at the earliest opportunity it will indeed seem like the end of the world for most of the 780 employees at Digital, Galway &mdash; an end of their worlds, that they are not willingly going to accept.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister please tell this House today that he will take action?  Whether along the lines I have proposed or not is not important so long as the problem is adequately addressed.  This situation is critical and the time for a decision is now.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Molloy for his contribution on this matter and I would like to assure him that some of the ideas he has put forward will be carefully considered by the Minister in addition to the proposals already put forward by a number of other local Deputies, including the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy M. Higgins.  I should also like to inform the House that the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, this morning met the task force to which the Deputy has referred, where similar matters were under discussion.</P>
      <P>I would like to express my sympathy for the workers at Digital who are being made redundant.  I am aware of the importance of redundancy payments in helping individuals and their families when jobs have been lost.</P>
      <P>The decision by Digital to transfer its computer hardware manufacture from Galway to Scotland is indeed a very serious blow to industrial development not only in Galway but in the west of Ireland.  The retention of the software operation is at least a positive aspect of the company's actions to deal with the worldwide difficulties currently being experienced by the computer industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question before us today is, of course, the current tax treatment of redundancy lump sum payments.  This treatment, while fairly complex, is very generous by comparison with the treatment of other income.  Briefly, statutory redundancy payments under the Redundancy Payments Acts are exempt from tax. Retirement lump sums under approved or statutory pension schemes are also tax free.  The first £6,000 of any other payment made by the employer to the employee is tax free.  This £6,000 may be increased by up to £4,000, that is to £10,000, if (i) no claim for relief other than for the basic £6,000 exemption has been made in respect of a previous compensation payment; and (ii) no tax free pension scheme lump sum has been received in the past, or is being received at present, and there is none which may <Col N="881" /> be received in the future, or which there is an option to receive.  The £4,000 will be reduced pound for pound with the amount of such tax free lump sum or option, or of any previous compensation payment.</P>
    <P>As an alternative to the £6,000, or the £6,000 as increased, the taxpayer may claim an amount known as the SCSB &mdash; Standard capital superannuation benefit. This is calculated as 5 per cent of the average yearly salary &mdash; that is, averaged over the last three years of service &mdash; per year of service, less any tax free lump sum which is received or receivable under any approved or statutory pension scheme or which the individual has an option to receive in the future under such a pension scheme.</P>
    <P>If the employee is liable to tax on any of his other compensation payments &mdash; and whether he or she just gets £6,000 or the £6,000 plus some or all of the £4,000, or the SCSB amount &mdash; he or she is entitled to &ldquo;top-slicing relief&rdquo;.  What this means is that any amount liable to tax is charged, not at the taxpayer's marginal rate for the year in which he or she retires or is made redundant, but at an average tax rate calculated by reference to the previous five years.</P>
    <P>As far as the use which redundant workers make of their lump sum is concerned, the tax code does not generally distinguish between taxpayers on the basis of how they spend their income. There is no provision in the existing tax code which distinguishes whether redundancy payments are spent repaying mortgages or on other bills of the workers concerned.  One area where the existing tax code allows extra tax relief for particular types of expenditure is the business expansion scheme.  If redundancy money is invested in a BES project then the investor would be entitled to a tax refund on the amount invested up to a maximum of £25,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>The maximum tax relief would therefore be £12,000.  Of course, there are obviously risks in BES type projects, but I hope that some of the Digital employees will be aware of worthwhile projects which they might be willing to invest in.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="882" /> In his Budget Statement the Minister also mentioned that he was examining the area of small business start-ups for the Finance Bill.  He said that he was particularly concerned about the position of owners own capital investment and incentives for employee investment. While I would not like to anticipate the outcome of the Minister's study in this area, I am sure that those Digital workers with ideas for their own businesses will be following developments in this area carefully.</P>
    <P>The success of the Galway area in attracting industry should enable it to survive the trauma experienced by the Digital cutbacks.  With its many disadvantages, including a skilled and committed workforce, experience of high-tech manufacturing processes and a strong community support, the Galway area has many advantages in the campaign now under way to attract alternative industries to the area.</P>
    <P>The special task force, to which I referred earlier, chaired by the city and county manager, and comprising representatives of the State agencies, local authorities, trade unions, the local private sector and Digital, has been set up to commence intensive marketing of Galway as a centre for high-tech investment. The task force will also act as a conduit for ideas, initiatives and proposals for dealing with the situation.  The task force has commenced business in a very expeditious manner and in fact held its first meeting today when it was addressed by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  I wish the task force every success in its efforts and I can assure the House that all the facilities at the disposal of the various State agencies will be made available to attract and develop alternative industries in Galway.  A programme is being put in place to work with Digital staff to enable them to capitalise on their valuable experience gained over the years and form new businesses.</P>

Sílim gurb é an trioblóid ansin ná cúrsaí airgeadais agus rátaí úis.  Chuir polasaithe airgid an Rial-tais le cúpla mí anuas isteach go mór ar an tionscal seo.  Bhí siad ag díol an-chuid dá gcuid táirgí isteach sa cheantar sterling, mar shampla an Bhreatain, agus san Ghearmáin chomh maith.  De thairbhe na rátaí malartan le cúpla mí anuas chuaigh luach an tairgidh suas 20 faoin gcéad agus sin i ndiaidh iad a chur amach beagnach as gnó ar fad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is leis an Údarás féin an mhonarcha ansin.  Níl mórán eile ag an Údarás i gceantar Ard an Ratha agus mholfainn don Aire teangbháil leis an Údarás agus a iarraidh orthu gach dícheall a dhéanamh an tionscal a choinneáil ag obair. B'fhéidir go bhfeádfadh an tÚdarás féin rannpháirtíocht a ghlacadh sa chomhlacht nó b'fhéidir tionscal éigin eile a <Col N="884" /> mhealladh isteach a chuirfeadh fostaíocht ar fáil sa cheantar seo.</P>
    <P>The shock announcement by Garn Teoranta that the remainder of its workforce would be made redundant within the next few weeks can be attributed directly to the Government's industrial and financial policies.  Garn Teoranta has provided employment in the Ardara area since 1979 and is widely known for the quality of its product and its excellent industrial relations with its workers.  At its peak, this company provided employment for over 40 people in the Ardara area.  However, the recent budgetary measures, including the recent 5 per cent increase in VAT on clothing, and the handling of the currency crisis are the straws which have broken the camel's back in this instance.</P>
    <P>Since September the price of the product produced by Garn Teoranta, because of currency fluctuations and the exchange rate of the Irish punt, has increased by 20 per cent and which has resulted in the company losing most of its UK market. I have been in touch with Údarás na Gaeltachta and I hope that the Minister &mdash; I am delighted he is present in the House this evening to respond to this matter &mdash; will ensure that Údarás na Gaeltachta has the backing of the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and the Government so that these jobs can be retained.  As I have said, this is the only industry Údarás na Gaeltacht has in the Ardara area, an area of high unemployment.  I hope every effort will be made to get Údarás na Gaeltachta to take equity in this company or to get an industrialist to take it over so that the 17 or 18 jobs are protected. This company has a long tradition and it would be a pity if the workers, all of whom are skilled in the tradition of weaving and tweed making, were dispersed.</P>

      <P>Ar an gcead dul síos tá mé thar a bheith buíoch don Teachta McGinley as ucht an cheist seo a phlé. Tuigim an tábhacht atá ag baint leis agus go háirithe le fostaíocht in áiteanna deacra mar a luaigh sé agus an comhthéacs <Col N="885" /> sóisialta agus eacnamaíochta speisialta atá taobh thiar den dúnadh seo.</P>
      <P>Bunaíodh an comhlacht sníomhacháin seo in Ard an Ratha i 1979 le cúnamh deontais ó Ghaeltarra Éireann.  Ó shin i leith tá tuilleadh cabhrach curtha ar fáil ag Údarás na Gaeltachta dó.  Tá an comhlacht lonnaithe i bhfoirgneamh ar léas ón Údarás.  Nuair a ceadaíodh cúnamh breise don chomhlacht seo i 1985 bhí sprioc fostaíochta de 82 dhuine aige ach níor sroiseadh an sprioc sin riamh. Bhíodar dóchasach ag an am sin go gcomhlíonfadh siad an sprioc sin ach bhí cúiseanna áirithe nár éirigh leo.  Glacaim go raibh sé deacair ach níor tharla sé.</P>
      <P>Seo leanas an fhostaíocht le ceithre bliana anuas: i 1989 bhí 27 duine ag obair ann; i 1990, 19; i 1991, 17; agus i 1992, 18.  Is é sin, tá an fhostaíocht ag laghdú ó 1985 i leith agus faoi láthair tá deich nduine ag obair sa chomhlacht.  Le bliain go leith anuas bhí an dá phríomh mhargadh ag an gcomhlacht sa Ghearmáin agus sa Bhreatain.  Bhí siad ag lagú na margaí sin agus bhí caillteanas trádála ag an gcomhlacht dá thoradh sin.  Ansin tharla an géarchéim sna margaí airgeadais agus chaill Garn Teo.  an príomh-chustamaer a bhí acu i margadh na Breataine.  Tháinig laghdú substaintiúil chomh maith ar orduithe ó mhargadh sa Ghearmáin.  Ag éirí as sin chinn na príomhaithe ar an gcomhlacht an gnó a scor.  Thug siad fógra scoir do na hoibrithe le déanaí agus dúnfar an mhonarcha ag tús mhí Aibreáin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ó shin i leith thug an tAire Stáit i mo Roinnse, an Teachta Gallagher, cuairt ar an mhonarcha d'fhonn iarracht a dhéanamh an fhostaíocht a shábháil.  Ghlac sé comhairle uaim féin agus thug mé comhairle dó gach iarracht ab fhéidir a dhéanamh a chur i gcrích agus gach tacaíocht a bhí ag teastáil a thabhairt.  Ach bhí aigne na bpríomhaithe déanta suas ag an am sin.  Ní ghlacaim leis go bhfuil na deacrachtaí tar éis tarlú sna seachtainí atá díreach imithe.  Ba mhaith liom a chur in iúl don Teach &mdash; mar beidh sé de nós agam gach eolas a thabhairt ar chuile rud más féidir &mdash; go ndearna mé féin iniúchadh ar na comhlachtaí beaga sna Gaeltachtaí éagsúla inar tharla na deacrachtaí airgeadais.  Bhí sé leagtha síos <Col N="886" /> agam mar bhun-riail, dá mbeadh deacrachtaí ar leith ag na comhlachtaí de bharr an ghéarchéim airgeadais, go mbeinn sásta aon chúnamh breise ab fhéidir a thabhairt dóibh.  Agus bhí sin ar fáil.</P>
    <P>Tuigim ón Údarás áfach nár iarr úinéirí an chomhlachta aon chabhair ón eagraíocht sin chun an gnó a choimeád ar siúl.  Is cosúil go raibh siad den tuairim nach bhféadfaí an tionscal a tharrtháil. Tá infheisteoirí nua á lorg ag an bpointe seo don ghnó ag Údarás na Gaeltachta. Tá mé an-ghníomhach faoi sin mar tá suim agum san áit agus tuigim, mar a dúirt mé, an tábhacht a bhaineann le fostaíocht a chur ar fáil in áit in a bhfuil sé deacair, b'fhéidir, fostaíocht eile a fháil.  Tá sé ró-luath ag an bpointe seo a rá cén toradh a bheidh ar an iarracht sin nó an mbeidh toradh dearfach air.  Bhí mé i gcomhairle le oifigigh ón Údarás agus beidh siad ag déanamh a ndíchill. Tig leis an Teachta McGinley glacadh leis go bhfuil mo dhícheall á dhéanamh agam féin i gcomhairle leis an Údarás chun fostaíocht eile a fháil do na hoibrithe atá i gceist.  Leanfaidh mé leis an iarracht sin agus leanfaidh an tAire Stáit go dícheallach leis freisin.  Aon chabhair is féidir leis an Roinn, liom féin nó leis an Aire Stáit a thabhairt do na daoine atá i gceist, tabharfaimid é.  B'fhéidir gurb é an bealach is fearr leis sin a dhéanamh ná comhlacht nua a mhealladh isteach.  Táimid ag iarraidh é sin a dhéanamh ag an bpointe seo.  Is féidir leis an Teachta a bheith cinnte go mbeimid ag déanamh ár ndícheall. Arís táim thar a bheith buíoch don Teachta McGinley an cás seo a ardú.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle.  The matter I wish to raise with the Minister is a technical one. It concerns the payment of new house grants to the owners of what are called &ldquo;granny flats&rdquo;.  In order to avail of the £3,000 grant, previously £2,000, a householder has to provide receipts &mdash; invoices made up of £9,000 for materials and £6,000 for labour.  That is a reasonable <Col N="887" /> requirement and I have no trouble with it.</P>
      <P>On a number of occasions recently I have met people who built such dwellings covering an area of 400-500 square feet but where the overall cost did not amount to £15,000.  The Department are not debarring those concerned from receiving the grant but something is very wrong when, though the cost did not amount to £15,000 the applicant is expected to submit receipts totalling that amount.  I hope I have made myself clear.  When Fine Gael and Labour were in Government I spoke to officials in the Department and understood that where it could be shown that the cost was less than £15,000 receipts for the actual amount would be accepted on the say so of the inspectors.  Will the Minister clarify the matter?</P>

      <P>Accommodation such as that mentioned by the Deputy could, depending on its type, qualify for a new house grant where the conditions of the grants scheme as existing from time to time, are fulfilled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To qualify for a new house grant, a contractor or contractors registered for VAT must be engaged in the construction of the house.  This measure was put in place to ensure compliance with the tax code in a sector which was badly affected by the black economy resulting in a loss of revenue to the Exchequer and also putting tax registered builders at a disadvantage <Col N="888" /> compared with those outside the tax net.</P>
    <P>My Department was conscious, however, that a certain proportion of prospective applicants for grants building houses on their own sites would wish to contribute their own labour in the construction of the dwelling.  In such circumstances, those applicants were allowed to carry out some works to their own houses subject to a registered contractor or contractors being involved in building works on the house.  This would typically mean that registered contractors doing electrical, plumbing, roofing, blockwork or installing windows and doors provided that the aggregate costs amounted to £15,000, comprising not less than £6,000 worth of labour by a VAT registered contractor and £9,000 for materials on which VAT had been paid.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to respond comprehensively to the Deputy on a hypothetical question.  Obviously, he has a particular case in mind.  If he would let my office have details of it, most importantly the name and address of the applicant, I undertake to have the case examined and then to communicate with the Deputy.</P>
    <P>I can say, however, that the £15,000 need not be binding in all circumstances. In the case of a relatively small dwelling, there could be some latitude available. but this would depend on the full facts of the case involved.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.25 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 5 March 1993.</P>

        <i>Wexford):</i> The provision of waste disposal facilities is in principle a matter for the local authority concerned.

As a result, group water scheme grants of £700 per house and £500 per farm would amount to less than 25 per cent of overall costs and would be insufficient to finance the scheme.</P>

      <P>It would be a matter for Mayo County Council to decide on the need for, and scope of, any remedial action in this case.  I understand that the council carried out certain drainage works over the winter period which brought some improvement, and that they are now monitoring the situation.  Grants are not provided by my Department for drainage works of this kind.  If the local authority decide to seek a remedy through the carrying out of road works, the cost involved would fall to be financed from their own resources supplemented by the annual discretionary grants for non-national roads.  The grants to Mayo County Council under this heading in 1992 totalled £4.278 million.  I hope shortly to be in a position to notify local authorities of the allocations for 1993.</P>

      <P>The Operational Programme on Peripherality 1989 to 1993 is the vehicle for European Regional Development Fund assistance for national secondary and non-national roads.  There are no proposals to divert any of the assistance available under this programme for national primary roads to national secondary or non-national roads.  The EC assistance to be sought for various categories of roads in respect of the period after 1993 will be determined by the Government in the context of the next National Development Plan.  It should be noted, however, that road maintenance works do not qualify for EC assistance.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the maintenance and repair of county roads rests with the county council concerned and expenditure on such works falls to be financed by the council from its own resources, supplemented by the discretionary grants for this purpose provided annually by my Department.  The determination of priorities in the expenditure of these funds, and decisions on the amounts to be spent in particular areas, are matters for the county <Col N="839" /> councils; details of such amounts are not available in my Department.</P>
      <P>The discretionary grants for the maintenance of regional and county roads notified to county councils in 1992 totalled £8.95 million.

      <P>I share the Deputy's view that it is important to minimise confusion, uncertainty and delays in administering the livestock headage and premium schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For this reason, my Department, with the assistance of Teagasc, held a series of public information meetings from mid-January to mid-February 1993 at over 60 <Col N="843" /> centres around the country in order to explain the new arrangements to farmers. These meetings were attended by approx 25,000 farmers.  My Department has also produced a special booklet which explains the details of the new arrangements and the procedures for claiming the grants.  Furthermore, at my request, Teagasc has put in place a package of measures to assist farmers in dealing with the complexity of the new Common Agricultural Policy arrangements while also advising them how to secure optimum income under the various schemes.  The extra £1 million which has been provided under the 1993 budget to enable Teagasc to extend its small farm development service should contribute significantly to this effort.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, the headage and premium schemes are operated through a network of local offices throughout the country and farmers have ready telephone and personal access to these offices.  The Government has provided a significant sum of money in the 1993 Budget for additional staff in order to ensure that the Common Agricultural Policy reform package can be satisfactorily implemented by my Department. In view of the foregoing, I do not see any need for a hot line direct to my Department in addition to the various initiatives outlined above.</P>

      <P>Because of the nature of hospital accident and emergency services, it is difficult to predict with accuracy the volume of work that will present for treatment at any given time.  This leads to peaks and valleys in the demand for services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accident and Emergency hospitals can generally cope with this pattern of uneven demand.  However, at times when the workload is particularly heavy, additional beds have to be brought into <Col N="848" /> operation.  This may be done in a number of ways such as opening areas which are not routinely used, extending the operational times of day units and five-day units and in times of severe pressure it may lead to the cancellation of elective admissions.</P>
    <P>Some of the accident and emergency hospitals in Dublin have recently experienced difficulties because of the number of elderly people requiring attention.  The difficulty here was not primarily the provision of acute hospital beds but one of inadequate step-down facilities.</P>
    <P>In this regard, shortly after coming into office, I approved a sum of £500,000 to provide an immediate response to the problem.  Overall, the Government has allocated £4 million in the current year towards a phased implementation of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Health Act, 1970 the determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the Chief Executive Officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the Chief Executive Officer, are unable without undue hardship to arrange general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants.  At present almost 36 per cent of the population hold medical cards.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are available to assist Chief Executive Officers in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the Consumer Price Index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and health boards have discretion to issue a medical card to a person whose income exceeds the guidelines if medical or other circumstances warrant it.</P>
      <P>While no information is available on the extent, if any, to which the income guidelines on outgoings on house and travel expenses result in persons in low paid employment not being entitled to a medical card, I would of course be anxious that every person who is in genuine need of a medical card should receive one.  I believe, however, that it is best to rely on the careful consideration of individual cases by the health boards rather than to introduce a provision on the lines suggested by the Deputy.</P>
