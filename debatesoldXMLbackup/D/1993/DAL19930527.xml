      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Tánaiste arrange to provide time for a debate as the Taoiseach has done in regard to other serious matters?  I have no doubt the Tánaiste is well aware of the seriousness of this matter.</P>
      <P>When will the Government introduce the legislation it promised in regard to heritage and national monuments?  Will the Tánaiste agree that this should be taken in parallel with the legislation in regard to planning permission being required by the State agencies so that we can establish in this House a coherent structure for policy in the Office of Public Works and a clear understanding that in all its activites heritage issues will get the priority they deserve and we will know which Minister is responsible to the House?</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that heritage legislation will be introduced in the next session.  It is not possible to introduce it in this session.  It is also my understanding that legislation will be introduced by the Minister for the Environment the week after next in relation to yesterday's High Court decision.  In relation to the other matter which was out of order but to which I should refer, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry will report to the Government and obviously discussions can take place between the Whips in relation to time for a debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;where the Taoiseach announced that the matter could be dealt with on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill and, a couple of minutes later, apparently contradicated himself and said it would be dealt with by way of separate legislation, when will the legislation be introduced and when is it intended that it will come into effect?  In particular will it be introduced before the summer recess?</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>My recollection of what was said yesterday on the Order of Business is that the matter would be dealt with in the appropriate legislative manner.  The Government will decide the framework of the amnesty and it will come before this House at the earliest date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I urge the Tánaiste to tell us when the legislation will be introduced.  It is not adequate that we should read about these things in our morning newspapers and that when we have an opportunity here the Tánaiste or the Taoiseach refuse to tell us precisely what they intend to do.  We read in this morning's paper that legislation will be introduced in two weeks, yet the Tánaiste told us this morning that he will let us know in due course what particular form will be used.  Will he clarify what is intended, or perhaps tell us that the Government intend to drop this crazy notion, this spectacle&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the views expressed by SIPTU, the affiliate of the Labour Party have some influence on the Tánaiste and his collegues in Government. Surely the anger of the PAYE sector should be enough.  Is there no response?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the <Col N="1037" /> Tánaiste about the proposed legislation to give legal identity to the county enterprise boards?  When is it intended that this will be introduced and is he aware that the announcement outside the House yesterday was in contravention of a commitment given by the Minister last week that any such announcement would be made in the House?  In regard to the appointment of people to the National Economic and Social Forum from within this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be permitted to make my point.  I am concerned that the legislation that will establish new planning procedures may delay the building of the Tallaght Hospital and I am merely asking the Tánaiste if care will be taken <Col N="1038" /> to ensure that the legislation, if possible, will avoid the Tallaght Hospital project having to go back to the planning stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> At the conclusion of the debate yesterday I referred to the implementation of this legislation once it has completed its passage through this House and is signed into law.  I asked the Minister to embark on a publicity campaign to inform employers and employees of its contents.  That is a difficulty.  Booklets and other documents are produced by the Department but it is often difficult for people living in rural areas to obtain this information.</P>
      <P>The Minister should consider setting up local or regional centres, to deal with the publication and dissemination of information regarding labour law and provide easy access for people to the industrial inspectorate.  The industrial inspectorate has been decimated as a result of cutbacks in the public service in recent years.  In my constituency an inspector originally covered two areas but that was later changed to four counties. At one stage an inspector was expected to cover six counties and that is unacceptable.  No secretarial or clerical backup services were available at local level and much of the correspondence had initially to be written by hand and sent to Dublin for typing to be issued to local areas.  The Minister should investigate to see if the network of FÁS offices dotted throughout the country and accessible to people, could be used not only to help people seeking employment and training but to provide this type of information.  People should be able to obtain advice and have their problems dealt with at local level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the implementation of the provisions of the Bill, I would refer the <Col N="1044" /> Minister to the difficulty experienced by many people in obtaining payment of awards.  This can take a long time.  The people involved must contact the Department and staff there must follow up those who are responsible for making the payments. This arises in cases where companies have ceased trading or where individuals have disappeared leaving debts and obligations which have not been fulfilled behind them.  It can be difficult for successful applicants to obtain the money due to them.  The provision of a localised service through FÁS offices would enable people to follow up awards due.  The staffing of the Department in that area would have to be supplemented.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the Department on a number of occasions and found them extremely helpful.  The Minister shortly after her appointment assisted in sorting out a long running problem.  People should be able to follow up on awards and claim their entitlements without having to go through a long process of contacting public representatives which involves letters going back and forth. Where awards are made recipients should be immediately able to follow up on them.</P>
    <P>I welcome this legislation which is an example of the Government's commitment to improve equality in our society and eliminate disadvantages.  I welcome particularly the extension of the categories of unfair dismissal which are automatically deemed to be unfair, namely race, colour, sexual orientation, age and membership of the travelling community.  The Minister should take on board my concerns regarding the implementation and follow-up procedures in respect of this legislation. Information regarding protection and services provided under this legislation should be available at local level to allow people prompt access to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which updates the 1977 Act.  That Act, which proved beneficial, put in place a structure under which claims of unfair dismissal could be investigated by a Rights Commissioner <Col N="1045" /> or by the appeals tribunal.  It provides redress for unfair dismissals by way of reinstatement or compensation. Prior to the 1977 Act, there was little protection by way of redress for employees who were wrongfully dismissed. A lengthy expensive and slow process was involved for an employee who wished to seek redress.  Since the passing of the 1977 Act we have had a speedy and fair means of access for resolving unfair dismissals disputes.  That has greatly reduced the incidence of industrial disputes related to such dismissals.</P>
      <P>A number of shortcomings have been identified in the 1977 Act and the Bill proposes to deal with them.  I welcome the scope it provides, particularly in relation to fixed term and specified purpose contracts and in relation to matters of race, religion, sex orientation, union, non-union employees, monetary compensation, enforcement of awards and procedural issues.</P>
      <P>In circumstances where companies have ceased to trade but are not in liquidation, employees who have been successful in obtaining awards in respect of unfair dismissal may not apply to the compensation fund.  This matter has been brought to the attention of the Department of Enterprise and Employment on a number of occasions.  Will the Minister clarify how it is intended to deal with these procedures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The three avenues open for redress in an unfair dismissals case are compensation, re-instatement or re-engagement.  The Minister in her Second Stage speech supplied various statistics in relation to cases before the Rights Commissioner and the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  These indicated that the preferred option for employees was monetary compensation.  The reason I am requesting special monitoring of the new sections, in particular section 7, is that I recognise that an unfair dismissal &mdash; and I emphasise an unfair dismissal &mdash; is a traumatic and stressful event in a person's life.  Apart from the obvious effect it may have on living standards &mdash;<Col N="1046" /> and many of my colleagues have referred to this &mdash; there is also the effect of the loss of wages on a person's social circumstances.</P>
    <P>In regard to the area of employment an unfair dismissal can result in an uphill battle by the employee to get back into the labour force.  I do not know how the Minister intends to address this matter or whether it can be addressed but it must be examined in a fair and reasonable way.  A person who has been unfairly dismissed may have given long service to a company and may have certain commitments if they are married with children in education and a mortgage.  Is monetary compensation the fairest way to recompense a person who may find themselves in those circumstances?</P>
    <P>Monetary compensation is addressed in section 6 of the Bill before us.  If one takes, for example, a person in the 40 to 55 age group who has had a long service with a particular company, who has certain commitments and who may try to enter the workforce at that age, with almost 300,000 people unemployed that person may have grave difficulties reentering the labour market.  In saying that the figures given to us by the Minister indicate that monetary compensation is the preferred option, I ask for special monitoring of the options available as outlined in this Bill.  Relevant statistics should also be retained so that there can be proper evaluation in due course of unfair dismissal cases that may come before the tribunal.</P>
    <P>I note that section 7 requires that clarification be given on the option that is chosen by an employee.  This section is welcome but I ask the Minister not to allow a standard line to be used under the heading of &ldquo;reinstatement&rdquo; which may read: &ldquo;We recognise the relationship between the employee and the employer has deteriorated and it is not wise to reinstate&rdquo;.  I do not want to put the Minister on the spot or ask her to respond to a very difficult situation but she is very pragmatic in the manner in which she addresses issues.  I would like the Minister to monitor this section of the Bill which provides that clarification be given <Col N="1047" /> as to why monetary compensation is the preferred option.  I ask the Minister how she intends to address the issue if that line remains in the Bill in relation to reinstatement.</P>
    <P>It is important for the State to encourage fairness and justice in the area of employment and there is nothing more fair than reinstatement when an unfair dismissal occurs.  That is why I believe it is important to closely monitor this matter.  At the same time I recognise the importance of an employer's right to dismiss an employee once it is carried out fairly and reasonably.  Many commentators say that labour legislation of this nature hinders employment.  That is not quite correct.  Legislation such as this can be beneficial for both the employer and the employee.  I am concerned that many employers feel that labour legislation hinders their ability &mdash; to use an old phrase &mdash; to hire and fire employees. I have experience of both sides of the coin on this matter and I recognise that labour legislation, and in particular the legislation that is before the House, is of benefit not alone to the employee but equally to the employer.  It affords an opportunity to both sides to understand clearly the guidelines, regulations and the legislation that is in place in relation to employment.  As the previous speaker indicated, it is important that all employers are fully aware of the regulations contained in the Bill before the House.  It clearly puts in place a structure and a set of guidelines and I believe the right balance has been struck in relation to unfair dismissals.</P>
    <P>I recognise, along with the Minister and many others on this side of the House, the right of an employer to operate their business in an efficient, businesslike manner.  Most employers recognise the contribution of employees and it is their desire to act fairly in rewarding them for their work.  If they decide to dispense with the services of an employee it is recognised they would do so in a proper and fair manner.  This Bill deals with very technical aspects of amendments to the 1977 Act and it is timely that <Col N="1048" /> after 16 years of an Act that has proved to be successful we have come to recognise certain shortcomings in that legislation which have caused this Bill to be brought before the House.  I congratulate the Minister for doing so and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfair dismissal at any time is a traumatic experience for the individual, their families and their employers.  Therefore, I welcome this new Unfair Dismissals Bill as it makes necessary and pertinent amendments to the 1977 Act.  While that Act has stood the test of time changing circumstances in relation to employment have meant that certain amendments and additions have become necessary.  Legislation is at its most effective when it makes changing circumstances into account.  This principle holds true for this Bill, which is an extremely effective response to changing circumstances.</P>
      <P>The 1977 Act was solid legislation which had three main objectives.  First, it provided that dismissals should be deemed to be unfair unless there were substantial grounds to justify them. Second, it provided through the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the Rights Commissioner, a speedy, informal and non-legislative mechanism to appeal against decisions of employers.  Third, it provided redress for unfair dismissal in the form of reinstatement, re-engagement or compensation for financial loss.</P>
      <P>In its time the 1977 Act was a legislative landmark, ground-breaking legislation which made great strides for workers' rights.  It remedied the position of employees in which instant dismissal without reason was common and could only be challenged by trade union action. It has been acknowledged that the legislation has had many beneficial effects for mangement.  It contributed to improved personal practices and to a more stable industrial relations climate.  Statistics show that since its enactment the 1977 Act has been instrumental in reducing the number of strikes and stoppages relating to dismissals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Social policy legislation must maintain <Col N="1049" /> a fine balance between safeguarding employees' rights and ensuring that entrepreneurships and employment creation are not stifled.  However, it seems employment creation is not hindered by unfair dismissals legislation.  An ESRI study in 1986 found that practically none of the firms surveyed saw the legislation as a problem and only a small minority cited it as having caused problems in the previous year.  All legislation should be enterprise friendly and should take into account in its formulation the impact on enterprise growth.  I have no doubt the Minister is fully aware of the needs of enterprise and will be sensitive to them.  I compliment her on some of the provisions in this Bill.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not propose a fundamental change to the broad intent of the 1977 Act.  Its original aims still hold true.  The main focus of the Bill is the introduction of desirable technical changes and improvements in arrangements for administration of the legislation. The Bill contains several new provisions, one of which relates to persons employed through employment agencies.  This is a particularly important measure given the increasing role of employment agencies in organising employment.  The Bill allows for protection in the case of the termination of certain second or subsequent fixed term and fixed purpose contracts.  This is a significant measure.  There has been considerable growth in recent times in the variety and amount of contract work in the jobs market, and it would be a major oversight if unfair dismissals legislation did not address this major change.</P>
    <P>The Bill introduces a new basic award of up to four weeks' pay where the dismissal of an employee is found to have been unfair but where no financial loss has been incurred.  This is a positive step and I welcome its inclusion in the legislation. Unfair dismissals procedures must work efficiently and smoothly.  In this regard I welcome the significant improvements in claims and appeals procedures which will streamline and update the working of the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  I welcome the extension of the <Col N="1050" /> Bill to prohibit dismissal on the ground of sexual orientation of the employee, age of the employee and the employee's membership of the travelling community. I pay tribute to the Minister for her foresight in these areas.  The nature and structure of our workforce is changing.  There is a growth in cotract work, job sharing, part-time work and other typical work forms and I welcome this Bill as an effective and timely response to this change.</P>
    <P>I would like to bring to the Minister's attention the case of a person who was dismissed last September.  He appealed to the appeals officer who upheld his appeal.  The company appealed the decision to the tribunal but the case, which was heard recently in Cork, was not completed and was deferred to next September.  It is unfair that this individual has to go to the end of the queue, particularly as he was originally found by the the appeals officer to be unfairly dismissed. I know there is a financial aspect in terms of the tribunal travelling around the country, but this person is under severe pressure.  As I said in my opening remarks, people who are dismissed &mdash; their families and everybody involved &mdash; suffer great trauma.  I hope the Minister will provide the additional resources necessary in this area.  Again I compliment her on her foresight in many areas of the legislation which goes a long way towards solving the problems that have emerged since the enactment of the 1977 Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I warmly congratulate the Minister on bringing forward this enlightened legislation, building as it does on the very fine record built up since the 1977 Act.  In her contribution to the debate here and in the Seanad the Minister pointed to improvements resulting from the operation of that Act.  She said that the number of disputes arising from unfair dismissals fell from approximately 20 per cent to 10 per cent, and in some cases even lower.  That is an indication of the Act's success.</P>
      <P>The 1977 Act deals with the powers and functions of the Rights Commissioner and the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1051" /> In general employees who have had occasion to use the services of these offices have been satisfied that their case has been adequately heard and that decisions have been fairly made.  The 1977 Act has had a positive effect on industrial relations and has led to a considerable decrease in the number of disputes arising from unfair dismissals.</P>
    <P>Before the enactment of the 1977 Act it was very difficult for employees to seek redress for unfair dismissals.  Their only recourse was to the courts, which was an expensive and intimidating procedure for people who already suffered trauma as a result of what they perceived to be an unfair dismissal.  The court setting was probably not the best in which to resolve personal disputes and the introduction of the less authoritarian setting of the tribunal and the Rights Commissioner was welcome.</P>
    <P>The Minister, while recognising the positive aspects of the 1977 legislation, is updating it bearing in mind experience gained in the operation of that Act.  The fact that this Bill has arrived so soon after the Government taking up office is an indication of its commitment to improving labour legislation.  Labour legislation will always need to be changed bearing in mind changes in work practices, management practices and in the trade unions.  This will not be the end of the matter.  In due course we will continue to update labour legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill covers a number of important issues, for instance the extension of the Act to include persons employed through employment agencies.  I am glad the Minister has decided to tackle this issue. Many people were concerned at the emerging trend with regard to agencies and at the fact that abuses were creeping into the operation of this type of employment.</P>
    <P>Another issue tackled in the Bill which was giving rise to concern related to replacing jobs with short term contracts. That is an unhealthy practice which I would not like to see becoming the norm in employment here.  Fixed contracts do not really allow employees to plan for the <Col N="1052" /> future.  One needs to be certain of one's employment.  Any legislation which seeks to roll back that trend in favour of employees is welcome.</P>
    <P>I would draw the Minister's attention to section 5 particularly with regard to extending the scope of the principal Act to cover unfair dismissal arising from sexual orientation, age and membership of the travelling community.  The Minister might well reconsider section 5 because it frequently occurs that at the interview stage a prospective employee is ruled out because of sexual orientation, age or membership of the travelling community. I appreciate that the Minister will have to take this issue up with her colleagues in Government, particularly the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor.  We must address the case of a person who feels he has been discriminated against at interview stage.  The current legislation is not nearly strong enough to deal with the issue at that point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>It only refers to dismissals. The Deputy is quite right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, but because of her interest in fairness I would ask the Minister and her colleagues in Government to consider the point I am making with a view to ensuring that there is no unfair discrimination at interview stage.  That issue impinges on this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation is very important in that it meets the objectives set down in the Programme for Government and is an indication of the Minister's intention to proceed as quickly as possible to implement all the positive aspects of this Bill which has developed from the 1977 Act.  The Bill will make a major contribution to continued good management/employee relationships in industry.  It is a pity that in the past some employers felt they had the right to summarily dismiss employees on the flimsiest of grounds.  This led to a great deal of frustration, friction and industrial disputes. This legislation will further strengthen <Col N="1053" /> the relationship between the employee and the employer.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to further consider the procedures leading to dismissal. Employers must be far more mindful of their responsibilities when they are proceeding towards dismissing an employee.  Dismissals do not always take place because of blatant dishonesty or inability to cope with the work.  Dismissals take place, for instance, because of the level of performance of an individual. In that area there are very vague conditions in relation to what might be regarded as a fair dismissal as opposed to an unfair dismissal.  In the sales area an employee may be dismissed for not achieving a sales target.  An employer might be tempted to increase weekly or monthly sales targets to such an extent that it becomes impossible for the employee to reach the target and then the employer will dismiss him because he is not performing at the level required by the company.  That is a very grey area involving many problems and conflict. An employee who is dismissed for not reaching a sales target will find it extremely difficult to get work with another company even if the target which he could not achieve was beyond the bounds of possibility to achieve.</P>
    <P>This is a small country and if a person is working in a small industry, he is known and therefore it becomes impossible for him to make a living having been dismissed in such circumstances.  That is an issue that needs to be teased out and strengthened from the point of view of the employee.  But it must be made clear to employer, and employee, the rights they have and the procedures to be adopted leading to dismissal; it should not be acceptable any longer for an individual employee to be dismissed at will, perhaps for the flimsiest of reasons.</P>
    <P>These are examples of how I believe labour legislation will continue to expand and strengthen the hand of both employers and employees in this overall area.  It is very important that the relevant procedures be clearly laid down for dealing with any disputes that may arise in the workplace rather than beyond the <Col N="1054" /> gates.  Indeed the successful implementation of the provisions of the 1977 Act have been a major contribution in this respect.</P>
    <P>Of course, the overall question of decisions of a Rights Commissioner and-or of the Employment Appeals Tribunal is one about which there is much doubt in so far as employees are concerned in relation to awards being paid, etc.  I can understand the difficulties that may arise here because, if and when a company will have gone out of business, obviously it will become increasingly difficult to implement decisions and so on.  That is understandable but is something that will have to be addressed, in terms of a special fund or whatever, to deal with the settlement of such claims.  I am talking about employers making a contribution over the years to develop or strengthen such a fund.</P>
    <P>The other issue that arises is whenever an employee has been found to have been unfairly dismissed and when reinstatement or re-engagement is recommended. There is room, in such circumstances, for the Employment Appeals Tribunal in particular to perhaps extend their remit, endeavouring to use their integrity and-or that of the Rights Commissioner to smooth the way back for an employee unfairly dismissed, so adjudged by the Employment Appeals Tribunal or a Rights Commissioner.  If a wrong has been done essentially it is much better that it be righted properly and fully, particularly in these days of great difficulty in the overall employment area when the loss of a job means the loss of a major asset.  One has great sympathy with redundancies but, whenever a person loses his or her job unfairly, and it has been decided by a third party to have been an unfair dismissal, every possible effort should be made to have such person reinstated or re-employed by the company concerned.  Of course, I understand that, in those circumstances, difficulties will arise with regard to relationships and so on.  But if employers and employees alike are to perceive the operations and-or decisions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal and a <Col N="1055" /> Rights Commissioner as being of full integrity then, in all fairness, they should be prepared to accept their findings even if they give rise to the suggestion that an employee should be reinstated.  That is a difficult task to achieve.  But we must remember that we have had here from time to time trade union disputes, when individual workers have been locked out. Ultimately, good sense must prevail, people must return to work, management must endeavour to co-operate with employees, they must work with their employees, and employees with management, even though such disputes may have been protracted, bitter and so on. There is no reason such opportunity should not be afforded such an employee, on having found himself or herself unfairly dismissed, that is the right to return to work, thereafter co-operating with their superiors, management and so on, and <i>vice versa.</i></P>
    <P>There is plenty of scope for us to continue to develop the type of labour legislation with which we are dealing today. I shall conclude by congratulating the Minister, as I did at the outset.  I look forward to the speedy passage of this Bill through both Houses so that its provisions will be available to employees and employers in order to further expand the good labour legislation obtaining.  I warmly congratulate the Minister on the speed with which she has introduced this Bill within the lifetime of this Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1977 Act was very forward-thinking and its provisions valuable. It is only right and proper that nobody should be dismissed from employment at the whim of an employer. At the same time, employers have rights also so that, whenever an employee has committed serious misbehaviour, an employer should be able to cease to employ them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what was said in the course of the debate yesterday, what were the views expressed by the hard right from the opposite benches.  I do not know what was their attitude to the <Col N="1056" /> provisions of this Bill.  I exclude Deputy Flaherty from those comments.  Very often business groups complain about labour legislation on the grounds that it ties their hands excessively, rendering it almost impossible for them to recruit or get rid of employees.  I totally reject that type of thinking.  It appears to me that, no matter what legislation is implemented, some employers at least always will find a way around or through its provisions. Undoubtedly, the Minister and her Department have endeavoured to close some of the loopholes that have appeared.  I very much doubt they will manage to close them all in that it is something akin to floodwaters, when on filling one gap, another will open up elsewhere. Some people are expert in finding ways around the provisions of such legislation.</P>
    <P>When one examines what has happened since 1977, one finds that the provisions of the Act implemented that year have proved to be very valuable, not merely in protecting employees' rights but in the industrial relations area generally. For example, strikes that took place in the past, that might have involved one person only being sacked, often leading to a plant being closed down for days or weeks on end, in large measure, have beem reduced if not eliminated as a result of the provisions of the 1977 Act.  However, they have not been totally abolished; too many still occur. The Minister gave some figures yesterday showing that, since employers' objective is to retain and keep people happy in the workplace, while they may complain about the labour legislation obtaining, will admit that its provisions have been very valuable to them.  The statistics available of the numbers of disputes arising out of unfair dismissals show that the incidence has declined enormously, which is to the benefit of employers, employees and the nation.</P>
    <P>Of course, some employers would like us to remain in the dark ages, would like employees to appear each morning on a type of hire and fire contract.  But we must realise that ours is now a modern, industrial economy and employees must <Col N="1057" /> be treated in a civilised manner, it being one of the marks of a civilised society. We cannot revert to the system of 70 or 80 years ago.  Employees are entitled to security of employment, which protection they should be afforded.</P>
    <P>Some of the Minister's proposals under the provisions of the Bill, extending their remit to people employed in employment agencies and contract workers, is something that has developed in recent years. People who work in employment agencies appear to live in a type of limboland. I know of one woman who has been working for six or seven years with an established company, through an agency, yet she appears to have no rights whatsoever in relation to unfair dismissal.  This lady got married two to three years ago and she cannot get a mortgage because the building societies do not consider that she is in secure employment.  If she gets pregnant she will not be entitled to maternity leave.  As I said, she is in limbo. In this way employers have managed to knock holes in the existing legislation. The provisions in the Bill which will plug those loopholes will have my total support.</P>
    <P>It has been said that up to 1977 an employee had some protection. However, it costs a fortune to secure one's rights.  It is all very well saying, as in many other respects, that one can look to the law of the land, particularly where one has the support of a huge lobby group, but it is not practical for the ordinary person to seek redress under it.  We cannot do without the law but the legal eagles' advice is expensive and I always think they tell people what they want to hear.</P>
    <P>In regard to the tribunal, if a person is a member of a trade union the representative of the trade union will support him but many people, who are not members of a trade union also avail of the tribunal.  While I accept they can bring someone with them, such as a rights commissioner, people who work in small companies and are not members of a trade union may come up against the might of an employer.  I think I am right in saying that in such cases the Department <Col N="1058" /> may provide financial assistance.  Some people when met by solicitors and barristers representing the other side get tongue-tied even when they have a strong case.  However, they may not make it very well when subjected to cross-examination. While the system is meant to be informal it may be more formal than people would like.</P>
    <P>While I accept that one cannot cover every matter in legislation &mdash; I do not think the changes proposed will alter the position &mdash; employers have the right to dismiss employees on the grounds of redundancy, where the company finds itself in financial trouble, restructuring or reorganising.  In many cases this is a genuine reason but in many others it is not.  Words such as &ldquo;rationalisation&rdquo;, &ldquo;restructuring&rdquo; and &ldquo;reorganisation&rdquo; can cover a multitude.  I have come across cases where everything was done under the heading &ldquo;restructuring&rdquo;.  Nobody is ever sacked; because everything is done under the heading &ldquo;restructuring&rdquo; anything goes.  In many cases their target is an individual or a number of individuals; yet they remain within the law because it is done under this heading.  The law in this area is loose and I would like to see it tightened.</P>
    <P>Under the original legislation part-time workers, in the main women, did not have protection but the position has improved in recent years with the introduction of legislation in this regard with the result that this is no longer a burning issue.  Up to a few years ago it was a major problem and it seemed that the law did not cover such workers.</P>
    <P>In relation to the provision whereby a person has to be in employment for one year before being considered permanent, one has to be reasonable but this provision has been abused; people have been let go after one year and then taken on again after a few weeks.  While everybody cannot be considered to be permanent on the day they take up a job employers argue that the period should be greater than one year while the trade unions argue it should be far less.  It would be difficult to have a hard and fast rule but <Col N="1059" /> I would like to think that, over time, it will be reduced.</P>
    <P>Under existing legislation it seems that very few people manage to get their jobs back.  Monetary compensation is not the answer.  Even though the figure of £15,000 was mentioned, in most cases it seems to fall between £1,500 and £2,000. In this regard it should be remembered that a person may travel to pay a barrister a few hundred pounds.  While I will not say that this amounts to a token gesture it seems that people achieve a moral victory and not much else.  I know a person who achieved a moral victory recently when offered £1,500 but legal expenses amounted to half this figure.  As part of the deal a reference was offered which was conspicuous for what it did not record. Even though people win they end up losing.  I wonder if an award of £1,000 to £2,000 and a reference from which certain words about one's character are left out amounts to a victory.</P>
    <P>In some cases employers are doing too well; they achieve industrial peace while the issue involved is put on the long finger.  While it may not be feasible to get one's job back, particularly in small outfits where one deals with the owner on a daily basis, in bigger companies where one is removed from management this should be possible.  Overall, I am disappointed at the size of awards granted; it does not represent fair compensation.</P>
    <P>The statistics on the number of cases dealt with at the tribunal show that people believe in it and that it is a valuable system.  However, I would like to see larger sums awarded and more people getting their jobs back.  The amendments to the existing legislation are valuable and I hope they will block the loopholes. I congratulate the Minister for bringing this legislation forward and I hope the position will be greatly improved.</P>

      <P>I have just come from the special committee dealing with the Finance Bill and I have only had a quick glance through the Bill.  However, I promise the Minister of State that, on <Col N="1060" /> Committee Stage, I will be more familiar with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am entering that caveat before I begin.</P>
      <P>This Bill is welcome.  The period from 1977 is a long time in the history of industrial relations.  A great deal of water has gone under the bridge in terms of our experience and practice of industrial relations since then.  This is reforming legislation in so far as it goes and for the reason it is to be welcomed.  However, it seems to me to be minimalist in conforming to the commitments given in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and not going beyond that. While it is certainly an improvement and a modernisation of the principal Act I regret that its scope is not wider, as a number of matters needs to be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If my memory serves me, we have enacted 23 different labour laws since 1973.  That is a minefield for the ordinary practitioner of industrial relations and I urge the Minister to consider a consolidation Act to remove some of the complexities and make it simpler.  I understand from my collegue, Deputy Gilmore, that the Minister's response to a similar argument put by him earlier is that she does not want the law to become the preserve of the legal profession.  I have great sympathy with that point of view and indeed I argued that point at the time of the 1977 Act.  From my experience as a trade union official it has become the preserve of lawyers, whether we like it or not.  My only regret is that I did not get paid the fee per case that the lawyers commanded in certain areas.  The law relating to labour is scattered over a wide area.  It is not confined to the 23 Acts introduced since 1973 but encompasses a growing body of statutory instruments and EC legislation.  There is a need to take congnisance of constitutional law as it refers to the area of dismissals.  During what appears to be the Minister's second reign in Government before she undoubtedly regains her status as a full <Col N="1061" /> Cabinet Minister, which I believe she will, will she start codifying the legislation? The ILO committee of experts has examined this issue and under the slogan &ldquo;codify, clarify and simplify&rdquo; they have addressed these very issues.  If the Minister is disposed to keeping a rein on the legal profession's involvement, a necessary prerequisite is to codify, clarify and simplify the legislation.</P>
    <P>The reforms introduced by the Minister are welcomed in their own right. Allowing fixed term contracts to come under the terms of this Bill is very important because trade union officials can recount cases of employers seeking to circumvent the terms of the Act by the manner in which they deliberately construct fixed term contracts.  Even State agencies have done this.  I remember the row we had with the health boards over a number of years where they employed people for 11 months, let them go for a period of three weeks and then re-employed them for another 11 months and so on.  As a result they were denied redress under the existing Acts.  It is a welcome development that fixed term contracts have the protection of this legislation.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a minimum award of four weeks pay is another welcome development.  I heard Deputy Noel Ahern say that when cases go before the Employment Appeals Tribunal very few get their jobs back and he was disappointed at the way in which the Tribunal discharges its responsibility.  I share that view.  Statistics have been compiled which show that the percentage of people awarded monetary compensation is in the high seventies.  We need to carry out a great deal more analysis and reform in this area.  The setting of a minimum threshold is important but it does not deal with the disposition on the part of the Employment Appeals Tribunal to award monetary compensation.  I do not know why it has gone so far in this direction.  If the Employment Appeals Tribunal does not reform itself, we should in legislation direct it to do so.  The Minister will be familiar with the work of Ferdinand Von <Col N="1062" /> Pronzdinsky of Trinity College who has written on the question of industrial relations generally and on this area in particular.  He recommends that we should enshrine in legislation a hierarchy of remedies, reinstatement, re-engagement and compensation.  We will have to enshrine this in legislation because the Employment Appeals Tribunal for some reasons tends to award compensation even where a person is successful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true in some cases but the Employment Appeals Tribunal seems to apply a rule of thumb that there is an irretrievable breakdown of relations, as if it were a domestic situation which the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Mervyn Taylor, is at this moment poring over and struggling to incorporate in marital legislation.  The Employment Appeals Tribunal is carrying the concept of irretrievable breakdown to its <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> because it seems to work on the presumption that the person does not want reinstatement. I continue to handle cases for constituents and others, without the remuneration that my legal colleagues apparently collect for doing so, and my experience is that the remedy is compensation.  A case may be presented at the Employment Appeals Tribunal that makes it appear there is irretrievable breakdown and terribly bad relations between the management and workers, but in reality it may not be like that.  Presumably that is the experience of anybody who goes into court.  Once a case reaches court hearing relations degenerate somewhat.  This can be seen in the case of the dismissal of an executive or senior person where a conflict of policy arises, a conflict I experienced myself in the not too distant past when, living between myself and the person responsible for my dismissal, was something that our worst enemies would not confer on either of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a situation where a senior executive <Col N="1063" /> or a manager is dismissed, on a matter of policy or whatever, one can see how it could be against the interests of the company or the general workforce in the company that they ought to be forced to cohabit and that reinstatement would be recommended in those circumstances. Generally speaking, for the ordinary worker to say that reinstatement is not a feasible remedy is entirely wrong in my experience.  Any analysis &mdash; I am sure the Minister has it at her finger tips &mdash; of the appeals tribunal cases will show that Deputy Noel Ahern is correct in saying that the number of reinstatements is very low even where the complainant is successful. We then come to the quantum of compensation, and frequently that is poor compensation for losing one's employment and one's livelihood.</P>
    <P>I welcome the improvements introduced by the Minister.  From a cursory glance at the Bill I think the Minister has abolished the practice whereby the tribunal took into account whatever social welfare one received in the interim and so on.  It is important that the employment appeals tribunal would remain in touch with the real world.  I would like to see the barristers and the lawyers kept out of it altogether because they do not add any flavour of reality. The more unreal it becomes the more lawyers flock around the tribunal and they all begin to have illusions of the nature of the real world that operates on the factory floor.  I do not know how we can keep them out.  We have seen this practice in Northern Ireland where the system of arbitration has virtually become the preserve of the legal profession. If they do not reform themselves legislation will be required to direct them and I hope that will come about.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that the reforms the Minister has introduced indicate a knowledge of the practitioner's experience of the 1977 Act as it operates.  However, it does not pay sufficient attention to the dramatic changes that have taken place in the labour market since 1977.  The year 1977 is an eon away, notwithstanding some of the remarks one may hear in the <Col N="1064" /> context of the present bus dispute.  Trade union practices, industrial relation standards, procedures and experiences have changed so dramatically since 1977 that I do not think the Bill takes sufficient account of that.  I accept that the Minister has made some concession to that end in terms of the decision she has made in respect of the use of agency workers. That is very important.  It is a welcome reform that responsibility is now put on the third party in that situation.  As I understand it &mdash; if I understand it correctly &mdash; the agency can place a clerk typist &mdash; if there is such a person nowadays &mdash; or a word processor operator with a company and that company is deemed to be the employer for the purposes of the Act.  That is welcome and is a step forward.</P>
    <P>The entire traditional structure of the workforce as we know it, has changed and disintegrated.  From the point of view of the traditional trade unionist, it has changed in a way that is neither helpful, progressive nor welcome but it has happened. The proliferation of part-time workers, agency workers, contract workers and that entire range creates a whole new vulnerable underclass of employee.  The Employment Appeals Tribunal is illustrative of the machinery that was created as between the employers' federation and the trade union congress on the other side.  In other words it is predominently a mechanism for the world of trade union labour. Unfortunately, from my point of view but, perhaps, fortunate from the point of view of some other people in the House, trade unions for whatever reason are increasingly unable to cope with these new developments with the result that a great many of these new workers are not organised into trade unions.  Some are at the top end of the market and as such have adopted the individualistic psychology of the era but a great many are part-time, unofficial, contract, agency workers who are exceptionally vulnerable to exploitation, and, frankly, the trade unions have not organised them. This raises the whole question of who represents them at the tribunal.  They will <Col N="1065" /> not be represented by trade unions since they are not members of trade unions. To require a solicitor or a barrister to appear is prohibitive.  In that situation we will have to examine the possibility of some access to free legal aid.</P>

      <P>Obviously we will come back to that at another stage.  I should like to mention just one other point in terms of these new workers.  The exclusion of people employed on the basis of a contract for services is another area of widespread abuse.  In Tallaght in my constituency a computer company shut down last December with the loss of 30 jobs.  I have discussed this matter with the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, and with several officials in the Department.</P>
      <P>The employer concerned started up again a couple of weeks ago using the same name.  The case went to the Employment Appeals Tribunal but now the 30 women have been re-engaged on a specific contract which states that it is a contract for service.  They have been asked either to sign it or forego the offer of the job.  That puts them outside the scope of the bulk of labour legislation, including this Act.  This is one area that we must look at because it is another area of abuse and exploitation.</P>
      <P>I meant to refer to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions' document which I, like other Deputies, have had submitted to me.  I apologise to my colleagues in Congress for not having got around to it but I will refer to it on Committee Stage because there are a number of points in it that I want to take up.</P>

Mar dhuine a bhí ina fhostóir ar feadh beagnach 20 bliain nífhaca mé ariamh cosaint an oibrí mar bhac ar fhostóir maith.  Má bhí cosaint réasúnta sa dlí chuidigh sé sin leis an bhfostóir agus leis an bhfostaí.  Fáiltím roimh aon soláthar a choscann ar dhaoine dul taobh amuigh den dlí nó fáil timpeall air; tá a fhios agam nach dteastaíonn ó bhunáite na bhfostóirí a leithéid sin a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Go minic bíonn de locht ar Éireannaigh leisce a bheith orainn oibriú de réir phlean nó de réir nósanna imeachta maithe.  Arís, fuair mé amach ó thaobh na n-oibrithe de agus mar fhostóir go raibh toradh níos fearr ann nuair ab eol do gach duine cearta an oibrí agus cearta an fhostóra.</P>
    <P>Bíonn níos mó ceangail idir oibrithe agus fostóirí i gcomhlachtaí beaga ná i gcomhlachtaí móra.  Ba é mo thaithí an corruair arbh éigean dom gníomhnú in aghaidh fostaí ná go raibh tacaíocht na foirne agam go ginearálta má bhí an ceart agam.  Tá sé de thuairim ag an bpobal, scaití, nach mbíonn an ceart ariamh ag an bhfostóir ach níorbh amhlaidh mo thaithí.</P>
    <P>There is a myth that workplaces are like a battlefield with employers on one side and employees on the other.  Most workplaces, particularly small workplaces, do not work like that.  In most workplaces there is an excellent relationship between the employer and the employee.  If an employee is not doing his or her work properly there is normally general support among the workers for appropriate action to be taken for the protection of their own employment.</P>
    <P>What we are talking about here is unfair dismissals.  Every employer and employee recognises that in the event of a downturn of work it is within the remit of an employer to let people go.  I found very useful the little booklets giving a layman's interpretation of the labour Acts covering unfair dismissals, redundancy, holidays, etc. that are available to employers and employees alike.  Too often ordinary people do not have access to information about their rights and the <Col N="1068" /> protections afforded in the legislation.  It is important to ensure as wide a distribution as possible of these leaflets so that employers and employees will know their basic rights.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about the small number of employers in certain industries who work to get around labour law.  I was pleased when steps were taken the year before last to protect part-time workers in certain circumstances where, for example, they were employed for under 24 hours a week for the sole purpose of excluding them from rights in relation to holidays, etc.  I welcome the fact that two other loopholes are being closed in regard to agency workers and renewable fixed contracts.  These loopholes, which are being used only by a small number of employers, are being closed to level the playing pitch for all workers.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat concerned about the drop in the number of PAYE workers working in the building industry.  More and more primary contractors are looking for people with C.2s because this relieves employers of many of the responsibilities applying to employment. This is not a good development because it also deprives people of rights under the social insurance code.  I would therefore ask the Minister to look at that aspect to ensure that employers do not have the advantage of not having to comply with the stringent regulations relating to social insurance, etc, by employing a person in one way rather than another.</P>
    <P>Bhí an-spéis agam sa mhéid a dúirt an Teachta Rabbitte i ngeall ar chomhdhlúthú a dhéanamh ar an Acht agus thiocfainn leis go m'fhéidir go bhfuil cás ann dó agus go gcuideodh sé leo siúd atá fostaithe.  Caithfimid féachaint chuige freisin nach dtagann lucht dlí isteach sa chás seo an iomarca.  Ba é mo thaithí nuair a bhí mé im' fhostóir agus im' fhostaí ag an am gcéanna go raibh tuiscint anmhaith ag lucht na gceardchumann ar an rud ab fhearr do na hoibrithe ar fad agus don oibrí aonaránach leis, sa chomhlacht ina raibh mé ag obair.  I gcás an Rights Commissioner agus nuair a déantar achomharc ansin, b'fhearr liom ionadaíocht a fheiceáil ann ó na ceardchumainn ar lámh <Col N="1069" /> amháin agus ionadaíocht ó leithéidí IBEC ar an lámh eile.  Ba mhaith an rud é dá mbeadh daoine fostaithe ag na ceardchumainn agus ag IBEC a dhéanfadh speisialtóireacht sa ghnó seo. Bheadh teagmháil leanúnach acu lena chéile a thabharfadh feidhm leanúnach chothrom don dlí agus a leagfadh béim ar chothromas agus ar cheart seachas ar phonití beaga dlí.</P>
    <P>Ag deireadh an lae, is é an cothromas is tábhachtaí.  Táimid ag iarraidh an ceart a chosaint agus ba mhaith liom go mbeadh an dlí bunaithe ar bhunchearta daoine, bíodh siad ina n-oibrithe nó ina bhfostóirí.  B'fhearr liom go bhfeidhmeodh an tribunal ar an mbonn sin seachas ar bhonn na bpointí beaga dleathacha lenar féidir éalú ón chothromas.  Is dóigh liom go mbeadh bunáite na bhfostóirí i bhfábhar sin mar go bhfeicfidís gurb shin atá ag teastáil.</P>
    <P>Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil bunús ar bith le ráitisí ó fhostóirí agus ó dhaoine eile a deir go ngníomhaíonn reachtaíocht mar seo in aghaidh na fostaíochta.  Tá sé cruthaithe ó tugadh an Príomh Acht isteach i 1977, go bhfuil laghdú mór ar stailceanna bunaithe ar aighneas idir fhostoirí agus fhostaithe mar go dtuigeann na ceardchumainn agus na hoibrithe go bhfuil córas ceart achomhairc ann má mheasann siad gur deineadh eagóir ar oibrí.  Sa mhéid go bhfuil structúr éifeachtach simplí ann le gur féidir cásanna a thabhairt chun tosaigh go sciobtha is ea is móa fheicfear nach gá dul chun stailce chun aighneas mar seo a réiteach.  Ní mór go mbeadh meas ag fostóirí agus ag oibrithe ar an gcóras achomhairc.</P>
    <P>It is vital that we have good labour law which will not deter people from employing others.  We should have an equitable system to balance the right of the employees against those of the employer and the rights of an employer against those of an employee who may or may not be acting in a proper manner. Such a system would, in the long term, be in the interests of employers and employees.  If employers and employees trust the system the number of disputes will be radically reduced.  The cost of employing people will be reduced rather <Col N="1070" /> than increased by proper employment legislation.  I support the tightening up of this legislation to close the loopholes that unscrupulous people might exploit and, on the other hand, ensure that where an employee acts in an improper manner that an employer has the right to dismiss that person, not alone to protect his position, but that of other employees in the company.  They also have to be protected from the actions of the few who might not act in a proper manner.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte referred to compensation versus reinstatement.  From my experience most employers are very slow to dismiss a person, they have good relationships with their workers and that has generally been the case in the past 25 years.  The idea of two groups of people at loggerheads has no bearing on the reality in most workplaces.  In most cases before a dismissal there will have been a serious breakdown of relationships and employers will genuinely believe they have no option but to dismiss the person involved.  I am not undermining the position of employees which must be upheld in law but that might be one of the reasons there are so few reinstatements. Most employers accept that dismissing an employee is the ultimate sanction and that of all the matters with which an employer must deal it is the most distasteful. In my experience that has been the case.  However, in some cases, in the interest of the workforce, employers have no choice but to dismiss employees. However, most employers have no objection to monetary compensation in the case of a dismissal, but this is where we should strike a balance.  Unfortunately, dismissal from the workforce is a fact of life, but the facts regarding reinstatement probably bear out that in most cases employers do not take such a decision lightly.  On the other hand, nobody likes to see an employee dismissed without some monetary compensation.  Generally speaking, the ratios are 80: 20, 70: 30 or 60: 40.  Where an unfair dismissal is proven the ratio is the other way around and, obviously, the person is reinstated. In very few cases the ratio is 100: 0.  Monetary compensation allows for a case <Col N="1071" /> where it is fair to dismiss a person under the terms of this Act, but where there are mitigating circumstances.  In such cases employees do not begrudge monetary compensation.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity of contributing to this debate.  I would like to give some of the background to the development of labour law here.  In the past decade or so many changes and improvements in our labour law have resulted from the European Community framework on labour legislation. That is not said often enough here.  I pay tribute to the influence of the European Community's labour law on our law, it have benefited Irish workers.  The erstwhile Leader of the Labour Party, Michael O'Leary, is not too popular in Labour circles but I have no hesitation in saying that when he was Minister for Labour he introduced worthwhile legislation. Workers owe him a great deal and I pay tribute to him.</P>

      <P>I disagree with Deputy Creed, but I will not go down that road. I will keep on the straight and narrow of labour law rather than dwell on labour history.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need to bring our labour law more into line with labour law in Europe.  It would be a good day for us if the Social Charter was implemented right across the Twelve members states.  I was unhappy with the prevarication and delays of Mrs. Thatcher and her Government in trying to delay and frustrate the implementation of the Social Charter in those states.  As far as I am concerned, the sooner that <Col N="1072" /> charter is implemented the better for this country.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and its improved provisions.  I also welcome the fact that we are spending time debating labour law in this House.  As Deputy Ó Cuív stated, we do not spend enough time considering the implications of labour law on the workforce and industry generally.  Today is a good opportunity for people such as myself to air our views on this matter.  As Deputy Rabbitte stated, I have taken more cases to the Employment Appeals Tribunal than any other person on the grounds of redundancy minimum notice, maternity and unfair dismissal.  Since the initiation of the tribunal I have had wide experience in labour law, not alone in Limerick but in all areas of the country. Every society needs a civilised and compassionate code of labour law although not something that will mollycoddle employees.  There should be a framework within which workers are guaranteed their rights will be protected in law.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Rabbitte's views in regard to barristers and solicitors invading the work of the tribunal.  The tribunal, which was set up by one of the Minister's predecessors, was not meant to be a nest egg for barristers or solicitors. On the contrary, it was meant as a forum for employers and workers in which they could take their cases in an atmosphere that would not overawe either party. Sometimes the entire panoply of a courthouse &mdash; the wigs, gowns and the archaic languages and practices &mdash; overawe ordinary people who go before the courts. The Employment Appeals Tribunal was established as a forum where those type of archaic practices, dress or language would not prevail, where ordinary people, employers and employees, could go before it, state their case and get justice. I have seen many solicitors and barristers appear before the tribunal, some of them tout for work and give the impression that workers and employers cannot go before the tribunal without being represented by a solicitor or a barrister. That is wrong.  There is no reason community groups, trade union officers and officials, residents' groups and other <Col N="1073" /> community information groups cannot represent workers or employers before the tribunal.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ó Cuív made a good suggestion in relation to books published by the Minister's Department in this area.  I would ask the Minister to go further and publish a booklet which would advise people about the procedures of crossexamination and the presentation of a case to the tribunal.  Anybody can learn how to present a case to the tribunal. One would not want to be Einstein to go before the Employment Appeals Tribunal. Unfortunately the trend is developing, the legal representations are made on behalf of applicants.  A small booklet published by the Department advising people how to conduct a case when cross-examined would be of great help to those who may bring cases before the tribunal and it would not involve a great deal of cost.</P>
    <P>There are some changes introduced in the Bill which I welcome but there are some areas which the Bill does not address.  It is impossible to enforce an award made by the Employment Appeals Tribunal in cases where an employer goes out of business but does not go into liquidation. I am aware of a number of such cases in recent years.  There is no redress for employees in cases where nonnational employers leave the jurisdiction. There was one such celebrated case of a French employer, Killine Eyewear Ltd., in Killaloe, County Clare.  The employer had obtained substantial grants from the Shannon Development Company.  I do not know the amount involved but it was a substantial grant of Irish taxpayers money.  An award was made by the tribunal in relation to three or four workers but it was impossible to enforce payment of those awards.  The employer was proud of the fact that he was fluent in English. At the tribunal hearing his English was very laboured; he pretended, he did not understand the proceedings and sought the services of a translator.  He was shamming and understood better than anybody what was happening.  He was able to play this game and cause frustration to members of the tribunal.  When the <Col N="1074" /> tribunal did not accept his act and his claim that he did not understand the proceedings, they made an award against him, but he left the country taking with him public money.  Unscrupulous employers can exploit workers and this loophole must be addressed.  In the case to which I referred much correspondence was involved in writing back and forth between the tribunal and the employer and at the end of the day there was no redress for the workers concerned.</P>
    <P>Other aspects of the legislation must also be considered.  It is implicit in the legislation that a worker must be in employment for one year before he or she can bring a case for unfair dismissal against an employer.  Sometimes unscrupulous employers exploit that one year time limit by employing the person for 11 months and then letting the worker go.  In those circumstances that worker has no redress to the Employment Appeals Tribunal but may invoke the services of a rights commission.  I have secured <i>ex gratia</i> settlements in cases where workers have been wrongly treated.  This is an area that should be examined by the Minister.  Such cases have promoted closer links between the Employment Appeals Tribunal and Rights Commissioners.  I have advocated the use of the services of Rights Commissioners and their services should be used more widely in the future.</P>
    <P>I welcome the inclusion of part-time workers in this legislation.  For a long time such workers were in limbo, excluded from their rights under the provisions of many of the Acts from which I quoted.  It is good that they have been brought in from the cold.  For too long part-time workers were the pariahs and Cinderellas of the labour force and that was not good enough.  They make a useful contribution to our economy and society and this should be recognised by provisions in labour legislation.  I welcome their inclusion in this Bill.</P>
    <P>There are other abuses in relation to short term contracts.  At one time such contracts were unknown in the Irish labour market.  People were employed on a 40 hour week.  In recent years, particularly <Col N="1075" /> in the last decade, more private firms and public bodies, for example, corporations, county councils and health boards, are offering short term contracts, as short as three months.  Those contracts are put in place deliberately to avoid the provisions in this legislation.  Many employers break an employee's service for one day to avoid the implications of the Act.  I do not believe this area is provided for under the provisions of this Bill; it provides for part-term workers. Short-term contracts should not be invoked by employers to avoid the provisions in this Bill.  That should be outlawed. Too many employers are breaking workers' service.  It is unfair and deprives the worker of his or her rights under legislation dealing with unfair dismissals, minimum notice, maternity benefits and so on.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ó Cuív referred to other practices engaged in by employers in the building industry.  He referred to C2 and other certificates used by workers and employers.  Such certificates are forced on workers who normally work on a PAYE basis.  Most building workers in the past worked on an hourly basis. However, there has been a change in that practice in the last two decades.  Most building workers whether permanent or temporary, now work on a bonus system. I do not see anything wrong with that. The work people do must be measured. It is easy to measure the daily output of a bricklayer.  It is possible to count the number of concrete blocks he lays.  Similarly the work of plasterers, carpenters and plumbers can be measured.  Work in the building industry, not only in Ireland but in Britain and Europe, is remunerated on a bonus basis.  I know from experience that building workers in Ireland are as productive as those in other parts of the world.  In the last decade more C2 certificates and other certificates have been used in relation to employment. C2 certificates are used to employ people on a sub-contract basis.  The national industrial agreement for the building industry stipulates that sub-contractors must fulfil certain criteria.  It <Col N="1076" /> states that a sub-contractor must have a permanent base for his operations and must supply materials, equipment, machinery and so on.  C2 certificates have been issued, perhaps not like confetti, but very liberally and widely across the board.  This has led to evasion of taxes and the breaking up of many building industry agreements.  Many people using C2 certificates are not genuine sub-contractors within any lawful meaning of the word.</P>
    <P>Those certificates have been used, with other tax certificates, to avoid the PAYE payments in industry and reduce employers' obligations in that area in regard to a meal allowance, tool allowance, travelling time, holiday payments, the guaranteed week and many other agreements that are frustrated by the use of these certificates.  The onus is placed totally on the worker to look after his interests in this area but if the worker loses employment and has not had his contributions paid by his employer he does not qualify for unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance.  He is required to go to the health board and go through a long convoluted process in order to get assistance.  Another aspect of this is that the worker has no insurance and if he has an accident on a site he is liable for the cost of his hospital care, convalescence and so on.  There are no obligations on his employer in this regard.  That should be addressed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>These Acts do not apply to workers, mainly building workers, who invoke the C2 system, and other forms of subrogation, to avoid paying the same amount of tax as their fellow workers. This should be examined by the Minister and the Revenue Commissioners.  I have nothing against productivity arrangements or building workers in general trying to earn as much as they can.  I am not against an employer using the skills and talents of their workers.  However, grave abuses are taking place in this area and safety precautions are not adhered to on occasions when people are trying to make money.  It is very hard to place apprentices in that situation because contractors <Col N="1077" /> have no great interest in taking on apprentices and teaching them the skills of the trade.  This is unfortunate as we all suffer because of that.  It is important that we end these malpractices and abuses because it is an area which the Bill does not address.  It needs to be examined in the future and I hope we will have an opportunity to return to that aspect of labour law later.</P>
    <P>In general, I welcome the Bill.  It is enlightened legislation which improves the protection of workers provisions contained in other Acts.  It also helps to bring us into line with European law which is favourable from our point of view.  We cannot remain isolationist and we must not allow sectional interests to control this area.  It would be wrong of us to think that we had some form of dispensation from labour law that is now universally enshrined in legislation throughout Europe.  I hope this Bill will go some way towards redressing some of the abuses and malpractices I have outlined.  I wish to share my remaining time with my colleague, Deputy Broughan.</P>

      <Col N="1078" /> Aontaim leis na Teachtaí eile a d'fháiltigh roimh an mBille seo agus tréasláim leis an Aire Stáit as ucht é a thabhairt os comhair Thithe an Oireachtais.  Is léir go bhfuil feabhas mór tagtha ar chúrsaí fostaíochta ó 1977 i leith, go háirithe mar a bhaineann leis an ngaol idir fostaí agus fostóir.  Déanfaidh an Bill seo leasú breise ar an dlí ar mhaithe le cách.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977 was a milestone in industrial relations and provided for an impartial investigation either by a Rights Commissioner or by the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  If an employee was successful in an unfair dismissal case against an employer that person was entitled either to reinstatement, re-engagement or compensation. The 1977 Act worked extremely well and the tribunal was extremely busy.  In 1991 the tribunal dealt with 872 cases and from 1984 to 1991 a total of 7,751 cases were referred which would appear to be a big number.  I notice that amendments before the House suggest an extension from six to seven weeks of the time for giving notice of a case being taken.  I understand that is because of the huge amount of administration involved in dealing with cases coming before that tribunal.  The Minister should consider dealing with that matter not just by an extension of the time limit but by providing extra staff.  This is a most important service and one which has improved industrial relations here.  It provides a release valve which prevents more precipitive action, has improved personnel practices and reduced the number of strikes and stopages.  The 1986 ESRI report indicated that few employers considered the 1977 Act as posing problems for them.</P>
    <P>It is inevitable that since the passing of the 1977 Act minor and some major shortcomings would be highlighted and some are addressed in the Bill.  It is significant that the commitment in that issue in the Programme for a Partnership Government is being implemented so quickly.  I commend the Minister of State for her alacrity in this matter.  This action augurs well for the success of the Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1079" /> The 1977 Act draws a distinction between dismissal and unfair dismissal. This distinction has been explored by a number of speakers and is in no way affected by the Bill.  Indeed, the Bill can in no way be interpreted as giving a <i>carte blanche</i> for irresponsible employee behaviour.</P>
    <P>I welcome in particular the provision covering people employed through employment agencies.  The terms of employment of these people who have been in somewhat of a limbo situation up to now, are now covered more adequately than before.  It is important to bear in mind that other legislation has been effective in this area.  I would cite in particular, the Payment of Wages Act, 1991, and the Worker Protection (Regular Part-time Employees) Act, 1991. Until Deputy Rabbitte mentioned it I was not aware that 23 legislative measures have been passed since 1973 dealing with this matter which is an indication of how complicated it is.  It is a favourable reflection on the development of our society that this Bill provides for an extension of the number of grounds for unfair dismissal to include age, sexual orientation and membership of the travelling community.  The Oireachtas must be seen to take a lead in these matters and to resist those who engage in discrimination on any grounds and avoid the inevitable slippery slope which pandering to such elements would inevitably lead us.</P>
    <P>A perceived weakness in the 1977 Act, which has been referred to by speakers, is that in practice some employers ignore the findings of the tribunal and force an employee to seek redress in the courts. In some instances this was too expensive a route for the employee to follow and the case remained dormant with no subsequent action against the employer.  I would welcome a stronger requirement on the employer to act on the findings of the Rights Commissioner or the Employment Appeals Tribunal or the provision of a strong financial disincentive for ignoring such findings.  I am not sure that the section 7 amendment to section 8 (4) of <Col N="1080" /> the principal Act adequately addresses this matter, particularly in relation to the timescale involved.  I am aware it is addressed also in section 11 but I would welcome the Minister's further clarification on this.</P>
    <P>I would welcome also a provision that the Minister would automatically take the appeal to the Circuit Court rather than as appears in the Bill, if I understand it correctly, that the case be taken either by the employee or the Minister.  I would welcome also clarification on the time limit involved.  This would be particularly important in cases where an employer is likely to go out of business in the short term with the result that by the time the case is taken the employee has no redress.</P>
    <P>I welcome the basic financial award of four weeks' pay, a provision which will strengthen the hand of the employee.  We need to remain vigilant in ensuring that employers do not have the opportunity to use devices to circumvent legislation. We should be prepared to introduce further amendments as required or perhaps a composite Bill covering all elements of employment legislation.  I very much welcome this Bill and commend the Minister on its introduction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Killeen, for sharing his time with me.  I welcome this opportunity to make a brief contribution on the Unfair Dismissals (Amendment) Bill, 1993.  A model society with continued change and increasing complexity, as a result of which there is need for continuous development and updating law.  People frequently express impatience with the process of updating legislation.  In certain instances constructive criticism is justified. Today we are considering a range of amendments to the Act which has made an excellent contribution to natural justice since 1977.  Proper planning at the time resulted in legislation which has stood the test of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendments we are now considering are concerned mainly with extending and clarifying the scope of the <Col N="1081" /> 1977 Act rather than changing it in a fundamental manner.  It is vital that even the most effective legislation is subject to regular scrutiny and review.  The key phrase in the current Bill is the need to maintain a balance between the rights of the employee and the rights of the employer.  High levels of unemployment place an extra burden on employees because they may feel that the employer will avail of any excuse for dismissal to employ somebody else on a lower salary. Similarly, in the knowledge that employees are readily available the employer may be tempted to be overdemanding on the employee.  The trend towards an increase in the number of non-union employments further increases the problems experienced by a large number of employees.</P>
    <P>On the other hand the employer must make every effort to survive in a tough and competitive business world.  There is little room for complacency on the part of the employer.  Customers and financial institutions allow little or no room for excuses.  If a business is not run efficiently or if it fails to show profit it is unlikely to survive for very long.  Consequently, the employer constantly needs the full support and co-operation of the staff.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, on her initiative in this area. I welcome the principle of the Bill.  It is essential that legislation on unfair dismissals be updated and brought into line with changing circumstances.  This legislation arises from shortcomings in the 1977 Act and the necessity to amend it.  It is hard to consolidate complex legislation and it is very easy to lose sight of the major issues that need to be tackled. There has been much dissatisfaction with the operation of the Unfair Dismissals Act, and any legislation which will eliminate its shortcomings is most welcome.</P>
    <P>The Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, provided legal protection for workers and dismissal could take place only where substantial grounds justified it and when the action by the employer was taken according to procedure.  That Act provided for a system of investigation by <Col N="1082" /> Rights Commissioners and the Employment Appeals Tribunal of claims for unfair dismissal.  This was a positive and progressive measure.  Where an individual was found to be unfairly dismissed the Act provided for redress by reinstatement or compensation for financial loss. Since 1977 a comprehensive and well tried code of practice has been devised relating to control, discipline and dismissal, and this is accepted by employers and unions.  The 1977 Act provided for a degree of certainty in the workplace.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill which provides that an explanation be given of a decision of a tribunal or a court is welcome.  The reasons for decisions of courts and tribunals often mystify us and it is essential that they be made public so that there is an understanding of the operation of legislation.  I welcome the provision in section 8 to increase the time within which to make an appeal and the provision in section 13 to extend the scope of the legislation to include persons employed through employment agencies. The Unfair Dismissals Act has had a major impact on management policy and practice, especially in large organisations with fully developed personnel departments. Employers and employees now have a clear understanding of where each stands.  The system is more open and transparent and there is a greater awareness of what is fair.  Procedures &mdash; for example, in the case of discipline &mdash; should be clearly understood.  The focus should be not so much on discipline or dismissal but on employees' needs.</P>
    <P>The Unfair Dismissals Act has contributed to the improvement of relationships at work.  In this regard I congratulate the various unions which played their part in complying with this Act.  I welcome this legislation.  We must ensure protection for workers, particularly those in jobs with low pay and bad conditions.  Employment must be maintained and employers encouraged to employ a greater number of people.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill as a valuable addition to existing legislation <Col N="1083" /> in this area.  However, many areas are not covered by this legislation.  Perhaps the Government will consider consolidating all the legislation of the last 20 years.  Cognisance should be taken of ILO submissions and the Social Charter, which resulted from the activities of the European trade union movement and the European confederation of socialist parties. The existence of such strong social European legislation, which has deeply influenced our country since the mid-1970s is welcome.  However, 20 years later many aspects of this legislation have not been fully applied to our country. It is notable that under the Maastricht Treaty unanimous agreement of Labour Ministers is required in relation to matters such as dismissals and social security. There is scope for wider application of European legislation.  We are grateful that measure has influenced the legislation before us.</P>
      <P>Unlike some speakers, I believe the overriding power in industrial dismissals disputes and in most industrial relations rests with employers, in the private or public sector.  Many of us are aware from previous employments that the balance of advantage lies with employers.  As society and the economy change the Government must strive to keep up with the natural advantages which employers will have in a free enterprise economy. It has been observed that reinstatement has not been a preferred option for employers when the Employment Appeals Tribunal or a court has found against them.  They much prefer a grant of compensation rather than reinstatement.</P>
      <P>Section 5 provides that the Employment Appeals Tribunal can take account of the reasonableness of the employer. Deputy Rabbitte referred earlier to the huge hunting ground that the Employment Appeals Tribunal has become for the legal profession.  That phrase &ldquo;reasonableness of the employer&rdquo; will generate a lot of legal action in the future. There remains a decided advantage to the employers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is to be welcomed because it <Col N="1084" /> attempts to address some of the changing social structures.  Britain is still enduring the Thatcherite revolution of the eighties. The British economy has tended to move towards Japanese and Far Eastern labour conditions.  That movement is developing here.  There is an alarming number of factory workers on temporary contracts and on short term fixed contracts. I welcome the attempt in section 3 to deal with this.  If a case goes before the tribunal we can aggregate the amount of time which has been served by the employee.  A feature of our economy today is part-time work and fixed contract work.  I asked the Minister for Enterprise and Employment about this a few weeks ago and in reply he indicated that our civil servants are not aware that this sort of Thatcherite revolution is spreading throughout industry.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision by which we apply the 1977 legislation to employment agencies.  There is a plethora of employment agencies, particularly for office workers.  Years ago temporary workers who had worked well for a number of years were employed permanently by the company.  It is interesting that now the third party concerned will become liable for all the penalties under this Act and the 1977 Act.</P>
    <P>I agree with the remarks which were made about foreign employers and situations where employers have left, leaving employees without any recourse to protect their rights.  For a long time I dealt with a case involving a number of workers who worked for a company which closed down but which did not go into liquidation.  It is very difficult to achieve compensation for such workers. The Minister and the Government might consider that point in future consolidation legislation.  I agree with remarks in relation to the subcontracting area where effectively a workforce can be offloaded.  In one of our large Irish companies about 15 years ago virtually the whole driving force was offloaded into subcontracting.  This has occurred in some service companies recently.  In the subcontracting world the rights enshrined <Col N="1085" /> in labour law and even in this new Bill are not available.</P>
    <P>I welcome the extension of the grounds for unfair dismissal.  The partnership Government will be taking strong action in the area of sexual orientation during the next few weeks.  It is interesting that this is being covered in labour law.  In Seanad Éireann it was proposed to include age as grounds for unfair dismissal. There is huge discrimination against people on grounds of age.  Some people are told they are too old for a job when they are in the mid-twenties or thirties.  From mid-forties on, one is certainly consigned to the scrap heap. Workers have been encouraged to leave jobs and accept redundancy and workers who found one task extremely difficult were not redeployed but were simply dismissed. I hope this is the start of a proper respect for older workers.  We should have provisions for older workers in society.  Many people want to work beyond their mid-sixties even on a part-time basis.</P>
    <P>I welcome the other provisions in relation to the extra four weeks along with the two years and so on.  I also welcome the extension of time limits because of the backlog of cases and the huge increase in fines for employers who are not prepared to take cognisance of the activities of the Rights Commissioner when a case has been referred.  I welcome the new choices open to workers to use either the courts or the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 14 in relation to apprentices and others engaged in trade union activity who did not have protection under previous legislation because length of service was less than one year.  In general, this Bill is a fine advance by the partnership Government and I fully support it.  However, there are many areas, within the changing circumstances of our economy overall, particularly in relation to short contracts and temporary workers, which the Minister's Department should examine. These areas affect a growing segment of our working population, leading to additional problems when people are dismissed <Col N="1086" /> summarily and have no recourse whatsoever available to them.  With that caveat I commend this Bill strongly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Members I generally welcome this Bill and recognise the need to protect employees, particularly at a time when the labour market has considerably more potential employees than there would appear to be jobs available.  In such circumstances the tendency is for the buyers' market to prevail, the same regard not being had to employees' rights, privileges and so on. For that reason alone the provisions of this Bill are important.  I should point out that a number of practices that have evolved over the years, leading to the necessity for the introduction of this legislation, must also be tackled by the Government.  This partnership Government would do well to examine those practices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other speakers have mentioned the development of subcontracting.  Why has there been such an increase in subcontracting nationwide?  The short answer is that it is too costly and administratively difficult to employ an individual. Whether in the manufacturing or services area, all employers will readily concede that it is difficult to take on staff, for a number of reasons.  The first reason is the cost involved in terms of PRSI, administrative costs and so on.  Even in the case of a small business of, say, five or six employees, fairly considerable administrative assistance is required, to the extent that it has become undesirable to recruit, leading to the growth in subcontracting. In the subcontracting area it is not always as easy to enforce the regulations as in the case of ordinary employees.  Let me take the example of a large firm employing cleaners.  There was a time when most firms employed their own cleaners.  This type of business has changed totally in the past ten years, in that all of this work is now done by subcontracting.  That begs the question why it should be so.  It is most undesirable that this should be the case.  The reason is that it is not profitable for a firm, no matter how large, to employ people fulltime <Col N="1087" /> because of all the administrative requirements, PRSI, holiday pay and so forth.  The main burden cited continuously by employers is PRSI and the difficulty of allowing somebody access to employment.  In other words, an employee seeking work has a problem; an employer who wants to give work also has a problem.  For an employer to make employment readily available to an employee, he or she must incur certain penalties of a financial nature.</P>
    <P>Let us examine what might be done to rectify that position.  The opportunity for an employee who has been out of work intermittently over recent years to obtain gainful employment is obstructed by virtue of the fact that, if they return to low-paid work, they will be caught in the poverty trap; that is the first disincentive. If they are recruited by an employer, automatically that employer has to do one or two things.  He or she will examine what it will cost the firm in a single year to recruit such an employee.  When the old insurance stamp system prevailed&mdash; although people scoff at such a system nowadays &mdash; it was so simple to recruit somebody, even for three, four or five months in the normal way.  There is a crying need for simplification of the system at that level to encourage a prospective employee to seek employment if they happen to be unemployed and render it profitable for them to do so. The incentive is the all important factor. If a person finds on seeking employment that they will finish up with £20 or £30 per week less than they would otherwise receive, that is no incentive whatsoever. A simple system should be devised whereby an employer can recruit somebody, especially in summer when there is more seasonal work available.  However, I know there is a downside to that in the abuse of casual labour and so on.  In the present climate with over 300,000 people unemployed and no prospect of any appreciable reduction in the near future, there is an obvious need to re-examine the paraphernalia, bureaucracy and red tape surrounding the overall issue of employment. <Col N="1088" /> My conclusion is that this Bill is desirable. Employers and employees alike will readily accept that, although there will always be exceptions to the rule, as there are in every walk of life and we must have safeguards in place for those exceptions. The general view would be that the provisions of this Bill are desirable but would not have been necessary had we in place a system operating to the advantage of both employer and employee.  At present there is no encouragement or incentive for either; in fact quite the reverse. Therefore, we are dealing with a problem that has arisen from an over-burdening of the system.</P>
    <P>With the development of subcontracting, within a market in which there is an over-supply of labour, naturally there will be the tendency to abuse the regulations.  I hope the provisions of this Bill will deal effectively with such abuses.  We will all have heard of or dealt with cases of an employee finding himself or herself out of work on account of some very minor matter.  The tendency for such to occur within a market in which there is an oversupply of labour is much greater than if the reverse were the case.  It will clearly be seen that the provisions of this Bill have become necessary as a result of other factors.  Those other factors need to be dealt with as well.  If they are not, there will be an exacerbation of the problems obtaining, leading to the necessity for further legislation to cater for them. Unless the fundamentals are dealt with we shall continue in this vein and will not solve any of our problems.</P>
    <P>I would much prefer to see circumstances prevail in which we could make employment more readily available to those at present seeking it.  If there is one issue fundamental to that objective surely it must be removal of some of the trappings, bureaucracy and red tape surrounding any effort on the part of an unfortunate person at present seeking employment and the unfortunate employer who might be able to provide such employment.  Unless some of that bureaucracy is abolished and the system simplified, we shall not make progress in this area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1089" /> I might mention that one of the disincentives to employers recruiting people is the fact that they, the employers, become liable to a whole series of penalties if they retain an employee beyond a certain period.  I can never understand why that should be so.  It should be the other way around; they would be encouraged to retain an employee unless the performance of that employee is unsatisfactory. There should be incentives to ensure that the maximum number of jobs is maintained; the more labour intensive the better for everyone concerned.  For some unknown reason during the years labour law has evolved in such a way that disincentives have been created.  I am not talking about unscrupulous employers who will always retain employees until shortly before they qualify for statutory payments and then release them to go on the unemployment register.  There is a need to provide incentives to encourage employers to retain employees.  It should be possible to come up with a remedy.</P>
    <P>There is a need to tackle the difficulties encountered by a person in seeking gainful employment and the difficulties encountered by a potential employer in taking on an extra employee.  The cost involved in terms of administration, particularly for a small business is great. We seem to spend much time in this House talking about small businesses but there is no incentive for such businesses to take on extra employees.  Indeed, given the cost involved, over and above what they would pay an employee, it would be better for them to do so.  For this reason the Minister should consider the possibility of introducing further legislation to solve the problem to which I referred.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonWalsh" hpid="Mr. E. Walsh Mr. E. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I have dealt with many cases in the past where it was clear there was a need for legislation and regulations to clarify people's entitlements.  The first matter I would like to deal with in this regard is the new basic award.  This provision should be welcomed because it is clear and simple.  We should now be in a position <Col N="1090" /> to inform people of their entitlements.</P>
      <P>It is my experience in cases where people have been unfairly dismissed that the problem is a lack of knowledge of the procedures and what is available under existing legislation.  As mentioned by a previous speaker, a large volume of complex employment legislation is in place. Following the implementation of this Bill we should consider the question of whether it would be possible to simplify this legislation so that people would be able to acquire necessary information to avail of their entitlements under this and previous legislation.  It is my experience that people tend to seek advice on what is available.  Many young people seem to be unaware of legislation in place and their entitlements.  They do not seem to be aware that the trade union movement is available as a source of information.  It is a sad fact that today many people are not members of a trade union and cannot avail of their expertise and protection.</P>
      <P>In regard to the tribunal, many people try to argue their own case, albeit with the help of the tribunal.  Despite this it is still difficult to process a case in such circumstances.  I am aware that the trade union movement has, in many cases, offered the services of its personnel to people who are not members of a trade union.  These personnel provide assistance and advice to the person concerned.</P>
      <P>The question arises as to whether persons should be entitled to legal representation at the tribunal.  I am not sure if this is the correct course of action because there is a possibility that people may be further alienated with the result that they may feel they have to take their case with the assistance of the legal profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many part-time workers seem to have no knowledge of their entitlements.  In many cases part-time workers are on contract. Traditionally, people were employed for a fixed number of hours per week whereas now a week's work is regarded as five days.  As I said, many part-time workers who seek our assistance do not know their entitlements in terms of holidays, sick pay and redundancy <Col N="1091" /> payments.  The way part-time workers are treated and dealt with can often lead to dismissal; in other words, if there is an argument the employer may feel that the easiest thing to do is to get rid of the employee.</P>
    <P>Following the enactment of this Bill the Minister of State should consider ways and means by which the information available to people can be improved. There is a need to condense and simplify the information contained in this and existing legislation so that it can be advertised and made available to young people in particular who should be able to understand the process and avail of their rights. Members should take into account the effect legislation has on the people it has been designed to help.  I would like to see all the information contained in this Bill simplified and made available so that people can make use of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I was associated with the Department of Enterprise and Employment for two and a half years and although I have had responsibilities in other areas I have always followed closely legislation produced by that Department.</P>
      <P>The Bill is welcome because it updates the principal Act, the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977.  As time goes on and as work practices and customs change there will be a need to review labour legislation. The Department of Labour was set up in 1966, making it one of the most recent and its first Minister was the former President Hillery.  Some of the Ministers who served in it, with the exception of myself, achieved great things.  Indeed the former Deputy, Mr. Michael O'Leary, was responsible for enacting much of the labour legislation prompted by the European Community.  The body of legislation is so voluminous that it has taken many years for people to come to grips with it. Indeed it took employers a long time to accept that they were governed by this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Legislation becomes outmoded and needs updating and, therefore, I welcome the proposed changes in this legislation. A discussion document was <Col N="1092" /> prepared in 1986-87 which covered three areas; unfair dismissals, employment equality and the payment of wages.  A payment of wages Bill was enacted a year ago and this Bill before us is a follow-up to the other areas under discussion which were considered in need of updating.  I am sure the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, will have an input to the equality aspects of this Bill and we look forward to the introduction of legislation in that area.</P>
    <P>This is a very welcome Bill.  Although the Minister with responsibility in this area is not present, I commend her on the job she is doing and I am sure she will ensure that the legislation enacted by this House is enforced.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the implementation of the European Social Charter, which sets out the rights of workers.  It is worth reminding the House that the Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers lists the rights of workers: (1) workers have a right to work in any EC country of their choice; (2)  they should be guaranteed a fair wage; (3)  they should have improved living and working conditions.  It is interesting that the EC Foundation for Living and Working Conditions is located just down the road from me and it would be interesting to hear its reports discussed in the House.  It would be useful if an invitation was extended to Members to visit this foundation; (4)  they should have social protection under the prevailing national systems; (5)  freedom of association and collective bargaining &mdash; we are reasonably up-to-date in this regard &mdash; (6)  vocational training; (7) equal treatment of both men and women; (8)  information, consultation and participation; (9)  health protection and safety at work; (10)  protection of children and adolescents; (11)  minimum living standards for the elderly and (12) improved social and professional integration of the disabled.  It would be hard to find anybody who could find fault with that Charter.</P>
    <P>Members on all sides of the House are in agreement that the Social Charter should be adopted as part of the Maastricht Treaty agreement.  There may be <Col N="1093" /> some confusion because in the Maastricht Treaty agreement it is known as the Social Chapter, but I still refer to it as the Social Charter.  Some of the Community countries have adopted a pick and mix approach to the Maastricht Treaty agreement. Germany, Holland, France, Belgium, Luxembourg and Ireland are enthusiastic about the adoption of the Social Chapter but others are not because it will impose an additional cost on production. It is worrying that our neighbour across the water is totally opposed to the adoption of the Social Chapter of the Masstricht Treaty agreement.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that the Social Chapter states only fundamental social rights, and they must be enacted in every country.  Britain's feet dragging on the Social Chapter gives cause for concern.  This will give them a competitive edge in attracting foreign investment to set up in Britain.  As it imposes a cost on industry, investors from America, Japan and other countries may not wish to be tied down by legislation that does not apply in their own country.  I hope that the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and anyone representing us in Europe will insist that all countries should adopt the Social Chapter and that the Maastricht agreement is not one from which they can pick and mix.  The Danes have said they do not like the defence policy and the British have said they do not like the Social Chapter and they are allowed to take on board what they want.  It would be very dangerous for us if this were allowed to happen.</P>
    <P>When one considers that Digital transferred its operation from Galway to Ayr in Scotland one wonders if an added attraction was the fact that Britain did not adopt these rights.  In Packard Electric approximately 200 workers were laid off and a certain section of that operation was moved to Portugal.  If countries like Spain, Portugal and Britain will not apply these fundamental rights to workers why incorporate this chapter in the Maastricht agreement?  Why incorporate a chapter that advances the conditions of workers <Col N="1094" /> unless we ensure that it is accepted by all EC countries so that labour legislation throughout the Community is on the same base?  I cannot see how anybody in an advanced Community can say: &ldquo;this is an aspirational document, we do not have to adopt it but we may adopt certain parts of it&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If we are adopting the 12 rights they should apply to the entire Community. Ireland, the poorest country in the Community, is prepared to accept these conditions and rights.  I insist that our Ministers ensure that the bigger, wealthier and stronger countries do something similar, otherwise I see a danger in their having a more attractive package to offer in rural investment.  That is dangerous for us, the IDA and the 300,000 people who are unemployed.  It is not for us to lower our standards, but we must ensure that the standards of other Community countries are raised to the highest levels.</P>
    <P>When we adopt certain aspects of the social chapter, as contained in this Bill, we have to say loud and clear that countries who are not prepared to accept forward legislation on behalf of their workforce should not be allowed to remain within the Community.  If we are part of the Community we should accept all the conditions, simply not those that suit us.</P>
    <P>I am vice-chairman of the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body, on which there are 25 members from each Parliament. At our plenary session in Cork at the end of next month it is my intention to table a motion on this subject not to embarrass our British friends, because I know that half the group are totally supportive of the social chapter but to have open discussion.  The British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body was set up to deal not only with security and protection in the country but to discuss all issues, for example, social issues, our position within the EC and problems arising from that and the position and conditions under which Irish people in Britain and British people in Ireland live and work. I have already indicated to the joint chairmen that I will be moving this motion <Col N="1095" /> which cannot be brought forward without the support of the Dáil, Seanad, the House of Commons and the House of Lords.  According to the rules, a motion has to be joined by members from both sides.  I hope to have the opportunity of a full open discussion in Cork on this matter and to encourage our British colleagues to ensure that the social chapter is adopted by them.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister is bringing forward legislation which will give protection in the case of the termination of certain second or subsequent fixed terms and fixed purpose employment contracts. This has become popular in Ireland in the past ten or 15 years.  Fixed contracts are being offered rather than contracts which are debated and agreed between the trade union movement and the employer.  In my view, fixed contracts are being offered to exclude the trade union movement organising, particularly in new ventures some of which are multinationals setting up in Ireland.  Fixed contracts are being applied right across the board from the most highly paid person down to the lowest paid worker in the organisation.  This reminds one of film stars or TV personalities who sign up for a length of time.  That is where the idea originated.  The person could work only in accordance with that contract for the term it was set up.  This is a way around all the legislation we enact.</P>
    <P>I welcome that provision in the Bill and I hope it will discourage employers from thinking they can get around the legislation by offering jobs to potential employees on the basis that they sign contracts.  With 300,000 people unemployed those seeking employment are almost forced into taking whatever is on offer.  Legislation such as this is needed to ensure that these people are protected when they are in a vulnerable position.  I welcome that section and I hope, when enacted, it will remove the present weakness and discourage potential employers or companies setting up in Ireland from excluding workers from the terms of any legislation in the labour area.</P>
    <P>Obviously, this Bill will improve the lot <Col N="1096" /> of people who work in small businesses where there is no tradition of organised labour, where they are unorganised employments and, therefore, employees have to work in unacceptable conditions. A number of Deputies referred to the fact that those workers are ignorant of the laws enacted over the years to protect their interests.  It is important, therefore, that Bills such as this update the provisions and make their position clearer.</P>
    <P>It has been said that many people who are dismissed have no knowledge of the law in this area and are not concerned about how they can get redress.  In our clinics we meet people who have been let go by employers who are either ignorant of their responsibilities or who flout the legislation.  I hope we can improve these matters.  In rural areas the situation for workers is not good.  Travelling to Dublin to a Labour Court or unfair dismissals hearing can be off putting for many people.  The old idea of holding hearings in local areas should be maintained. More publicity should be given to the fact that a worker can have the services of the Labour Court in his or her own county. Local newspapers are keen to report discussions at council meetings, court hearings and so on and would be keen to attend such hearings and highlight the difficulties people experience.  I hope rural employers accept they have the same responsibility as if they were in any part of the city of Dublin or any of our other major cities.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on her appointment.  She is very capable and the first woman to have responsibility for industrial issues.  I congratulate her on taking over that job.  That position used to be known as the bed of nails in comparison with other Departments.  It is now a progressive Department, and has expanded its area of operations.  Many people now depend on it.  I wish the Minister well in dealing with her first legislation in the House.  It is excellent legislation with which to start and I look forward to its operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for the absence of <Col N="1097" /> the Minister who has an official engagement. She obviously looks forward to Committee Stage of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kavanagh raised the question of access to information about the Bill by workers and employees.  It is not within the terms of the Bill, nevertheless it is very important.  In areas where there is no definite trade union activity and organisation workers may not always be aware of their rights and may have difficulty in gaining access to the procedures which would allow them to bring forward their case under the Act.  I am sure that is an area to which the Minister will apply herself because obviously there should be equal access to the provisions of the Unfair Dismissals Act for all our citizens.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their wide and varied contributions to this debate.  I understand that this Bill was perceived, prior to publication, as a primarily technical Bill geared to tidying up and enhancing already sound legislation.  Discussion on the Bill in this House is a reflection of the broad interest in and public profile accorded to this legislation since its enactment in 1977.  It is heartening to note that all contributors welcomed the Bill and overall the only criticism was concerned with further enhancing the legislation rather than any retrenchment.  Many of these matters will be raised on Committee Stage by way of amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flaherty raised the question of agency workers which is dealt with in section 13 of the Bill.  There is no clear statistical information about the number of agency workers who are employed with a user organisation.  It is not unusual, however, that some agency workers are called upon to work for significant periods of time in a single organisation.  In these circumstances, there is validity in broadening the scope of the legislation to take account of the position of such workers.  Indeed, two particular cases that involved agency workers with more than the one year's service requirement are the basis for the present amendment to the 1977 Act at section 13 of the Bill. These cases clarified, unfortunately, that <Col N="1098" /> agency workers were outside the scope of the legislation.  The amendment seeks to address this issue.  The reason the user organisation is identified in the Bill as the employer rather than the agency is that the action to dismiss is almost invariably attributable to the user organisation and not the agency.</P>
    <P>Deputies Cullen and Gilmore referred to the broadening of the legislation to include certain unusual contracts.  I note with interest the concern of the Deputy about changes in the patterns of employment arrangements.  Unfair dismissals legislation covers all employees who work at least eight hours a week, subject to the one year service requirement, for an employer, so I am satisfied that part-time workers who are employed, even to quite an inconsiderable extent, come within the scope of the legislation.  Certain employment contracts of a short term duration are for the first time brought within the scope of the Act. There are, of course, distinctions between a &ldquo;contract for services&rdquo; and a &ldquo;contract of service&rdquo;.  The latter kind of contract is the kind of contract covered to date by all employment legislation. If Deputy Gilmore is correct and some &ldquo;contracts for services&rdquo; are, indeed, really &ldquo;contracts of service&rdquo; then the individuals involved would be eligible under labour legislation and an approach to the tribunal in the matter should ensure a finding in favour of the employee in relation to coverage, thus allowing the case to be considered by the tribunal on its merits.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore expressed concern about dismissal on political grounds. Section 6 (b) of the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, provides protection against dismissal on grounds of &ldquo;political opinion&rdquo;.  The issue of dismissal because of an employee's unavailability for work owing to membership of either House of the Oireachtas is quite a separate issue.</P>
    <P>The Deputy's own case could well have been heard at the tribunal.  I understand, however, that the Deputy sought and obtained redress in the courts under common law as an alternative.  What I think most Deputies are seeking in this <Col N="1099" /> regard is redress for dismissal but leave of absence from their employment in the public interest.  Such leave of absence, connected as it is with election to the Oireachtas, may be more appropriate for consideration.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton inquired about the costs of implementation of the proposals before us.  When the Bill was published the Minister presented with it an explanatory and financial memorandum which stated: &ldquo;No significant costs are anticipated in connection with this legislation either in relation to its administration or in relation to compliance with its terms by individual employers and employees.&rdquo; Deputy Bruton and Deputy Callely, in particular, also raised the issue of an employee's entitlement to compensation where a company is insolvent or being wound up.</P>
    <P>The position is that section 11 of the Bill, and formerly section 10 of the Act, allows the Minister for Labour to pursue the enforcement of a case on behalf of an employee.  The volume of cases pursued by the Minister on this basis is high.  The maximum level of available resources in the Department is assigned to this work.  The central issue in relation to the delays complained of by the Deputy are not administrative but arise from the obvious difficulty of legally securing payment from a party who is either unwilling or unable to pay.  Pursuing such unwilling employers is a thankless and tedious job which is undertaken in the Department &mdash; sometimes indeed, without success.  There is no evidence that similar action undertaken by private parties on behalf of the employee would be any more effective in securing a positive result.  Enforcement statistics have been published annually in the annual report of the former Department of Labour.  These statistics show overall a high degree of success.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies referred to the Maternity (Protection of Employees) Act which obliges an employee to inform her employer of her intention to return to work at least four weeks before the date <Col N="1100" /> of resumption.  This is a reasonable requirement on an employee and necessary to the employer in the organisation of his business.  It also has regard to the interests of the employee who may have replaced the employee who is on maternity leave.  She or he is entitled to adequate notice of termination of employment.  In all these circumstances, therefore, the four week period of notice of intention to return is a reasonable requirement to place on the worker on maternity leave.</P>
    <P>I would have some sympathy with the case made by the Deputy, if the four week notice requirement was strictly interpreted by the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  This is not the case.  The case law in this area has proved quite flexible. As a result, cases do not arise in practice where a worker on maternity leave is denied the right to return to work merely because she has failed to comply with the letter of the law in regard to notice.  In general, therefore, the four week requirement works in a manner necessary to ensure the smooth operation of business and to provide leeway to employees whose circumstances are outside the normal run of things.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies questioned the effect on the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977 of the implementation of the EC Pregnant Workers Directive.  Responsibility for the implementation into Irish law of this directive by October 1994 rests with the Minister for Equality and Law Reform. One of the areas of the directive involves an amendment of substance to the Maternity (Protection of Employees) Act, 1981.</P>
    <P>The EC Pregnant Workers Directive raises a series of new and complex issues relating to risk assessment, transfer to other jobs and entitlements to leave and pay which could involve substantial costs to employers or the State.  Consequently, it is essential that these issues are adequately resolved and that the necessary implementing measures are included in comprehensive legislation, which I have no doubt will be introduced by the Minister for Equality and Law Reform by the due date in 1994.  Meanwhile, it <Col N="1101" /> should be remembered that pregnant workers are not precluded from protection under the Act simply by amendments not being taken on board.  It will be possible under the amending legislation which will give effect to the Pregnant Workers Directive to strengthen as necessary the provisions of the Unfair Dismissals Act.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I repeat my conviction that fair practices and procedures in the workplace, particularly in relation to dismissal, are an essential part of any civilised economic system.  Unfair dismissals legislation penalises employers who deal with an employee in an unfair way in relation to dismissal.  It is not intended to impinge at all on an employer who is just and evenhanded when it comes to discharging from employment someone who has been with the employer for a year or more.  This is the balance sought in the legislation and the indications are that it has been achieved.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the legislation as drafted, together with the amendments in the present Bill, will ensure the balance necessary to guarantee that the unfair dismissals legislation continues to make a relevant and effective contribution to the framework of our existing industrial relations and labour protection laws.</P>

    <P>The executive chairman has informed me that Aer Lingus management and consultants are still analysing all elements <Col N="1103" /> of the company's business.  This analysis, when completed, will form the basis of the strategy.  I have impressed upon the executive chairman the need for urgency in preparing the strategy.  However, I have not given him a specific deadline for doing so.  I do not intend, nor would it be appropriate for me, to make available to Members of Dáil Éireann any report in this particular matter which is given to me by the executive chairman in my capacity as Minister.</P>
    <P>A Supplementary Estimate would not be necessary in the event of a decision by the Government to inject additional equity into Aer Lingus.  Where equity is invested in State bodies it is issued from the central fund under legislative authority. In the case of Aer Lingus, the relevant legislative provisions are contained in the Air Companies Acts, 1966 to 1983.</P>

I regret that he will not put whatever report is made by Mr. Cahill before the Members of the House, but I presume he will communicate the main recommendation of any such report.  When Mr. Cahill was appointed executive chairman the House was informed that Government policy on Shannon was sacrosanct and that any rescue plan proposed by Mr. Cahill would have to be in line with this policy. Is this still the position or should we believe newspaper reports that proposals from Mr. Cahill contain recommendations to change the status of Shannon?</P>

      <P>I note the Minister is no longer using the term &ldquo;recovery plan&rdquo; and that he has replaced it with the term &ldquo;strategy&rdquo;.  What is the significance of the change in terminology?  Does it mean that the Government will approve some type of general statement in relation to Aer Lingus which would permit the new management of Aer Lingus to proceed with the dirty work of letting go workers and reducing the size of the company?  At the time of Mr. Cahill's appointment it was intended that this plan or strategy would be produced within a matter of weeks. In view of recent reports that it will be necessary to have it produced in advance of the submission of the national plan to the European Commission, will the Minister indicate from his discussions with Mr. Cahill if any date has been set for the completion and submission of the plan to him?</P>

We are seeking to achieve a position whereby Aer Lingus is a commercially viable company, consistent with the maximum possible levels of employment to sustain that commercial viability.  Everybody understands that the difficulties in relation to this company must be considered seriously and fundamentally.  We must bring forward proposals for a strategy for the survival of this company.  It is not true that the recovery strategy for Aer Lingus to ensure its survival must be produced in tandem with or before a national plan is submitted to Brussels.  The European dimension in this regard relates to the competition directorate and the transport directorate in relation to State aid.  That matter is separate from issues relating to support for transport infrastructure which may form part of the national development plan when final decisions are taken.</P>
      <P>In relation to the question of terminology, it is important that the forthcoming strategy, subject to approval by the board and which would then come to me as Minister be a decision by Government, must set a definite direction for this company to ensure its commercial future.  There must then be detailed proposals internally within management and staff to achieve the objective of such a strategy.  That is the only way in which we can proceed to ensure the survival of this company.  There are very difficult issues that must be faced in the interests of its long term future.</P>

The Government, as a shareholder, will support the <Col N="1106" /> company in the interests of my wider responsibilities to the general taxpayer to ensure that such investment will have a return and will ensure the company's commercial viability.

In view of the fact that we are discussing the survival of this company we must await the strategy that will ensure its survival and in that context everything will be considered.

      <P>The Moriarty task force on the implementation of the Culliton report recommended that unless there is a credible proposal to commercialise the refinery so that the mandatory off-take of petrol products from Whitegate can be ended by 31 December 1996 at the latest, the mandatory regime should be ended immediately.  The task force further required that the appropriate decisions in this connection be taken by June 1993. These recommendations have been accepted by the Government.

      <P>INPC is at present developing a plan to achieve commercialisation of operations at Whitegate.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Work is already underway under the supervision of the Department of Finance on the preparation of a national development plan which will set out the <Col N="1114" /> Government's priorities for the use of EC funds available to Ireland from the next tranche of the Structural Funds and from the Cohesion Fund.</P>
    <P>As part of this process the Government will be seeking EC funding for an integrated package of transport measures, including improvements in strategic rail links.  In this regard a major study of the existing mainline rail network has been undertaken by my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Finance and CIE and with the assistance of independent consultants.  The outcome of this work in under consideration at present. Decisions on the allocation of EC funds to the mainline railway network will be dependent on the Government's assessment of overall national priorities and on the outcome of detailed negotiations with the EC authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the Dublin-Westport line should receive priority in view of the fact that, as confirmed by Iarnród Éireann, the line is 50 years old &mdash; the line to Ballina is 100 years old &mdash; the signalling system which was installed at the turn of the century is manually operated and the locomotives which are more than 30 years old are in need of urgent replacement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that there has been under-investment in our rail network due to constraints on national finances and the prioritising of other matters which were deemed to be of greater importance. The availability of Structural Funds provides a unique opportunity to redress the imbalance.  My Department, in terms of its application to the Government and the Department of Finance, which coordinates the national development plan proposals, regards investment in railways as necessary.  The Department is anxious to facilitate investment in signalling and in rail lines so as to maintain a national network.  It is important that those issues are to the fore in allocating Structural Funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's comments in relation to giving <Col N="1115" /> priority to the rail network.  Would the Minister not agree that if the rail system is to remain competitive a number of basic prerequisites must be set down as a matter of priority?  For example, obsolete tracks should be replaced by welded tracks and timber sleepers replaced by concrete sleepers.  In terms of cutting travel time, new locomotives should be introduced on a phased basis, thereby improving the level of service on a line such as the Westport line which is used by a large number of passengers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Including myself.  I agree that locomotives are an important aspect of this matter.  Iarnród Éireann will undertake a programme to start purchasing locomotives next year and this will considerably improve the position. The level of investment in lines and signalling will depend, first, on what is agreed in terms of the national development plan and, second, on Commission approval.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I correct in thinking that, depending on the priority of rail in the overall national plan and the success of the subsequent discussions in Brussels, unless sufficient EC resources are made available for the rail network we may be looking at a possible closure of the rail network or of significant parts of it?  In the assessment of the rail network now being undertaken, it is envisaged that any disused rail links will be re-opened or will the assessment be confined to those rail lines which are currently in regular use?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to provincial mainline rail the priority will be to ensure that we maintain that national network. I do not anticipate the closure of any of the mainline network.  Structural Funds are important in order to maintain that national network and bring it to the standards one would expect.  Given the level of under investment we had in the past in our existing rail network it is very difficult to envisage how we can open <Col N="1116" /> new lines when we have to put a priority on maintaining what we have.  I am not excluding the possibility, but any cursory assessment would suggest that we need to invest in what we have before we start talking about opening up new lines.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the comments made by the EC Commissioner for Competition, Mr. Karel Van Miert, in which he indicated his intention of initiating legal action against a number of countries, including Ireland, for what he alleged were abuses of national monopolies concerning imports of gas and electricity; his response to Mr. Van Miert's statement; the steps, if any, he intends to take to protect the position of public companies such as the ESB and Bord Gáis, especially in the light of our peripheral position; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will appreciate that as Ireland's electricity network is not connected to any other country this is very much an academic issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Competition Directorate of the EC Commission initiated formal proceedings against Ireland some time ago under Article 169 of the Treaty for alleged infringements of Community law by retaining exclusive rights in relation to the import and export of electricity. As part of this procedure the Commission forwarded a reasoned opinion to the Irish authorities in November 1992.  A detailed reply addressing the matters raised by the Commission was issued earlier this year. It is now a matter for the Commission to decide whether to refer the matter to the Court of Justice.  While I am aware of Commissioner Van Miert's recent comments, I have had no formal indication of the Commission's position.  I take the view and have indicated to the Commission that moves to change the existing structure of the industry should be taken within a clearly defined policy framework. This view has been supported by the EC Energy Council which indicated that while supporting progress towards completion of the internal energy market, full consideration should be given to the circumstances in member states and to the need to ensure security <Col N="1118" /> of supply and to protect the interests of small customers.</P>
    <P>A review of the electricity industry was carried out by my Department and the ESB to examine how the industry might best be structured in the future to provide the most efficient and economic service for customers.  Arising from the review, proposals for the restructuring of the electricity industry were recently approved by Government.  The restructuring is intended to bring the electricity industry in Ireland into line with requirements for a more open energy market.  It will introduce greater cost transparency and facilitate competition.  The Commission will be fully informed of the proposed changes in the electricity industry.</P>
    <P>No communication has been received from the EC Commission in regard to natural gas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am puzzled as to how the Minister can say that this is an academic issue since the ESB, apparently in response to Commissioner Van Miert's legal initiatives, is proceeding with subdivision on the approval of the Government. The ESB also has an application for a price increase before the Minister about which I will be asking later.  We recently had the very direct statement from Commissioner Van Miert of his intention to proceed with legal action.  Is the Minister taking seriously this statement made by Commissioner Van Miert? Is the Minister satisfied that there are no grounds for such legal action against this country, particularly in relation to electricity supply?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason it is an academic issue is that we have a stand alone electricity grid and a stand alone gas grid, pending completion of the gas pipeline.  The Commission alleges that under existing legislation the ESB has exclusive import and export rights in respect of electricity and that this is incompatible with Articles 30, 34 and 37 of the EC Treaty.  We have not accepted that Ireland is in breach of its obligations under the Treaty.  The point was made to the Commission that changes to the <Col N="1119" /> structure of the Irish electricity industry were under consideration.  Decisions have now been made on the restructuring appropriate to the energy market here.</P>
      <P>The changes proposed are designed to allow for a more open energy market while retaining the benefits associated with a single electricity company.  Work is now beginning to determine the detailed legislative changes needed to implement the organisational changes which the Government has recently approved.  The proposed changes in legislation will introduce a more open market structure.  The electricity industry will also be subject to independent public regulation.  All of these requirements are in line with the EC Commission requirement for the completion of the internal energy market.  The option of amending those parts of the existing law which refer to imports and exports will be considered as part of this process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that the recently announced changes in the ESB are as a direct response to EC requirements? Is the Minister in any way concerned about the impact of EC liberalisation of competition generally on Irish consumers, who have recently had to endure an increase in telephone charges and who may now be faced with an increase in the cost of electricity and possibly gas in order to comply with the various EC requirements, and about this bludgeoning of the Irish consumer by Commissioner Van Miert who is threatening to take this country to the European Court over alleged non-compliance with the various competition rules?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be incorrect to suggest that the price increase application was made on the basis of trends within the European Community.  Presumably, the application was made on the basis of securing and ensuring the financial stability of the company and meeting its capital requirements for energy generation in the future.  That is the reason we have an application for a price increase, which has nothing to do with <Col N="1120" /> the European Community.  I stated in my original reply that moves to change the existing structure of the industry should be taken within a clearly defined policy framework.  We have already put down some markers on that, now that the EC Council of Energy Ministers is approaching the question of the liberalisation of the internal energy market.  Therefore, I do not accept that the Government is not ensuring that our interests are represented at EC level so that we obtain the best possible deal.</P>
      <P>The restructuring was to meet the trend emerging in Europe but it is also very much in the interests of the company. I am glad to note, as a result of work undertaken within the ESB, that it has the approval of staff.  Indeed, it will be on the basis of consultation with staff that such reorganisation will be effected. A task force has been established, with one of the officials of my Department participating, to help to implement the necessary changes which the chairman, board, management and staff agree is in the best interests of the company; even from its own selfish point of view, it should be more competitive and seen to be more cost-transparent throughout its business operations.</P>

Will he confirm that, at the same Cabinet meeting, he made his colleagues aware of the ESB's requirements for capital, particularly on the transmission side?  Will he also confirm that the Cabinet agreed that these were a matter of priority, and that this investment capital would be contingent on an annual increase of approximately 3 per cent in ESB charges each year over the next five years?</P>

That type of assessment is necessary within the context of any application.  There should be no presumption that increases should be effected on the basis of funding future capital projects, which would require Government approval in the first instance.</P>

I asked him about capital costs on the transmission side, in respect of which the ESB put a clear programme to Government, which the Government agreed and which will require increases of up to 3 per cent each year over the next five years to deliver.  Will the Minister confirm this and not pretend to the House that there will be long consideration of the merits of the application when it has already been agreed in principle?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The conditions under which radioactive material is stored at Lyons Estate, Rathcoole, County Dublin do not create a radiological or health hazard.  It is low-level waste produced from medical and veterinary procedures carried out at the various laboratories on the UCD campus and the Veterinary College, Ballsbridge.  The majority of the waste is in solid form consisting of phials, test tubes, pipette tips and paper tissues stored in strong plastic bags and labelled in accordance with international standards. There is also some low-level liquid waste stored in 25-litre drums.  The radioactive waste is stored in a secure outhouse which is remote from occupied areas. The store is permanently locked and a warning sign is attached to the door.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to give an exact figure for the total activity in the store at any time but it is estimated to be less than 300 megabecquerels.  The waste is disposed of when the level of activity has decayed over time to that specified in the licence permitting its disposal as ordinary domestic waste.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister consider this is a suitable place in which to store radioactive waste?  Could it not be stored in an approved dump; in particular, could it not be stored underground? Does the Minister really consider it sensible to talk about its being stored until its radioactivity has been reduced to an acceptable level, considering that it takes anything between one and 300 years for it to lose a half life, as they call it?  How does he expect that any of us will be around to see the happy day when it will have reached an acceptable <Col N="1124" /> level at which it can be dumped as ordinary waste?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>There are different levels of radioactive waste.  This is low level radioactive waste and, therefore, can be disposed of, presumably, within our lifetime. Inspection of storage of radioactive substances is carried out by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland.  In the case of sealed sources there are at present some 3,200 gigabecquerels of radioactive waste in storage.  These sources were imported before the introduction of regulatory controls which stipulate that they be returned to the supplier at the end of their useful life.  In the case of stored, unsealed sources, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland monitors the decay of the radioactive content until it has reached levels at which its disposal as ordinary domestic waste is permitted.  Storage is generally for a period of five to ten years.  I am satisfied that the licensing arrangements ensure that all sources of radioactivity are at present stored in a manner which does not pose a hazard to people or property.</P>

      <P>MMDS licences are issued subject to the terms of the Wireless Telegraphy (Television Programme Retransmission) Regulations, 1989 (S.I. No. 39 of 1989).  The Regulations have been lodged in the Dáil Library, reference PL 6311, and may be inspected by the Deputy in the Library at any time. The form of the licence is specified in <Col N="1127" /> the schedule to those regulations.  Each licensee is obliged to comply with technical conditions established by my Department in Specification No. R82 of April 1988 entitled, &ldquo;Technical Conditions relating to the establishment of a Programme Retransmission System (Microwave Multipoint Distribution System) (MMDS) in the band 2500 to 2686 MHz&rdquo;.

The licence granted to Cork Communications Limited was in accord with the regulations which are available for inspection in the Library.  If <Col N="1128" /> the Deputy has any queries I would be prepared to answer a separate question. In relation to MMDS, I suggest that consumers are satisfied with the service although it is more expensive than the deflector systems which are providing a signal illegally.  In the same way as we cannot have public houses without intoxicating liquor licences we cannot have illegal deflector systems.  I will seek to expand MMDS and eliminate the deflector systems.</P>

      <P>Is it not the case that the application for a price increase has been with the Minister's Department for over 12 months?

      <P>The Department has been discussing a framework with the ESB for deciding on price increases.  The objective is to strike a balance between the financial stability of the company and the need to minimise increases to consumers. There has been a long period of price stability, which the Deputy might acknowledge, given his stated commitment to semi-State companies.  This has been an achievement for the ESB.  If the Deputy is suggesting that this can continue <i>ad infinitum</i> without taking account of the capital requirements and the reorganisation that will take place in the company he is being over-optimistic. I am not prepared to examine this matter in isolation from the wider issues of the electricity market in Ireland and the need to ensure that we get the best possible deal for the consumer in all the circumstances.</P>

      <P>In reply to an earlier supplementary question I said that my Department is in consultation with the ESB to come up with a framework for deciding on price increases generally rather than taking an <i>ad hoc</i> approach, which involves delay and a lengthy consideration of the issues.  We need a framework between the ESB and the Department for dealing with these issues in the future.  Since no decision has been taken and presumably there will be a modification of the original proposal, it is premature to decide on the level of increase over the next year, not to mention the next five years.</P>

The functions of the Telecom Éireann users' council, to which the Deputy referred, have effectively been taken over by the Ombudsman, under the Ombudsman (Amendment) Act, 1984. Sections 48 and 49 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, which gave statutory effect to the users' council, were repealed by section 3 of the Restrictive Practices (Amendment) Act, 1987.</P>
      <P>In relation to the voluntary groups, I have already outlined that £500,000 will be available from Telecom's resources to meet the demands of the Rape Crisis Centre, Childline and the Samaritans.

They are greatly modified as a result of long and detailed discussions between officials of my Department &mdash; in whom I have <Col N="1135" /> every confidence &mdash; and Telecom Éireann.  No outside independent group examined the application because I was satisfied that the officials of my Department gleaned the necessary information to allow me to have discussions with Telecom to ensure that we could agree a modified tariff which would be fair and balanced for all concerned and met the objectives of the rebalancing exercise. The advisory group will monitor the new tariff regime, report to me and will have full co-operation from Telecom Éireann. I will take on board the reports as they come to me and refer back to Telecom Éireann at that stage.</P>

      <P>In relation to the part of the Minister's reply concerning the £500,000 for the helpline services, has he had discussions with the various helpline agencies?  If not, does he intend to meet them?  Is he aware that the various helpline agencies are extremely concerned that they will be saddled with a freefone service &mdash; the cost of which would not be met from the £500,000 which is to be provided &mdash; and that they will end up with huge telephone bills at the end of the year which they may not be able to meet?</P>

They are the experts in the operation of these matters.  I recall that some voluntary agencies welcomed the proposals on terms of the reduction of free charges and the trunk rate charge.  Telecom Éireann is setting up a committee who will sit down with those groups to discuss the problems, if any, and go on from there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 14 and 74 together.</P>
      <P>The Government is fully committed to the EC objective of stabilisation of CO2 emissions in the Community as a whole at 1990 levels by the year 2000.  In so far as member states such as Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Greece are concerned, there is provision in the EC proposals for differential treatment, in accordance with the concept of equitable burden sharing, having regard to the economic and social development of those countries.</P>
      <P>A national carbon dioxide abatement strategy plan has been approved by the Government and it will be published in the near future.</P>
      <P>The plan will specify a wide range of measures to be taken to reduce CO2 emissions in all sectors of Irish energy consumption. These measures do not include energy taxes or non-fossil fuel obligation but as the Deputy is aware discussions, in which Ireland is participating, are proceeding within the EC on a possible energy/carbon tax.</P>
      <P>Since June 1991 the ESB at the specific request of my Department has been offering an increased price for non-fuel renewable energy supplied to the grid by private producers.  While the main beneficiaries are private hydro electricity producers it was also intended by my Department that it would be an incentive for the development of new wind and solar projects.  In June 1992 the ESB offered an increased unit price to combined heat and power producers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>My question asked if the Minister would give details of the commitment to reduce Ireland's carbon dioxide emissions.  As the Minister has not answered that question will he give details of the widespread commitment into which Ireland has entered?  He talked about an equitable burden.  Did he take into account that the effects of climatic change and global warming range over the whole earth, not simply over the EC?  Will he agree that an equitable burden is something we must consider in a global context, and that Ireland has an extremely high output of CO2? Will he agree that in the questions on the ESB today there was no reference to energy conservation?  Perhaps &ldquo;Electricity Supply Board&rdquo; is a misnomer.  Will he agree that rather than dwelling on renewable energy as a cure-all conservation is far more economical? Finally, will he agree that the effects of climatic changes are more costly than any preventative measures he may consider given coastal erosion, damage to agriculture and flooding, as indicated by the pictures in the newspapers today?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that conservation is an important aspect and should be an important component of our energy policy.  Demand site management is important in terms of the ESB reducing its capital requirements in future if we can get better use of the existing electricity grid.  The carbon tax issue is one for the Minister for Finance and can be taken up with him on another occasion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister tell us at least one step the Government can take that would be an indication of its sincerity? I suggest that a start might be made by reducing the cubic capacity of State cars, it they are necessary at all, and thus show the public that the Government is sincere about taking action on issues that contribute to global warming.</P>

      <P>I am here to answer questions about energy taxes, non-fossil fuel obligations and different pricing structures. If the Deputy wants Ireland's position on CO2 and energy tax, I can give him that.  So far in negotiations Ireland has had an open-minded position on the proposal.  Pressure is now being exerted by the pro-tax member states to agree the tax in principle.  This pressure failed to get consensus at a joint Energy-Environment Council last April but it is being remitted in the context of the next ECOFIN Council on 7 June.  For economic and social reasons it would be important for us that the carbon energy tax should not apply to peat, including peat for electricity generation.  The Commission on Presidency Efforts is seeking to get the four cohesion countries to agree to endorse the principle of the tax by allowing special considerations to apply.  The principle of the tax, and the negotiating mandate for the Minister for Finance and ECOFIN to cover our special concerns is scheduled for consideration by the Government shortly. Until the Government decides on this issue it would be premature to discuss our position further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I have raised this matter with four successive Ministers for Education and have not received a satisfactory response.  On 19 January 1991 the <Col N="1176" /> Sisters of Mercy announced their intention to withdraw from Mount Trenchard, Foynes in June 1991.  They were not prepared to accept first year pupils from September of this year.  On 16 February 1991 a public meeting was held and the parents, teachers and public representatives attended.  A committee was formed and it has met on numerous occasions.  It is now more than two years since that meeting and, despite representations to four different Ministers for Education, including the present Minister, a cloud of uncertainty still hangs over this matter.</P>
      <P>I am appalled that in a constituency which at one stage had a Minister, Deputy Collins, and a Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, urging its retention we have failed to get a commitment to retain the school.</P>
      <P>On 4 December 1992 the action committee, with Deputy Collins, met Deputy Séamus Brennan, the Minister at the time.  They presented the case that the vocational school in Shanagolden and the Stella Maris secondary school in Foynes should amalgamate and should be administered by the vocational education committee. The Minister, Deputy Brennan, gave a commitment that the school could be purchased and that all the details would be sorted out.  The committee returned home delighted.  Indeed, in a recent edition of <i>The Limerick Leader</i> a member of the committee, who happens to be the Fianna Fáil Director of the organisation in west Limerick castigated the Minister, Deputy Brennan, for reneging on his commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is intense fury in the area over the indecision of the Department.  The parents who are sending their children to secondary school for the first time have to seriously consider their options now that there is such a vacuum as a result of the Minister's indecision.  The secondary school covers the Shanagolden, Kilcolman, Ballyhahill, Loughgill and Foynes areas.  There are more than 80 pupils in their final year of primary school in those areas.  In the other schools in this area, such as Tarbert comprehensive and Newcastle West secondary schools there <Col N="1177" /> is considerable overcrowding.  The Minister is also aware of the overcrowding in Limerick city area which has been highlighted in recent times with more than 160 pupils who cannot gain admission to a school.  In an area such a Foynes, which has been targeted for industrial expansion, it would be a retrograde step to allow this fine establishment to close.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister at this eleventh hour to make a decision.  The time for decision-making has arrived.  The cloud of uncertainty should be lifted.  Surely the Minister can make a decision.  I trust the Minister will inform me that the school will remain open.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to apologise on behalf of the Minister for Education and the Minister of State at that Department for their absence and thank the Deputy for raising the matter. It may be that because four different Ministers have attended on each occasion the Deputy raised this matter that the present Minister would not take the chance of coming here and sent me instead.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Mercy Order in the diocese of Limerick announced, in 1991, its intention of withdrawing from the management of its post-primary school at Mount Trenchard, Foynes, in 1995.  As the Stella Maris school is a voluntary secondary school, this decision was a matter solely for the Mercy Order.  The Stella Maris school at Mount Trenchard, Foynes, is located in the west Limerick catchment area which is unique in that it has four post-primary schools located in four different centres.  The three other schools are Scoil Mhuire secondary school, Askeaton, the Salesian College, Pallaskenry and the vocational school Shanagolden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For many years the Department of Education has considered that some measure of rationalisation at post-primary level should be implemented in this catchment area and since the late 1960s the matter had been discussed periodically with the four managements <Col N="1178" /> involved in post-primary education in the catchment area.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that a school action committee was formed in Foynes with the aim of keeping the Stella Maris school in operation after June 1995 under a new management, County Limerick Vocational Education Committee.</P>
    <P>The Department carefully considered a submission made by the action committee and the question of whether the school could be continued in operation beyond 1995 had been under consideration. One option, that of leasing the school property from the Mercy Order, has been explored but found to be unacceptable to the sisters.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education and Department officials, met a deputation representing the action committee, on 1 April last.</P>
    <P>The Minister listened carefully to the points put forward by the deputation in support of their case.  However, she informed the deputation that the technical advice available to her suggested that the development costs in question were likely to entail a large financial liability which would be difficult to justify.</P>
    <P>As the deputation disputed the scale and scope of the development costs involved, it was agreed that a meeting would be held between the Department's professional staff and the architect advising the action committee.  At this meeting, which took place on 20 April, there was an exchange of information on likely development costs, with the Department's professional staff providing details of how its costings had been arrived at.</P>
    <P>The meeting concluded on the basis that the architect advising the action committee would report back to the committee and would contact the Department again when more details in relation to mechanical and electrical costs, structural requirements and dry rot possibilities had been clarified.  This response is awaited.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The announcement on Monday last, 24 May 1993, of the closure <Col N="1180" /> of Wexmann Trousers involving 109 redundancies sent shock waves through Wexford town.  The company was originally established in 1966 and was the first of many German companies to locate in Wexford.  Wexmann was a great ambassador in attracting other foreign industries to the area.  Only two years ago the company underlined its commitment to Wexford and its ability to ride out the recession by extending its plant by 50 per cent and by investing £250,000 in new modern machinery.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, competition particularly on the cut, make and trim price for contract trousers from the Baltic states, Poland and Tunisia, together with the inept handling by the last Government of the currency crisis, interest rates and a subsequent devaluation has not allowed that to happen.  The final straw was the 5 per cent increase in VAT on the manufacturing industry in this year's budget and that put the nail in the coffin of an excellent product in Wexford town.</P>
      <P>The CMT price at Wexmann was 16.3 pence per minute in terms of the production cost.  In Tunisia and the Baltic states the CMT price is as low as 5 pence per minute.  Competition was extremely difficult, particularly with the collapse of the Berlin Wall.</P>
      <P>This company, established in 1966, did not have one day's stoppage for industrial action.  Can we say the same of many other companies?  Excellent management and co-operation with the workforce ensured a quality product and a highly skilled workforce during those years.  I would ask the Minister to put on the record of the House what he intends to do to ensure that we salvage the jobs of the 109 people involved, preferably by having it taken over as a going concern or, perhaps, a fall back position of an alternative manufacturing industry, if not a trouser industry.  We would even consider the possibility and the economics of a management buy-out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to hear from the Minister that the Government cares about the dilemma of the unemployment crisis in Wexford town.  I would like to see some evidence of outrage about the unemployment <Col N="1181" /> level there.  In Wexford town and district there are 3,465 people unemployed, 25 per cent of the workforce. That is well above the national average which is bad enough.  The real tragedy is that there is no outrage about this problem.  People in Wexford believed for years that when they got a Cabinet Minister their problems would be solved.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for coming into the House to reply to this debate.  I ask him, and his colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, to ensure that no stone is left unturned to resolve the dilemma of the 109 workers faced with redundancy on 16 July at Wexmann Trousers Limited.  Above all, everybody living in Wexford, those on the dole queues and the workforce, want some evidence that the Government actually cares about the unemployment crisis and the scarcity of jobs for people in Wexford town and district.  There has been no evidence of that to date.</P>
    <P>When the Labour Party was in Opposition there was much talk about such difficulties, but from the minute that party got into bed with Fianna Fáil and got the big cars there has been no word of concern for those on the growing dole queues.  Wexford can take it no longer. The shock of the loss of a quality industry such as Wexmann has been the final straw.  The Minister should give details of how the IDA, through pressure from him, will find an alternative enterprise, preferably a going concern for Wexmann Trousers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the House that I share the Deputy's concern about the proposed closure of Wexmann Trousers Limited and the serious consequences this would have for the company's workforce and the economic life of the area.  This House will of course realise that in all such cases, a closure decision is essentially at the discretion of the owners and management of the enterprise involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Wexmann Trousers Limited was established in Wexford 20 years ago as a joint venture between three German slacks <Col N="1182" /> manufactures.  To produce men's tailored slacks for these companies on a cut, make and trim basis.  Wexmann subsequently succeeded in developing its own brand of slacks for sale on the UK market, which reduced the company's reliance on CMT and enabled it to trade profitably for a number of years.</P>
    <P>Since 1990, however, Wexmann has suffered badly due to the deepening recession in the UK market, where its sales volumes have fallen by around 25 per cent.  It is unfortunate that, around this time, Wexmann completed an extension to its manufacturing facility, in the belief that the UK market would continue to grow and would absorb the additional capacity.  This failed to materialise, however, and it illustrates the difficulties companies encounter in attempting to forecast developments in international markets in the current volatile economic climate.</P>
    <P>I understand that Wexmann's market has been eroded by competition from other European slacks companies who are sourcing their products at significantly lower costs in Eastern Europe and North Africa and Deputy Doyle has given the comparative figures in that regard.  It is against this background then, that Wexmann has continued to operate over the past few years and there is little doubt that the availability of lower cost clothing products in Central and Eastern Europe has had a major effect on Community producers.</P>
    <P>The decision to close has, I understand, been forced on the company because the UK market alone can no longer support the volume of sales necessary for Wexmann to break even, and because the company's CMT production would not on its own be cost competitive.</P>
    <P>I understand that Wexmann Trousers Limited does not propose to cease production until the end of July 1993.  The IDA has done everything possible to avert the closure.  At the behest of the Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, I have been in contact with the company in conjunction with the IDA.  We have been assured that the IDA is making an all out effort to secure a takeover <Col N="1183" /> company for the Wexmann operation.  In this regard the IDA offices at home and abroad have the company's profile to hand and are targeting suitable companies who may be interested in acquiring the plant.  Despite the problems facing the clothing industry I remain hopeful that the IDA will be successful in its efforts in this case given the strength of the Wexmann brand name and the recent upturn in the financial climate.</P>
    <P>The overall importance of the clothing and textiles sectors to the economy is evidenced by the fact that about 23,000 people are employed in them, this equates with approximately one in every eight manufacturing jobs in Ireland.  Approximately 15,000 of these are engaged in the clothing sector.  This figure does not take account of the numerous service and retail jobs throughout the country which are dependent on these sectors.  Around 65 per cent of the clothing industry's production is exported, mainly to the European Community and this underlines the importance for Ireland of the export market.</P>
    <P>The European Community represents a market of some 350 million consumers, and the future development of Ireland's clothing industry must actively exploit this market.  It is important therefore, for the industry to gear itself to the changing needs of its export markets.  It must also structure itself to meet the enormous challenge arising from increasing competition from low cost products being imported into Ireland and the Community as a whole, from developing Third World countries and, indeed from Eastern Europe.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance has given detailed consideration to the various representations by the industry in regard to this matter.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The House is aware that the Minister for Finance also announced that an urgent review is being carried out in consultation with the Minister for Social Welfare, of the impact that the Employers' PRSI system has on low paid clothing manufacturing firms.  This <Col N="1185" /> initiative recognises the labour intensive nature of the clothing industry.</P>
    <P>The IDA is talking to the existing management of Wexmann with a view to facilitating what Deputy Doyle referred to, an assisted buy-out.

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Intervention Weight Limits.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to have the opportunity to raise this matter since the Government refused to make time available earlier today.  We would have had the best part of an hour or more to discuss these issues if the Government had taken a more reasonable view earlier.  The Council of Ministers in Brussels last night decided that from 1 July next no beef carcase weighing over 380 kilos will qualify for intervention and that with effect from 1 July next that limit will be reduced to 340 kilos.  That decision will be disastrous for Irish cattle producers and meat processors and the people who <Col N="1186" /> work in our meat factories.  It is a humiliating defeat for the Minister for Agriculture and a further demonstration of his utter ineptitude as a negotiator.  In the past the Minister repeatedly assured farm organisations and the meat processors that such limits would never be applied.  When he lost that argument in Brussels he tried to pretend that the effect would not be so bad, that he would secure a higher limit and would never allow the weight limit to be reduced to 340 kilos.  We know the Minister's tactics. He is using them again today.  He is a nice fellow, he smiles a lot and tells us not to worry, that it will be sorted out on the day.  We have seen that as a direct result of the decision.  The Minister assured us that the limit would never be reduced to 340 kilos but he has again failed; from 1 July next no carcase weighing over 340 kilos will be put into intervention, something the Minister told us would never happen.</P>
      <P>The Minister now tells us he believes that the decision by the Council of Ministers may be illegal and that he will take it to the European Court of Justice.  I wish the Minister well but he should realise that he will lose either way.  If on the one hand the court finds that the Council decision is illegal the Minister stands condemned for having failed to convince his colleagues.  If, on the other the court upholds the Council decision the Minister will end up with a double dose of egg on his face.  Either way he stands condemned for ineptitude as a negotiator.  This decision will create grave difficulties for producers and meat processors this year and more serious problems after July next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should not try to tell me he is encouraged by the fact that the Irish meat processors did not make any bid for a recent tender for intervention.  That came about as a result of a combination of circumstances for which the Minister cannot claim credit and which would have been in place with or without the 380 kilo weight limit.  To take the matter to court which the Minister has talked about doing &mdash; I do not know if he has decided this yet &mdash; will not give consolation to <Col N="1187" /> farmers, the meat processing industry or workers in that industry in the immediate future.  It is impossible to guess how long such court proceedings will take and, in the meantime, the pain will be acute.  The Minister may have snookered himself by making this threat.  If he now found some other way round the problems of farmers and meat processors there is little chance that he will get a hearing from the Commission or the Council if he has already threatened to take the matter to court.</P>
    <P>We should now set about finding alternative ways of reducing pressure on the intervention system, there are plenty of them, and the Minister's advisers will tell him this.  We should aim to have a comprehensive, well articulated approach by the end of this year so that we can return to the charge well before the second phase of this disastrous decision comes into effect in July of next year.</P>
    <P>It seems that the Minister has so completely sold the pass at this stage that the whole situation may well be irretrievable. He has shown such ineptitude I have serious doubts that even with the best brief in the world he will make much progress on this issue.  We owe it to our farmers, to our workers in the meat processing industry and to the industry itself at least to try.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Commission first put forward their proposal in December 1992 to impose a weight limit on carcase beef entering intervention, my Department and I have opposed the proposal in every available Community forum at both ministerial and official level.  The weight limit has been contested strongly by Ireland at the beef management committee, the special agricultural committee and the Council of Ministers.  Most recently at the Council meeting which ended early this morning, I made a strong case against the weight limitation.  I have also raised it at a number of bilateral meetings with Commissioner Steichen and the Council President, Mr. Westh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1188" /> This opposition by Ireland has had significant effect.  It is easy to forget now that the first Commission proposal was for a 325 kgs limit with effect from 1 January 1993.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>We will be hanged slowly instead of quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The present proposal is that the weight limit regime will be phased in over a period with the first phase &mdash; a limit of 380 kgs &mdash; starting on 1 July 1993, the second phase &mdash; a limit of 360 kgs &mdash; starting on 1 January 1994 and the third phase &mdash; a limit of 340 kgs &mdash; starting on 1 July 1994.  In addition, the Commission decided to prepare an internal report on the market situation and on intervention operations before the commencement of the second phase.</P>
      <P>At the Council meeting which ended earlier today I sought agreement to have the Commission submit a report in the autumn to the Council &mdash; rather than consider it themselves &mdash; on the market situation for beef and on the intervention system.  I also proposed that in the meantime we suspend the weight limit of 380 kgs due to come into effect on 1 July next.</P>
      <P>I obtained agreement that the Commission would submit the report to the Council before 1 November next. However, apart from France there was no real support for the suspension of the first phase limit of 380 kgs pending consideration by the Council of the report.  Indeed, there was strong hostility from a number of member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a consequence, I am now proposing to the Government that we challenge in the European Court of Justice the Commission's regulation imposing the weight limits and of seeking an injunction against the introduction of the first phase on 1 July next, pending a hearing of the substantive issue in the court.  I had already commenced the process of legal preparation for such a court challenge before the outcome of today's Council meeting and consequently I will be in a position to put a proposal to the Government on this issue next week.  I understand <Col N="1189" /> that France is also likely to bring this issue to the court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Liz O'Donnell if she should come into the House.</P>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to raise this matter of the referral service for homeless children in the Eastern Health Board region.  It is not a new problem but it has reached a new intensity with the industrial dispute that is currently taking place.  The failure of the health board to provide proper accommodation for homeless children and young people has been evident for quite some time.</P>
      <P>Under the new Health Care Act the health board has a clear obligation in section 5 to provide for children who are homeless and to take the necessary steps to provide accommodation if there is clearly no alternative.  The health board has not done so in the past and there has been an appalling <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement where staff have been trying to fill the gaps.  They have clearly been finding it difficult for quite some time.  The result has been that totally inappropriate accommodation has been provided on occasions for young people and children. For example, the health board has provided bed and breakfast accommodation with no backup and no provision for adequate care for these children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently, in a blaze of publicity, the Minister for Health stated that he would not introduce the Health Care Act regulations unless he had the resources to do so.  The Kilkenny incest case put additional pressure on the Minister and gave much media attention to the problem. However, in relation to regulations and the sections of the Act already in place, there is a clear lack of resources. It would be the ultimate in hypocrisy to give this undertaking in relation to protecting young children from abuse if at the same time accommodation is not provided for young people and children who may be, on occasions, escaping <Col N="1190" /> abuse in their homes and seeking shelter from the State.</P>
    <P>The recent housing assessment indicates that there is a high level of homelessness and need for new housing.  It is not clear from the Estimates what the need is among young people but there is general acceptance that within the Eastern Health Board region there is a well established need to provide for the specific conditions that exist relating to homeless children.  The evidence is there.</P>
    <P>For a long time in my own area of Wicklow, and I am sure in Kildare also, there has been no provision for young homeless people.  In the Dublin region, staff have been providing after hours oncall cover on a voluntary basis.  This is totally untenable.  The fact that IMPACT, the union representing them, is now taking action is simply an expression of the total frustration experienced by those operating the service who are simply unable to continue to do so.</P>
    <P>Unless this problem is tackled swiftly and resources allocated to providing both staff and accommodation we will continue to have children, like the 13 year old boy who was turned away last Tuesday night, being refused care from the Eastern Health Board.  The irony is that on the same night the Minister, Deputy Howlin, announced the new £35 million package to implement further provisions of the Health Care Act.  The reality is that the Minister has an obligation to fund equally the regulations already in place to ensure that all our young people and children at risk are catered for.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Dea) Willie O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board out of hours service for homeless juveniles was established in March 1992 on terms agreed between the Eastern Health Board, the IMPACT union, and social work staff on a local basis after full consultation.</P>
      <P>The front line after hour service is provided by three social workers specifically recruited for the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, agreement was reached with IMPACT and staff for the provision of an arm's length supervisory role by a <Col N="1191" /> senior-head social worker, through his or her availability for advice and consultation via a mobile telephone at night. Under these arrangements, the supervisor is paid an allowance of £50 per week and is provided with a mobile telephone unit for use at home.  The Eastern Health Board considers that this rate of allowance is appropriate, given the extent of supervision required.  There is a pool of five persons, amongst whom the supervisory arrangement rotates.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that not every client contact made with field workers would result in a call being made for advice and consultation to the supervisor on duty.  It is understood that, on average, there would be only two or three such calls made each week to the supervisor on duty.  Matters arising from those calls may be expedited through further telephone calls made by the supervisor and-or by action by the field worker, acting on advice or instructions received.</P>
    <P>At the establishment of these arrangements, it was agreed by all parties that the senior-head social workers providing this night time supervisory &ldquo;back-up&rdquo; would be paid £50 per week to operate the mobile telephone and to provde advice and consultation by phone if contacted after hours by the social worker on duty in the field.</P>
    <P>IMPACT now seek to have this agreed £50 figure substantially increased. IMPACT have specifically referred to the paramedical &ldquo;on-call&rdquo; rate.  This latter rate, however, is paid to staff such as radiographers who have a liability actually to attend in person at a hospital.  The role of the supervising social worker is essentially confined to providing advice by telephone, or to making telephone calls subsequent to being contacted.</P>
    <P>At a meeting with union representatives on Tuesday, 25 May, the Eastern Health Board signalled its willingness to refer the dispute to such third party review as would be agreeable to <Col N="1192" /> both sides.  This was rejected.  The offer still stands.</P>
    <P>The three social workers in the field are continuing to provide night time services on a normal basis to clients, which may include referrals to other agencies as appropriate.  The situation is being closely monitored.</P>
    <P>When the after hours service was introduced, it was agreed that an evaluation would be conducted after 12 months. That evaluation is near to completion. The union has been asked to stop the current industrial action in order to allow the issues in dispute to be addressed and reviewed comprehensively within the framework of the evaluation process.</P>

      <P>Grant aid towards the cost of installing and upgrading supply on farms in disadvantaged areas has been provided for more than a decade under the original EC funded Feoga Western Aid Programme and, latterly, under the Exchequer funded Farm Electrification Grants Scheme.

In addition the current state of nuclear technology and economic costs make it unsuitable for the relatively small scale stand alone electricity system operated in Ireland.</P>

      <P>The integrity and safety of the gas interconnector pipeline are key elements in the planning, construction and operation of the system.  The technical specifications for construction and operation conform to the highest international standards. Trenching of the subsea pipeline will protect it from any external risks.</P>

    <P>In the operational phase, the flow of gas in the system and all key operating <Col N="1144" /> parameters will be monitored continuously by remote telemetry methods. There will also be an annual inspection of the subsea pipeline route using advanced technology which will provide early warning of any adverse conditions arising.</P>
    <P>In addition, BGE is developing detailed safety and emergency plans to ensure adequate response to deal with any unforeseeable incident involving the pipeline.  During the period up to the eventual decline of the Kinsale Head reserves, sometime after the year 2000, we will enjoy the security of supply that comes from having two separate inputs to the gas system.  Towards the end of that time, if we have not identified a new supply of gas at home, we shall have to look again at the need to provide additional security of supply.  This might take the form of liquefaction and storage of gas, or even the importation of liquefied natural gas.  In this context it is possible that a north-south link would provide security of supply to both parts of this Island.</P>

      <P>The background to the issues raised by the Deputy is set out below.  Given the reasons for the various changes.  I would not propose any amendments at this stage.  However, overall procedures for issuing of passports are kept under review.</P>
      <P>(i)  <i>Spouses Passports:</i> The issuing of joint passports to husbands and wives was discontinued in October 1992.  Under the joint passport system, the spouse was not entitled to travel separately from the passport holder; it was found that, in practice, problems regularly arose when the spouse needed to travel independently. The provision of separate passports allows greater flexibility in travel and also brings Ireland into line with general international practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(ii)  <i>Adding Children to Passports:</i> The present procedure was introduced in July 1988, when it was decided to laminate the children's section of the passport. The purpose of lamination is to prevent <Col N="1146" /> fraudulent inclusion of a child on a previously issued passport.  The change in format means, however, that it is no longer technically possible for the Passport Office to add child details to a passport after issue.  Instead, a replacement passport is issued for the unexpired period of the original passport; the fee charged is £15, one-third of the normal passport fee.</P>
    <P>(iii)  <i>Abolition of one year passport for over 65's:</i> This change was introduced because of the transition from handwritten to Machine Readable Passport (MRP) which is currently under way.</P>
    <P>With handwritten passports, there is flexibility to extend the validity period after issue.  However, MRPs are the international norm; they have a number of advantages, including considerably enhanced security in passport production. The design and layout of MRPs are determined by international agreements, which require that a fixed expiry date be established at the time the passport is issued.</P>
    <P>In order to prepare for the introduction of MRPs, it was decided in October 1992 to replace the existing one-year renewable passports for under 18's and over 65's with a three year non-renewable passport costing £10.  Although these new passports cost £5 more at time of issue, they remove the inconvenience of annual renewals and represent a saving of £5 over the life of the passport.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that the sale of taxi plates falls outside the scope of setion 28 of the Capital Gains Tax (CGT) Act 1975, which provides for deferment for CGT purposes of gains realised on the disposal of certain business assets, including plant and machinery, buildings, land and goodwill, provided that certain conditions are met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of public service vehicles licences (taxi-plates) in issue at any given time is controlled by the public authorities. These licences derive their value from the fact that their numbers are limited and not from any inherent value or characteristic of one licence over another. The disposal of a taxi-plate is in effect the disposal by its owner of his legal entitlement to operate a taxi and accordingly would not be a disposal of a qualifying asset as provided for in section 28 of the Capital Gains Tax Act, 1975. Since the sale of the taxi-plate arises when the owner is leaving the taxi business, the payment of capital gains tax does not affect the taxi business.  It is assumed therefore that the Deputy is referring to the effect of this capital gains <Col N="1148" /> tax payment where the owner goes into a new business.  Since a large capital gain can often arise on the disposal of a taxi-plate, I do not believe that payment of capital gains tax in such situations should cause a major problem.  Indexation relief and the annual CGT relief for individuals will of course normally apply to such disposals.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44 and 45 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that in January 1993, Dublin Corporation undertook a process of extensive public consultation on the results of the studies of the traffic implications of the proposed access road from the Northern Cross Route to the Ballymun Road, in particular on parts of Ballymun and Glasnevin north in the corporation's administrative area.  The studies, which involved the assessment of traffic aspects by consultants and the investigation of environmental issues by <Col N="1152" /> EOLAS, were required to identify and describe the likely significant effects on humans, on air quality and on noise levels in any areas which would experience higher traffic volumes due to the provision of the access road.</P>
    <P>Since January, two meetings have been held between corporation officials and public and local residents association representatives. I understand that questions in relation to the traffic study which were raised at these meetings and any others submitted in writing to the corporation have been referred to the consultants. It is the corporation's intention to meet again with residents association and public representatives as soon as the consultants respond to the issues raised and in advance of the award of the contract for phase 2 of the Northern Cross Route.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for the relevant local authority, taking full account of the studies and of the results of the public consultation process, to implement traffic management or other appropriate measures required to prevent, reduce or offset any significant adverse effects in the environment.</P>

      <P>New house grants are paid directly to the applicants and are not incorporated in local authority house purchase loans.  However, it is a condition of the local authority house purchase loan scheme that the amount of the loan cannot exceed the relevant percentage (i.e. for annuity loans 95 per cent normally, 98 per cent in &ldquo;special category&rdquo; cases, and for convertible and income related loans, 90 per cent) of the <Col N="1153" /> value of the house (excluding the amount of any grant paid under any enactment in respect of the construction or acquisition of the house).  I have no proposals to drop this condition, which would require an amendment of the regulations. To do so, could result in the loan and grant combined being in excess of the value of the house.</P>

      <P>The position is that Clare Island Seafarms Ltd., Cloghmore, Achill, County Mayo, applied in August 1992 for the licensing of a long term fallowing site at Annagh Bay, Achill Sound, County Mayo.  Leaving sites fallow for a period to break the cycle of infection with sea-lice and reduce the risk of other diseases is an internationally accepted fishfarm management strategy.  It has been endorsed by the Scientific Sea Trout Working Group.  The permit and licence which is now proposed is for a short term, pilot fallowing project for 1993 only, and is subject to rigorous environmental and independent monitoring requirements. The approvals were necessary to ensure continuity of employment for up to 25 people working full-time with the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These permissions were given following detailed assessment and advice from the Department's Aquaculture Licence Vetting Committee (ALVC). The ALVC rigorously assessed the proposal, including comments made to the Department during and extensive consultative process with the Fisheries Board, the Salmon Research Agency and a number of other public bodies.  The ALVC recommended in favour of granting the permissions.  Decisions for 1994 and beyond are contingent on the outcome <Col N="1154" /> of the recently established expert Fallowing Working Group.</P>
    <P>This rearing trial does not involve any increase in the licensed tonnage of the salmon farm operator.  While a formal offer has been made to the company, finalisation and issue of the necessary permit and licence is contingent on the company's acceptance of specific environmental and monitoring requirements.</P>

      <P>In January of this year following serious oil tanker accidents in the UK and Spain a joint Environment/Transport Council of Ministers called for the adoption of measures to protect environmentally vulnerable areas of Community Waters.  As part of that process the EC asked member states to identify ecologically sensitive areas in need of protection and to submit proposals to them.</P>
      <P>Ireland's proposals relate to the creation of exclusion zones or what are formally designated as &ldquo;areas to be avoided&rdquo; by all ships or certain classes of ship.  The areas identified which include shell-fish grounds, aquaculture sites, coastal flora, fauna and wild bird habitats and coastal areas of scientific interest fall, broadly, into three categories:</P>
      <P>(1)  Areas where, because of navigational restrictions, laden tankers (oil, chemical, gas) or other ships carrying dangerous cargoes would be banned from entry at all times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Routes taken by laden tankers, ships carrying large quantities of fuel oil, or other ships carrying dangerous cargoes bound for or leaving an Irish port where such tankers/ships would be required to keep seaward of linked geographical baselines around areas of the Irish coast. The distance seaward would depend on <Col N="1155" /> the tonnage of oil or dangerous cargo on board.  Inbound and outbound traffic would be required to take as direct a route as it is safe to take to commence voyage outside of the baselines.</P>
    <P>(3)  Routes taken by laden tankers and ships carrying dangerous cargoes transiting Irish waters i.e. not bound for an Irish port which would not be permitted to come within the 100 fathom/200 metre sounding line (range 20 to 70 miles approx. off the coast).</P>
    <P>Proposals will now be assessed by the EC prior to submission to the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) for adoption globally and for formal incorporation in ships' navigation charts. Pending acceptance of my proposals at EC and IMO levels I do not wish to be definitive about the areas/routes in question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Moriarty Task Force recommended that plans to implement greatly reduced prices for milled peat to the ESB so as to bring that fuel more into line with the price of other energy sources should be completed by end June, 1993.  The Government noted the recommendations in relation to the sale of milled peat and, as a first step, the subsidy element of the price paid by the ESB to Bord na Móna will be identified and made transparent.</P>
      <P>Making the subsidy transparent will not contribute to reducing the excess cost of electricity &mdash; that can only come about by reducing the subsidy.  In this context the reason for the existence of the subsidy is relevant.  Bord na Móna is a company with net borrowings of £180 million.  The cost of servicing the debt as set out in the latest published accounts of Bord na Móna (year ended March 1992) was £20.3 million.  Without the subsidy Bord na Móna would be unable to survive. Ireland is by no means the only country in the European Community that subsidises indigenous energy.  The Government however agrees with the implications in the Moriarity Task Force report that the level of the subsidy should be minimised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly, the Government recognised <Col N="1158" /> that the reduction of milled peat prices to the ESB is dependent on the ability of Bord na Móna to achieve a large reduction in its debt.  My Department, in conjunction with Bord na Móna, is currently working on proposals to achieve this objective and it would be premature to give details of these before they are finalised.</P>

      <P>The additional cost of petrol attributable to the mandatory take-off from Whitegate refinery varies from time to time.  A general idea of the scale can be got from the report of the Fair Trade Commission on the Supply and Distribution of Motor Fuels, which estimated that over the four year period examined, the additional cost, including the cost of storing that part of our national oil stocks in the refinery, was 2.45 pence per gallon. Recent examination of import data indicates that, over the 12 month period September 1991 to September 1992, there has been little change in this figure.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 58, 59 and 60 together.</P>
      <P>The Government has approved proposals for a major restructuring of the ESB.  These proposals include the reorganisation of the ESB into five business units; the establishment of a central power purchasing function within the ESB and an end to the ESB's monopoly on the sale of electricity.  The purpose of these changes is to promote greater cost transparency within the industry and to encourage the development of combined heat and power and renewable energy projects.  Future generating requirements to meet electricity demand in Ireland are under constant review and the method of providing additional capacity will be a matter for Government at the appropriate time.</P>
      <P>The general scheme of a Bill, to be entitled the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, approved by Government on 13 October last, is currently being drafted.  I hope to introduce it before the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1161" /> The Bill will provide for, <i>inter alia</i>, removal of Bord Gáis Éireann's right of first refusal on all gas got within the jurisdiction of the State and will empower the Minister to give general directives on the carriage of gas through its pipelines by Bord Gáis Éireann for others, subject to considerations of capacity and security of supply to BGE's existing customers.  The proposed Bill will also provide for the appointment of an arbitrator in cases of dispute as to the terms of conditions under which gas is to be carried.</P>

      <P>The approval of the Government and the EC authorities for the development of diesel-based commuter rail services along the south-west rail corridor was anounced by my predecessor on 30 July, 1992.  The project will involve an investment of approximately £13 million.  Financial assistance is being provided for the project from the European Regional Development Fund at an intervention rate of 50 per cent.  The balance of the investment cost is being funded by Iarnród Éireann from its own resources, including borrowings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The project involves the development of new and enhanced outer suburban services based on the existing stations at Newbridge and Kildare, with new stations to be established at Cherry Orchard, Clondalkin, Hazelhatch and <Col N="1162" /> Sallins.  A dedicated feeder bus service is also planned to link Heuston Station to the city centre.</P>

      <P>Coal supplies are currently imported for use in Moneypoint and the ESB's fuel purchasing arrangements ensure that fuel is available as required.</P>
      <P>In relation to indigenous solid fuel sources, the Government is committed to peat's continued use for electricity generation. The Programme for a Partnership Government committed the Government to supporting a new 120MW peat fired station, which would result in the creation of about 350 long term jobs, if it is found to be feasible.  Such a station would require one million tonnes of peat annually and Bord na Móna is satisfied that it can produce and deliver such quantities over the life of the power station.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 70 and 71 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As indicated to the House on 6 April 1993, we already have an aviation policy for Ireland.  The objectives of this policy <Col N="1164" /> are as follows: (1) to improve competitiveness and thereby facilitate job and wealth creation in Ireland by providing a wide range of reliable and regular commercial air services for Irish tourism trade and industry, at the lowest economic cost; (2) to promote direct job and wealth creation in the Irish airline and aviation industry through opening up new markets for Irish operators, e.g. Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta, either in bilateral or multilateral negotiations; (3) to have at least one domestically based and financially viable national airline to ensure continuity of air services between Ireland and all our main export markets &mdash; in effect, this means a strong Aer Lingus, not because it is Government-owned but because it is the one Irish airline which has the critical mass, expertise and best range of products to achieve this aim; (4) to ensure, in so far as possible, an equitable distribution of airline traffic to Shannon, Cork and the regional airports to support the Government's policy of promoting balanced regional growth within Ireland; (5) to ensure that all Irish airports are cost compeititive and have infrastructure of the highest international standards to meet the needs of the international airline industry; (6) to ensure the maximum utilisation of our national airspace asset; (7) to ensure that the standards, safety and security of aviation inspire confidence in the use of Irish airspace and technical infrastructure by air carriers.</P>
    <P>These objectives have been formulated against the background of: (1) the current market changes in the international economic regulatory environment which has become more deregulated and liberalised; (2) Ireland's peripheral geographical location within Europe; and (3) national agreements with the social partners where the emphasis has been on expanding existing air services, introducing new services and ensuring access costs are competitive in the interest of both tourism and business travellers alike.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that these objectives are the appropriate ones for the current and future needs of Irish aviation.  All policy <Col N="1165" /> decisions which have been or will be taken will be fully consistent with these objectives.  Both I and my predecessor have taken a number of initiatives to ensure the achievement of these objectives mainly through bilateral agreements which we have initiated with other countries. Over the past three years, 11 such agreements have been or are being negotiated not only for air services but also for the whole range of aviation activities which Ireland excels in.  In addition, my Department is in contact with another eight countries about concluding similar agreements.</P>
    <P>Since 1 January this year, all Community air carriers are entitled to fly on all international routes within the Community. The question of whether an airline wishes to exercise its right to operate on any specific route is a matter for the commercial judgment of the airline.  In this regard, Aer Lingus has indicated to me that it has no plans to operate on the Dublin-Stansted route in 1993.</P>

      <P>I am aware of concerns expressed regarding a possible health risk from wild cats in the Dublin area.  While my Department has no statutory responsibility in the control of wild cats as such, any potentially serious health risk from whatever source, would be of concern to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Infections associated with cats are toxoplasmosis and cats scratch fever.  Toxoplasmosis can be transmitted via cat <Col N="1166" /> droppings in the soil to humans and other animals.  Cat scratch fever is normally linked to a bite or scratch from a cat.  In very rare cases rabies may be carried by cats but this has occurred only in countries where rabies cases are prevalent.  At a recent meeting between officials of my Department and representatives of the Cats' Protection Association of Ireland the Association undertook to submit a formal document outlining the problem as they perceived it, how they thought it should be dealt with and what the costs involved would be.  It will then be a matter for consideration whether any special measures are required to deal with the matter and if so by what authority.</P>

      <P>The disadvantage post was provided to counteract, as far as possible, the impact of disadvantage on the pupils.  It was intended that the school authorities would use this resource to provide remedial help to the pupils of the school and to develop home/school liaison in order to advise parents and to involve them in the education of their children.</P>
