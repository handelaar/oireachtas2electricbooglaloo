    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Minister for State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. T. Kitt) Minister for State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. T. Kitt)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to update the Commissioners for Oaths (Diplomatic and Consular) Act, 1931, and the Diplomatic and Consular Fees Act, 1939, by redefining diplomatic and consular officers entitled to administer them and to consolidate the two Acts.  It is essentially a tidying up of legislation that has become outdated.</P>
      <P>The 1931 Act enables specified diplomatic, consular and honorary consular officers serving outside the State to administer oaths, take affidavits and carry out notarial acts.  It renders such services done abroad as effective as if done by or before any lawful authority within the State.  The Act also empowers the Minister for Foreign Affairs, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to make regulations by order in relation to the fees to be charged in respect of those services.</P>
      <P>The 1939 Act supplements the 1931 Act.  It empowers the Minister for Foreign Affairs, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to make regulations fixing the fees to be charged for servcies other than those authorised by the earlier Act &mdash; for example, passport, visa and general consular fees.  The 1939 Act applies to services rendered by the same categories of diplomatic, consular and honorary consular officers serving outside the State as are mentioned in the 1931 Act but it can also apply to any officer whom the Minister for Foreign Affairs may appoint specially for the purposes of the 1939 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amending legislation is required because the ranks of diplomatic and consular officers listed in these two Acts have become obsolete.  Many of them, such as High Commissioner or First Secretary of Legation, no longer exist.  More importantly, some officers who are <Col N="782" /> expected to provide the services mentioned and to collect fees, such as Ambassadors, Third Secretaries and Honorary Consuls-General, are not specifically identified in either of these Acts.</P>
    <P>The Bill therefore updates the lists of the ranks of diplomatic and consular officers entitled to administer the 1931 and 1939 Acts.  The definitions and descriptions of diplomatic and consular officers contained in the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, 1961, and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, 1963 &mdash;&ldquo;head of mission&rdquo;, &ldquo;member of the diplomatic staff&rdquo;, &ldquo;career consular officer&rdquo; and &ldquo;honorary consular officer&rdquo;&mdash; are used.  Those two Conventions have the force of law in Ireland through the Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Act, 1967.</P>
    <P>On the advice of the Parliamentary Draftsman, the Bill also consolidates the 1931 and 1939 Acts so that the services provided and the fees charged by diplomatic and consular officers can now be covered by just one Act.  This is essentially a tidying up of outdated legislation bringing us into line with the fact that many of the titles such as High Commissioner, and First Secretary of Legation no longer exist.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not oppose this tidying up Bill.  It is good to see antiquated legislation being dealt with.  It is time many other antiquated Acts were looked at.  Many of the citizenship Acts, which come under the ambit of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Justice, need to be tidied up.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  The titles in the 1931 and 1939 Acts read like something out of a Gilbert and Sullivan operetta. Like the words out of one of the songs, they refer to the Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  We have the Councillor of Legation and a First Secretary of the Office of the High Commissioner.  I <Col N="783" /> was recently at a showing of &ldquo;The Mikado&rdquo; where they had the First Secretary of the Office of the Lord High Executioner.  I just wonder that such a person is not on this list along with the Honorary Consul and an Honorary Vice Consul.  I gather that these terms are no longer used.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that our ambassadors have been given this extra power. This Bill also gives us an opportunity to raise a couple of other issues with regard to our diplomatic and consular officers. Over the years a number of Ministers for Foreign Affairs have expressed the desire for our embassies abroad to become more &ldquo;hands on&rdquo; in selling Ireland, with a move away from the honorary positions which ambassadors have held over the years.  By and large, it is a very diplomatic task &mdash; representatives go around the various receptions on national days and discuss foreign policy with their counterparts. Having regard to our lack of resources in providing services throughout the world, it is important that our ambassadors extend their role and seek contacts and business opportunities for Ireland and encourage foreigners to visit Ireland as tourists or become involved in business ventures.  For that reason we need resources to expand the service.  If we do not speculate we will not accumulate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The diplomatic services do a very good job and could do more.  I gather that the Department is considering opening three new missions in the new year &mdash; an embassy in South Africa, overseas development offices in Uganda and in Ethiopia which will be staffed by Foreign Affairs and other technical people.  At the moment we have 34 foreign missions in Dublin and 40 Irish missions abroad.  I know that development offices are not embassies in the real sense, but having dealt with a number of development offices in Zambia, Sudan and Lesotho I know they have to acquire the status of embassy in order to be able to communicate with other embassies and that they act as ambassadors for us in those countries.  They are in the front line in <Col N="784" /> assisting those countries and in seeking out opportunities for Ireland.</P>
    <P>Although it comes under the ambit for the Minister for Justice, the Minister for Foreign Affairs will have a direct interest in our reluctance to honour applications for Irish passports from many people living in the US, South Africa, New Zealand and Australia.  In 1986 the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act was introduced.  It contained a deadline of December 31 by which people had to apply for Irish citizenship and have it registered to entitle them to passports, thus enabling their children in turn to be entitled to Irish citizenship.  At the time the Department did not anticipate the huge number of applications that would be received.  Throughout the world the embassies and consular offices had to cope with queues, which lasted for two and three days, of people wishing to sign on for Irish citizenship.  Applications were received by 31 December, but staffing was not adequate to register these applications.  There are now thousands of people throughout the US, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand who have paid their fees and are eligible for Irish citizenship but have not got it.  I have raised this issue year after year since 1986 and every Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Justice tells me that they are doing a trawl, a review of all citizenship Acts, in order to make this amendment.</P>
    <P>In 1987 the Attorney General indicated that amending legislation was required to register the applications which had been received but not registered before 31 December 1986.  I call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State present to take an active interest in this matter and, in conjunction with the Minister for Justice, to correct this anomaly.  We have gone cap in hand to the United States authorities to beg them to extend citizenship rights to our citizens in the United States illegally. Yet, when we are called upon to return the favour we cannot do so and have failed to do so during the past six or seven years.  I, therefore, ask the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, to take a personal <Col N="785" /> interest in this matter and to press the Government to introduce the amending legislation because, if it does not, I will do so myself.  All that is required is a one line Bill.</P>
    <P>Our ambassadors are being hounded. On a recent visit to the United Nations in New York this issue was raised with me yet again by the Ambassador and some of his staff.  They have been approached by people in Congress and individuals.  Indeed, one such applicant came to see me in New York to put the case on his own behalf and on behalf of a number of others who want their citizenship confirmed.  The dollars they paid have been held in our Embassy's bank accounts for the past seven years and have not been used.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to raise this issue in the debate on the Diplomatic and Consular Officers (Provision of Services) Bill.  Although it is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice to introduce the amending legislation it is the Minister of State's officials who are causing the delay.  I would like him to make the necessary resources available to allow the applications to be processed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Bill and can find nothing, in principle, wrong with it.  Therefore, I do not intend to waste the time of the House by expanding on the subject.  However, I have now been spurred on by Deputy Owen and wish, without being disorderly and irrelevant, to support the points she made about the Citizenship and Nationality Act.  I know of people who were left in no man's land due to the failure of the Department to deal with the problem which it had created.  It is wrong that a Department which was obliged to carry out this function, the registration of applicants for Irish citizenship, as a matter of law by a specific date should have failed to do so and in the process leaving people with no right of redress except to wait for the mills of legislation to grind slowly and finely through the small detail of citizenship and nationality legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I anticipate from the discussions during <Col N="786" /> the renegotiation of the Progressive Democrats-Fianna Fáil Programme for Government 1991 that citizenship and nationality legislation is on the way and that not only will it contain provisions to deal with the issue raised by Deputy Owen it will also &mdash; this is more worrying &mdash; deprive children born in Ireland of citizenship on the basis that their parents are illegal aliens.  I warn the Government that that legislation will not go through without a strong debate.  It would be a retrograde step if children born in Ireland were deprived of citizenship because their parents are aliens.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to make a contribution on this legislation.  I hold strong views on the question of diplomatic representation, career diplomats or honorary consuls.  I recall that when I was Minister for Agriculture I advocated that some people from the private sector should be appointed ambassadors and honorary consuls rather than confining the appointments to career diplomats.  For my pains I was keel-hauled by the Taoiseach of the day.  I deeply resented this.</P>
      <P>I have continued to advocate this in the House by way of parliamentary question and during debates on foreign affairs matters because it would be of immense value, from the point of view of job creation, if a significant number of successful people from the business sector and professional people were appointed ambassadors or honorary consuls.  We should expand our diplomatic service as there is no better way of gaining access to Ministers, Prime Ministers, Presidents and the captains of industry than through the diplomatic service.  Ambassadors and honorary consuls are invited to every kind of reception where political leaders and leaders in industry are present.  They can make invaluable contacts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to make a comparison with the position in New Zealand which is similar to this country and largely dependent on agriculture.  New Zealand appoints ambassadors and honorary consuls on the basis of a person's ability to lobby and influence Government Ministers and <Col N="787" /> industrialists.  In my capacity as Minister for Agriculture I was lobbied continuously by the New Zealand ambassador to Ireland who was also accredited to the United Kingdom.  He knew agriculture inside out.  Each time I went to mainland Europe I was sure to meet the New Zealand ambassador who wished to lobby me on the question of the entry of New Zealand agricultural products, including lamb, butter and milk products, to the European Community.  I fail to see why we should allow ourselves to be restrained by a straitjacket which dates back to 1922 when the State was founded.</P>
    <P>Our diplomatic service is the spitting image of the British diplomatic service but does not serve the same purpose.  The British diplomatic service was designed to deal with an empire which covered almost half the world.</P>

      <P>If I can get rid of the cobwebs that are literally choking Iveagh House and its incumbents I will do so. However, I do not wish to come into conflict with the Chair.  I am asking the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and his deputy to show a bit of initiative. We have a process here by which we <Col N="788" /> could substantially reduce the number of unemployed by gearing our diplomatic corps towards promoting Ireland abroad and lobbying the people I have spoken about, Heads of State and heads of industry. Surely that is not too much to ask. All it requires is a little bit of initiative.</P>
      <P>I have yet to see a Minister for Foreign Affairs who has that initiative.  I might as well be speaking to the wall today if past experience is to be repeated.  As far as job creation and attracting industry and industrialists to this country is concerned, I would expect people in high places, people like the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, to react; but there has been no reaction.  I can do no more than make a plea for some initiative to be taken.  Nobody in this House seems to care, but I do.  Other countries &mdash; for example, the United States &mdash; bring in the captains of industry when it suits them and appoint them as ambassadors abroad.  I am not saying we should eliminate career diplomats, but we should have a mix.  Some career diplomats are very good, some are very bad and quite a few are mediocre.  There is the good, the bad and the indifferent, and that is not good enough.  We should have the best people from all strands working abroad on behalf of this country.</P>

      <P>I am speaking to this Bill from an unusual angle, not as a former Minister for Foreign Affairs, which would obviously give me an interest, but as the only notary public in this House.  This Bill is timely.  It is sensible that we should tidy up these old Acts.  The huge lacunae existing in these old Acts confirm yet again the need for patient debate on Bills that come before this House.  It sounds crazy to us that ambassadors and third secretaries were not specifically provided for in the old legislation of 1939, but if the Bill had been teased out properly at the time they would have been provided for.  This confirms the need for full discussion on Bills, no matter how simple they appear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister tells us that this legislation is essentially to tidy up legislation that has become outdated, and from that <Col N="789" /> point of view we support it.  The position in regard to our ambassadors has been referred to.  At this stage we have 40 Irish missions abroad.  As a small island nation it is essential that we should be represented abroad and should not have an introverted, parochial outlook on the world.  In so far as resources permit it is important that we have full representation throughout the world and that those who represent us abroad have full powers to do so.</P>
    <P>We can look at representation abroad in a purely diplomatic sense or in a broader sense.  I much prefer to look at it in the broader sense.  No matter where one travels throughout the world one finds Irish people.  For a variety of historical reasons we as a people have had a great tradition of seeking out the furthest corners of the globe.  One finds Irish people everywhere, not just in the UK and the US.  I recall going on a mission to Lesotho and coming across three people not just from Ireland but from my own constituency in south-west Cork.  If one keeps digging one will always find a few gold nuggets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose their families were appreciative of the contact made with them.  It just illustrates the point that a small country of only 1.5 million people was represented in a place like that, not just by Irish people but by people from my own area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should encourage the development of our diplomatic service, but we must do it for a purpose.  We must bear in mind that our representatives are put there by their political masters for a specific purpose.  The onus is then on the Government of the day to clearly define the functions and duties of our representatives abroad.  It is in that context that there should be some re-evaluation of the present situation.  Of course our representatives are there as diplomats, to look after our own people and to do what is provided for in this Bill in the context of consular activites, administering oaths, taking affidavits and carrying out notarial <Col N="790" /> acts.  However, there must be a much broader definition of their function today.  They must be in a position to clearly enunicate the efforts of our Government in relation to Northern Ireland and dispel the myths that exist about the problems on our island.  I regard that as a particular function of our representation abroad.</P>
    <P>The question of trade was touched on by my colleague, Deputy Deasy.  In this area our diplomats have sometimes not been given proper credit for what they are trying to do.  There has not been a sufficient level of decision making by Government on how the diplomatic service can be incorporated more into our trade operations.  I know there is an involvement, particularly in the old Communist bloc countries, where everything was done on a state to state level. However, we must go further.  I have always favoured the idea of a &ldquo;one stop shop&rdquo; abroad, an Ireland House concept in other countries, where the ambassador would have a role.  It is a total waste of money to have semi-State bodies with different offices in capitals throughout the world.  This is particularly applicable in the United States and to a degree in countries in Europe.  The right approach is to aim towards having an Ireland House in each of these centres, with our ambassadors fronting activities and helping to open the door from the point of view of inward investment and dealing with trade aspects.</P>
    <P>Another area worth mentioning in the context of this Bill is the consular service. I am not sure how many honorary consuls we have abroad.  Perhaps the Minister could tell me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 56 at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that the position is an honorary one and holders of it receive a few hundred pounds a year to cover postal charges. They also get a CD plate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is time to review our consular service system.  I would favour extending it if we can get people to represent us in out of <Col N="791" /> the way places for such nominal sums. During the years in emergencies, such as sudden deaths or accidents abroad, invariably the officials in Iveagh House and the honorary consul in the foreign destination co-operated fully and went out of their way to help.  They are not appreciated and I would like to record that we very much appreciate their help in such emergencies.  The Government might consider reviewing our consular postings.  Suggestions have been made that some holders of consular posts might not be the most suitable representatives. I am not sure if there is any question of terminating such appointments.  The Government should give more recognition to honorary consuls who are doing an excellent job on behalf of the country for very little reward and examine the possibility of extending the list of consuls to provide a wider network of representation throughout the world at very little cost.</P>
    <P>There is a latent resource of talent in the Department of Foreign Affairs and it behoves us to use such talent to the best advantage.  All the officials are not whizz kids but from my experience they try their best and many are very capable.  In a country with 300,000 unemployed and which depends largely on foreign trade, it behoves the Government to ensure that this resource of talent is used to the best advantage.  I do not believe that is happening at present and I urge the Minister to consider how we might best use that resource.</P>
    <P>Donning a notarial hat, I am pleased that henceforth ambassadors will be able to perform the function I perform as a notary public, administer oaths and witness affidavits abroad.  It is a small additional function but it should not take in any way from their main function and perhaps additional functions in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. T. Kitt) Tom Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will outline the five functions of a diplomatic mission.  It represents an ascending State and the receiving State.  In the receiving State it protects the interests of the <Col N="792" /> ascending State and its nationals within the limits permitted by international law. It negotiates with the Government of the receiving State.  It ascertains by all lawful means conditions and developments in the receiving State and reports thereon to the Government of the ascending State.  It promotes friendly relations between the ascending State and the receiving State and develops their economic, cultural and scientific relations. This has been a useful debate.  Primarily, this Bill is tidying up legislation from the 1930s.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the Chair has allowed the Deputies who contributed to widen the debate and they raised some important points.  Deputies O'Keeffe, Deasy and Owen referred to the role of our ambassadors and our diplomatic service. My experience would not be as long as some Members.  I will respond to Deputy Deasy's remarks about the involvement of the private sector in the diplomatic and consular service.  I have been impressed by the activities of our diplomatic service.  Our diplomats are well trained in a wide range of areas and their work requires them to address many difficult economic issues.  They are involved in promoting trade and investment.  From my experience of dealing with officials in the European Community, there is no doubt that our ambassadors have a central role to play in working closely with Ministers and Ministers in the receiving States.  They must be up to date with the Maastricht Treaty legislation and current economic and monetary policies.  Having met some of our ambassadors, and had briefings from them, especially in the European Community, I know they are fulfilling a very useful role and acting in a pro-active way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last Thursday I represented the Tánaiste at a meeting in Germany because a confidence vote was tabled in the House.  In Frankfurt I met some industrialists who plan to invest here. Two meetings were held at which officials of the IDA and our ambassador were present.  That example highlights how one of our ambassadors is pro-actively involved working as part of a team with the IDA.  The ambassador is well known <Col N="793" /> to local Ministers, industrialists and works well with the people in Germany who plan to invest here.  As a result of that visit approximately 300 jobs will be created shortly.  Last Thursday I addressed a luncheon organised by the Germany-Irish Business Association with the help of our ambassador.  We should applaud the work undertaken by our ambassadors.  There are many more examples of the work of our ambassadors in promoting Ireland abroad.</P>
    <P>Recently I visited Japan.  Deputies present will be aware of the importance of that country in our approach to investment and economic expansion.  Our ambassador to Japan who has a difficult mission, is closely involved with the business community and is aware of where the opportunities lie.  He is well known to Ministers and civil servants in Japan. Our ambassadors abroad are well trained and are familiar with what is happening in the countries where they are resident. I appreciate that we must monitor their work.  I assure the House that the Tánaiste and I are conscious of the points raised and I thank the Deputies for their remarks.</P>
    <P>The size of our diplomatic service is under constant review and its expansion is subject to available resources.  For example, we recently expanded our diplomatic service to Helsinki and in the near future will expand to Pretoria.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy O'Keeffe's suggestion that we need to monitor closely the activities of our consular missions.  We have 56 honorary consuls and they were mainly chosen because they are effective business people and have good contacts in the private sector.  They are key people in the business world and promote our policy of economic expansion.  Our honorary consul in Nairobi had a central role to play in our dealings with the problems in Somalia and Sudan, both of which countries I visited.  Other Ministers when visiting these countries, particularly Somalia were very impressed with the work of our honorary consul in Nairobi who, in many cases, works throughout the night to receive Ministers visiting those countries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="794" /> Citizen legislation was mentioned.  As Deputies are aware, this is a matter for the Minister for Justice.  We are well aware of the problems mentioned by Deputy Owen and the necessary amending legislation will be brought forward by the Minister for Justice as soon as possible.  I understand and share the concerns of Deputies and I will convey them to the Minister.  The legislation is well overdue and it is unacceptable that people be left in limbo for so long.</P>
    <P>This has been a useful debate in that Deputies have made constructive comments about our diplomatic services.  This is essentially a tidying up Bill.  It removes anachronisms but does not change the law relating to the provision of consular services, an important and basic function of every foreign Minister.  I thank Deputies for their constructive approach and their detailed comments.  The changes that needed to be made to the 1931 and 1939 Acts were relatively minor and such matters tend to be overtaken by more urgent issues.  Finally, I propose that the Bill be referred to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs pursuant to Standing Order 94 (1), Paragraph 4 of that committee's terms of reference.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill provides for the establishment of three new county councils &mdash; Fingal, South Dublin and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown &mdash; to replace the existing Dublin County Council, Dún Laoghaire Corporation, and Dean's Grange Joint Burial Board.  It represents the culmination of a legislative process which began in 1985.  The new county councils will be the first since the system of county councils was established in 1898.  We are making history here today and we would like to continue to do so.</P>
      <P>The Bill also deals with a large number of matters, many of a detailed, technical nature, arising from the establishment of the new authorities and the dissolution of the existing bodies, including adjustments to other statutory codes and provisions to rationalise and improve local authority operations in Dublin in a number of service areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1991 census showed Dublin county, which stretches from Balbriggan to Bray and westwards to the Kildare and Meath borders, to have a population of almost 547,000.  At the start of the century almost the entire county was essentially rural.  Subsequent changes in local authority structures basically involved the city boundaries extending outwards in pursuit of population growth into the county.  During this century the population in the Dublin area has more than doubled, with growth being especially marked &mdash; involving an increase of more <Col N="796" /> than half a million over 50 years &mdash; between the thirties and the early eighties. This growth in overall population has been accompanied by redistribution on a massive scale with population loss at the centre and population gain in the surrounding county.</P>
    <P>As in most European cities, for much of the first half of this century a majority of the population of Dublin lived in the inner city, that is roughly within one to two kilometres of the centre at O'Connell Bridge.  Over a quarter of a million people lived in this area during the thirties, many of them in highly congested and very poor accommodation.</P>
    <P>From the thirties onwards a combination of factors acted to promote growth in the county.  On the one hand, a programme of local authority house building at suburban locations allowed for slum clearance in inner city areas.  On the other, a rise in private car ownership, particularly from the fifties on, accelerated a trend for people to move outward to new suburbs and beyond to surrounding towns and villages.  New industrial and commercial enterprises also began to locate in the country.</P>
    <P>Over the years there have been many proposals for reorganisation of the local government structures in the Dublin area to adapt to changing patterns of social, economic and population distribution. There were inquiries in 1880, 1926 and 1938; a White Paper in 1971 and a policy statement in 1985.  A number of enactments to implement boundary changes were passed in the first half of the century as the city boundary was moved outwards. In particular, the Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1930, provided for boundary alterations, together with the creation of Dún Laoghaire Borough and the introduction of the management system in Dublin.  The most recent legislation was the Local Government (Reorganisation) Act, 1985, and the Local Government Act, 1991.</P>
    <P>The 1985 Act increased the membership of the city council and of the county council, made adjustments to the boundary between city and county and divided the county into three areas used <Col N="797" /> for the purposes of the 1985 local elections. These areas, which were known as electoral counties, are essentially the same as those for which the new county councils are now being established. Under the 1985 Act the total membership elected on the basis of the electoral counties &mdash; 78 persons in all &mdash; formed the membership of Dublin County Council pending further legislation which was intended to formally establish the three new county councils and dissolve the existing bodies.</P>
    <P>The Local Government Act, 1991, provided, <i>inter alia</i>, for a structured and progressive statutory framework to carry forward the reorganisation process.  In particular it required Dublin County Council to establish an &ldquo;area committee&rdquo; for each electoral county and to delegate functions to them: it provided for the appointment of three area managers; required the new area managers to prepare jointly, following consultation with the area committees and Dublin Corporation, a &ldquo;reorganisation report&rdquo; setting out arrangements to be made in preparation for the transition to the new councils, and to submit the report to the Minister for the Environment; provided that all Dublin authorities could make submissions to the Minister in relation to the report and provided that the Minister for the Environment could then by regulations make arrangements allowing for the making of necessary preparations.</P>
    <P>The Reorganisation report was duly published in July 1992 and set out the general arrangements to give effect to the reorganisation process.  Broadly speaking it proposed that the three councils would operate as autonomous local authorities each providing its own services, but certain services such as sewage treatment, waste disposal and water production would continue to be provided on the wider Dublin area basis.  The Dublin (Preparations for Reorganisation) Regulations, 1993, made by me required the area managers to prepare schemes, in general accord with the reorganisation report, which would have effect on and from the establishment of the new councils. These schemes deal with the many <Col N="798" /> practical arrangements to be made in preparation for the new councils.  For example, the allocation of assets and liabilities; the performance of functions by one authority on behalf of another; staff assignment to the new councils, etc. These arrangements are well in train and are, I understand, on target for a 1 January 1994 start up, thus clearing the way for the establishment of the new county councils provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The proposal to establish three new county councils is designed to ensure more relevant and accessible local government structures with a a sharper focus and operational capability to serve their areas.  However, any proposals for reorganisation in Dublin must address the issue of co-ordination of major local authority services.  In this context not only are important provisions included in the Bill &mdash; which I will come to in a moment &mdash; but relevant action is being taken at the regional level to ensure the desired result.  An order under section 43 of the Local Government Act, 1991, for the establishment of regional authorities will be made by me shortly.  The three new counties and the city will constitute a single Dublin region; this has been the case for Structural Fund purposes for some years past.  The surrounding counties of Kildare, Meath and Wicklow will constitute the mid-west region.  The purpose of regional authorities will be to promote the co-ordination of public, including local authority, services and the order establishing them will provide for a significant role in relation to the review and co-ordination of development plans.</P>
    <P>Over and above the regional authority framework, section 32 of the Bill requires the three new councils and Dublin Corporation to co-operate, to have due regard to the needs of the overall Dublin region in their policies and programmes and enjoins the managers to ensure that necessary procedures are in place to facilitate this.  Under that section, the four authorities must also have regard to any strategy, study or other statement of the Dublin or Mid-East Regional Authority or any joint statement of those bodies.  Taken together, the provisions of <Col N="799" /> the Bill and the operation of the regional authorities will ensure that necessary co-ordination proceeds on an ongoing basis as regards local authority services and functions affecting the Dublin area as a whole.  This brings me to the detailed provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Part I contains standard provisions relating to short title, interpretation and repeals.  Section 3 deals with orders and regulations and section 5 deals with the construction of enactments.  Section 6 deals with implementation of the Act by local authorities, including actions by local authorities in anticipation of its commencement and also provision for directions to ensure that necessary steps are taken to give full effect to the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Part II deals with the establishment of the proposed county councils.  Section 7 provides for the establishment day, that is, the day on which the new county councils are to be established and on which the existing bodies are dissolved.  It is the intention to fix 1 January 1994 as the establishment day.  Section 8 provides for boundary alterations to the city-county boundary and for boundary alterations between the electoral counties.  I stress that these boundary alterations were all recommended in the reorganisation report to which I already referred.  All these adjustments will take effect on the establishment day.  Section 9 provides for the abolition of, <i>inter alia</i>, the administrative County of Dublin and the Borough of Dún Laoghaire and for the establishment of the three new administrative counties.</P>
    <P>The Irish and English titles of the new counties are set out in section 9, as is a procedure for the alteration of the name of any of the counties.  I should mention here that the question of the names of the new counties was raised in the reorganisation report but without any resolution of the matter &mdash; hence the provision referred to which will permit a change in name in future to be promoted by the relevant county council.  Section 10 provides for the preparation by the Commissioner of Valuation of official <Col N="800" /> maps showing the boundaries of the new counties following from the changes effected by section 8.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides for the establishment of the new councils.  Each council will consist of a cathaoirleach and councillors and will have all the powers normally vested in county councils.  For example, the new councils will be housing authorities, rating authorities, planning authorities, etc.  Section 12 provides that the members of the area committees will become the first members of the new councils and the chairman of each committee will become the first cathaoirleach of the corresponding council.  Section 13 makes necessary provision for management of the new councils and section 14 is a technical measure which allows for expenditure by the new councils in the short period between the establishment day and the adoption of their estimates later in January 1994.</P>
    <P>Part III deals with the dissolution of Dublin County Council, Dún Laoghaire Corporation and Dean's Grange Joint Burial Board and makes necessary consequential provisions.</P>
    <P>Section 15 deals with the dissolutions and sections 16 and 17, together with the Second Schedule, deal with consequential arrangements, including transfers of staff.  I have already referred to the statutory reorganisation report. The report sets out the arrangements to be made in preparation for the transition to the new authorities and the 1993 regulations provide for schemes to be prepared by the area managers for transfer of assets, liabilities, etc. and for staff designations in accordance with these arrangements.  It is these schemes and designations, together with the provisions of the Bill, which will determine the detailed allocation of property, equipment, contracts, etc. and the assignment of staff to the new councils, and which will effect their formal transfer.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill provides for consequential adjustments to a number of statutory codes, ministerial responsibility for which rests with other members of the Government.  In general the provisions of this Part relate to public bodies to which <Col N="801" /> the local authorities to be dissolved make appointments or to statutory provisions which use the administrative areas of the dissolved bodies in defining their area of application.  The explanatory memorandum outlines the various arrangements proposed and the codes which are affected.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill deals with a number of miscellaneous matters relating to the local authorities in the Dublin area. Section 32, to which I already referred, places a statutory duty on the principal authorities to have regard to the metropolitan interest and provides for the necessary arrangements designed to support this objective.  Section 33 confers power on the new councils to repair branch water pipes, a power which incidentally, has been available to Dublin Corporation and Dún Laoghaire Corporation but not to Dublin County Council.</P>
    <P>Section 34 deals with responsibility for water supply in parts of the county of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown.  Under the Dublin Corporation Waterworks Act, 1861, Dublin Corporation is responsible for the supply of water to certain areas outside the city known as the &ldquo;extra-municipal areas&rdquo;.  This is clearly unsatisfactory and the new county council will assume responsibility for this function.</P>
    <P>Section 35 and the Third Schedule rationalise responsibility for certain dwellings and land in the Dublin area. Over the past 20 years Dublin Corporation has engaged in large scale house construction in the county area.  This has resulted in a situation where now there are almost 7,500 rented houses in the county owned by the corporation. Equally, but on a much smaller scale, there are county council houses in the corporation area.  The reorganisation report highlighted this, together with the related issue of corporation land in the county, as matters that required attention and specifically recommend a transfer of ownership of houses to the local authority in whose area they are located.  Section 35 and the Third Schedule, therefore, should be seen against this background and as representing an attempt to come <Col N="802" /> to terms with a difficult problem in a way that will be seen to be fair to all the parties concerned.  The explanatory memorandum sets out how these provisions will operate in practice.  There will be difficult issues to be addressed by the managers in consultation with the elected members but I am sure that, with goodwill from all sides, the best all round arrangements will be worked out.  I might add here that it is my intention that this process will be brought to a satisfactory conclusion without delay.</P>
    <P>Section 36 will rationalise responsibility for certain Liffey bridges and harbour walls, while section 37 is a technical amendment to section 63 of the Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1930, in relation to the form of notice served for the payment of rates.</P>
    <P>Section 38 will enable the transfer of fire staff from Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council to Dublin Corporation where an appropriate agreement is made between the two authorities for the performance of fire authority functions.</P>
    <P>Section 39 contains provisions relating to the application of certain enactments in relation to the former borough area. It is purely a temporary contingency provision which will cease to have effect two years after the establishment day.</P>
    <P>The First Schedule sets out repeals. In the main these effect amendments to various enactments arising from the establishment of the three new counties and the dissolution of the existing bodies; various obsolete provisions are also being repealed.  The Second Schedule provides for matters consequential on the dissolutions of Dublin County Council, Dún Laoghaire Corporation and Dean's Grange Joint Burial Board and the matters concerned are listed in the explanatory memorandum.  Finally, the Third Schedule sets out the arrangements to give effect to the transfer of houses and land pursuant to section 35 which I have mentioned previously.</P>
    <P>I have every hope and confidence that the arrangements proposed in the Bill, with the action proposed at regional level, will significantly enhance the local government system in our capital city by, <Col N="803" /> on the one hand, making it more local, democratic and accountable and on the other, by ensuring that issues with metropolitan-wide significance are looked at in that way, and by having structures which facilitate and encourage such an approach.</P>
    <P>I would also like to put on the record of the House my appreciation to all of those who have been involved in the reorganisation process in the Dublin area, from the elected members to the managers, and to local authority officials who have co-operated fully in the transition process and without whose goodwill and hard work the process could not have been brought to the satisfactory stage now reached.</P>
    <P>In commending the Bill to the House I look forward to the contributions from all sides and I hope we will be able to conclude our work here in time to meet the establishment deadline.  I trust that will not put too great an onus on my colleagues who have to facilitate those developments through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill before us today effectively abolishes County Dublin, and as one born and bred in these parts of Ireland I find it rather strange that we in this House are abolishing County Dublin. I am not sure whether Dubliners realise that that is what we are about today, but in effect that is the case.  No longer will the concept of County Dublin exist. Many who consider themselves to be &ldquo;Dubs&rdquo; or living in County Dublin will now be living in County Fingal or County Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown or South Dublin County.  I am glad the Minister referred to the mechanism he has provided for revising the names if that should be the wish of the people and the elected members in the relevant areas.  I believe most of the names are unacceptable at this stage.  From representations made to me I am of the view that people would like to keep the title Dublin in all of the three new counties.  In other words, we would have Dublin Fingal, Dublin Belgard and, perhaps, Dublin Dún Laoghaire, but that is for others to decide <Col N="804" /> on another occasion.  However, as we are making history today by relegating County Dublin to the history books, those who will be most affected by it should have a say.  I welcome their involvement in the process of deciding what their new county shall be called and whether they are satisfied with the provisional titles of the three new counties which are in the Bill before us.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for the division of the administrative county of Dublin into three administrative counties to be known respectively as County of South Dublin &mdash; this is a misnomer, whatever about West Dublin.  It also creates enormous confusion in regard to Dáil constituency nomenclature, among other things.  However, such as they are, these are the new titles &mdash; the County of South Dublin, the County of Fingal and the County of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown.  It also provides for the establishment of a council for each of these new counties and various other related matters to which the Minister has referred.</P>
      <P>I believe many people will experience an identity crisis, initially at least, when they realise what we are doing today. People were thinking in terms of three new local authorities taking on the local government functions in the Dublin area. They had not really considered that we are actually abolishing County Dublin.  A question I was asked last night and could not really answer for example, concerned John O'Leary and Brian Mullins, who now find themselves living in County Fingal.  Would they be eligible to play for the Dublin team?  I do not know.  Are they still to be called &ldquo;Dubs&rdquo;?  When this legislation is enacted they will wake up and find they are no longer &ldquo;Dubs&rdquo;; they are &ldquo;County Fingalians&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>However, we will not go down that road at this stage.  That is an interesting discussion for another day. The identity crisis will be quite acute and when the public realise what we are actually doing they will have far more to <Col N="805" /> contribute to this debate generally.  There will be postal address changes as a result of this legislation and the allegiance to the county of one's birth or adoption will be gone with the stroke of a pen.  People now find that they belong to a county such as County Fingal that hitherto did not exist.  This issue will be much bigger than what we have given consideration to up to now.</P>
      <P>There are serious financial implications in this legislation for Dublin Corporation, particularly in the proposal to transfer land, land banks and housing stock to the new council in which the land and the housing stock might find themselves situated.  These implications for the corporation include its ability to provide adequate land in its own functional area in the future to meet the housing needs within the city, with a housing list of over 5,000 facing it at the moment. Dublin Corporation will find that Tallaght, Clondalkin and Blanchardstown, for example, will be removed from the city housing stock allocation.  The need for compensation for the loss of this housing stock, the rental income and land costs and the general eroding of the financial base needs to be examined in far greater detail.  While it is appropriate in a Second Stage debate to point out my concerns in this area, I hope the Minister will be able to indicate on Committee Stage what arrangements will be put in place.  It is not sufficient to say we will transfer responsibility for this area to the new managerial committee or to some subcommittee to decide on how best this can be put in place.  Before enacting the Bill we need to know that adequate provisions for compensation will be in place. There is no point in making provisions if the new local authority cannot afford to meet the demands for compensation.  We need to know where the funding for compensation will come from.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present cumulative deficit of Dun Laoghaire Borough Council and Dublin County Council is, I understand, in the area of £22 million.  How will that liability be divided up between the three new county councils?  We need to know the Minister's views in this regard.  This must <Col N="806" /> have been thought out in the pre-planning stage during the fine preparatory work that has been done up to now to get us to this point.  What will happen the £22 million deficit?  If it is divided equally among the three new local authorities, how will they be in a position to compensate Dublin Corporation for the massive loss of its land bank and housing stock?  We need to know the Minister's precise thinking in this area and how this will be achieved.</P>
    <P>In the explanatory memorandum and indeed in the Bill itself minor boundary changes are mentioned.  The only controversial one, I am advised, is the proposed adjustments in the boundary between Dún Laoghaire/Rathdown and the South Dublin County.  This will divide a parish, albeit along the lines of existing wards, and in fact will divide a housing estate into two different counties &mdash; part of the estate will be in County Dún Laoghaire/Rathdown and the other part will be in the South Dublin County.</P>
    <P>Under section 10 the commissioner may fix a boundary to avoid minor anomalies.  I would again urge the Minister when we reach Committee Stage to be in a position to indicate to the House how the type of anomaly to which I have referred will be addressed because it is a cause of concern for people living in this area and for the local electorate.  It is fine to say that the housing estate is now in two wards, the boundary of the wards going down the middle.  But those two wards are now in the one local authority. If the Minister is now going to make the middle of a housing estate the boundary between two local authorities, with perhaps service charges in one and not in the other or different rates of service charges in each one, he will cause friction and dissension and it is not advisable for the Minister to proceed with this.  Now is the time to ensure that this does not go ahead.</P>
    <P>Part IV deals with the list of what are referred to as consequential adjustments to various other bodies as a result of the abolition of Dublin County Council.</P>
    <P>The necessary changes in the relationship of the membership of the Eastern <Col N="807" /> Health Board are dealt with.  Apparently, no changes will ensue in relation to the vocational education committee structure that now exists.  Higher education grants, heretofore dealt with by Dublin County Council, will be dealt with by the three new county councils.  I note that a school attendance committee will continue to operate in the former Dún Laoghaire Borough.  Might I suggest that perhaps we need to look at the overall question of school attendance committees &mdash; I realise it may not be the direct responsibility of the Minister present &mdash; but could the Minister bring it to the attention of the Minister for Education, pointing out that the overall problem of truancy and school attendance is becoming a major one particularly in inner city and major urban areas nationwide?  Let us re-examine our overall school attendance procedures and regulations.  Rather than merely stating there will be no change, there is need for an overall debate on this issue on another day.</P>
    <P>I note also that the appointment of a member of the governing body of UCD is looked after, as is the overall issue of the coroner for the County Dublin area and consequential provisions in relation to the High Court and Circuit Court circuits, District Court areas, jury districts and courthouses.  I note that the provisions of section 30 will continue in force the existing arrangements which apply in relation to the enforcement of the Weights and Measures Acts and that those of section 31 will allow the three new councils to make joint arrangements in respect of the performance of functions under the Abattoirs Act, 1988.  The different aspects of that and the implementation of changes in this area will make for an interesting discussion on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 32 of Part V is perhaps one of the most important sections in that it deals with the overall area of horizontal co-ordination at regional level of all State agencies and services.  It introduces the whole concept of the need for a philosophy for Dublin embracing the entire <Col N="808" /> metropolitan region, which has been called for over many decades.  I must say that response has been very limited in relation to the urgent needs in this area.</P>
    <P>The Minister recently announced the establishment of regional authorities. Given the importance of the new structures we are debating today, in terms of their impact on the entire metropolitan area of Dublin side by side with this Bill we should be debating the Minister's concept of &ldquo;regional authority&rdquo;.  We should know today from the Minister what will be the functions and structure of the Dublin regional authority.  It is very difficult to accept the very radical Bill before us which, on the face of it, contains no detail in terms of what regional co-ordination will be put in place.  The Minister did refer to a certain aspect of it but elsewhere, not in this House &mdash; he has not developed his thinking in this House in any great detail &mdash; he gave his views on regional authorities.  I had hoped the Minister would have included such thinking in his introductory remarks but, in replying to Second Stage, would he please indicate clearly and in some detail his thinking on the role, structure and function of the regional authorities, particularly the Dublin regional authority?</P>
    <P>The division of Dublin County Council into three new functional authorities can only be successful, and will only be accepted by people who care about Dublin as our capital &mdash; if you like, as the engine that drives most of the rest of the country &mdash; if they can know the Minister's views in terms of this &ldquo;regional authority&rdquo;.  What we are talking about today will succeed only if we are quite sure what regional, co-ordinating structure the Minister has in mind.  I would ask the Minister to put on the record at the next possible opportunity &mdash; which I suspect will be his reply to Second Stage &mdash; his views in this area.  The Minister has spoken at various conferences, given a line here and there and most of us have put together a little bit, or have some idea of his thoughts, but the actual structure of the authority is extremely vague.  For example, when will the establishment <Col N="809" /> order be signed and on what date will that come into effect with the new local authorities?  On 1 January next?</P>

      <P>If it is to come into effect then, there is all the more need for us to have an opportunity to debate it in tandem with this Bill.  It is not acceptable to keep that from the House.  May I ask the Minister to assure the House that if we are not going to be able to debate the details of the Dublin regional authority side by side with this Bill the House will be given adequate debating time on the whole concept of regional authorities before the commencement date of 1 January next?  As we all know, time passes very quickly in this House when one is seeking to debate any issue.  I should have thought the ideal would have been perhaps a public announcement of the Minister's concept of regional authorities so that we could have discussed it along with our views on the division of Dublin County Council into three new local authorities.  Perhaps before Committee Stage we could have the details so that we might incorporate the Minister's thinking and discuss it with him.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the size of the Dublin metropolitan area and literally because of the number of other areas it embraces, even if we are talking only about the greater Dublin area, we are not talking about four local authorities. There are many who would contend that greater Dublin also takes in part of what will become the mid-east region, that is parts of Counties Kildare, Meath and Wicklow, the peripheral counties.  Therefore, no matter what way one describes the greater Dublin area &mdash; if you like, the commuter Dublin &mdash; it is essentially relevant to the Bill before us.  It would <Col N="810" /> be far easier to impose a regional structure on other areas &mdash; Cork will have its difficulties also since it is a very big metropolitan area &mdash; but the critical &ldquo;regional authority&rdquo; will be the authority structured for the greater Dublin area. Indeed, the most difficult work to be undertaken by any regional authority will be that to be undertaken by the Dublin regional authority.  Without being contentious in any way, before Committee Stage, I ask the Minister, either in this House or, as we have become used to now, &ldquo;elsewhere&rdquo;, to announce details of the regional authorities so that we could discuss them with him on Committee Stage.  This would be very relevant to the provisions of section 32, which provides for the co-ordination of the four Dublin local authorities.  It would then be very easy and in order for us to debate the Minister's concept of the Dublin regional authority which can then be transposed to the others.  I presume the same system will work in Dublin as elsewhere.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to give us this opportunity, because I do not think we will have another one, to discuss regional authorities or, if we do, it will be by way of statements for two hours some morning; it will not be a proper informed debate.</P>
      <P>In the explanatory and financial memorandum it is said that:</P>
      <P>Section 32 requires the three new county councils and Dublin Corporation in formulating policy and in implementing functional programmes to have regard to the interests of the combined functional areas of all the authorities and their inhabitants and to take all appropriate steps to ensure the co-ordination of relevant policies and programmes (including development plans)...</P>
      <P>I should particularly like to hear the Minister's views on development plans, as this is a very contentious area.  It was very contentious when there was only Dublin County Council&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is the type of question to which I would hope to receive a reply some time.  I will not hold my breath just now.  These are areas in respect of which we need answers to the greater questions that arise and on which we might have hoped for an elaboration in the Minister's introductory remarks.  We might have hoped that he would have developed his <Col N="812" /> philosophy, if you like, in respect of the greater Dublin area.  Rather, we got the nuts and bolts of the Bill.  We were told what will happen where and what will be abolished there.  We have read that and accept what the Minister is planning to do in that respect, but we are no wiser as to whether he has any philosophy for the greater Dublin area, whether he has any vision as to how he will co-ordinate the four local authorities that will henceforth be operating within what was formerly County Dublin or the remit of Dublin County Council.  That is what I really want to know.</P>
      <P>The Minister now tells me that there is provision to co-ordinate development plans under the provisions of section 32 of this Bill.  I hope I do not take from that that the Dublin regional authority will have no role to play in relation to the co-ordination of development plans.  I would like to think there is an overview that could draw together from the different functional areas what is best for the proper physical planning and land use requirements of Dublin for the decades ahead.  We want to know what the role and function of the Dublin regional authority will be.  It may be the final piece in the jigsaw that will make everything work and respond to the dozens of reports going back to 1910, to which the Minister referred in his speech, all of which are gathering dust on shelves somewhere.</P>

He should respond positively to the experts who have been crying out for change for the past seven or eight decades, and a regional concept of planning for greater Dublin and the country generally.  The regional authorities may respond to that or there may be a damp squib &mdash; some sort of sop to the EC and monitoring committees for the disbursement of Structural Funds but will <Col N="813" /> they have teeth?  Will they be regional authorities?</P>

      <P>Section 35, as well as the Third Schedule to the Bill, sets out arrangements for rationalisation of responsibilities for local authority dwellings and land in areas of the three new county councils in the city.  This is a most vexed area.  We will need details of the type of compensation afforded to Dublin Corporation for land they will have to cede to one of the new county councils and, indeed, for Clondalkin, Blanchardstown and Tallaght, other housing stock that apparently will now become the stock of the new local authority in which it is situated.  Please let us know, given the enormous £22 million deficit that will be divided among the three new local authorities, who will pay whom and from where the money will come?  At present there are 5,000 people in Dublin city on our housing lists.  Will there be a communal housing list?  How will people on transfer lists, who may wish to be transferred from one functional area to another when the Bill is enacted, be accommodated without a communal list? How will the whole housing problem be handled now that we have four local authorities looking after the housing needs of the Dublin Metropolitan area?  I would like to hear the Minister's views on what will happen in this area.</P>

If they will not all be compensated can the Minister tell us how Dublin Corporation's housing needs will be looked after?  The Minister's response may answer our question. Regarding financial implications I find it difficult to accept that there will be no additional staff costs.  That would also be the view of most staff in local authorities.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred to my concerns about the co-ordination of physical planning and how it could or could not be achieved.  For many decades proposals have been made and concerns expressed regarding the need for a regional dimension to development. In fact the Minister, in his contribution, referred to a number of reports and commissions, inquiries in 1880, in 1926 and 1938, White Papers and policy statements.  For over 100 years concern has been expressed about the reorganisation <Col N="815" /> of local government, particularly the regional dimension and the structure of the local government system in Dublin.  In 1930 it was thought that the Local Government Bill introduced then would solve the problem.  We will not know until we see the Minister's philosophy for the management of the greater Dublin Metropolitan area whether this will work.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that Seán Lemass, who had a great concern for the development of Dublin generally and before he became one of our better Ministers, speaking on the 1930 Local Government Bill in this House said:</P>
    <P>There has been consultation about this question for 20 years, but nothing has been done.  What is required is legislation power in the hands of some executive authority, so that the question can be properly dealt with...  If we want to secure that the growth of the city of Dublin will be properly regulated, we must have not merely a town planning authority, but around the city a belt of virgin land on which building has not yet begun and over which any development that takes place can be properly controlled.</P>
    <P>He went on at length giving his views in 1930 to the House.  Between 1911 and 1916, on visits to Dublin, Geddes preached regionalism and regional planning and its importance to the Dublin region. The Civics Institute of Ireland took up his message and the Dublin Reconstruction Committee under A.E. Aston in 1922 saw the necessity for the co-ordination of land use and infrastructure in and around Dublin.</P>
    <P>Almost annually for decades we have had experts telling the elected representatives at the time what was needed and urging us to concentrate on the problem but we did not do it.</P>

      <P>This is a most important Bill.  There are many problems in the detail of the Bill but these can be dealt with on Committee Stage.  Will the Minister please indicate his concept of a <Col N="817" /> regional authority which is essential for the success of this Bill?  Without the knowledge of that detail we can only give a lukewarm welcome to the Bill.  Dublin is the engine of the economic, social and cultural growth of our country.  Devolution is essential but, no matter what we do, it will be the metropolitan capital. It is very important both regionally and nationally.  For a long time, particularly since the rather controversial review of the county council development plan during the past year or two, there has been much focus on how we handle the proper planning and future development of our capital city and the entire metropolitan region.  The Minister will have whatever constructive help he needs from the Fine Gael Party and I am sure from the other Opposition parties.  I ask the Minister to seriously listen to any concerns and to take on board any constructive changes that may improve this Bill.  I urge him to think big when he is thinking about regional authorities and to ensure that he does not put a ring fence around what is now County Dublin and exclude commuter Dublin, which extends almost to Arklow on one side but certainly into Counties Wicklow, Kildare and Meath.</P>
      <P>It is essential to make this work. Dublin is a very important part of our country.  To introduce a Bill that promotes the abolition of County Dublin will be considered controversial by many people, but that is what we are doing. However, let us ensure that what we put in its place is worthy of replacing County Dublin.</P>

      <P>Those of us who are elected members of Dublin County Council recognise that not only is reform of local government necessary but in the case of Dublin County Council is imperative and urgent.  Because of the number wishing to contribute, the 78 Dublin county councillors have had the experience of waiting their turn to contribute and having to listen to endless repetition.  I am sure others will agree with that.</P>

      <P>Obviously, despite the excellent chairman who does not let anybody ramble on too long.</P>
      <P>I hope this Bill will be the start of a programme of devolution of functions, as proposed by the Barrington report, to a new, revitalised local government system, but I remain to be convinced. This Bill is not about reform as such but about re-organisation and management. In so far as it goes, I welcome aspects of the Bill, but other aspects need to be explained and amended.  This Bill will not address the fundamental issues of local government, but it will make life a bit more manageable.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to create three new administrative counties &mdash; Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, of which I am a member, Fingal and South Dublin.  It gives statutory effect to the transition arrangements we have arrived at following a great deal of discussion.  More discussion is needed.  I believe we should be open to further discussion and that we, as local authority members, should have the authority to be able to make decisions.  I am fearful that will not happen.</P>
      <P>The tone of the Bill suggests to me that the Minister still has a great deal of power, because he has retained power to provide by regulation for certain matters and a great deal of power is vested in the management and officials of each county. I believe the essential reform of local authorities is to give more power to the elected members, but obviously we need to debate this matter further.  I feel like the apocryphal passer-by whom the motorist asks for direction and who says: &ldquo;Well, if I was going there I would not start from here.&rdquo;  I feel a bit like that about Dublin County Council, but I will try to be a bit more open-minded about the &ldquo;there&rdquo; we are going to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finance is fundamental to any Bill dealing with local government, but I am afraid it gets only a mention at the very end of the memorandum, where it is stated &ldquo;There will be some initial cost for <Col N="819" /> the three new county councils in the startup phase but this should be marginal in the context of overall expenditure.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have a few words to say about finance in relation to Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown. If we are to talk about local government there should be some discussion about the vexed area of financing local authorities. Because this Bill deals with re-organisation rather than reform, it unfortunately avoids the issue.  On Committee Stage we will concentrate on some of these issues and perhaps the Minister will give an opinion on how he feels we should deal with the many strains on the local authority purse.</P>
    <P>It is not expected that there will be any increase in overall staff numbers.  That may be so, but the statement that &ldquo;no increase in Exchequer funding will arise as a result of any additional staff costs&rdquo; makes me quake.  Both the Minister and I know how difficult it is to find money &mdash; indeed, he finds it difficult himself &mdash; but those involved in local authorities find it dreadfully difficult to get anything done because the money is not there to do it.</P>
    <P>I concur with my colleague Deputy Doyle's views on regional authorities. We had a very interesting meeting between members of Dublin County Council and Dublin Corporation, but it was evident that nobody was aware exactly what was proposed for regional authorities. In the context of this Bill we need to know what the Minister proposes with regard to regional authorities and we need to know how it is proposed they will operate because we have all sorts of misconceptions about them.  Misinformation arises when there is a lack of information and the Minister should address this lack of information on regional authorities.</P>
    <P>I will comment in general before returning to a number of specific issues. Section 3 provides power for the Minister to make regulations and subsection (7) states: &ldquo;The Minister may by regulation do anything which appears to be necessary...&rdquo;. That seems to be all encompassing.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;describing debate within the county council as a dialogue of the deaf.  I take great exception to that because I believe that with the new county council areas we will have good debate.  If somebody is serious enough to put themselves forward for election to the local authority, he or she should be taken seriously and given the responsibility. Otherwise, what is the point?  I am not interested in going to county council meetings and contributing to the debate, knowing that I might as well have stayed at home or indeed that I would have been better off to send a press release to the newspapers.</P>
      <P>Section 6 deals with executive powers. Barrington says that too much power resides with the Executive and that true democracy entails giving more power to the elected councillors.  I certainly would go down that road with Barrington.  In section 11 (3) it is a bit uncertain who will decide when the annual meeting of each county council established under the Bill will take place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I thought that might be the answer.  The Minister will decide <Col N="821" /> a great deal of what we are doing.  Section 12 (3) says: &ldquo;The first meeting of each of the councils established by section 11 shall be held on such day as shall be fixed by the Minister...&rdquo;.  We may let the Minister do that, but could we not have the freedom to decide?</P>
      <P>I now come to Part III of the Bill. Deputy Doyle alluded already to this.  It will be a bit like a county council meeting with all the repetition.  There is concern about the boundaries and where the dividing line separates estates there will be difficulties, but perhaps they could be dealt with through the county council. I would not like the discretionary lines delineated at present to be written in stone if local councillors believe a problem may arise.  Perhaps the Minister might be willing to discuss that at a later stage.</P>
      <P>Section 18 of Part IV deals with the Eastern Health Board.  I am concerned about the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown area and I am sure I am <i>ad idem</i> with my colleague, Deputy Gilmore, in regard to this matter.  We are concerned about the provisions of section 18 because, for example, if each council appointed three members to the Eastern Health Board the proportional representation would be peculiar.  For example, Wicklow County Council's proportional representation would be one representative to 43,000 people whereas our representation would be one representative to approximately 68,000.  An anomoly exists in that regard and there should be equality of representation. A difficulty also arises in relation to representation in the Dublin Corporation area <i>vis-à-vis</i> other county council areas and I would like that matter considered further on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter of vocational education committees has received a good deal of discussion recently.  A peculiar anomaly exists in relation to Dún Laoghaire because of the existence of the Dún Laoghaire Vocational Education Committee. The provisions of the legislation provide that the existing Dublin Vocational Education Committee and Borough of Dún Laoghaire Vocational Education Committee shall continue to <Col N="822" /> operate and existing members shall continue to hold office.  Members of other county councils are concerned that councillors who continue to be members of vocational education committee boards will not be representative of, say, the political persuasion of the new county councils.  I have no concern in that regard, but the matter has been brought to my attention.  The proper way to address the matter would be to set up a local education authority in each county council area.  A Green Paper on Education is being prepared at present and, hopefully, a White Paper will follow but, notwithstanding the publication of those papers, there is a widely held view that following the next local elections a local education authority should be set up in each county council area.  However, it is appropriate that we should await the publication of the Green Paper on Education before pressing the matter further.</P>
    <P>Section 21 provides that a school attendance committee will continue to operate in the former Dún Laoghaire Borough area and that existing members will continue to hold office.  I came to this House by a circuitous route.  I started my career as a teacher and career guidance counsellor before going into business and I hold a firm view in respect of school attendance.  It is vital that all areas should have a school attendance officer.  At one stage it was proposed to appoint school welfare officers, which would be very welcome.  In this regard, the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown area should encompass one area, not just the Dún Laoghaire Borough area.  Local authorities need funding.  It is most unsatisfactory that at present the Garda should have to deal with the matter of school attendance.  That puts an unfair burden on gardaí and it is an area in which they are not trained.  At present truants are not receiving proper welfare care.  The Minister should discuss this matter with the Minister for Education and regardless of whether local authorities receive funding or the Department of Education deal with the matter, it should be dealt with urgently.</P>
    <P>The Garda deal also with the matter <Col N="823" /> of weights and measures referred to in section 30 of the Bill.  The onus in that regard should be on the three local authorities, but that matter can be dealt with in more detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Part V deals with a range of miscellaneous matters relating to Dublin local authorities.  The legislation states that managers must put in place procedural and organisational arrangements to facilitate co-ordination and the authorities must have regard to any strategy or statement of the Dublin or mid-east regional authority which are to be established by order under the Local Government Act, 1991.  Will the Minister tease out that matter at the end of this debate? What exactly does the Minister propose in this regard?  In which direction is he heading?</P>
    <P>Section 33 will empower the new county councils to repair branch water pipes.  Another peculiar anomoly exists in my area in that regard.  Dún Laoghaire and Dublin corporations used the enabling legislation to assume responsibility for water service pipes in the city area to within nine inches of the curtilage of premises.  Because of the type of difficulties with which I have had to deal on behalf of constituents outside the Dún Laoghaire Corporation area, the words &ldquo;a principal authority shall do&rdquo; might be more appropriate than the words &ldquo;may do&rdquo; in that section.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to section 23 which deals with county cororners.  I heard a brief interview on the &ldquo;Gay Byrne Hour&rdquo; some time ago with the county cororner who stated that he has no facilities whatever.  He does not have a telephone or typewriter not to mention an assistant to type his reports.  He has to avail of the facilities of the city cororner. That should not be the case and I ask the Minister to examine the matter.</P>
    <P>Section 39 deals with regulations in relation to the borough area and is somewhat vague.  I would like the Minister to give this matter more attention.  Under this section we may be able to facilitate the provision of school meals.  In the borough, school meals are provided whereas <Col N="824" /> in the county they are not.  This type of anomaly should not exist.  We are now starting a new county area and there should be uniformity in the provision of services.  It would not be helpful in legislation to underline the divide in a totally new area.  There has already been some degree of tension between those who are part of the old borough of Dún Laoghaire and those who are part of the greater Rathdown area.  I ask the Minister to consider this.</P>
    <P>There is great concern about the financing of local government and I hope we will have an opportunity to debate that issue in the future.  All councillors are concerned about the financing of local authorities.  The new county councils on 1 January next, unlike new businesses set up and well financed to do business effectively, will start off with a burden of debt.  We already know of the difficulties involved in financing local authorities and this is an opportunity to wipe the slate clean and start anew.  A business person would hate to start in business from a debit balance.  One would like to start at least on level ground if not actually in credit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a debt of £22 million between the three of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the reality and while it might be unrealistic to ask for that debt to be wiped out, the problem underscores the difficulties in funding local authorities. It is unreal to say that there are no financial implications in the restructuring because apart from the debts, costs are involved.  In the case of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown there is the cost of merging two systems, a cost which the county has not taken on voluntarily but which has been forced on it.  A case can be made for trying to find a way to finance setup costs generally over a period.  This process can be costed and I do not believe it would be outrageous.  Management in the counties would probably be in a position to give those costings, and funding should be made available for general reorganisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have already referred to difficulties <Col N="825" /> in cases where some areas are charged rates and others are not.  There is not just a difficulty because of divisions between counties.  In Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown the difficulty will be between the old borough area and the existing Rathdown area.  A gesture has been made towards solving that problem but, without doubt, there will be a cost in regard to rate remission.</P>
    <P>There is great concern also about the extra municipal area for which the city has been responsible which cost something in the region of £700,000.  It has generally been agreed that that sum is not enough.  More funds must be made available.  I have asked the Minister to look at devolving functions before devolving powers to the local authorities. He knows that without the finance to back this up there is no point in getting the powers.  I would not waste my time seeking further powers for local authorities unless I was convinced that there will be some finance to back it up.  In Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, for instance, there is a very low rate support grant, so we will just have to sit down with the Minister and find out exactly what he wants to do in relation to this.</P>
    <P>I will table amendments to this Bill which is not about reform but about reorganisation. In general a great job has been done by the elected members and the management and officials of the various areas.  We should build on that work but we cannot expect officials to work miracles in relation to funding.  There must be genuine co-operation between the Minister, the Department and the local authorities so that funding is properly addressed.</P>
    <P>In relation to the SIPTU merger it was acknowledged that mergers require funding which was provided through ESF funding.  With more imagination much more could be achieved in the area of local government financing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is about the reorganisation of local government in Dublin county but it must be looked at in the context of the reorganisation and reform of local government generally.  As <Col N="826" /> this Bill springs directly from the 1991 legislation it would be appropriate for us to look at how the Government is faring with the programme of local government reform it promised.  Notwithstanding the fine statements issued on a regular basis by the Minister, and his Ministers of State, that the process of local government reform is proceeding, despite the fact that most of those involved in local government do not see any great evidence of this, a critical examination of the Government's record shows that what is happening in practice falls far short of what was promised.</P>
      <P>The local elections that were due to be held in 1990 were postponed for a year to allow the process of local government reform to proceed.  In 1991 the Local Government Act was passed.  In many respects that is fine legislation.  However, it was rushed through the House and not subjected to the critical examination this House should have been allowed to carry out.  For example, the titles of the new county councils in Dublin were never examined on Committee Stage.  As a result one of the councils is now known as South Dublin County Council when it is responsible for west Dublin or, at best, south-west Dublin.  This gives rise to confusion. This would not have happened if the House had been enabled in 1991 to debate the legislation in a proper fashion and examine it critically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1991 Act provided for the indefinite postponement of elections at municipal level, that is, the urban councils and town commissioners.  At the conference of the Association of Municipal Authorities last year the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, announced that elections would be held next June and that a Government committee had been established to reorganise local government at that level.  The first thing that should be said is that the holding of elections in 1994 to bodies last elected in 1985 hardly constitutes good local government reform.  It does not say much for the Government's zeal in reforming local government that elections to local bodies have been postponed for a period of time &mdash; an interval of nine years &mdash; which <Col N="827" /> constitutes double the normal lifespan of those bodies.</P>
    <P>We have not heard from this subcommittee since, even though it was to examine the question of the way in which local government at that level should be reorganised, whether the municipal authorities should continue essentially as urban authorities, as I believe they should, or whether the recommendation contained in the Barrington report that wider district authorities should be established should be implemented.  It is a matter of regret, that in opening the debate today the Minister did not give us a wider view of his position on the question of local government reform.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I honestly expected him to put the position in Dublin in context in terms of local government reform and outline the up to date position in regard to the municipal authorities.</P>
      <P>I also expected him to make a statement on the question of local government funding.  The Barrington Commission was precluded from examining this question. Successive Governments have failed not only to provide adequate finance for local government but also to face up to the financial problems facing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that the biggest problem facing local authorities is the lack of finance.  This dates back to the time domestic rates were abolished.  At that time they were promised that the shortfall would be made up by a grant in lieu of domestic rates, but this has not happened in practice.  Under the 1983 Financial Provisions Act the &ldquo;one for one&rdquo; link between the grant in lieu of domestic rates and the sum collected in domestic rates was broken.  The sum now made available bears no relationship to what they would have collected in rates. It amounts, depending on the local authority, to between £4 and £6 out of every £10 that they would have collected. Indeed, it is no longer known as the grant in lieu of domestic rates but rather the rate support grant.  This confirms that it <Col N="828" /> is no longer the intention to make up the shortfall.</P>
    <P>A study was also carried out by the Institute of Fiscal Studies, but we have heard nothing from them either since then.  No substantial statement has been issued by the Government about where it stands on the question of local authority funding since the report of the Institute of Fiscal Studies was presented.</P>
    <P>Legislation on local government is welcome, but making fine flowery statements at conferences and seminars are no substitute for real local government reform. What the people are looking for is a system of local government under which they would have control over their own environment and the way in which their local communities are run and under which local services would be delivered efficiently.  Unfortunately, because of the financial crisis the system for the efficient delivery of services such as refuse collection, water supply and regular maintenance works is breaking down.  Indeed the idea of new works to be carried out by the local authorities now belongs to the history books.  As a consequence the public will continue to lose confidence in local government.  All the legislative measures are no substitute for resources. The Government has failed to deal with that problem and I am very disappointed that the Minister made no reference to this.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Devolution&rdquo; is one of the buzz words used by the Government, whose performance in this area has been phony. Despite the fact that the then Minister made the finest of speeches when the 1991 Act was introduced in the House, many of its fine provisions have not yet been implemented.  For example, those sections under which local authorities will be allowed to establish committees and joint committees to involve the community have not yet been implemented. As a result, if my own local authority, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, decide to establish a joint committee in conjunction with Bray Urban Council to deal with a particular problem, it cannot be established on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="829" /> What are we getting instead?  Periodically, press releases are issued by the Minister and his Ministers of State in which the new functions to be devolved to local government are listed.  On the one hand meaningless functions are being devolved to local government, but on the other their real powers are being hauled back into the Department of the Environment. In the Planning Act, for example, the rights of local communities to lodge objections to planning applications have been greatly restricted, while in the Roads Act significant powers of the local authorities have been transferred to the National Roads Authority. In this regard a motion due to be taken at the meeting of Dublin County Council next Monday calls on the Minister not to proceed with the proposal to toll the ring road around Dublin, a project that has been dear to his heart for many years. Until the passing of the Roads Act that power was a reserved function of the elected members of Dublin County Council.  It is no longer a function of the members of Dublin County Council but of the National Roads Authority.  For all the talk about devolving powers on local government, here is a practical example of a power which elected members had until a few months ago that has now been taken from them, so that the elected members are now reduced to being petitioners petitioning the Minister not to proceed with the tolling of that road.</P>
    <P>The same position obtains in regard to the way the Department of the Environment exercises its supervisory functions over local government.  It now seems to be the practice not to provide the money for any project funded through the Department of the Environment if the local authority does not carry it out the way the Department wants.  There is an example of that in my own constituency, what is known as the Church Road extension, where for a number of reasons the land take is not sufficient to justify building a dual carriageway. A debate has been going on between the local authority and the Department of the Environment for two years about the design of that road.  The <Col N="830" /> local authority wants a single lane road incorporating cycle lanes while the Department of the Environment wants a four lane road.  The latest communication from the Department of the Environment is to the effect that if the local authority does not carry out the project to the Department's specifications, it will not get the money.</P>
    <P>That is not devolving power to local government; it is wielding the big stick and making a mockery of the way local government functions.  This is a two-handed approach to local government, with fine public statements about devolution of functions and reform of local government; but in practice the proper functions of local government are being more and more centralised.  Unless there is an end to that, unless power, budgets and money are restored to local authorities, there will be no real reform of local government.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us arises from the 1991 Act, which provided that we would have in Dublin city a council and three county councils.  At the time my view was that that was not the best way to re-organise local government in Dublin.  I felt that the three authorities would be too big and that a better option would have been to have ten to 12 smaller local authorities serving populations of 50,000 to 100,000 people.  I make the point now simply to put it on record because, given all that has happened, it is probably just of historical significance.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the reservations about the format for the re-organisation of local government in Dublin, the management and members of the new Dublin County Council, which was elected in June 1991, proceeded promptly along the lines of the 1991 regulation, which in many ways put the initiative back in the hands of the three area managers and of the elected members.  It is to the credit of the elected members &mdash; and I am a member of Dublin County Council myself &mdash; that it proceeded quickly to devolve on the area committees the reserved functions of Dublin County Council, that the area managers produced their re-organisation report within <Col N="831" /> the six months provided for in the Bill and that an enthusiastic approach was taken by management and members of the county council to get on with the re-organisation.</P>
    <P>I understand, of course, that the production of legislation does take time; but I am concerned that although the re-organisation report was submitted 12 months ago we are only now, within the last two months of the life of the present county council and Dún Laoghaire Borough Council, debating the legislation on the re-organisation.  It would have helped if we had had a longer period of time to debate the legislation.  I hope that when we come to deal with this in committee there will not be an attempt to guillotine it.  The 1991 legislation lost significantly because of the attempt to rush it.</P>
    <P>There are a number of things in the Bill that I welcome, but I want to highlight a number of areas I am concerned about. First, continuing the theme of the phoneyness of the devolution of powers, I want to draw attention to the extent to which this legislation is peppered with references to ministerial powers and authority to override and oversee the new local authorities being established in Dublin.  In section 3, for example, there is a whole range of powers given to the Minister for the Environment to make regulations for the general purposes of this Act in relation to any specific provision of the Act and in relation to any class or classes of local authorities.  There is a wide ranging sweep up power whereby in any area, in any respect, the Minister for the Environment can make regulations and change regulations as he sees fit, effectively overriding the local authority.</P>
    <P>That is not devolving powers on local authorities.  Children in a kindergarten would have more autonomy from their nanny than the Minister is proposing to give the county councils.  It is the same story in section 6 (4), which provides that the Minister may give to the relevant local authorities and the managers, including the area managers of those <Col N="832" /> authorities, such general or particular directions in relation to the execution of or compliance with any provision of this Act or regulations thereunder etc.  In plain language, the Minister for the Environment can tell the councils or their managers what to do.</P>
    <P>I intend to table some amendments to these sections.  The Minister will have to make up his mind that powers and authorities are being devolved on local authorities so that the elected members of local authorities and their managers can work out their own relationships and get on with their job, subject to the law, without the Minister telling them what to do.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the continuing power that Ministers have to abolish local authorities, to simply wind them up if they do not strike a rate or for whatever other reason, should be brought to an end.  At the very least provisions for the dissolution or the standing down of a local authority should only be exercised here in this House.</P>
    <P>The theme of continuity is strong in this legislation.  There seems to be an undercurrent in the legislation that although Dublin county is being re-organised into three new county councils, things will continue as they were before.  We find references to, for example, the school attendance committees and school meals services in the context of the borough area.  Even though the borough is being abolished, the borough area will remain as an idea in this Bill because they cannot bring themselves to move that one step further and say that if children in Loughlinstown who are now in the borough get school meals, children across the road from them in Ballybrack who are in the county should also be entitled to school meals.  That is having one's cake and eating it.  In theory the Minister wants to set up a new county council, but in practice he wants to keep everything as it is.  If county councils are reorganised matters cannot stay as they are.  The idea of the borough area must go.  The same rules should apply for school meals, <Col N="833" /> school attendances and other services throughout the county.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Keogh's point in relation to representation on bodies, particularly representation on the Eastern Health Board.  Having only three representatives of the new county councils on the Eastern Health Board is not sufficient. Deputy Keogh quoted the figure of one representative per 68,000 population in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown area.  I understand the position is somewhat similar in the other two county council areas but the figures for Wicklow is one representative per 43,000 population and in Kildare it is one representative per 32,000 population.  The new county councils should not be disproportionately disadvantaged <i>vis-à-vis</i> the other counties who have representation on the Eastern Health Board. On Committee Stage I will seek an increase in such representation.  I am glad that the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown county council will have representation on the governing body of UCD.  I am sure my colleague who will be representing the other two counties will ask why they have not been given representation on that governing body.</P>

      <P>It is standard practice that most local authorities have representation on that governing body.  We will take two places on that body if the local authority Deputy Rabbitte represents does not wish to avail of its representation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not proposed that the new authority will have its own vocational education committee.  New education legislation is proposed but we do not know what will be included in it.  We do not know if there will be vocational education committees.  It is prudent to work on the basis of what exists.  I understand for administrative and management reasons that it might not be advisable to immediately establish a vocational education committee in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown.  However, a time <Col N="834" /> limit should be introduced to provide that, with effect from the next local elections, the new authorities in the three counties will be enabled to appoint their own vocational education committees.  In the meantime new education legislation may be introduced which may change that scenario, but that may not be the case and we must provide for that.</P>
    <P>I welcome the transfer of responsibility in respect of housing lands to the new county councils.  I welcome also the ending of the extra municipal areas the absurdity endured by people living in those areas.  For example, if a water leak occurred on the main road outside one's house, the householder was responsible for the repair and that person had to get an instruction from the county council to carry out the repair and apply for a road opening licence to carry out the work.  I am pleased the extra municipal area idea is at an end and that responsibility will be transferred to the new county councils.  I agree with Deputy Keogh that there is a financial implication involved.  It is clear that Dublin Corporation was underspending in the extra municipal area and the new local authority in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown area will inherit a wornout system of water supply in that extra municipal area.  Some financial recognition must be given to compensate for that.</P>
    <P>In the context of the legislation, a case must be made for the new Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  It is the only authority where two local authorities are being merged.  That has not happened at this level in this way before.  Dún Laoghaire Corporation and Dublin County Council will be abolished and there will be a merger of two bodies. Much work has been undertaken by members and management to resolve matters.  I wish to emphasise the difficulties this merger will give rise to.  In relation to how the authorities transact business, there are different standing orders, practices and administrative systems.  For example, there are different schemes of letting priorities in the housing area, different rent schemes and different approaches to land banks, the <Col N="835" /> management of land and to development plans.</P>
    <P>There are two different commercial rates.  There is provision in the legislation to converge them over a period of five years.  That has a financial implication for businesses whose rates will increase faster than they would normally have increased during the five year period. This also has an implication for the local authority as it will not be collecting the full amount of money because of the convergence period.  There are two different approaches to service charges: Dún Laoghaire borough has water charges and Dublin County Council does not have those charges.  The new Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council will not get off to a credible start with the public if one of its first measures is to increase the commercial rates for businesses in one part of the county and impose new charges for householders in another part of the county who hitherto have not been burdened with such charges.  Some of the convergence problems can be dealt with by the local authority but some must be recognised by the Minister and assistance must be provided to deal with them.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the debit balances which have accumulated between Dún Laoghaire Corporation and Dublin County Council and amount to £22 million.  We cannot expect the three new county councils to get off to a proper start if from day one they are saddled with such debt.  In the case of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council it is also saddled with the problems of trying to converge differing systems.</P>
    <P>At the end of the explanatory memorandum reference is made to finance.  I hope it is more than a passing reference. If finance is not provided to enable the new authorities to get off the ground the result will be disastrous.  There is much precedent of cases where public bodies on being reorganised and merged are given finance to enable them carry out their work.  Deputy Keogh referred to trade union mergers where finance was <Col N="836" /> provided.  In the private sector when B &amp; I was bought out its losses were written off and the amount of money involved was considerably more than is involved here.  Where bodies were merged to provide a more efficient service finance was made available to facilitate such mergers.</P>
    <P>The Barrington report recommended that in addition to the setting up of the new county councils a new tier of district authorities should be established in Dublin.  I understand a map setting out the boundaries of the new authorities, and their memberships, was included in the report.  I am disappointed the Minister did not refer to this report in his speech.  We have not heard about those proposed Dublin district authorities for some time.  I appreciate priority has been given to introduce this legislation and set up the county councils before proceeding to deal with the establishment of such district authorities.  However, if local government reform in Dublin is to mean anything the proposed district authorities must be established.  The Minister should indicate when it is proposed to establish them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which is significant.  This is an important day when we are discussing the break-up of Dublin County Council and the creation of three new councils, Fingal, South Dublin and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown. That clearly demonstrates the increase in population in Dublin and the necessity to continue to streamline local government procedures in view of that considerable increase in population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a member of Dublin City Council I am not directly affected by this Bill, but I will take an overall Dublin view of local government reform.  I welcome this Bill. There is no doubt that, despite the best efforts of very good chairpersons, Dublin County Council procedures are chaotic. I understand from many members of Dublin County Council that motions tabled are very often not reached and become irrelevant in the course of time. Perhaps that position has changed recently, but there is no doubt that <Col N="837" /> Dublin County Council needs to be streamlined with a view to making it more efficient.  There is a need for the efficient provision of local government services by these three new county councils.</P>
    <P>Many Members referred to the overall programme of local government reform. There is no doubt that local government reform is needed, and this Bill is a step in that direction.  Many local authority members believe it is unsatisfactory that every major decision &mdash; and indeed many minor decisions &mdash; require the sanction of the Minister for the Environment.  The Minister initiated a programme of local government reform, outlining general principles, and we need to proceed without delay in that regard.  Local government is important in a liberal democracy such as ours.  It is an important tier in the democratic system.</P>
    <P>In a united Europe it is very important that communities identify with Government structures, particularly local government structures.  That certainly is not the case at present.  There is a love-hate relationship between citizens and their immediate local government structure, which is probably due to the fact that there have not been reforms.  It is important, therefore, that the programme of local government reform is implemented.  More powers should be given to the democratically elected members.  The whole question of finance also needs to be examined.  Of fundamental importance to the whole question of local government reform is the financing of local government structures. That matter could be debated at length although it probably does not arise under the terms of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I will deal generally with the economy of Dublin, the fact that Dublin is perceived to have a regional problem and is losing out in terms of employment and job creation, a very relevant issue in the context of local government.  The new local authorities with Dublin Corporation and Dublin City Council must take a much more active role in promoting the economic development of their areas.  Many submissions are made by groups such as the Dublin Chamber <Col N="838" /> of Commerce, the Dublin City Centre Business Association and so on regarding the economic situation in Dublin.  Statistics prove that there is a higher unemployment rate in Dublin than in many other regions of the country.  We need to promote our areas and encourage development in Dublin city and county. Many issues are raised from time to time in this regard such as the question of direct flights to Dublin, a matter which does not arise under this Bill.  This question has been dealt with and that is to be welcomed.  Another welcome step is the decision to locate EC agencies in Dublin. Provisions have been brought forward in the National Development Plan in relation to a national convention centre to serve Dublin city and county and indeed the county as a whole.  That measure is also welcome.  The three new local authorities and the corporation in general need greater tax incentives, more funding for housing renewal and greater resources to combat crime, a problem particularly relevant to the Dublin area. Dublin city and county also experiences particular transport problems and greater resources are needed to deal with these.</P>
    <P>I will now refer to the question of the role of the Lord Mayor of Dublin and the title of the new councils being established today.  I understand from the Bill that the title of chairpersons of the new councils will be &ldquo;Cathaoirleach&rdquo;.  I have always believed that the Lord Mayor of the Dublin should play a major role in promoting the economic development of the city. Due to the centralised system of economic development in this country, the office of Lord Mayor is under-utilised.  I found from experience that foreign investment in particular can be attracted through the office of the Lord Mayor. The office is highly respected in the United States and in the Far East where the title seems to have a major significance and certainly opens doors which would not be otherwise opened.  I have always called for greater use of the office of Lord Mayor of Dublin.  The Cathaoirleach of these new bodies should play a greater and more active role in promoting economic development of their areas. <Col N="839" /> They should take a hands-on approach, liaising with central Government organisations to bring about economic development.</P>
    <P>Obviously everyone in Ireland understands the terms &ldquo;Cathaoirleach&rdquo;, &ldquo;Taoiseach&rdquo; and &ldquo;Tánaiste&rdquo;, although recently the British Prime Minister had difficulty with the pronunciation of the word &ldquo;Tánaiste&rdquo;.  Perhaps we should revert to the term &ldquo;Ard Mhaor&rdquo;, or use the Irish term for the title of chairpersons of these new bodies and when travelling abroad a more familiar English term could be used if necessary.  I ask the Minister to consider that matter.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the development of the Temple Bar area in the context of increased involvement by local authorities in economic development.  Dublin Corporation identified the potential development of the Temple Bar area as a cultural centre, a left bank so to speak, and brought forward a development plan for the area.  I was fortunate to chair the committee set up by the Government to put forward recommendations for the balanced development of the Temple Bar area.  When the report was produced it had to be handed over to central Government; local government did not have the power to implement many of the recommendations. I congratulate the Government on seizing this initiative and bringing forward legislation to establish various companies to promote the Temple Bar area.  Despite some begrudgery, this initiative has proved very successful.  It is an example of what can be achieved when a determined effort is made by central Government in association with the local authorities. However, in the context of further local government reform, it should have been possible to deal with this development at local authority level.  This demonstrates the need for the further devolution of powers to local government.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to transport in the greater Dublin area.  Obviously, this issue will be of concern to the three new councils. At present, manufacturing in the greater Dublin area, particularly in <Col N="840" /> Dublin city, is in decline.  One of the reasons is the decline in the role of Dublin Port, as a result of inadequate access to the port.  This issue is now under consideration and I understand that the Dublin Transportation Initiative is examining an access route for Dublin Port. Indeed, provision has been made in the National Development Plan for a port access route.</P>
    <P>Three options are under consideration &mdash; the northern section from Belfast, through Whitehall and into the north port, an east-west tunnel and a designated truck line along the Royal Canal railway line.  There is no doubt in my mind about the option the DTI should choose &mdash; the northern section from Belfast through Whitehall and into the north port.  I would have favoured the entire port access and eastern relief route but, unfortunately, decisions taken have ruled out this option.  Many residential areas on the north side of the city are plagued by massive levels of commercial traffic which should not have to travel through these areas.  I hope that the DTI will opt for the port access route from Belfast, through Whitehall and into the north port.  This access route to the port will improve the environment in many residential areas, particularly those on the north side of the city.</P>
    <P>The disposal of waste and waste management are very controversial issues in the greater Dublin area at present. Dublin County Council has plans to develop a tiphead at Kill, County Kildare.  These plans are at present before An Board Pleanála for decision and I understand there will be an oral hearing shortly.  The people in Finglas who live adjacent to the Dunsink tiphead are fed up with the present situation.  The lifespan of the Dunsink tiphead has long since passed and the people of Dublin have nowhere to dispose of their rubbish. This is a very serious issue.  The development of a tiphead at Kill is the only option open to Dublin County Council.  It is vitally important that this matter is dealt with as a matter of urgency.  Obviously, the planning process has to run its course, but I ask the Minister to play an active <Col N="841" /> role in this issue.  Obviously, I am not asking him to get involved in the planning process but he should pay more attention to the serious problem of waste disposal in Dublin, issue guidelines and become more active in dealing with this problem if planning permission is not given for the development of a tiphead at Kill, County Kildare.</P>
    <P>As a member of Dublin Corporation, obviously I regret the transfer of responsibility for the land bank and housing stock in County Dublin to the new councils.  Nevertheless, it is for the best that services be provided efficiently in these areas.  The new councils will manage and allocate the housing stock in their jurisdictions.  The financial consequences of this change for Dublin Corporation need to be looked at carefully. With regard to the provision of housing for the citizens of Dublin city, I appeal to the Minister for the Environment to make more funds available for the refurbishment of the existing housing stock. A programme for the refurbishment of the housing stock has been set in train but is hampered by lack of finance.  I would encourage the development of small housing schemes in the city area. The days of the large housing estates are long gone.  Consideration needs to be given to the type of accommodation which should be provided for people.  The average family size is getting smaller &mdash; very often a family consists of two people. Careful consideration needs to be given to this point.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish to refer to economic development and the role of local authorities. Local authorities in general should become less bureaucratic, have an employment role and encourage enterprise and initiative instead of going out of their way at every possible stage of a planning application, grant application, etc., to discourage employment.  Local authority employees should be more exposed to a business environment and seek to encourage people availing of their services to establish businesses.  The three new councils should be pro-business and pro-entrepreneurship and less bureaucratic.</P>

      <P>I wish to say loudly and clearly to the Minister that he will not get the kind of reform he is seeking or set up the proposed new local government structures in Dublin on the cheap, as implied in his speech.  This Bill will not be worth the paper it is written on unless it leads to real devolution of power to the three local councils.  Nothing in the Minister's speech gives me hope that the resources necessary for this devolution of power are provided for in the Bill.  On Committee Stage we will tease out with the Minister where he thinks this money will come from.</P>

They confirmed the position as they and, indeed, my Department see it, namely, that that was and always has been the case.  If such a rule existed it would be contrary to the right of all Governments, which successive Governments have reserved to themselves, to announce matters of public interest or public policy in a way that a Government deems appropriate.

      <P>As somebody relatively new to the House this debate has clarified something that was a mystery to me until now.  I also have a complaint, a reply to a parliamentary question put down by me was made available to somebody else <Col N="847" /> before I received it.  Is the Taoiseach interested in getting the details because I was astonished that information I had sought through the proper channels had been made available to another person?</P>
      <P>Surely the fact that somebody from another House can obtain material in this way is extraordinary.  Surely the Taoiseach would take that point on board &mdash; that we are conducting business according to the book and it is up to the Government to ensure that its response is conducted equally according to the book?</P>

      <P>Deputy McManus can take it from me that we are conducting our business according to the book and are not deviating from it.  I want to repeat that there is no question of confidentiality, or indeed, to be more precise, of privilege attaching to information.  It is as I have stated and I have nothing further to add.  But I will be as helpful as I can to any Member who may have any complaint.  I might remind Members that there is also the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to which they can resort whenever they have any such complaint.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach say whether he has been able to inquire &mdash; which he promised some weeks ago he would do &mdash; into how a company that was the subject of a parliamentary question in the House tabled by Deputy Rabbitte two weeks ago had the information in relation to the question within a day or so of the question having been tabled?  The Taoiseach told the Deputy two weeks ago that he would investigate how that had happened.  Would he say whether he has concluded his investigation?</P>

In this respect I must point out to him that what we are doing is what has always been done, as I have stated quite clearly.  I have checked with many Departments, including the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, because I thought that Deputy Deasy, having been a former Minister, might have been under that impression also.

Would the Minister of State agree that there is need for a deterrent to this rising tide of births to unmarried mothers, specifically since many of these young girls find themselves in a poverty trap occasioned by the lack of State-subsidised child care, unable to enter the workforce or undergo training?

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Would the Minister of State agree that while the figure he has given is obviously correct, it is a national figure and there are variations within that figure which are significant. The 18 per cent figure is not consistent throughout the country and is much higher, perhaps double, in urban areas and may be treble the figure in certain specific locations in urban areas.

      <Quest>the progress, if any, that has been made with regard to the implementation of the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government 1993 to 1997 to consider extending civil legal aid to tribunals such as the Social Welfare Appeals Tribunal and, following consultation with the social partners, the Employment Appeals Tribunal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 18 together.  The Programme for a Partnership Government places a responsibility on me, as Minister for Equality and Law Reform, to ensure access to the law; that the present scheme of civil legal aid and advice will be placed on a statutory footing; that additional <Col N="856" /> funding will be provided to facilitate an expansion of the scheme; that the possibility of extending legal aid to tribunals will be examined; and that in the case of the Employment Appeals Tribunal, this will follow consultation with the social partners.  Since taking office earlier this year I have made substantial progress in meeting these objectives.</P>
      <P>The Grant-in-Aid to the Legal Aid Board for 1993 is almost 20 per cent higher than it was in 1992.  As a result of that extra funding the board has recruited an additional 12 solicitors and is engaged in recruiting an additional 29 support staff.  These increases in staff will add significantly to the capacity of the board to provide an improved service to those entitled to it under the scheme.  A special allocation of £100,000 in 1993 is being used to employ the services of private solicitors on a pilot basis so as to further reduce the length of waiting lists at law centres.</P>
      <P>The pilot project for the involvement of private solicitors by the Legal Aid Board is confined to the conduct of cases for maintenance, barring and custody orders in the District Court and is operating on the basis of panels of solicitors who have applied to undertake the work. The project should enable, among other things, the making of arrangements with local private solicitors to provide a direct service to clients.  The fee payable for a case is £75, plus VAT, together with the cost of such incidental outlays as are covered by the legal aid certificate, reducing to £65, plus VAT, for a fifth and each subsequent such case dealt with by any one solicitor in a single day.  I am glad to say that a good geographical spread of solicitors have applied under the project and that briefs are in the course of being distributed to them.</P>
      <P>The board is, in consultation with my Department, devising an action plan for further development and expansion of the board's services, subject to budgetary constraints.  The question of extending civil legal aid to tribunals will be considered in that context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Bill to put the scheme of civil legal aid and advice on a statutory footing is <Col N="857" /> in the course of being drafted and the details will be announced in the normal way in due course.</P>
    <P>I think that Deputies will accept that the developments I have outlined are a good indication of my determination and that of the Government to ensure access to the law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that when a marriage breaks down and a husband or wife requires legal help they should be encouraged, if possible, to resolve the consequences of the breakdown without having to initiate court proceedings and that if they are to separate they should be encouraged to do so by agreement, perhaps with the assistance of lawyers or through a mediation service? Would the Minister acknowledge that the legal aid system he is now putting in place with regard to the District Courts is a court driven system which will ensure there is conflict between husbands and wives in circumstances where they cannot afford solicitors in private practice and they have to resort to the solicitors on the panel the Minister has set up?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have thought the Deputy would have expressed satisfaction at the substantial increases I have just announced in the civil legal aid system.  Had I not been in a position to announce them he would have made appropriate adverse comments, as has been done in the past about the inadequacies of the service.  I agree with the issue the Deputy raises about mediation, but it does not arise on this question. That is a separate matter.  The question of the mediation service is also receiving my attention and if a question is put down the details of intended expansion in that service will also be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that on the basis of this scheme a wife in Dublin who seeks legal help and who finds the doors of the law centre closed and who does not have means of her own will be told that the only way she will get a solicitor to provide assistance, through the State scheme, is if she takes <Col N="858" /> her husband to court.  She will then have to issue District Court proceedings and, at best, she will see a solicitor on the morning of the court case.  Would the Minister not agree that that is creating a conveyor belt system of justice for wives and is providing for deserted and unsupported wives a scheme of legal aid which is grossly inferior to that provided under the criminal legal aid system for people charged with petty crimes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree.  What I announced represents a qualitative improvement, a major step forward in the provision of legal aid in civil cases and exceeds any increase in previous years.  I feel sure that will be received with great satisfaction by all sides of the House, as it has long been sought and pressed for by Deputies.  Twelve additional solicitors have already been employed in the various law centres throughout the country and a further 29 support staff are in the process of being recruited during these very difficult times.  Clearly this will mean a substantial extension of the availability of civil legal aid and advice provided in the law centres.  With these substantial increases in staff, people will have greater access to the service which, I hope, will be further expanded in future years as provided for in the Fianna Fáil and Labour Programme for a Partnership Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>While I welcome the appointment of additional solicitors to the law centres will the Minister acknowledge that the duty system of solicitors sitting in district court buildings waiting to see how many wives they will represent in court that day is grossly inadequate means of providing legal help to people suffering the emotional trauma of marriage breakdown and renders it impossible for them to get legal representation which will ensure that their cases are properly prepared?  Will the Minister explain to the House what will happen if a wife says she is seeking legal advice but does not want to proceed to a court <Col N="859" /> hearing?  Under this scheme will the solicitor attending with the wife at that court case be accredited by the Legal Aid Board with dealing with an amicable separation or will the extent of the solicitor's involvement be a once off visit to the court with the person he is seeking to represent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Shatter well knows, the provision of the civil legal aid service is but one of the services provided and which are being expanded by this Government.  I am sure the Deputy knows that solicitors employed by the Legal Aid Board are professionals and are well qualified to represent people.  If the particular case before them is a matter for referral for counselling or mediation, they have full information and are skilled in referring people to the referral agencies.  However, when, regrettably, court proceedings are required, it is the Government's firm intention to ensure as far as possible that the legal services which have been called for so long and so often by Members on both sides, are provided.  I regret the somewhat grudging response to these very major advances in the services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 6, 7 and 17 together.</P>
      <P>The procedures and timescales for the holding of constitutional referenda are governed by provisions in the Constitution and in legislation.  The holding of a referendum requires initiation in the House of a Bill to amend the Constitution and when the Bill is passed by both Houses it is for the Minister for the Environment to make an order appointing the polling day, which must not be less than 30 days and not more than 90 days after the date of the making of the order.  No time limit is fixed within which the Minister must make the order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of replies to questions on 12 October last &mdash; Official Report columns 627-632, volume 434 &mdash; the Taoiseach indicated that the referendum is more likely to be held in the second half of 1994 than in first half of that year. The Government will indicate its position on the matter in due course.  The date of <Col N="861" /> the referendum will, of course, fall to be fixed following the approval by both Houses of the necessary Bill to amend the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I am unclear as to what exactly Deputy Sargent has in mind when he refers to a preferendum on divorce.  I am not aware that there are any provisions in our law on that approach.  Any enabling legislation on the matter would be the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment.  However, I should like to point out that the White Paper on Marital Breakdown, on which the views of the public and interested parties have been sought, sets out five possible amendments to the Constitution on divorce, and these have been the subject of continuing debate.  Those options offer a very good basis for canvassing views on the form the Constitutional amendment migh take.  These options are not necessarily an exclusive set of all possible amendments and in the course of my discussions with party leaders or with other groups it is possible that other amendments or variations may be suggested.</P>
    <P>I propose to complete my examination of the submissions received on the White Paper in the very near future.</P>
    <P>I have previously made clear my intention to embark upon consultations with political parties to secure the maximum possible consensus on the various issues in the divorce debate.  The consultations will be held sooner rather than later and I assure Deputies that my commitment to consult will be honoured.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the fact that it is over a year since the White Paper was published and that the Minister has been in Government for nine months, will he indicate to the House which proposal he believes should be included in a Referendum Bill to amend the Constitution? Will he indicate whether he had discussions at Cabinet on the wording to be put into the Constitution?  Will he clarify whether it is his intention to have cross-party discussions in the context of the Government suggesting a preference for the proposed wording?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has not yet considered or decided the parameters or the format for the divorce referendum. Obviously there will not be a final decision until the consultations, which I intend to hold with the other political parties, have been concluded.  I wish to note their comments and their views and having taken them into account to go to Government where the final decision will be taken on the parameters of divorce.</P>

Does the Minister agree that following the process of consultation we should engage in vigorous advocacy among the general public and in this House to inform the moderate opinion which might be pro-divorce in theory but has legitimate concerns regarding the impact of the divorce referendum on family life?  I am aware of very many people who are pro-divorce but who have legitimate concerns and I am sure the Minister will agree that those concerns must be dealt with.  Family law reform legislation is due to come before the House, will the Minister agree that this presents an opportunity for Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is a very complicated area, evidenced by the fact that Members have tabled a number of priority questions on the topic and it is very important that the Government takes this opportunity to introduce progressive legislation <Col N="863" /> and procedures that will be supportive of the family unit as well as allowing for the dissolution of marriages which have broken down.  The Government, with the full support of the House, should grasp the opportunity to allow for support structures, such as mediation conciliation, and ensure that the maintenance presently envisaged does not just encompass financial maintenance, but also the maintenance of the attachment between both parents and the children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to know how long we will be waiting.  My suspicion tells me it is like asking how long is a piece of string.  I would remind the Minister that it is not only a long time since a White Paper on this matter was produced but it is also a long time since he first announced he would meet Opposition leaders in regard to this matter.  In August last newspaper reports stated that he would be approaching all Opposition parties, but at that stage I was not aware that there was a pecking order involved. In September the newspapers stated that it would be only a matter of weeks before the discussions would take place and those reports were not contradicted.  In October last the Minister is quoted as saying that &ldquo;it has gone well beyond the talking stage&rdquo;.  That is news to Opposition Members.  We are now told that the talks will take place sonner rather than later.  Is the Minister not aware people want to know when the referendum will be held, what form it will take and how it will be presented to them?  Is he not aware that it is vital that there is clarity and an opportunity for debate so that the fudging and mistakes of the last occasion are not repeated? That will take time, leadership, direction and openness and that is not what we are getting at present.  We are going in circles.  If there is some type of mating dance going on between the Government and Fine Gael we should know whether it is helpful to the debate or getting in the way of debate.  If there is not, it is simply an excuse for lack of clarity and direction.</P>

      <P>There is no question of any seduction.  I sympathise with the impatience of Deputy McManus and I agree that we should move forward in regard to this matter.  However, the Programme for Government states clearly that the referendum will be held in 1994. That is a firm commitment and the Taoiseach reiterated that it is likely to take place in the latter half of 1994.  Deputy McManus should realise that important preparatory work needs to be carried out and consultations must take place.  The Government's decision will be made in adequate time to debate and explain the issue and I look forward to working with Deputy McManus and her party when the campaign gets under way.  The usual amount of time will be made available and the details will be published and submitted at the appropriate time.  The degree of impatience shown by Deputy McManus is not required a present as there is still plenty of time to deal with the matter before 1994.  Preparatory work must be carried out and legislation must be passed and that is proceeding apace at present so that the appropriate building blocks will be in place in sufficient time to allow the referendum to proceed on schedule.</P>

      <P>The Child Abduction and Enforcement of Custody Orders Act, <Col N="867" /> 1991, gives the force of law to two international conventions &mdash; the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction and the Luxembourg Convention on Recognition and Enforcement of Decisions concerning Custody of Children and on Restoration of Custody of Children.  The Hague Convention is designed to ensure the immediate return of children who have been abducted from one contracting state to another.  It is aimed at securing the immediate return of children on the basis that the custody of a child should be decided by courts in the state in which the child habitually resides.  The Luxembourg Convention gives a person who has a custody order the right to apply for that order to be recognised and enforced in the courts of another contracting state. Both conventions contain grounds for refusal by courts of applications for the return of children.</P>
      <P>The conventions provide for the establishment of a central authority in each contracting state to administer the procedures involved.  My Department operates as the central authority in the State. In the case of a child who has been abducted into the State, the central authority, acting on the foreign applicant's behalf, is obliged, <i>inter alia</i>, to arrange, if necessary, for court proceedings to secure the return of or access to the child. These proceedings take place in the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obligations are imposed on contracting states under the Luxembourg Convention to provide free legal aid to applicants who have to initiate court proceedings for the return of a child.  There is no obligation under the convention to provide legal aid to respondents.  The Hague Convention imposes an obligation on contracting states to provide free legal aid to applicants, unless a contracting state has made a reservation indicating that legal aid will be provided only to the extent that it is covered by that state's system of legal aid and advice.  In order to be consistent with the approach taken under the Luxembourg Convention, this country has not entered such a reservation. <Col N="868" /> Again, as in the case of the Luxembourg Convention, the convention does not require that legal aid be given to respondents.</P>
    <P>Since the coming into force of the conventions in the State on 1 October 1991, the Legal Aid Board has been requested to institute proceedings on behalf of an applicant on 35 occasions.  I am informed by the board that in 22 of these cases the respondent has also sought legal aid, and that in all such cases legal aid was granted in good and sufficient time to allow the respondent to defend the proceedings. The position, therefore, is that no application for legal aid to defend proceedings under the 1991 Act has been refused, nor is the board aware of any case in which a respondent has been left without legal representation to defend proceedings under the 1991 Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in some cases where proceedings of this nature have been brought apparently the respondents have been unaware of their entitlement to seek legal aid and on their doing so the court procedures which demanded that the case be heard rapidly resulted in respondents being unsuccessful in obtaining legal aid from the Government law centres?  Is the Minister aware of any case in which that arose?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>My information from the Legal Aid Board is that no case comes within that category and that in all the 22 cases in which legal aid was sought it was speedily granted.  Law centres have instructions that any application for legal aid that comes in under either of those conventions are to be dealt with as priority matters.  Quite clearly that has been done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 19, 53, 54, 55, 56 and 61 together.</P>
      <P>I accept that there is a strong case for a system of stillbirths registration which would provide bereaved parents with official recognition of their stillborn child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has assumed responsibility for a comprehensive review of the legislation governing births, marriages and deaths.  It had been intended that the question of stillbirths registration would <Col N="870" /> be addressed as part of that review.  It is clear, however, that because of the complexity of the issues involved and the age of much of the relevant legislation, the comprehensive review will take some time to complete.  I have, therefore, decided to give priority to the question of stillbirths registration and to deal with stillbirths registration separately from the wider review.</P>
    <P>Later this month I intend to bring proposals to Government for a Stillbirth Registration Bill which would provide for the establishment of an official stillbirths register.</P>
    <P>I wish to reassure the House that I am very conscious of the need for such a register and that I will be progressing the matter with a high degree of priority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive and satisfactory reply. The Minister recognises that there is a deep sense of anguish suffering, pain and profound sadness among the people involved and parents of still born children at the lack of official recognition.  We are the only EC country that does not register stillbirths.  Will the Minister ensure that the timetable outlined will be followed tenaciously as this is very urgent legislation for the people concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The preparation of the draft heads for a Bill is virtually completed and I intend to bring them to Government later this month.  The preparation of the heads for the Bill is a complex enough matter although it might appear to be a very simple matter.  I assure the House that I will try to progress the matter before both Houses with the maximum degree of priority.  I fully understand and sympathise with what Deputy Martin and other Deputies who have made representations have said and I understand the need to have this processed as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted that the Minister will bring forward the legislation very soon.  Does the Minister envisage a compulsory system of registration of stillbirths or a voluntary one?  Has the <Col N="871" /> Minister consulted with the masters of the major maternity hospitals who are in favour of a compulsory system?  How has the Minister decided to define &ldquo;stillborn&rdquo;? Has the Minister decided to accept the definition put forward by the various support groups?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>All necessary consultations have taken place.  The two aspects the Deputy mentioned are but two of the matters that require careful examination and consideration.  It would not be appropriate for me to divulge details yet because they have not yet been seen by or approved by the Government and they will not be approved until later this month when the heads of a Bill are submitted to the Government.  The Bill will be published as soon as possible after it has been drafted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the large number of families who have experienced this grief and trauma and who have spearheaded this campaign, will there be retrospective provision in the Bill to register stillbirths on the basis of hospital records or will registration only begin when the Bill has been passed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>

The amount of time which voluntary groups had to put into lobbying, having gone through such a traumatic time, is extraordinary. Has the Minister taken up the recommendations from the ISANS group in particular?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>We are having continuing consultation with the ISANS group and consultations with appropriate Departments and other groups have also taken place.  I will take into account all the representations received and the eventual Bill will be submitted for consideration <Col N="872" /> by the House.  We can examine these points in detail on Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I be so bold as to depart from the cosy consensus developing around this matter, a consensus of mutual back slapping and mutual congratulations. In replying to Deputy Martin's question the Minister did not refer to a timetable.  A timetable sets out a certain procedure to be employed.  We are dealing with a promise of an express nature made by an official in the Minister's office in response to public dissatisfaction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to written Question No. 55, to which the Minister is supposedly replying, which refers to that letter.  In view of the Minister's widespread consultations with ISANS will he give this House an undertaking that, to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of this group in 1983, by 31 December 1993 the simple and straightforward legislation will be on the Statute Book?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>When Deputy Flanagan sees the Bill he will be satisfied that it is not as simple and straightforward as he would like the House to believe.  The only undertaking I can give the House is that I intend to bring the heads for the Bill to Government this month and after that to press the matter to a conclusion in both Houses with all possible speed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 16 together.</P>
      <P>There are 55 employees in my Department. Their grade and gender are as follows: one secretary, two assistant secretaries and four principal officers, all of whom are men; 12 assistant principals, of whom six are women; seven higher executive officers, of whom five are women; seven executive officers, of whom four are women; five clerical officers and nine clerical assistant/typists, all of whom are women; two clerical assistant/clericals, one of whom is a woman; two services officers, one of whom is a woman.  In addition, there are three non-established civil servants in my Department, one of whom is a woman.</P>
      <P>My Department was set up by transferring certain functions and the staff engaged on those functions from other Departments.  The principal Departments involved in those transfers were the Departments of Labour, Justice and the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>Permanent civil servants are recruited by competitions run by the Civil Service Commission.  Promotions to secretary and assistant secretary grades are made following competitions organised by the Top Level Appointments Committee. Promotions to other grades are made either by competition or on the basis of merit with due regard to seniority.</P>
      <P>Since taking up office I have been responsible for recruiting three men and two women and two women have been promoted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the equality section of his Department was established to ensure gender equity and fair play?  How can he exercise political or moral authority in <Col N="876" /> insisting that State agencies and bodies employ the requisite number of females when his credibility has been called into question by the reply he has given?  He has said that the secretary of his Department, two assistant secretaries and four principal officers are male.  He also neatly sidestepped the fact that two of the posts that he filled himself, the post of partnership programme manager and the post of special adviser, are both held by males.  Is it not a case of do as I say but not do as I do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not accept that. The senior officials in my Department were not appointed by me, rather they were seconded, as I said, from other Departments when my Department was set up and constituted.  I have no doubt that the question of the procedures within the Civil Service for the appointment of senior officials will be considered by the Government to see if the necessary improvements in the gender balance can be achieved and how they should be achieved.  The appointments made by me in my own Department are fully in accordance with the concept of gender balance which has been to the forefront of my mind at all times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that he fills the posts of partnership programme manager and special adviser; they are not filled by the Civil Service Commission.  In addition, the Minister has a choice when it comes to the appointment of a driver.  Would he agree that the big positions of power and influence within his Department are without exception held by males and that because of this his credibility in relation to his role of policeman has been called into question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not accept that.  I appointed one programme manager and it had to be either a man or woman.  I do not think any reasonable person would suggest that I should appoint a woman and not a man.  I also appointed a legal adviser.  Again, I do not think any reasonable person would suggest that I should appoint one gender or the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="877" /> If I were appointing two or more, the position might be different, any reasonable person would accept that.  I know Deputy Higgins is doing his best, but his argument is pretty poor.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The position of programme manager involves particular qualifications and relationships with the Minister who makes the appointment.  I am quite satisfied that the programme manager I appointed is working diligently to achieve all those necessary improvements advocated by the Second Commission on the Status of Women.  No person could work harder or with more dedication than my programme manager. It was a first class appointment with which I am very happy and I know the Members of the House, particularly the women Members, will see and appreciate the wisdom of the appointment I made in that regard.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 58 together.</P>
      <P>The Government has decided that when a Minister proposes to appoint members of the board of a State body or is bringing forward proposals to Government for such appointments, and where, after the proposed appointments are made, there would not be a minimum of 40 per cent of both men and women among the members, apart from members appointed on the nomination of outside bodies, the Minister should set out in a memorandum for the Government his or her plans for achieving the 40 per cent target within four years.</P>
      <P>Bodies nominating persons to State boards have been asked to follow the 40 per cent gender balance policy.  Indeed, in the case of the county enterprise boards, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment made a strong request to the nominating bodies to comply with the guidelines issued by the Government.  In the circumstances it is disappointing in the extreme that many local authorities, trade unions and employers' bodies failed to comply with the request.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Enterprise and Employment has indicated that casual vacancies arising on these boards will, generally, be filled by women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept <Col N="879" /> that the Government commitment to a 40 per cent gender balance on State boards has proved an absolute flop and that what he is now presenting as a way of ameliorating the problem is a fumble? Early on in his ministry, when I said I believed there was no difference between this Government and the previous one regarding equality, the Minister pinpointed the Government commitment to a 40 per cent gender balance.  Will he agree that that commitment has no basis in reality?  We have seen it tested in the county enterprise boards; the county managers effectively ignored the recommendations of the Minister and acted in the traditional way which means that women are yet again excluded, apart from an instant rearguard action carried out by the Minister for Employment and Enterprise.  That simply is not good enough.  Will the Minister accept that, if this is a commitment worth establishing, it should be done through legislation? If it is not worth establishing through legislation, will the Government please shut up about it and stop pretending that it is committed to a 40 per cent gender balance without delivering?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept Deputy McManus's comments for the simple reason that they are not in accordance with the facts.  The Government has adopted the position broadly recommended in the second commission's report in regard to the appointment of women members to boards by the Government.  However, the question of appointments by outside bodies such as the trade unions, local authorities and employers is a matter which, for the moment, rests in their hands.  One would have expected that at the request of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, they would have complied with the Government guidelines adopted by the Government itself.  It is regrettable that those outside nominating bodies did not do so on that occasion.  In an attempt to partly redress the imbalance thereby constituted in the county enterprise boards, the Minister for Enterprise and <Col N="880" /> Employment increased the membership of those boards from the intended 12 to 14 by the addition of two women in each case.  I take this opportunity of appealing again to those outside nominating bodies when they are making nominations, as they called upon to do constantly across the spectrum of virtually all State boards, to bear in mind the Government's requirement to comply with the gender quota broadline direction.  I repeat that if it emerges that they are failing to do so, legislation would certainly have to be considered.  That should not be necessary in the case of responsible bodies like the trade unions, employers' organisations and local authorities who ought to accept and comply with the new policy adopted by the Government in its own appointments. It would be regrettable if one were forced to bring in legislation to compel those bodies to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister agrees that for years the employers, the trade unions etc., have been talking about their equal opportunity initiatives and, to some degree, claiming success for them.  However, when it comes to the crunch, they have not delivered the goods.  I suggest that the Minister needs to do much more than appeal to them. The question of local authorities developing equal opportunities policies that are really effective also needs to be looked at.  How does the Minister intend to take this further with the social partners?  Is he meeting them to discuss it and asking them to re-evaluate the equal opportunities policies they have had to date, given this dismal failure of the county enterprise boards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to take all possible appropriate steps, short of legislation, to induce them to comply with the Government's directive on gender balance.  I had a meeting with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on the subject yesterday and made the point very forcefully to them.  I will be having meetings and communications with other nominating bodies so that the Government's position on the matter is made quite clear.  I would <Col N="881" /> expect responsible bodies to comply with the requirements of the Government, clearly signalled by the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women of which they were all constituent members and to whose report, on these very questions, they subscribed. Having subscribed when serving on the commission to these notions, it is totally unacceptable that they do not put those requirements into practice themselves.  It would obviously be much better if that could be achieved on a voluntary consensus basis rather than by legislation. However, if all else fails, legislation will have to be considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that the Government made an absolute mess of appointments to the county enterprise boards and that it was a mistake not to have retained the power to refuse to accept nominations to boards where a gender balance did not exist? Will he not agree that all advances in the area of protecting women's rights in relation to equal treatment, equal pay and in the area of family law and marriage have only come about through legislation and that until the Government enacts legislation to ensure gender balance in State appointed bodies in practice it will not come about?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Deputy's comments that the Government made any mess of the appointments to the county enterprise boards.  The Government made its appointments in accordance with its directives.  It impressed on what should be responsible organisations, such as employers, trade unions and local authorities, and requested many times that they comply with that requirement.  It is regrettable that they have not done so.  The Government's displeasure on the issue has and will continue to be made known to them by other Ministers and by me in a forceful manner.  I would be hopeful that the message will get through in respect of future appointments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those are organisations that regularly make appointments to State bodies. <Col N="882" /> Vacancies arise and appointments are regularly made by the unions, employers and so on under the ambit of Ministers. Hopefully the gender balance message will get through to those organisations and the necessity for legislation will be avoided.  It would be a poor reflection on those bodies who were represented on the Second Commission on the Status of Women if it is necessary to apply the stick to them.  One would like to believe in this day and age that they would regard gender equality as something to be tackled and accepted on a voluntary rather than a compulsory basis.</P>

Regarding the composition of local authorities, in the next election many women may be interested in joining local authorities and many more women may be available to take up posts.  The 40 per cent gender balance is a target that will be achieved during a period of time.</P>

If the local authorities and other nominating bodies had given attention to the gender balance on those boards sought by the Government, that balance could have been achieved.  I would be hopeful that the necessary mental thought processes of members of nominating bodies will come around to the recommendations of the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women and that we will achieve the necessary gender balance on a progressive basis.</P>

      <P>What form of communication did the Minister's Department have with the nominating bodies to <Col N="883" /> the county enterprise boards prior to the submission of nominations?  Considering that the nominations did not meet the required gender balance, how can the Minister assure the House that any measures he can take at this stage other than the introduction of legislation will bring about the required gender balance?</P>

I consulted with my colleague the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, on the issue and he communicated with the boards.  I cannot guarantee what outside nominating bodies will do, but the views of the Government have and will continue to be made known to those nominating bodies in a forceful manner, but we must wait and see whether they comply.  If in the future it becomes clear that they are not reasonably complying, then appropriate action would have to be taken.  However, I hope that will not be necessary.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not accept that it is a privilege for nominating bodies to participate on State boards established by Ministers, that it is not impossible to ask those bodies to nominate two people, a man and a woman, and that the final selection be made by the Minister when the balance has been worked out?  The suggestion that women are not available is ludicrous.  The women are available but they are not represented. New boards will be coming on stream and a new State board will be set up to deal with the Animal Remedies Bill.  Will the Minister ensure that no new State boards are established until this matter is resolved?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to say that the Government, the Minister for Justice and I were shocked to learn of this dastardly crime in which Mr. Jim Lacey, a prominent banker, his wife, family and babysitter were subjected to a cowardly kidnapping ordeal.  I am quite certain that all sides of the House will join with me in condemning the perpetrators of this outrageous and appalling crime.  I was, however, relieved to learn that nobody was physically injured and that those who were abducted were subsequently released uninjured.  Obviously, all members of the Lacey family and their babysitter were subjected to an horrific and traumatic experience and I sincerely hope that they will recover quickly from their awful ordeal.  Over the past two decades there have, unfortunately, been a number of other kidnappings of prominent <Col N="885" /> business persons all of which, thankfully, were successfully resolved.  This latest kidnapping is the subject of a major Garda investigation and I am confident that the Garda will be successful in tracking down and bringing before the full rigours of the law the criminal gang responsible for this crime.</P>
      <P>The House will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to say anything further about this incident at this stage while the Garda investigation is continuing.</P>
      <P>With regard to the security of financial institutions, and in particular the protection of its personnel, I should explain that the Garda authorities have ongoing contact with the various banking federations and associations in the light of which they constantly review and update their security policies.  It is unrealistic to think that Garda action alone can prevent the serious crime of kidnap.  Any person who feels they or their families may be a kidnap target should take reasonable and prudent precautions. They should keep in close contact with the Garda and take all advice offered to them by the Garda, who have specialist knowledge in this area.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Fine Gael Party, I, and, I am sure, the House, want to be associated with good wishes to the Lacey family and their babysitter for a speedy recovery following their terrible ordeal.</P>
      <P>May I ask the Minister, in view of the fact that there is a general appearance of lawlessness in parts of Dublin &mdash; a man was shot recently and robbery is a daily occurrence &mdash; whether the penalties for such crimes will be reviewed with a view to making those contemplating such cowardly and dastardly acts think twice before they embark on them?  Will the Minister confirm that a full and vigorous Garda investigation will take place, with all the necessary resources being made available to hunt down those guilty of these terrible crimes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda authorities <Col N="886" /> have assured the Minister that they have the capacity, strength and facilities necessary to track down these people and no effort will be spared in ensuring that the culprits are brought to justice.  On the confiscation of the proceeds of crime, the Taoiseach has indicated to the House that it is hoped to bring forward in the next couple of weeks a Bill to deal with this matter.  Members will welcome this measure because it is only right that people involved in criminal activity do not, with impunity, live off funds acquired in this way.  The Criminal Law Act, 1976, provides for a maximum penalty of life imprisonment for kidnapping. The Law Reform Commission is at present preparing a report on sentencing policy and the Minister for Justice, on receipt of that report, will seriously consider the question of mandatory sentencing to strengthen existing legislation to combat crimes of this nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that the Government will consider the question of mandatory sentences in these circumstances because life imprisonment sometimes means six or seven years and in the case of crimes of this kind the penalty should be greater.  Would the Minister agree that the fact that the Garda strength is about 500 below the authorised and established level contributes to vandalism and lawlessness and a break down in order, allowing people to play the system to their own advantage? Will the Minister communicate to his colleague, the Minister for Justice, the view of most Members that the Garda force should be immediately brought up to full strength and that all the necessary Garda sources be deployed on the streets to deal with the current crime problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to correct Deputy Mitchell's comment that life imprisonment means a term of imprisonment of about seven or eight years.  Such comments are very often made, but it is not possible to go before the sentence review group until after at least seven years imprisonment &mdash; the average is about 11 years.  In relation to the current strength <Col N="887" /> of the Garda, considerable resources are made available by the Government to update and make provision for the most sophisticated systems to aid the Garda authorities to combat international and domestic crime of this nature.  The Minister has been assured by the Garda Commissioner that there is no question of a lack of resources in dealing with these crimes.  Nonetheless, in terms of criminal activity generally and the problem of law and order, discussions are proceeding in Government with a view to taking further initiatives in this regard.  We are aware of the concern in the community, but it is not only a question of resources and Garda activity; quite a number of other aspects have to be dealt with.  No effort will be spared in terms of overall national resources and a commitment to increasing Garda activity on the ground to protect people in their homes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not be possible to implement on the cheap the provisions of a local government reform Bill of this nature.  It will be necessary to provide adequate resources to ensure that its provisions are properly implemented.  It is timely to remind ourselves of the purpose of this Bill and, indeed, of local government reform.  The Barrington report was published in 1992.  The question is often asked, why is there a need for local government reform?  I will remind people of the basic reasons for local government reform, the need to develop the democratic system; the problems associated with centralised government; the need for regional, local and community development and the need to make the best use of resources.  For many years this country has been tardy in introducing proper local government reform.  I welcome the emphasis of this Bill on dividing the large council into three localised councils.  The essence of this move is that people will identify with them and see them as serving their local needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to express certain reservations about the division of the council.  It will be a sad day when Dublin as a county is disbanded.  I welcome the fact that the names of the three new councils are not copperfastened in the Bill because I have strong reservations about them.  The Minister referred to the provision which will permit a change in name in the future to be promoted by the relevant county council.  It should be possible &mdash; and I believe it would be desirable &mdash; for us to <Col N="928" /> reach agreement on the names of the new councils.  If the Bill is enacted in its present form the new councils will not have proper identifiable names.  All parties will be represented on the councils by their councillors and it should be possible for us to reach agreement on the names of the councils.  The Fingal Council will be easily identifiable with that area, but there is a risk that the other councils will not be identified with Dublin county.  If this happens, people will not be aware of the close association of the councils with County Dublin.  My colleague, Deputy Doyle, asked if there would be three Dublin football teams &mdash; a Fingal GAA team, a South Dublin GAA team and a Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown GAA team &mdash; and whether footballers who now live in Fingal will in the future play for Fingal county.  It is important that an identity of some sort be retained.</P>
    <P>I am very disappointed that the Minister has used the term &ldquo;cathaoirleach&rdquo; to describe the people who will head up the new councils.  It should be remembered that, apart from Dublin Corporation, these councils will be bigger than any other council in the country.  Therefore, the term &ldquo;mayor&rdquo; or &ldquo;lord mayor&rdquo; would have been more appropriate.  I want to give my reasons for saying this.  I have been a member of Dublin County Council since 1979 and I am sick and tired of it being regarded as the poor relation and an adjunct to Dublin Corporation. Dublin County Council represents more people than Dublin Corporation.  I am sorry to be parochial about this matter &mdash; I am sure my colleague on Dublin County Council who is in the House will make the same points &mdash; but the Lord Mayor of Dublin is regarded as the head of the city and county of Dublin while the poor chairman of Dublin County Council gets second billing.  Dublin County Council has to fight for every bit of prestige it gets and it has to remind people that its chairman represents more people than the Lord Mayor of Dublin.  We will put down amendments on Committee Stage dealing with the status of these new councils.  We want to ensure that these <Col N="929" /> councils are given a proper identity, something I know the Minister wants to do.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Doyle, I am very disappointed that the Minister has done no more than refer to the establishment of the regional authority.  The Bill proposes that the new councils will be autonomous. Yet it goes on to say that certain functions will still be carried out on a Dublin basis.  What authority will deal with issues such as waste disposal, sewerages schemes and waterworks and implement the development plan in a macro way as opposed to implementing three development plans?  We do not know who will deal with such issues.  All we can assume is that Mr. Davy Byrne from Fingal will administer one bit of the plan, Mr. Kevin O'Sullivan from Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown will administer another bit of it and Mr. John Fitzgerald will administer the rest.  That would not be a satisfactory arrangement.  It is important that we know the details of the regional authority for Dublin and the responsibilities of the new councils as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the issue of waste disposal.  It has been proposed to dispose of the waste for Dublin city and county at a new site in Kill, County Kildare.  As the Minister will be aware, this issue is extremely controversial, mainly because the site is outside the County Dublin border.  Deputy Haughey said he welcomed this proposal and gave out about the Dunsink tiphead in Finglas.  For many years Dublin County Council has been the only waste disposal authority for the city of Dublin.  The council was very glad to carry out this function &mdash; councillors knew there were not adequate quarries and sites available within the city boundaries to build tipheads.  All available sites in County Dublin have now been used up and it has been found necessary to build a tiphead outside the county boundary.</P>
    <P>The controversy over this proposal shows how parochial and possessive people can become about their areas. One can only imagine the rows which will take place after the establishment of the <Col N="930" /> three councils.  For example, arguments may arise about who is responsible for filling potholes where one half of the pothole is in one council area and the other half is in another council area.  The Minister does not seem to realise that the new county boundaries divide housing estates.  We already know from experience the difficulties which can arise when one divides areas &mdash; for example, health board areas.  In parts of Dublin city and county people living on a certain road in an estate are entitled to free fuel while people living on another road in the same estate have to beg and plead for the same benefits &mdash; they have to be means tested, etc.  If housing estates and neighbours are divided in this way by the new county boundaries the situation will be totally untenable.  I hope that the person who draws up the maps will set proper boundaries. In his speech the Minister referred to open spaces but he did not refer to housing estates.  It is important that people who are part of a community remain part of it.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer briefly to a number of what one might call housekeeping issues. Apart from his statement that the three new councils will each receive one-third of the money presently allocated to Dublin County Council, the Minister made no reference to resources.  I do not think it will be possible for the new councils to work properly on this level of funding.  The Minister was a member of a local authority and he knows how hard pressed local authorities are to finance the jobs they are given to do.  I think that at present there are four dog wardens for Dublin county.  How can one divide a dog warden between two councils?  Will he be split up the middle or will he have to work a day and a half with each council? Each new council must have proper structures, otherwise the reforms will merely be on paper and they will not work in practice.  As the Minister is well aware, the list of legislation passed to local authorities to administer has been getting longer and longer.  When Ministers decide they do not want to implement legislation themselves they give local authorities responsibility for implementing <Col N="931" /> it.  However, local authorities do not get the necessary resources to implement this legislation.  They do not even get the fines collected under that legislation. They get the £5 fine for litter but an £800 fine imposed on someone in court goes back to central Government.  We must ensure that this legislation can be implemented and will bring about the changes people want to see.</P>
    <P>The three new councils will start off with a debt of £22 millions on their backs. I ask the Minister to be realistic and not to strap the councils with this debt.  He should find some way of writing off that debt, thus ensuring that the councils will be able to work.  The councils will find it difficult enough to provide the services required without starting off with a debt of £22 million.</P>
    <P>I wish to highlight other areas that the Minister is passing on to the three new councils.  There is a good deal of tidying up being done in this legislation which I welcome.  One of these is the ex-municipal area where the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown council will be responsible for the ex-municipal areas.  It is obviously very unsatisfactory for one local authority to be responsible for maintaining pipes in the area of another local authority and it is appropriate that this is addressed in the legislation.  However, we are talking about a very old network of water pipes in need of major overhaul and maintenance. Therefore, there is little point in asking a new council to deal with this problem because it will find itself up to its neck in debt.  Pipes will burst and there will be huge traffic congestion, as we have seen many times around the Blackrock area, where traffic is delayed and the costs to industry and the business sector generally are enormous.  The Minister should include in his proposals the provision of sufficient moneys to ensure that this new council can work.  The Minister of State and the Minister will be indicated if they simply introduce legislation and leave the new councils to fend for themselves.</P>
    <P>The other area I welcome is the extension of responsibility to the councils for <Col N="932" /> water pipes to the curtilage of the garden walls of houses.  At present, if the water pipe serving one's house has a stopcock across the road from the house and there is a burst under the road between the stopcock and one's house, the unfortunate householder is responsible for the repair of that burst pipe all the way into the house.  If one is lucky enough to have a stopcock just outside the gate, the householder does not have to carry that cost.  I am happy that this problem has been addressed in the legislation but again it will place an additional burden on the councils.  Whereas it is appropriate to deal with the problem the Minister should not expect it to be done on the cheap because the engineers in my area have told me they will not be able to make such calls to restore water in the case of a burst pipe if the necessary resources are not made available to them.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the issue of the transfer of responsibility for corporation houses from parcels of land which are now in the county area.  This has been a major question in Dublin County Council for many years, particularly for the unfortunate tenants of the corporation houses. They do not know whether they are fish, flesh or good red herring because they come to us as councillors for assistance and we have to refer them to the corporation who tells them they are not its responsibility because they are in the county and so on.</P>
    <P>In Fingal at the moment 1,600 council houses under our control are rented. When these regulations are drawn up an additional 3,500 corporation houses will come under our control.  These houses carry a heavy maintenance burden because, unfortunately, many of the tenants are deserted wives, single parents or unemployed people who suffer great stress and cannot carry out the type of jobs that we expect people in public housing to do.  Additional funding must be provided so that these houses can be properly maintained.</P>
    <P>The library system will be divided and there will be three main librarians.  Will the Minister reconsider, before this Bill is finally passed, the powers of these new <Col N="933" /> councils with regard to the provision of libraries?  There is no power of CPO to acquire land for the building of libraries and this has been a major problem over the years.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will consider some of the points I made and I look forward to participating on Committee Stage of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonWalsh" hpid="Mr. E. Walsh Mr. E. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill because it contains many important details that will affect the new councils.  I will mention briefly a passage from the Minister's statement this morning which is worth repeating:</P>
      <P>The proposal to establish three new councils is designed to ensure more relevant and accessible local government structures with a sharper focus and operational capability to serve their areas.  However, any proposals for reorganisation in Dublin must address the issue of co-ordination of major local authority services.</P>
      <P>That statement highlights the whole issue, namely, making the three new local authorities, Fingal, Dublin South and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, relevant to the people in those areas.</P>
      <P>The break-up of Dublin County Council is an historic event.  Many people will be sad to see the old Dublin County Council disappear as it served its constituents well, many people refer nostalgically to the way in which it has maintained its housing stock, and the way that the county has developed in the rural areas.  Naturally, after the long history of such an important local authority, it is sad to see it go, particularly the name Dublin.  This will be missed greatly in relation to football teams and various other social activities and it is important, therefore, that the new local authorities show some evidence that they are still located in the Dublin area with all the traditions linked to the old organisation. I am happy that in my own council we will be referred to as South Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The break-up of Dublin Corporation involves the question of dividing approximately half a million people into three <Col N="934" /> separate areas.  That is a staggering figure when we consider the population of the country.  Dublin County Council which, of course, will be in existence until the end of this year, has a budget of £150 million.  That is a substantial amount of money to be administered by a local authority. The process that led to the break-up of the county council is worth mentioning because this is the first local authority that the State will have created of any great importance.</P>
    <P>I was elected to Dublin County Council for the first time in 1991 and I was privileged to be part of that process and to have witnessed the first indications of the break-up.  It was difficult to understand the process because it was such a complex organisation.  However, I had been thrown in at the deep end by being elected chairman of the first South Dublin area committee which put me in a position to understand the process.  This had to be understood quickly as there was a short timescale involved and the new council had to come into being by 31 December.  Sadly, my office terminated in September and, therefore, I will not be the new chairman of the South Dublin County Council but I will have contributed by being chairman of the area committee.</P>
    <P>It is also worth mentioning that the staff involved in the reorganisation are very special people who went about their work in a diligent manner.  The councillors of South Dublin contributed in many positive ways towards that development. Most people tend to regard change as something negative and attempt to protect what is already in existence.  The civic offices are well underway and are due to be completed by February 1994.  I turned the first sod for those offices in March of last year in Tallaght, an indication of how quickly we have moved in South Dublin.  On 1 January 1994 the area of South Dublin will come into existence and I hope this historic event will be marked by a suitable ceremony.</P>
    <P>On the question of the boundary changes referred to in the Bill I consulted members, with the manager, in our area in South Dublin.  We have agreed with <Col N="935" /> neighbouring counties the revised county boundaries which, I presume, will be taken into account when defining the boundaries of the new South Dublin County Council.</P>
    <P>The manufacture of a seal in South County Dublin involved a very difficult process.  Indeed our gratitude should be expressed here to the Chief Herald who enabled us to go through that process.  Many of us in the county council are not <i>au fait</i> with the skill of heraldry but, because of the nature of our work, we had to devise a seal.  We were given the task of designing a new coat of arms.  We obtained the advice of the Chief Herald and, after much deliberation, difficulty and controversy, finally secured a coat of arms which does not contain many humps like those on a camel but which is reasonable, looks traditional and will represent the new image of South Dublin.  Indeed when we become a full county council, with its attendant status, I look forward to displaying it in many areas in the county especially through local organisations, at sporting activities and other various community projects so that the symbol of South Dublin will be readily recognised by them, thereby creating a good image of the new South Dublin County Council.</P>
    <P>There appears to be a certain amount of controversy regarding the name of South Dublin.  We in South Dublin fully discussed the matter.  We agonised over the title, received many proposals, some excellent and some very difficult to comprehend. After all the deliberations, the vote was put and the motion passed that South Dublin be the name of our area committee.  That was the democratic wish of the members of the South Dublin area.</P>
    <P>I understand the geographic difficulties because at present, serving on Dublin County Council I represent an area and, in South Dublin, will represent the area of Terenure.  The local electoral area of Terenure was mentioned but I should point out that that is not in Terenure. For example, I live in the district of Greenhills but the Greenhills electoral area is not located in my area.  The boundaries of electoral areas do not correspond <Col N="936" /> with the traditional ones. However, South Dublin is the name we have adopted; that is the name by which we shall be known henceforth.  Indeed we are already known by that name because we publicised the fact that we are in the process of breaking up and that South Dublin is the area in which we are engaged in reorganising.</P>
    <P>The question arises also of the chairmen of the new county councils.  I had the privilege of chairing the first South Dublin area committee.  The last chairman of the South Dublin area committee will be Councillor Don Tipping who will become the new Chairman of South Dublin County Council.  I commend the work he has been doing since he succeeded me in bringing to finality this historic creation of South Dublin County Council.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the question of mayoral status raised by Deputy Owen which is worthy of mention because County Dublin has always been regarded as the Cinderella of Dublin local authorities. No matter how well one presented one's local authority, how good one was at performing one's duties, no matter what one's status from the point of view of whomsoever one represented, the Mayor of Dublin always took precedence over us.  Nonetheless the appointment of mayors of the new county councils might constitute a way of addressing that imbalance.  I ask the Minister to consider that possibility, particularly since Dublin Corporation will have a mayor&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonWalsh" hpid="Mr. E. Walsh Mr. E. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I stand corrected by an ex-Lord Mayor of Dublin.  I am sure the Lord Mayor of Dublin Corporation will work very closely with the chairpersons of the other county councils so it is right for us to have equal status and to have a Lord Mayor.  I ask the Minister to seriously consider that possibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should point out also that the manager in South Dublin, Mr. John Fitzgerald, brought enthusiasm to reorganisation and took his staff through <Col N="937" /> a very difficult process, enabling them to deliver on the difficult decisions placed before them.  He should be given credit for having pushed this issue to its limit and bringing us to the point of being a new county council.  Without his enthusiasm and understanding we might not have reached this point because, on many occasions, councillors had very serious reservations and worries about certain things, but Mr. Fitzgerald was always available to meet personnel and to reassure us because of the confidence he had in his ability to deliver and that we were on the right road.</P>
    <P>I should like to address some questions <i>vis-á-vis</i> the membership of the boards to which the new county councils will be entitled to nominate members the first being the vocational education committees in respect of which there is no provision to effect any change in the County Dublin Vocational Education Committee.  We understand that changes will be introduced in that area fairly soon but, if we continue as at present, in South Dublin &mdash; I am not sure about the other areas &mdash; we would be concerned that we would not have adequate representation in the interim period on the old vocational education committee.  Perhaps the Minister could consider the possibility of devising some temporary arrangement to ensure that the new South Dublin County Council will be represented on that old vocational education committee.  The reason for that proposal is that it is one of the most important subcommittees of any local authority.  It is also essential that South Dublin is given the status it deserves by being represented on a vocational education committee.</P>
    <P>I note that section 18 makes consequential adjustments in relation to the membership of the Eastern Health Board but I understand that the question of the membership of the Governing Body of UCD has not been resolved.  I note that section 22 of the Bill provides for the appointment of one member only.  I should like the Minister to examine how he will deal with the other two areas &mdash;<Col N="938" /> Fingal and South Dublin &mdash; who will not have nominees.</P>
    <P>Problems have always been encountered when county boundaries were revised.  Within the new county I envisage one of the problems being Dublin Corporation and the question of rezoning, halting sites, finance and &mdash; one of particular importance to the Tallaght area &mdash; a courthouse.  I should like to deal with the question of Dublin Corporation first.  The last Part of the Bill deals with the transfer of lands and housing from Dublin Corporation to the new South Dublin County Council, one of the most complex and important issues ever encountered by any local authority.  Can Members of the House imagine a local authority operating in another local authority area without being in any way accountable to the latter for the actions of the former?  One example is of land in Ballycragh, Tallaght, where 880 acres have been zoned for housing against the express wishes of the 26 members of South Dublin area committee which, in the draft development plan, had been zoned as a green belt area.  At the same time, Dublin Corporation is proceeding to dispose of that land for housing totally against the wishes of the 26 members of South Dublin, a matter which must be addressed immediately.</P>
    <P>On the matter of the transfer of the local authority housing stock &mdash; here I may be corrected if I am wrong &mdash; I understand that 500 houses must be dealt with.  Indeed one of the greatest issues facing us in west Tallaght is the fate of those houses.  For example, how will they be transferred?  What will the cost be and who will bear it?  What will the consequences be and what will comprise the final solution to this long saga?  In south Dublin, in west Tallaght in particular, people are not represented by any public representative at local authority level. There are people in large areas of west Tallaght who, when they want to make representations to their local authority, submit them to Dublin County Council who, in turn, must make representations to Dublin Corporation.  When there are difficult issues in regard to housing it is <Col N="939" /> frustrating to take such a long tedious route in regard to simple matters.  I am glad the Minister devoted a section to that important area.</P>
    <P>I understand, and I would like to hear the Minister explain in more detail, that the managers will prepare a report, in consultation with the members of each of the four local authorities, which is the case in relation to the report prepared for the break-up of the councils.  I understand this report will be organised by the four managers in consultation with the south Dublin, Fingal and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown members and that its proposals containing all the details of the transfer will be listed, accounted for and presented to the Minister for decision.  I ask the Minister to consider carefully the final outcome of this operation because a solution to that problem will be the making or breaking of the new council in south Dublin.  If we do not have a satisfactory resolution, this problem will bedevil us for the remainder of the century and the beginning of the new century. It is important to get this section right.  I urge the Minister to use whatever influence and goodwill he can identify in Dublin Corporation to ensure that this happens.  There is a large cost involved, which was not taken into account in discussions, in solving the problems associated with a population that feels alienated.  It is very difficult to reassure them that after the transfer everything will be all right.  We need to have some resources at our disposal to bring the reorganisation of houses and land of Dublin Corporation up to the standard that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the rezoning of land, in Kiltipper, despite the best advice available from the manager of Dublin County Council and the planning officers, a section of land was rezoned.  I ask the Minister to examine that issue with a view to resolving the problem, <Col N="940" /> about which people are seriously concerned.</P>
      <P>We have a large number of halting sites in the south Dublin area and, on the formation of the new council, there must be some mechanism to ensure an equitable distribution and that Dublin south does not have to bear the brunt.</P>
      <P>There are costs involved in reorganisation and Dublin County Council will have a small charge to be accounted for in the reorganisation unit.  Perhaps the Minister would take that into account when the new councils are being formed. If he could see his way to wiping out debts everybody would be delighted.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to the positive side of the whole development.  We have the Square in Tallaght, the hospital, the civic offices which are almost complete, the regional technical college which is flourishing and the job creation possibilities arising therefrom.  I look forward with confidence and anticipation to the formation of the new councils.  I ask the Minister to do everything in his power to ensure their success, particularly Dublin South.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>As a recent former Lord Mayor of Dublin I wish to put on record my appreciation to the officials of Dublin Corporation for their great service to the city and county of Dublin down through the years.  Dublin Corporation is not without fault.  I would be the first to criticise its faults and I have pointed them out in the past.  It is a great honour to be a member of Dublin Corporation because it delivers so many important services in our capital city.  As a member since 1979 and a recent Lord Mayor I know at first hand the dedication of the vast majority of the public servants who work in Dublin Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are those who believe that my ambition to bring the Olympics to Dublin should be laughed at and dismissed out of hand.  I do not know why people start from the basis of no confidence in themselves. All I want is to carry out a feasibility study to find out whether we can do it.  The second feasibility study will be carried out because the first study was <Col N="941" /> very positive.  The reason I mention it is that I am not aware of any public or local authority service in the world which is better than ours.  Of course there are faults but our public servants are first class.  At both national and local government level they are dedicated to carrying out their duties in a fair and impartial manner.</P>
    <P>Our politicians work harder than most other politicians in other countries.  Both in the elected and the permanent public service &mdash; with all its faults &mdash; there is a dedication which should not be taken for granted.  There are many other things we do better or as well as any other part of the world.  For example, Dublin Corporation's parks department is one of the best in the world and if you were to seek one to equal it you would go to Dublin County Council.  In this city we provide services to the very highest standards.  In Northern Ireland they are self-congratulatory regarding the housing provided but the housing provided in this city and county is second to none.  There may be a shortage of housing stock and a great need for refurbishment of housing stock, a point I will return to later.  It is time we had more confidence in ourselves and in particular more confidence in Dublin.  This is no mean city.  We are aware of the quotation: &ldquo;I am a citizen of no mean city&rdquo;.  I have had the great privilege of being Lord Mayor of no mean city.  Dublin city dates from the 8th century. We have had a Mayor of Dublin since 1229, a Lord Mayor of Dublin since 1665 so the title Mayor has been around for a very long time.</P>
    <P>The ancient city of Dublin is the greatest cradle of English literature since Elizabethan England &mdash; those are not my words.  We have had the greatest satirist in the English language, Jonathan Swift; the greatest orator in the English language, Burke, and three Nobel literature prize winners.  This is the only city in the world which produced three Nobel literature prize winners.  It may surprise some Members of the House and the public to know that James Joyce and Oscar Wilde were not among them. There were many other people who if <Col N="942" /> they were in any other city of the world probably would have won a Nobel literature prize.  Dublin always had more than its quota.  Yeats, Beckett and Shaw, all Dublin born, are our three Nobel literature prize winners.  The Gaelic League celebrated its centenary this year.  It is time, given our great history, that we had more confidence in our capital city.</P>
    <P>Anybody who dismisses out of hand the prospect of bringing the Olympics to Dublin, without any scientific research, should be put under the microscope and asked to account for themselves.  We have formed the Dublin international sports council which has the unanimous support of every party and independent members of Dublin Corporation for its objectives of (a) bringing major international events to Dublin and (b) carrying out the Olympics feasibility study, for which we have raised commitments abroad of US$800,000.  Not all the money will go on the study and some of it will be used to bring major events to the city.</P>
    <P>Why do we want to bring major events to Dublin?  Dublin has the highest rate of unemployment in the country.  In previous unemployment crises the rate of unemployment in Dublin was lower than in the rest of the country, but this has changed and we need to promote Dublin. I believe the new local authorities need to play a more developmental and promotional role.  As Lord Mayor I had the honour to speak to people abroad about Dublin &mdash; my comments on the Bill are mainly about Dublin city although my constituency comprises the city as well as parts of County Dublin.  I tell them that we have one of the best educated populations in western Europe; a constant low inflation rate over a number of years; a debt-GNP ratio which is decreasing; that there is strong support on a cross-party basis for the control of public expenditure; that interest rates are low except for the temporary aberration which affected countries in the EC: and that our growth rate over a number of years is twice that of the European Community. When they hear that they say that must be a marvellous economy, but I have <Col N="943" /> to tell them we have an unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>Why have we an unemployment problem? Part of the reason is that people are not investing in Dublin and another reason &mdash; these are not my words but those of the Norwegian economist who carried out a special report for the National Economic and Social Council &mdash; is that new ideas and innovations cannot come through the system because there are so many people waiting to knock them.  This brings me back to my idea of promoting Dublin as a major sports centre and the possibility of hosting the Olympics.  I have not asked for a penny of public money to carry out a feasibility study on holding the Olympics in Dublin, but major corporations indicated they would support such a study because it is important to talk in this way about Dublin.</P>
    <P>This is no mean city and if people hear about us because we are running major sporting events such as the Tall Ships regatta, the Tour de France, the world boxing challenge, the upgraded Dublin City Marathon and other events which hopefully will come our way such as the world equestrian cup and the womens' world cup hockey, what will happen?  I believe what has happened in Manchester will happen.  People said &ldquo;God help Manchester, it did not get the Olympics&rdquo;. But Manchester has helped itself and there has been £300 million in forward investment and investment in all sorts of facilities which it had not got previously.  Hyatt Hotels, when considering where to build hotels over the next ten to 15 years, are not looking at Dublin, Belfast or Beirut.  We do not deserve that treatment.  When they see the glass they say it is half empty, but it is half full and we can top it up.  That is the reality of the situation.  However, if they only hear about us every time a bomb goes off in Belfast or somebody is kidnapped on the streets of Dublin or similar incidents, that forms their attitude.</P>
    <P>They do not know Dublin and I have to explain all the economic indicators to <Col N="944" /> them.  They need to hear that Dublin can attract international sporting events to the country and that we can run them.  I am not saying we can do all of them and we are working on the feasibility study. But we will attract major events and then we will start to see investment and some of our own business people who have money will start to invest here.  Look what has happened in Lansdowne Road. The IRFU and the FAI got together and agreed to floodlight the Lansdowne Road grounds, and they have invested the money in it.  The GAA is also investing money in Croke Park, and when the work is completed there the stadium will have 25 per cent more seating capacity than the main stadium in Barcelona.  The GAA thinks that talk of bringing the Olympics to Ireland is a good idea.</P>
    <P>There is now talk of bringing a European cup final to Dublin in the near future.  When I was a boy that would have been unthinkable.  Indeed, when I was grown up it was unthinkable that the Eurovision Song contest would be staged in Millstreet, and indeed all our eyes were wiped when it was staged there.  That taught us a lesson or two and was a source of great encouragement.  It has never been envisaged that an airport would be built at Knock.  Indeed I recall the time when there were strange ideas about the provision of an airport at Shannon.</P>
    <P>It is time we had more confidence in our city and county.  I hope these new authorities will become developmental authorities that will promote Dublin. Somebody needs to speak for Dublin.  I do not have a difficulty with any TD speaking for his region, indeed Members are entitled to do so but Members such as myself, and others, have been lacking in not fighting for Dublin, it is time we put the case again.</P>
    <P>The NESC report is right: people keep changing the grounds for denouncing ideas such as conducting an Olympics feasibility study and have a vested interest in stopping the study being carried out.  They are replicated right throughout the system.  The NESC report is right.  There is not only the lack of encouragement for innovation but the <Col N="945" /> blocking of any innovation by vain people who want to hold their fiefdoms and travel the world as if they were members of some royal family.  They need to be taken on.</P>
    <P>We need innovation, and let nobody tell Members of this House that we are not as capable as they are in Melbourne. Melbourne was founded in the 19th century, it has already run the Olympics and wants to do so again.  The question is not whether we run the Olympics but whether we have the confidence to find out that we can do it and that we stop those people who are knocking the city and the country.  We are competent, able and resourceful.  People of the calibre of Dr. Ryan, Kevin Heffernan, Ronnie Delaney, Pat McQuaid and Mary Finan, sound business and sporting people, are on the committee.  We have the support also of the Dublin City Council on an all party basis, the support of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce and the support of the Dublin trade union representative, the representative of the IDA and the representative of the Ports and Docks Board on the committee on the economy of Dublin.  Do Members think those people are fools?  Do Members think that the people who gave us the money for this survey are fools?  No, they are people with confidence in Dublin.  It is time we displayed a similar confidence in our city. We should not necessarily be competing with the other regions because we want to compete with the rest of the European Community.  Manchester and other cities are out there doing their best to do business. Birmingham has a full time representative in the European Community.</P>
    <P>During my term as Lord Mayor I set up the Lord Mayor's Commission on Reform of the Corporation and the Lord Mayor's Commission on Housing and I am grateful to members of the City Council who on a cross-party basis supported my initiative.  The Lord Mayor's Commission on Reform of the Corporation proposed mainly internal reforms within the Corporation, which I hope will be encouraged.  I also hope that the level of expenses paid to the members of Dublin City Council will reflect what is expected <Col N="946" /> of them under the proposals in that document so that they will be able to slimline their duties and spend more time at fewer meetings discussing matters relating to Dublin city.  They should be paid a decent level of expenses for their work.  It is extraordinary that the largest local authority in the country pays the lowest out-of-pocket expenses to its members.</P>
    <P>As that report stated, it is time to consider a longer period than one year for the Lord Mayor of Dublin to hold office and also for the chairpersons of the new authorities.  Elections of the Mayor of Jerusalem and of the Mayor of New York took place yesterday.  The Mayor of Jerusalem was replaced after 28 years in office and the Mayor of New York had held office for a period of approximately four years.  If we are serious about promoting Dublin the Lord Mayor and chairpersons of the new authorities should hold office for more than one year.  Those persons will not have to compete with the Minister &mdash; their areas of responsibility are local rather than national government matters.  If the Minister for the Environment was appointed on an annual basis, what advances could be made? Thankfully, the present Lord Mayor of Dublin has been trying to maintain a certain level of continuity during his term of office, but the next Lord Mayor could hold completely different views.  The term of office for the Lord Mayor of Dublin should exceed more than one year.  Some people may disagree because they have not had an opportunity to be Lord Mayor and I have.  It is pointless appointing people to that office as a reward for services.  Such appointments are an opportunity to serve, and without begging the Government of the day, a great deal could be done for the prestige of the office to promote the city's needs and the same applies to the new local authorities.</P>
    <P>The report of the Lord Mayor's Commission on Housing is probably the best housing report published since 1914.  It contains a number of imaginative proposals. I hope that new ways of providing funding for housing will be addressed by the Minister and that the contents of that <Col N="947" /> report will be taken on board.  One of the members of that commission has since been appointed assistant city manager for housing.  I hope he is requested to implement the general contents of that report, but in particular the proposals dealing with the need to refurbish inner city flats.  I appeal to the Minister to put on the agenda a seven year plan to refurbish all inner city flats.  The nature of those flats contributes to the problems of crime and drugs because their inhabitants are living in dark, dank surroundings with broken sewers.  Those flats must be refurbished. The report outlines how that can be done and it must be given priority if this city is to remain a living city.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the transfer of housing and the landbank to the county authorities, but I recognise the problems associated with this.  Dublin Corporation owns many houses in Tallaght for which it collects rent and is responsible for maintaining.  Local councillors have no say in regard to those houses.  That is an anomalous position and must be changed.  However, if it is changed in such a way that the city has nowhere to house its population many problems will arise, because there is not much space in the inner city to build new houses.  The Minister should consider a common housing list for the citizens of both Dublin city and county so that people can be considered for housing in any area of Dublin irrespective of where they live. The houses in Tallaght owned by the corporation should form part of the Dublin housing list; they should not be restricted to housing people from the inner city.  Councillors in County Dublin must have a say and people from the inner city are entitled to be housed.  A common housing list for all citizens of Dublin would resolve the problem.  I hope the Minister will consider that matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate for the Dublin region.  This Bill involves a process of continued reorganisation of local government which began more than <Col N="948" /> ten years ago.  We are now moving towards the final lap in relation to the structures.  What we are discussing here will have major repercussions for communities in all of County Dublin and some of its surrounding regions.</P>
      <P>The people of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown fared well to retain the old name for its new local authority and the same applies to Fingal.  However, I am unhappy with the South Dublin name, which is merely a geographic location. Many other names could have been chosen for the local authority and I hope this is not the end of the matter so far as the name of that authority is concerned. The name of &ldquo;Belgard&rdquo; was proposed at a committee and I am sure many other names were put forward.  I would like the South Dublin authority to be given a title which would be more apt as the local authority develops its own tradition and history.  I know the Minister is amendable to such a change eventually.</P>
      <P>In the short time available to me I want to refer to a few areas, some of which have already been referred to, but I would like to bring my own thinking to bear on them.  The first relates to housing. Deputy Mitchell, who has wide experience in that area as a member of Dublin Corporation, to some extent put forward the corporation's case.  The officials of Dublin Corporation have done tremendous work in times of great social change in this city in the past 20 years.  They have had to grapple with what would be termed in any major city as housing problems of great magnitude and they have done a good job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as housing is concerned, the main difficulties relate to county areas and the fact that Dublin Corporation developed 7,500 houses in County Dublin for us by tenants on the Dublin Corporation housing list.  Those houses were built to meet a specific need for people living in inner city areas in unhealthy housing conditions and who needed decent accommodation.  That objective was certainly achieved by Dublin Corporation. Perhaps it was the background to the development of the housing stock and our failure to understand the social <Col N="949" /> consequences of such large scale housing being provided by the corporation away from its administrative area, and our failure to understand the effects of such housing policy that gave rise to the problems in the county.  The first problem arose for the tenants many of whom were plucked from a city environment in which they had the support of the extended family and knew the local community and transported to newly developing towns like Tallaght, Clondalkin and Blanchardstown. The result was that the whole social fabric of the life they lived &mdash; I accept that it led to a considerable amount of ill health because of bad housing conditions &mdash; was destroyed albeit for the best of reasons.  Unfortunately, at the time, social scientists failed to make their voices heard to prevent the major catastrophe that developed.  That is why there was so much unhappiness and discontent in the newer towns and in the corporation housing developments, a discontent that was generally not found in its sister authority housing developments, those built by Dublin County Council, because the people in those developments were from the area or had an affinity with the county.  That discontent was one of the social consequences of the corporation policy.</P>
    <P>No matter how fair-minded one tried to be in examining the corporation's record in the county, one would have to conclude that the corporation did not provide the resources to maintain and manage their housing estates in the county.  There was probably a good reason for that from the point of view of the corporation in that I understand that the net rental income from a local authority house is far below the cost of maintaining the house.  The average rent per week is £7 per house and the average maintenance cost per week is between £12 and £13.  Financially there was nothing in it for the corporation to encourage it to maintain its housing stock.</P>
    <P>If one examines the structure of the corporation's effort to provide maintenance and management of the housing stock one will see that it was very limited. <Col N="950" /> Usually an old house taken over in the acquisition of land, was turned into a housing maintenance depot.  One could not possibly provide adequate management and maintenance to a large housing stock through such limited facilites. Another point is that the corporation would build 1,500 houses as part of one housing estate and that would end its commitment to the area.  It would not see that it had a responsibility to assist in the provision of community centre facilities, proper development of parks and local spaces.  Generally speaking that was left to the county council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>We developed Tallaght centre; it was our land and our negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very interesting interjection.  The difficulty is that the corporation continues to draw out of the Tallaght town centre a very substantial rental income which, as far as I can see, is not ploughed into the local community. Those of us who represent Tallaght, and the people who live in Tallaght, resent the fact that Dublin Corporation benefited financially to such a great extent because 15 years ago they had the money to buy huge tracts of land in the county. The corporation now feels justified in clawing back from the investment of 15 years ago half of the total rental income generated by the town centre.  If I asked the corporation to spell out how it was using that money I would be surprised if it was using any perceptible amount of it in Tallaght, Clondalkin or Blanchardstown. That is our problem with regard to the development of the Square and the town centre lands in Tallaght and the corporation's involvement in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The transfer of the housing stock in the county from the corporation to the county and the three new councils will pose a problem for the corporation in meeting the housing needs of applicants for accommodation.  We will have to try to come to some arrangement in that regard.  The suggestion by Deputy Mitchell that we develop a common housing list for all of County Dublin has been <Col N="951" /> around for some time, but it is only in that way that we will be able to accommodate the needs of Dublin Corporation who will still have substantial numbers on its housing list.  In any transfer of property that issue will have to be taken into account.  I hope the report to come from the new councils in conjunction with Dublin Corporation will address this issue quickly.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the need for co-ordination.  Without co-ordination he will have serious difficulties.  Each local authority should provide all the services expected of such a body without relying on contracting out to other local authorities for services.  If we are to have genuine independent local authorities they ought to have the capacity to plan and to provide all the services which the general public expect of them.  The fire service, for instance, is provided under contract to Dublin County Council by Dublin Corporation.  Under this legislation, Dún Laoghaire Corporation is to contract with the corporation to provide a service.  From an efficiency point of view that may have some merit but, apart from extinguishing fires, a fire service provides a range of services associated with fire safety in local areas.  In considering the delivery of fire services in the regions it would be better for each county council to provide the service independently because Tara Street will appear remote as the command and control centre from places like Blanchardstown, Tallaght, Clondalkin and north County Dublin.</P>
    <P>Planning and development has caused serious concern over the past number of years.  With the outward development pressure from the city many difficulties have occurred and been associated with the need for good planning and development. The system is gradually being brought into disrepute.  In the five year development plan, and the reviews of it, we need to critically examine the operation of that aspect of local authority development and provision of services, particularly due to the <i>ad hoc</i> manner in which development is taking place.  In <Col N="952" /> this regard rezoning seems to be based on land ownership.  I was a member of Dublin County Council for 12 years and always considered the requirements in a particular area rather than allow development extend into the country and be based on land ownership, hedgerow contours and access to a piece of ground.  It always struck me that that was an unusual way to proceed in planning the development of the city as it expanded outwards. I hope therefore that will be done.  Perhaps the issue could be considered in a consultative process, with the new local authorities indicating once and for all the way forward.</P>
    <P>The new county councils will be expected to touch the lives of the people they serve.  However, I put it to the Minister that there is a great number of weaknesses in the current legislation which need to be addressed.  First &mdash; this impinges on my own area &mdash; there are defects in the Animals Act, 1985.  As those of us who live in the outer regions of Dublin know, that legislation was introduced to deal with the serious problem posed by wandering horses, particularly in some of the bigger housing estates on the outskirts of Dublin.  Unfortunately, the penalty to be imposed on an owner who allows an animal to wander along the roadside, in an open space or in a housing estate is so small as to be meaningless.  It is my understanding that the Minister for Justice would have to amend the regulations before pound keepers or the local authorities could charge for the service they provide.  This would be separate from the pound fee of £27. If the local authorities were allowed to recover their collection costs this problem, which is the source of concern for residents from the point of view of the safety of children, would be eliminated overnight.</P>
    <P>We also need to address the issue of the inability of local authorities to draw up bylaws speedily.  Those of us who have served on a local authority know that from time to time they are required to draw up bylaws dealing with various aspects of their operations.  For example, they are required to draw up bylaws for <Col N="953" /> public parks.  This can be a torturous process, given that the bylaws have to be submitted to the Minister for Justice, the Garda Síochána and the Minister for the Environment.  As it takes so long to complete the process, people soon become disenchanted, particularly if there are delays in implementing the bylaws, which are designed to benefit local communities.</P>
    <P>At present bylaws are being drawn up &mdash; this will be of interest to those of us who live in the Dublin region &mdash; to prohibit the parking of heavy goods vehicles in housing estates.  Even though this is a major problem it will take many years to complete the process.  The bylaws in draft form were submitted to the Department of the Environment.  The Department transferred them to the Garda Commissioner, who will return them to the Department of the Environment, which in turn will send them back to the local authority.  It should be borne in mind that many children live in housing estates and there is a danger they could run out from behind or under one of these heavy goods vehicles.  Indeed, there has been a number of fatalities. I cite these issues as reasons for strengthening these new authorities and giving them more teeth.</P>
    <P>We also need to address the question of funding &mdash; the old chestnut.  In the mid-eighties the allocation made from the Exchequer began to fall.  Even though some minor adjustments have been made from year to year, until such time as the local authorities can raise finance to complement the funds allocated from the Exchequer they will always find themselves in a difficult and precarious position financially and will not be able to meet the legitimate needs or provide the services people are entitled to in their respective administrative areas.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I hope these new authorities will be very active within their own areas, provide the facilities that one would normally expect them to provide, be keen to implement whatever supporting legislation is enacted and become developmental authorities in their own right in order to increase commercial <Col N="954" /> activity, thereby increasing the number of employment opportunities.  That is the role I would like to see them play in the future.  I wish the Minister well in implementing the legislation and ask him to take into account the points raised by those of us who have experience in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>The more I listen to the debate the more I wonder if we are doing the right thing in seeking to put this legislation through the House.  I must admit that this thought crossed my mind a number of times as I listened to the previous speaker, Deputy Flood.  He mentioned that there is a need to address the question of finance.  He is right; if local government is to be independent it must be able to raise funds and spend the money in accordance with its priorities. However, that issue is not dealt with in the legislation.  The previous Government gave a commitment that it would reorganise local government.  I wonder if we are doing the right thing in seeking to put this legislation through the House in advance of the major reorganisation of local government given that crucial issues, such as the question of finance, will have to be addressed.</P>
      <P>I also listened to what my colleague, Deputy Gay Mitchell, had to say.  He placed the emphasis on the necessity for co-ordination.  In this regard both he and the previous speaker mentioned, in view of the problems encountered, that there is a need for a common housing list in Dublin and that problems might arise in relation to the fire services.  Therefore are we doing the right thing in dividing up the country four ways?</P>
      <P>I believe &mdash; Deputy Mitchell also made this point &mdash; that we do not put Dublin first.  It is not generally understood just how great the problems are in Dublin in terms of unemployment, crime and other social problems to which the previous speaker referred.  It is everyone's capital city, not just Dubliners.  Insufficient emphasis has been put on its problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other areas have their lobby groups, some of which have been very successful; others not so successful, as we saw this <Col N="955" /> week in relation to the Shannon stopover. However, the west has been particularly successful because its public representatives and local communities have made the effort, but we never see a similar lobby group in Dublin.  If one lifts a local newspaper in County Mayo or County Cork one will often see photographs of a local gaelic football team along with the number of players on that team who have emigrated.  One does not see anything similar in Dublin, but every day there could be photographs of that sort in Dublin in regard to emigration. Is there anything in this Bill which will remedy that and enable our capital city to take up its premier position?  Part of the problem is that in the past &mdash; and in the future if this Bill goes through &mdash; Dublin has been divided between the corporation, the county council and Dún Laoghaire.  Now we are to have four local authorities.  Who will speak for Dublin in that context?  I would prefer to see one greater Dublin authority linked to maybe a dozen local district councils which would give local accountability and local representation.  Then Dublin, as the capital city could speak with one voice to the rest of the country and the rest of the world.</P>
    <P>There was a reference to the election of mayors in Jerusalem and in New York and a valid point was made in that respect.  I would like to see the Mayor of Dublin directly elected by the citizens of Dublin, which would give the first citizen of this city some clout and authority. Making him directly responsible for running the city would add to the efficiency of our local government.  Instead of going in the direction of this Bill we ought to be going in the opposite direction.  Dublin is discriminated against, but that is largely because Dubliners discriminate against themselves; they do not put their city first and they do not have the right sort of authority.</P>
    <P>That is not to say I am against democratic local government and some of my remarks about a directly elected mayor bear that out.  I also strongly believe in subsidiarity, a word that came from our <Col N="956" /> colleagues and neighbours in the European Community, which caused concern to some people.  By &ldquo;subsidiarity&rdquo; I mean that public services should be involved to the lowest practicable level at which they can be discharged efficiently and effectively.</P>
    <P>I wonder about the relevance of our local authorities to the electorate at present.  To what extent do people think they are getting good service from their elected councillors?  A recent survey in the <i>Evening Herald</i> came to the conclusion that two-thirds of Dubliners have no faith in their local councillors and that more than half do not know the name of even one of their local councillors in their ward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">

      <P>There are some prominent members in Dublin West.  More than half of Dubliners do not know the name of even one of their county councillors even in cases where they are also elected Members of this House and, to that extent, get greater publicity.  That is appalling.  It suggests that the cynicism I detected at a very early stage of my political career on this side of the Border is rampant.  Nor am I too sure that our councils, the county council and the corporation, deserve to be called efficient.  I have heard praise of the councils for their efficiency and, I suppose, they are reasonably efficient.  Maybe I require a bit more.  Was it Swift who said: &ldquo;For forms of Government that fools contest, that which is best administerd is best&rdquo;?  I do not necessarily agree with all that, but there is something to be said for it.  I looked through my constituency files and I see that I wrote a letter to Dublin County Council of 8 February last about a roadway in my constituency where I personally counted 14 rotten trees, some of which have fallen.  Before that others <Col N="957" /> had also fallen across the road and they are a great danger to people driving and walking along it.  I first wrote on 8 February and again on 31 March.  The trees are still there but I have not even received a reply from Dublin County Council telling me what action, if any, it intends to take on this matter.  That is not the only example.  I could give many, and I have given recent chairpersons of Dublin County Council examples of letters that have not been replied to.  Maybe they just pay attention to elected councillors. I am at a disadvantage, being a second class citizen; I am only a TD for the area.  Therefore, I am not sure of their efficiency; nor am I too sure of their sensitivity to community groupings.</P>
      <P>Nowadays it is a very important function of local authorities to be sensitive to the many hundreds of community groupings. That is one of the differences I noticed from the situation North of the Border were there are not so many community groupings.  Maybe because of the greater availability of finance from Great Britain, community groupings are not thought to be necessary.  Also, because of the divided community in the North there is sometimes difficulty in relation to community groupings.  Certainly, in the context of the number of meetings one is expected to attend, the multiplicity of community groupings is more noticeable in Dublin.  In those circumstances it is very important that the local authority is sensitive to the wishes and demands of those community organisations.  I am not sure they are sufficiently sensitive and maybe that is one of the reasons we should have one greater Dublin authority with, in addition, quite a large number of local councils.  Whatever happens there is a need for increased sensitivity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The transfer of houses to the authority in which they happen to be located makes sense.  There has been an anomaly up to now.  I listened with great interest to what Deputy Flood said about previous housing policy and the moving of people from city centre areas to areas where they have not roots, where there is no community development, etc.  I wonder why people did not learn from the experiences elsewhere, <Col N="958" /> in Britain, in the United States and other places where such a policy was followed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but there is a lot to be said for terraced houses.  Why is there objection to terraced houses?  Great communities live in terraced houses which are fine once they are equipped with modern amenities.</P>
      <P>I hope the new authorities will provide libraries, particularly in Lucan and Palmerstown which have sought such facilities for many years.</P>
      <P>The Minister will be aware of my concern for the protection of the tremendous amenity of the Liffey Valley.  It is a landscape of both national and international importance, our equivalent to the Loire Valley.  Despite the greed of developers, and the stupidity of some of our councillors, this tremendous amenity still survives. It is our responsibility to hand it on to those who will live here hundreds of years from now.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the Minister's proposals in this Bill in dividing the former county council area into three councils will increase rather than diminish the threat to the Liffey Valley.  No one local authority will have responsibility for conserving its unique character.  Coordinating committees or arrangements for co-ordination between county managers are no substitutes for one authority having overall control.  If the Minister intends to push ahead with these proposals he should consider as an alternative, albeit, an unsatisfactory one, the creation of a body with sole responsibility for the preservation of the Liffey Valley and its amenities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other questions arise in the context of this Bill over the future of the Liffey Valley.  The last Government found it necessary, because the council was behaving more like an estate agency than a local authority, to introduce limitations on the use of section 4 motions.  The Local Government Act, 1991 specified that section 4 motions had to have the <Col N="959" /> support of three-quarters of the total membership of a local authority.  It is illogical that such a requirement did not include re-zoning motions which merely require a simple majority of those present at any particular council meeting.  Will the Minister use the opportunity of this Bill to close that loophole?</P>
    <P>Again, the recent re-zonings by Dublin County Council have emphasised the importance of the special amenity area order for the Liffey Valley.  I shudder to think what certain councillors may have done if this order had not been in existence. The order was, of course, very restrictive and there is a necessity to extend it to cover a wider area of the valley.  How will the special amenity area order procedure be affected by the division of the old council into three new councils?  Under section 42 of the 1963 Act, as amended by section 40 (a) of the 1976 Act, a planning authority may declare an area to be an area of special amenity and before it becomes effective it must be confirmed by the Minister. Which new Dublin authority will have responsibility for declaring an extended area of the Liffey Valley to be an area of special amenity?  Again, under the Act the Minister is empowered to direct a planning authority to make a special amenity area order in relation to a specified area.  If the Minister is so minded which of the new local authorities will he direct in relation to the Liffey Valley?</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will give a positive reply to those questions and assure me, and those in the community seriously concerned about what has happened in the Liffey Valley and afraid of what may happen in the future, that every possible effort will be made to preserve the unique character of this great national inheritance.</P>
    <P>However, any commitments he may give in these respects do not lift from his shoulders the responsibility to look critically at the re-zonings carried out by Dublin County Council and to utilise his power to require it to vary proposals which are inimical to the amenities of the valley.  I hope in making this demand of <Col N="960" /> the Minister I will have the support of other Members representing Dublin West who signed a public statement urging the members of Dublin County Council to reject all pressures and applications for re-zoning in the Liffey Valley.</P>
    <P>I trust the matters I raised interest the Minister and I believe I raised some matters that are different from those highlighted by other Members.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>Many remarks I wished to make about the Bill were anticipated by my colleague from Dublin West, Deputy Currie.  This Bill represents the implementation of an insipid report, the Barrington report.  Fundamental issues regarding local government, particularly local government in the Dublin region, were not addressed to any great extent by that report.  This matter may have been raised by Donal de Buitléar and I am not aware of any councillors who were involved in compiling the report.  The result has been that today there is a minimalist approach to local government reorganisation and reform.  I appreciate that under the Programme for a Partnership Government it is intended to sign the European Charter on local self-government, but local government has little power here.  Deputy Currie referred to some issues which caused this.  Comparing Ireland to other European countries including Britain, which is a fairly centralised State, and with the possible exception of France, one will find that not much power is given to local councillors to effect serious changes in their localities.  I realise that the Minister and the Ministers of State intend to transfer more powers in respect of traffic management, the environment and many aspects of what were in the past executive powers, to local authorities.  However, the overwhelming impression is that little power is devolved to local government and this Bill does not address this matter, particularly in relation to the key issues of funding and responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the leader of the Civil Alliance group on Dublin Corporation, I am aware that the issue of funding is a vital one.  The corporation do not have service <Col N="961" /> charges and we have not had them since my predecessor, the present Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, negotiated their abolition approximately seven years ago. Since then we have had to eke out an existence, with severe restraint being exercised by some officials, to keep the programme of civic government on the rails.  For three-and-half bitter years before this Partnership Government entered office the corporation received no increase in its rate support grant.  The grant amounted to £23 million each year for a period of years.  Unfortunately in this area the dead hand of the Department of the Environment is visible restricting any genuine local development in our city.  This Government increased the rate support grant by 2.5 per cent, bringing it to £23.5 million.  The budget of that authority for 1993 was £220 million an indication that Dublin Corporation is the largest local authority and has the largest workforce.  It is faced with the prospect of running the capital city on a restricted budget.  However, the Bill does not attempt to address the question of funding.  The Barrington report revealed that county councils recieve 44 per cent of their income from Government.  Dublin Corporation receives less than 20 per cent of its income from Government and it is expected to run and develop the capital city.  If the corporation received financial support equivalent to the amount it collected in domestic rates which were abolished in 1977, it would now receive a Government grant of between £55 million and £60 million.</P>
    <P>This Government must address the problem of local government funding. Some of my colleagues in Dublin City Council have proposed repeatedly &mdash; it deserves examination &mdash; that a set portion of VAT be allocated to local government, perhaps 10 per cent or £200 million.  This money should be allocated to all the local authorities each year. Nobody expects fundamental reform of local government funding until there is reform of national funding.  I would ask the Minister for Finance to bear in mind on completion of the Estimates that there is need for fundamental reform of personal <Col N="962" /> taxation, particularly of the low paid, if people are to make direct contributions to local government.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes no attempt to address the fundamental issue of responsibility. A previous Lord Mayor spoke on this matter this evening.  The reason the spirit of Frank Hall, Ballymagash politics, is still around is that there is no clear centre of power in local government.  What happens is that 37 mandarins in the Department of the Environment tell the city managers what to do &mdash; the dead hand is inflicted on our land.  Responsibility should be transferred to the localities. An official in the Department of the Environment oversees the work of our city and county managers.  Why is that necessary?  Why can these people not carry out their responsibilities under their own steam?  The question of responsibility for local government has not been addressed, certainly in Dublin and, I imagine, in other counties.</P>
    <P>In an addendum to the Barrington report, Dr. Donal de Buitléar proposed that Dublin and other counties should have an elected chief executive.  Those of us who have served in local government understand the reason behind that proposal. At meeting after meeting officials have one agenda while political representatives have a different agenda; it is a game of cat and mouse.  Recently in Dublin, in anticipation of the new councils, the cat and mouse game moved into the general arena, with Dublin County Council carrying out functions for the city and Dublin City Council carrying out functions for the county, with nobody taking responsibility.</P>
    <P>The 1955 Act gives power to dismiss a county manager and his officials, but this is a power which people would be very loath to use.  In general the executive function lies with management and very often responsibility for local government falls between two stools.  We should consider in the future the possibility of allowing people of vision to stand for election to be leaders of local government.  I know that we would have to consider the dual mandate &mdash; this matter is referred to in the Barrington report &mdash; which people <Col N="963" /> would be loath to give up, and that certain arrangements would have to be made for Deputies who would no longer be in touch with the run-of-the-mill matters of local government.  In Britain nobody expects county councillors to be Members of Parliament.  New thinking is required in the area of responsibility and funding.</P>
    <P>I share the reservations of my two colleagues in that Dublin is not four counties or four regions &mdash; there is one Dublin.  It is a single civic and cultural entity and it should be ruled as such.  When local government originated in 1898 the British had the sense to operate a single local authority in Dublin and there were various townships around the city under the control of the corporation.  Since 1922, as Declan Kiberd has very eloquently said, Dublin has been a centre dominated by a periphery.  The people who represent Dublin are getting tired of the position whereby we do not get our fair share of national funding.  There are huge districts with 90 per cent unemployment.  While I welcome the increase in Structural Funds, we are still getting only 84 per cent <i>per capita</i>.  If that position prevailed in Connemara, Mayo or elsewhere there would be grave dissatisfaction with such an unfair division of Government funds.</P>
    <P>It is time Dublin politicians stood up for their city.  The division of the city is a device to weaken its voice.  In the past people said there could not be a single Dublin council with 120 or 130 members. In Moscow there are about 500 members on the council and in Paris there are several hundred members on the local authority.  Before Lady Thatcher abolished the old London council it was comprised of well over 100 people.  If we had local government with real power, taking real action and with its own funding arrangements, there is no reason that there could not be a single voice for Dublin, with perhaps an executive elected for three to five years.  I do not accept that Dublin is too big.  The real reason for not wanting a single authority is, as a former corporation official said, that Dublin, because of its big population, <Col N="964" /> is perceived in this House as a threat to national Government. However, that is not the case.  I have no desire to run Wexford, Kildare, Tipperary or Wicklow, but I want to run Dublin and local politicians should have a real say in running the city.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation, because it consists of 7,000 of the 10,000 people working in the local authorities in Dublin and because it runs the fire service, water service, library service and many other services, has principal responsibility for Dublin, but areas such as Clondalkin, Tallaght and so on are perhaps not fully represented.  The case I make is strengthened by the fact that many people said here today that we should have a single housing authority covering the four new councils.  Similarly, instead of having three vocational education committees, one single authority would suffice.  The division of Dublin authorities gives rise to many problems.  For example, proposals were put forward recently to rezone massive areas in Coolock and Baldoyle on the border of my constituency, proposals which would greatly affect my constituency in terms of housing, roads and other areas.  However nobody informed us of this matter until the night before the Baldoyle rezoning when I received a note from a developer informing me of what was happening.  There is no co-ordination in these matters and that is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the logic of this Bill.  I will have to support it but I will be working to change it.  One glaring anomaly is the fact that the Howth ward is included with Fingal County.  There is no logic whatsoever behind this provision.  The northern boundary of the city, including the areas of Donaghmede, Kilbarrack, Sutton, Baldoyle and Howth, is a single entity and these areas were much more effectively run under the control of Dublin Corporation.  In the last number of years there has been much unhappiness with many of the decisions taken. I am glad the Minister, Deputy Smith, acted decisively to bring to a conclusion the recent flooding saga in the area. There was great dissatisfaction with the <Col N="965" /> response of Dublin County Council to the tragic events earlier in the summer in the Baldoyle area.</P>
    <P>There is a deep affection for Dublin Corporation and Dublin City Council in the Howth area and I ask the Minister, even at this late stage, to look again at sections 8 and 10 to see if the Howth ward could be included as part of Dublin Corporation.  I should say that this would be of no political advantage to me as, unfortunately, there is no Labour Party representative in that ward.  Nevertheless, I would be happy to welcome the four councillors for the area from the other parties into Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>Section 35 and the Third Schedule deal with the transfer of responsibility for certain dwellings and land.  This proposal has significant implications for the finances of Dublin Corporation and future development. At present Dublin Corporation has control, so to speak of 8,000 houses out of a total of approximately 17,000 houses. This means that a large chunk of the houses available for inclusion in our list of tenants is located in the county.  I understand why Deputy Lawlor and other members of Dublin County Council regard it as right and democratic that the people living in these houses should be represented by local representatives. However, local representatives on Dublin Corporation will be left in dire straits if they do not have some access to the transfer and housing allocation lists for the three new councils, particularly the list for the South Dublin area where there are many large housing estates to which many of the people on our housing list will be transferred.</P>
    <P>The proposals in regard to land will probably have the most detrimental effects on Dublin Corporation.  Deputy Currie referred to this issue earlier. During the past 50 years Dublin Corporation has built up land banks of a few hundred acres in the county area.  This issue has been discussed previously in the House and everybody accepts that we do not want huge soulless estates without any community facilities to be built again. Nevertheless, under Part II of the Third <Col N="966" /> Schedule all that land will be transferred to the new councils.  The Minister has set out very explicit instructions for the transfer of that land &mdash; for example, the way in which it is to be transferred. However, the point needs to be made that Dublin Corporation after this transfer will have very little land left on which to construct houses.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the Government has restarted the housing programme and I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, and the Minister, Deputy Smith, for their efforts in this regard.  The list available to us at present tells us that there are approximately 1,151 sites &mdash; about two-thirds of these have been built on &mdash; available for housing construction. Dublin Corporation has been asked to build 500 new houses each year.  If our land in the county area is transferred to the new councils we will have run out of space on which to build houses within six months.  I ask the Minister to look again at section 35 and the Third Schedule between now and Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>A previous speaker referred to terraced houses.  I think most people would agree that over the past two-three years an attempt has been made by Dublin Corporation under the Civic Charter to revitalise the city.  This has been successfully done in parts of the city where tax incentives are given to buy houses.  If some of the land available at present to Dublin Corporation is transferred to the new councils we will have no option but to build flat complexes.  Otherwise, we will not be able to provide any housing for the homeless.  As I said, Dublin Corporation raises 90 per cent of the funding and if we are to keep down commercial rates some of the policies in regard to land will have to be looked at again.</P>
    <P>Irish local government is still too centralised. We have not dealt with the problems of funding and responsibility.  I still remain to be convinced of the need for four counties in an area where there is one society.  I ask the Minister to look again at the Howth ward.  There should be some common authority for housing and the transfer of land should take place over a long period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate.  I share some of the concerns outlined by the previous speaker and other Deputies who have contributed to the debate.  I welcome this Bill in so far as it goes some way towards solving the problems in Dublin County Council, an unwieldly and unworkable entity where vital planning decisions are often made by people who live many miles away from the area concerned, who have no intimate knowledge of the area and who are not directly accountable.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons it is possible for controversial planning decisions to be made by Dublin County Council &mdash; I want to be careful about the terms I use as I do not want to join the band wagon which attacks people for making certain decisions and ascribes certain motives to them &mdash; is that many of the decision-makers have no knowledge of the areas to which the decision relates.  It is clear that Dublin County Council is too big.</P>
      <P>The previous speaker felt that Dublin should not be divided.  However, I do not think there could be any real local democracy in Dublin if it was taken as a unit.  Our spokesperson, Deputy Doyle, made the point very strongly that we do not know whether this Bill deals with the bottom or central tier of the long term proposals for the Dublin area &mdash; we do not have any idea of what the top tier, the regional structure, will be like.  A letter from the Department gives a broad outline of the Minister's intentions to set up a regional structure for Dublin whose members will be appointed from the existing local authorities and who will have broad directive functions.  This letter leaves many questions unanswered. The Minister promised that we would have detailed proposals in this area five-eight weeks ago.  These proposals should have been outlined in advance of the debate of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The success of the proposed changes is very much dependent on a proper regional structure.  Many of the problems which arise from this change could be ameliorated if an adequate regional structure was in place.  This is typical of <Col N="968" /> the way we go about business in this House.</P>
    <P>Like many other speakers, I regard this Bill as an incremental approach to reform of local government in the Dublin area. These reforms do not take into account local areas, local communities and old traditional towns, where people have an identity with their areas.  In my constituency, which accounts for perhaps one-eighth of the entire Dublin city area, there are three or four clearly identifiable local communities.  It is vitally important that we know how they will interrelate. As I said, we do not know the full picture, yet it is proposed to make changes which will have radical consequences.  As previous speakers have said, this issue could be solved if there was sufficient clarity about the regional structure, its powers to intervene, etc.</P>
    <P>Another point raised by Deputies Mitchell and Broughan was that very few capital cities in Europe, are administered in the same way as Dublin.  Most of them have directly elected or directly appointed mayors who hold office for long terms and are accountable to the public or to the Government, depending on their structures.  The local authority mechanism, that very difficult relationship between manager and councillor, may be a receipe for lack of progress in the context of the huge demands involved in running a capital city the size of Dublin.  The systems in Amsterdam or Paris are entirely different, there is either directly elected accountability or accountability to the Government in the form of the appointment of a person who comprises executive as well as political power.  To take such a direction would represent real reform in Dublin because we are simply tinkering with the existing system without implementing any fundamental changes apart from geographical.</P>
    <P>While this Bill breaks down what had become an unrepresentative structure into smaller units it does not respond to demands for more fundamental reform or to any level of localisation of democracy. Many councillors suggested they would have preferred the option of <Col N="969" /> having a larger number of smaller authorities based on tradition.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the &ldquo;Dublin&rdquo; issue. In talking to some of my colleagues from different parts of the city and from the independent &ldquo;kingdom&rdquo; of Dún Laoghaire, who see themselves as becoming a part of Dublin now, it is obvious they have a particular view about their identity but, traditionally, Dublin City and county have an integrated identity. Without an indication from the Minister as to how strong the regional structures will be and how this cultural identity will be maintained, we are working within limits.  Like other councillors, I believe in the maintenance of that identity and the need for Dublin to work together for its future development, particularly in the context of the undoubted decline in employment, the decline in its quality of life in recent years and its failure to attract sufficient Government and EC investment on a scale comparable with other parts of the country.  This is due mainly to a dissipation of efforts and, in the context of implementing reform such as this, it is important for that identity to be maintained.</P>
    <P>I wonder why &ldquo;Dublin&rdquo; is not retained in the titles for the new county councils. That may appear to be a very simple point but it is significant and symbolic and would retain the integrated identity which nobody wishes to lose.</P>
    <P>This legislation arises as a consequence of vital decisions in the 1950s and 1960s in relation to the future development of Dublin.  Up to 1953 the traditional response to the growth of the city was to expand the city boundary, which was done on a regular basis.  However, since then we had the famous planning analysis of the city which identified the need to establish the three satellite towns of Tallaght, Clondalkin and Blanchardstown. It was decided the city should no longer wantonly be allowed to expand while the county diminished but that the county should be developed based on these three new townships.  That was a fundamental decision for Dublin which was not without its measure of controversy and ultimately <Col N="970" /> led to where we are today, dividing Dublin County Council into three regional counties, thereby leaving Dublin largely intact at its current size.</P>
    <P>I share the view of other Deputies in regard to Howth.  We are very fond of Howth, it was always part of the city and I believe its people regret no longer belonging to the city.  It is a traditional port and entertainment centre of the north city and the logical extension of the bay from Dún Laoghaire.  We miss it and I gather it misses us, according to its local representatives.  This issue was raised by a number of Deputies and I would be interested in hearing the Minister's response.</P>
    <P>One of the issues about which councillors are most concerned in this city is the proposals in the latter part of the Bill and developed in detail in the Schedules involving the transfer of lands and property. In principle, I agree that planning decisions and the maintenance of local authority property in a general sense &mdash; particularly housing &mdash; is best carried out by the relevant local authority.  However, traditionally cities have been unable to provide inner cities for their own housing needs within their catchment areas and traditionally city centres have had to provide housing for their people.  This occurs in the private sector and it is something we do not try to control.  The proposed constraints on Dublin Corporation, as a result of the blanket implementation of this policy of transfer of lands, would mean that the housing needs of Dublin &mdash; there are approximately 5,000 people on the housing list &mdash; would have to be met from the city's resources.</P>
    <P>If this proposal were to be implemented all the land bank Dublin Corporation acquired for housing would have to be handed over to the county council with the question of compensation being very vague indeed.  This morning the Minister intervened during Deputy Doyle's contribution to make the point that compensation should not be presumed in any situation.  If the Minister is prejudging provisions in the Bill, on the basis that he anticipates a negative response in the case of Dublin, there will <Col N="971" /> be alarm in Dublin Corporation about the consequences of such an attitude on our financial stability and on our ability to provide housing for the many people in this city who require it immediately and who will need it in the future.</P>
    <P>The consequences for us have been partly outlined already by many speakers in the course of the day.  Deputies Gay Mitchell and Broughan, colleagues of mine on the City Council, referred to the fact that we have 8,000 dwellings in the county built and maintained for us.  I receive weekly the list of housing vacancies from Dublin Corporation.  I read them with the usual interest of a person who goes to a clinic in Ballymun and Finglas where there are many anxious people seeking housing.  Every week, in the context of housing, Tallaght, Clondalkin and Blanchardstown provide for us, I would say, 75 per cent of the houses. In the city we have many flats but essentially it is houses that are provided in those areas.  Therefore they comprise a very important part of our housing stock, of our ability to meet the needs of people in the city.</P>
    <P>If that is to be taken away from us without compensation how are we to provide for those people?  We do not know whether the regional authority will have an ability to pick up the deficit by way of providing a communal housing list.  It is clear that there is no anticipation that it would have any administrative functions but that it would be largely advisory.  Are we to depend on their goodwill to take on the tenants of Dublin Corporation and add them to their lists, which I am sure are already under pressure?  What is to happen Dublin Corporation's housing list?  Are the Minister and the Government saying that they want us to revert to building inner city flats on a large scale, given their history, the movement away from them and the traditional desire for people, particularly those with small children, to live in houses?  I do not say that inner city flats will not have a role to play, but are we to be confined to that concept in the context of the kind of land available at this point in time?  For example, we <Col N="972" /> have only 1,151 sites with 500 of those already committed.  In the absence of compensation for acquiring additional sites, which within the city context would be extremely expensive &mdash; particularly if we are to adhere to traditional housing &mdash; the issues here are not ones that can be ridden over rough shod.  I was very concerned to hear the Minister's remark this morning, that the question of compensation is something nobody should presume.  I took the trouble of getting copies of the Official Report to ascertain exactly what he said, because it was by way of an intervention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Joe Jacob">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of housing is the most critical one in that context.  If compensation is fair and reasonable, perhaps it is something we can resolve &mdash; not easily &mdash; but certainly we would have some capacity to resolve it.  But without compensation effectively we would have no ability to respond to the housing needs of the city of Dublin.  Indeed, we will have closed off the traditional avenues of housing for the people of the city of Dublin, whether in the private or public, because many private people find they cannot afford the cost of accommodation in the city and initially find their first home in the suburbs.  My own parents did so when Finglas was a suburb and was in the county at the time, a little rural village. That has been the practice and pattern. People have been doing so privately in Tallaght, Clondalkin and Blanchardstown. But if we are to say to our local authority tenants that henceforth that avenue will be closed off to them, that is an issue that will need to be resolved.  There are a number of ways of resolving it, but it will require some flexibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On top of the housing land there is also our development land, a valuable resource which has kept our local authority liquid on many occasions when they have been owed money by Government and by other sources.  It is land used to <Col N="973" /> develop facilities for residential areas, which provided the basis for the Tallaght Town Centre and was held to respond to our other function of providing for industrial development.  While some of those properties are already the subject of negotiations, nevertheless under the provisions of this Bill a significant land bank for development will be ceded, to the new local authorities.  The question of compensation for the corporation is very confused.  The Minister may or may not approve &mdash; and, based on what he said here this morning, it seems more likely to be the &ldquo;may not&rdquo; rather than the &ldquo;may&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There are very substantial issues arising for Dublin.  I do not think anybody would like to be facing the problem they face in the south county area, in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, where there is a £22 million deficit.  It would be unfortunate if we were to be penalised or not adequately compensated for one of the wise investments we made on behalf of the people of Dublin ten years that gained for the citizens of Dublin, for the Exchequer and the Department of the Environment a valuable asset which might otherwise simply have gone into the private sector.</P>
    <P>So far as it goes in terms of reform, I welcome this Bill.  It is incremental.  It is tiny either in the context of genuine local structures one might have liked.  But so far as the provisions of the Bill represents a step towards breaking up a structure that was large and unwieldy, I welcome it.  But because the reforms needed to render administration in Dublin effective are so large, I predict we will be returning to the Bill over many decades.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that this Bill is before the House today is evidence of a decisive attempt to tackle the restructuring of local government in the greater Dublin area.  There is a lot of merit in what is intended, but a follow-up with, pragmatic financial underpinning and coordinated decision making is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had the duty of chairing the Eastern Regional Development Organisation for seven or eight years.  We examined a <Col N="974" /> number of the issues covered by the provisions of this Bill.  We endeavoured to examine the blueprint for the eastern region, to ascertain what should and should not be done.  We sought to rise above the parochialism of petty government arguments in order to do the right thing, while ensuring there was community involvement in local government. That is the balance that needs to be struck and which we endeavoured to strike.</P>
    <P>When I first stood for public office in the seventies I had only one cottage in north Clondalkin to canvass, whereas today 8,000 houses make up what is known as north Clondalkin.  There has been much discussion, controversy and analysis of planning and planning disasters. Tragically, north Clondalkin is the only part of the country that so far has warranted the establishment of a task force to combat urban crime.  That is the single greatest indictment of planning disasters that have taken place in this city and county.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flaherty and her colleagues here from Dublin Corporation over the past ten to 15 years do not appear to know what was done in their names in County Dublin.  They are pleading here for hope for their areas.  I do not hear them plead for areas such as Neilstown, Rolestown or Quarryvale, estates built by Dublin Corporation.  Those estates are there today and it is our responsibility to complete them.  Deputy Rabbitte carries some of the burden in Tallaght.  The satellite town of Blanchardstown is also in my constituency.  This very day there are 6,000 Dublin Corporation sites &mdash; mainly waste land and badly managed &mdash; in Clondalkin and Lucan.  There are 10,000 Dublin Corporation sites in Blanchardstown and approximately 2,500 in Tallaght.  That was the concept of the butchery enshrined in the Myles Wright report, which recommended the building of four satellite towns on the west side of Dublin.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation bought up all of the land between Clondalkin and Lucan, known today as north Clondalkin, and incorporated it in the 1972 so-called coherent development plan.  As a result <Col N="975" /> we had this planning disaster and we must now do whatever is necessary to rectify it.</P>
    <P>I fully agree with others who have said that there are 5,000 young couples or families on Dublin Corporation housing list qualifying for accommodation.  I agree also that between the canals, within the city boundary, there will not be much progress made in reducing that number. At managerial level Dublin Corporation have had their knuckles sharply rapped this year and it is peculiar that they are now able to produce 500 sites while in all 1,000 sites have been identified.  I should point out that they were there in 1992, in 1991, in 1990 and indeed in 1989, but why were they not getting on with the work?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>It was an incredible disaster visited on the county.  Also it pushed the private sector to the fringes on the south and the north side of the county and raised the price of houses for young couples to excessively high levels.  The position has been reached whereby the whole mish mash that is the horseshoe of County Dublin around the city &mdash; Fingal, Dublin South and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown &mdash; will have their own powers.  I hope that with the underpinning on the financial side we will be able to get some cohesion on what has to be done.  The <Col N="976" /> frustration in the county of trying to deal, at managerial level, with those in City Hall has been aggravating to say the least. I called on the city manager in 1979 and he had with him the housing co-ordinator and the planning manager.  I told them then that the concept of Clondalkin-Lucan would not work and that we would have problems.  They paid me the courtesy of listening, agreeing and nodding but did nothing about it.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will keep a hands-on approach to this reform of local government and that the managerial recommendations contained in the Bill will be given full effect.  There will have to be some interface on the housing situation in the greater Dublin area, for example, the provision of a comprehensive and computerised housing list with a view to bringing about some cohesion in the provision of accommodation for those waiting to be housed. I sympathise with the plight of Dublin Corporation but unfortunately the disentangling of the present system will require managerial action.  I hope that the necessary arrangements, financial and otherwise can be made to allow for implementation of the Bill.  All revenue in this area came from housing capital, it was not raised by the corporation. There was a transfer of £4 million in the late sixties from the Department of Finance to the then Department of Local Government and that resulted in the land bank that was to provide the Tallaght, north Clondalkin and Blanchardstown developments.  It was an attempt to crack the housing crisis in Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>However, that move did not represent a well-thought out philosophy and, unfortunately, left in its wake, many problems.  In regard to the underpinning of finance for local authorities I wrote to the manager of Dublin County Council following a local election when we gave a commitment to the people of the county that we would not impose a water charge.  An inflow of about £6 million in that financial year <Col N="977" /> was projected.  Though there was much hostility and resistence to paying the charge, about £4 million had been collected without any controversy.  In today's figures that would be £10 million. With the permission of the House, I wish to share time with Deputy Eoin Ryan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Joe Jacob">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>That revenue would be in the coffers of Dublin County Council today if, as I asked to have done concerning the subsequent financial year, the manager put a schedule of community spending to the elected council so that we could explain to our local communities how these moneys would be expended.  In that way people would see the advantages coming back to their communities, even if they were being burdened with this extra tax which was a backdoor method of trying to reintroduce rates.  Unfortunately, management did not have the ingenuity to do that. Therefore, it did not come to pass and we never put it to the electorate.  If we as local authority members were in a position to go back to our local communities and go through an expenditure programme where community leaders could see the advantages there might have been some merit in it.  Unfortunately that did not happen.  There has been much hostility both at Department of the Environment level and at local authority level throughout the country about the fact that city and county dwellers are not paying this service charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's predecessors in the Department of the Environment effected cutbacks in revenue to Dublin County Council during difficult times in order to bail out Donegal and other counties including Wexford that were in serious financial difficulties.  The reality is that the workload &mdash; bin collection, public lighting, parks etc., has increased continually due to the build up of populations and costs have increased annually in the Dublin local authority area.  Because transfer funds are not transferred from the Department of the Environment, <Col N="978" /> Dublin is unable to provide that broad range of services.  Much has been achieved in the county by way of community facilities.  Rarely does one see it written down that we have about 8,000 acres of wonderful parkland including Malahide, Marley etc., with some of the finest amenity facilities in western Europe.  In difficult times, management in Dublin County Council has done a fine job.  Focusing on the three new local authorities will allow management be more responsive to the demands and needs of the area.  The priority of the manager in Dublin south will be unemployment, tidying up the difficulties to which I referred earlier and ensuring that industrial investment comes to that part of the county, an area in which Deputy Rabbitte and I have a very great interest.</P>
    <P>The IDA set up five or six excellent industries in the Blanchardstown area and a major corporation from the United States is looking at the county but the Fingal area was able to turn the cartwheels and obtain approval for industrial development for about 80 acres of Dublin Corporation lands zoned for residential purposes in case the project would go to Dublin south.  I hope this type of internal industrial sabotage will not be the order of the day.  We have been successful in attracting large industry to Blanchardstown &mdash; an area I represent &mdash; but we have not been similarly successful on the west side of Dublin.  That is the task that lies ahead.</P>
    <P>In the limited time available to me I will make one further comment.  I sincerely hope the recommendations of the Culliton report, which were applicable to our part of the county, will be implemented and that there will be investment in the base infrastructure to ensure we become a very attractive location.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, in a national population category Dublin is seen as too large and in the provision of full facilities it is probably too small.  The proposed rapid rail systems to areas such as Tallaght, and the other major facilities for populations of 80,000, 90,000 and 100,000 presents an unbalanced economic <Col N="979" /> picture and creates many difficulties. This is not an easy matter to address.  The Bill goes some of the way but there is much more to be done.  I sincerely hope the fragmentation of the county into the three new authorities will give a much greater focus.</P>

I am sure Deputy Rabbitte will recall a meeting he co-chaired between city and county, some of the arguments from which are still being bandied about.  I welcome this Bill.  It is a small part of a programme to give back power to the local authorities.  The general trend has been towards the transfer of power; the Local Government Act, 1991, which removed the <i>ultra vires</i> restrictions, was the beginning of that process.  Reserve functions such as plans for the disposal of waste are being transferred to the new authorities.  Other powers being transferred include, for example, school meals service, school traffic warden service and some aspects of water pollution prevention.  This indicates the lack of real power in local authorities.  The Department of the Environment and the three Ministers involved should aim during the next few years to give power back to local authorities.</P>
      <P>In the main councillors know the problems and how to solve them, but if they are not given the power to deal with them, the problems will remain.  It is soul destroying for members of the local authorities to wait for permission from the Department of the Environment to solve a problem and it adds to the lack of confidence in local government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the years people were relocated from the inner city to the county.  We sometimes forget &mdash; I have fought for inner city renewal since I was elected in 1985 &mdash; that at that time people were living in horrendous slums in the city. It was like something out of Dickens. Housing was a huge political issue and the politicians reacted by having housing estates built in new towns on the outskirts of the city.  Mistakes were made and <Col N="980" /> estates were built in places which had absolutely no facilities.  The corporation is still making mistakes and it is wrong that members of the city council do not recognise that.  The condition of some of the houses and flats has been brought to our attention at meetings and we should do something about it.  We need to address the problem because our failure to do so is not making our job as county councillors any easier.  I am glad the situation is changing slowly.  Tallaght has come on well in the past few years, the Tallaght Shopping Centre has attracted people to the area.  The provision of the regional technical college and the proposed hospital &mdash; I understand there are plans in the pipeline for hotels and so on &mdash; will make Tallaght a very successful town. It has taken Tallaght a long time to get to its present position because mistakes were made in the past and we should recognise that.  Our aim should be to make the local government structures relevant and accessible to the general public.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides for three new local authorities in addition to Dublin Corporation and they must work together rather than in competition.  I would hate to see a mad scramble for businesses. Because of the lack of finance there would be huge pressure on councillors to make decisions purely on financial grounds rather than on good planning grounds.  The Department of the Environment must watch this and it could be monitored by a regional authority comprised of members selected from the four councils.</P>
    <P>I was chairman of the planning committee of Dublin Corporation when our development plan was drawn up and in some cases decisions were taken without the knowledge that a shopping centre of 100,000 sq. feet would be built in an area, making our proposal totally irrelevant. That made for bad planning decisions in the past.  We have many problems in common and that is why it is important to take a regional view.  In the city we had a problem with dereliction &mdash; I think we have solved it and we will not have the doughnut type city which everybody <Col N="981" /> spoke about &mdash; but now there is a great interest in urban renewal and approximately 6,000 to 7,000 apartments have been built or are at the planning stage in the inner city.  The leader of the Civil Alliance in Dublin City Council, Deputy Broughan, said it was responsible.  While of course, Civil Alliance played a part, the Fianna Fáil led council from 1985 to 1991 had a huge impact.  Every single party was involved and this had a dramatic effect.</P>

      <P>Shopping centres on the outskirts of the city could have a detrimental effect on shopping in the inner city.  It is not that we do not want people to be properly serviced but we have to take cognisance of the situation and recognise that problems may be caused for others.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Transport Initiative is an example of a body that takes an overview of the region.  It has made proposals that relate to both the city and county and this gives us a better overview in regard to sorting out the traffic problems.  I believe the Minister should give teeth to a regional authority that can make real decisions and inform the relevant local authority of them.  Unfortunately, time prevents me from making further points.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to make some of the points for Deputy Ryan.  As Members said, I am chairman of Dublin County Council, the local authority being abolished.  My colleagues expect me to speak on this Bill but, unfortunately, I am not as prepared as I would like to be. I hope, unlike the processing of the 1991 Bill, that we will get an opportunity to deal with this in some detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I disagreed with very little of what Deputy Lawlor said.  His analysis, with <Col N="982" /> all due respect to colleagues who have served or are serving members of Dublin City Council, is nearer the historical truth and the explanation of things envolving in the way they have than the contributions of Deputies Flaherty and Ryan.  I regret that I missed Deputy Broughan's contribution, he has a rose tinted view of the machinations of Dublin city hall and its impact on Dublin County.  It is unfortunate if other members see this as a parochial squabble in Dublin.  The Minister's figures this morning show that the population of Dublin county is 547,000 in addition to the 500,000 in Dublin city, a huge population.  Our capital city is a major issue.  We have a legacy of problems and there is no doubt, as Deputy Lawlor says, that the severity of the problems in some of the areas is due to planning decisions made since the 1960s.</P>
    <P>I will refer to Deputy Eoin Ryan's aspiration that the new local authorities would co-operate rather than compete, his underlining of the planning arguments in terms of the future shape of the capital city and the reasons this should happen. Unfortunately, there are no mechanisms in the Bill that are likely to ensure the position will be any better in the future. Deputy Lawlor instanced the case of a major international company &mdash; and hopefully it will locate here &mdash; as an example of the infighting that can take place within the component parts of what is currently Dublin County Council, omitting entirely the complication of the City Council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">

      <P>I thank the Deputy for that description.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed regional authority will not be very meaningful.  It is no more than a co-ordinating committee; it is essentially a managers' committee without any clout or teeth.  It cannot give Deputy Ryan an assurance about the future co-ordination of the greater Dublin region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lawlor referred to his experience with ERDO.  Notwithstanding the fact that the figures ERDO were working on turned out to be erroneous, I am not <Col N="983" /> convinced that the greater Dublin area and the three counties which form the mid-east region form a meaningful regional unit.  It is an inescapable fact at present that the dormitory towns of Leixlip, Bray and so on are part of that region or whatever title is ascribed to it.  I have no hang-up about the word &ldquo;Dublin&rdquo; being used.  Those towns are part of the region and it will be difficult to make plans in regard to that region without taking them into account.  The provisions relating to a regional authority are totally inadequate if we are to proceed from an overall regional perspective.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lawlor expressed the requirement that an overview on a regional basis be taken to transcend inevitable parochial disputes and at the same time devolve more power to the local community for matters relevant to them.  The legislation is deficient in that regard and I am not sure if the Minister is willing to reconsider the matter on Committee Stage.  Nevertheless, the matter requires further consideration.</P>
    <P>In case Deputies think I was dismissive of the role of City Hall I will refer again to that matter.  Deputy Ryan stated that some problems relating to County Dublin have not been dealt with but that we are beginning to tackle them and that matters are improving.  That is not true.  Matters are not improving; and if any structured steps are being implemented at present to tackle the residue of problems they result from the introduction of this legislation. There was never any voluntary commitment on the part of either the political or managerial bureaucracies at City Hall.  For example, I recall visiting City Hall as part of a deputation and we were received as a deputation and not as members of an equal local authority&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Flaherty, as a long serving city councillor, holds a <Col N="984" /> similar attitude to that of my colleagues and I, which is that the City Council believe it is the premier local authority, that things should be done its way and that Tallaght, Swords and Dún Laoghaire are part of the suburbs.  That is the mentality of the members of that council. There was no recognition of the status of the separate local authority or its problems. In its views we were the suburbs and it was the premier authority.  That might be acceptable if those suburbs were represented on the City Council; but they were never represented on the council and no councillor from any party, including my own, raised the problems in north Clondalkin, to which Deputy Lawlor referred, or the problems in Tallaght and many other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The problems in Tallaght were raised regularly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever criticisms one can make about the weakness of the system and public accountability it is the lack of ability to stand up in City Hall and raise the problem of rundown estates, the total absence of management of estates and why the housing maintenance programme has been allowed run down which has produced the cumulative effect we now have.  I understand why officials tend to respond to areas of greatest need. I understand also that councillors such as Deputy Flaherty, who represent the Finglas and Ballymun areas, have sufficient problems in their own areas to raise.  It is perfectly natural that City Council officials tend to be responsive to councillors in those areas.  As a result we have had problems which have been created since the sixties in County Dublin.  For example, the housing authority was the City Council and the administrative authority was the county council.  This meant that the unfortunate residents of the county did not get the service or attention to which they were entitled.  The result is that we have this extraordinary residue of problems &mdash; rundown, unkempt estates, with little maintenance; no management of estates, <Col N="985" /> no tenant participation in the allocation of housing, and so on.</P>
      <P>I will cite a practical example in that regard.  Unlike Deputy Flaherty's constituency, my constituency contains only one flats complex.  I recall going to City Hall as part of a deputation with the late Deputy Seán Walsh during St. Patrick's week in 1986 to highlight the uninhabitable state of the 12 blocks of flats in my area.  It took five years to have two of those blocks repaired and that was achieved only because we finally persuaded officials in City Hall to sell them off to a housing co-operative called NABCO.  The other ten blocks remain virtually unchanged since our visit to City Hall in 1986.  There never was a willingness to co-operate in this area.  I do not wish to be offensive to anybody, but in making representations to Dublin City Hall I may as well have been chairman of Cork County Council for all the response I got.  The fact that 7,500 housing units in my area are the property of Dublin Corporation and inhabited by people selected by Dublin Corporation apparently accounts for nothing.</P>
      <P>I welcome enthusiastically the sections of the Bill and the Schedule thereto that provides for the transfer of dwellings between principal authorities and the transfer of lands to new councils.  Those provisions are long overdue.  It makes no sense that it should be otherwise.  If a local authority is the administrative authority for an area, it should also be the housing authority.  Responsibility for housing matters should be vested in that local authority.  As a result improvements will be effected, but at a cost.  As Deputy Lawlor stated, a net cost will accrue to the local authority in which responsibility for those houses is vested.  That matter must be addressed under this legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed by the Bill which I see as an attack on the workers in Telecom Éireann.  It shows a cavalier disregard for the interests of the staff.  Over 13,000 people are employed in An Bord Telecom Éireann, a decline of over 30 per cent on the 1984 figure when over 18,300 people were employed. The annual turnover of Telecom Éireann is of the order of £814 million and its annual investment programme is £160 million.  The net assets of the company are £1,500 million and on the balance sheet the company has debts amounting to £1,000 million.  I make these points to show that the manner in which Fine Gael are approaching the company is cavalier and shows an unplanned, rushed approach.</P>
      <P>A planned, coherent approach is the obvious one.  To suddenly, in a peremptory fashion, abolish the monopoly of Telecom Éireann makes one query the Fine Gael attitude to the 13,000 workers.  What is Fine Gael saying to those workers?  In the lead-up to the publication of this Bill was there any genuine consultation to ascertain the views and needs of the Telecom Éireann workers? It could be argued that the publication of this Bill could do a lot to unsettle and undermine morale in the company.  I am disappointed at the lack of regard for employment in Telecom Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the years there has been a significant reduction in the staff of Telecom Éireann and further reductions are on the cards if we are to judge by recent announcements in the newspapers and so on.  The Minister could have a second look at that area.  In the US over the last ten to 20 years where a company has been in difficulty the tendency has been to respond by cutting down the labour force.  Serious questions are being asked about that response and studies have been carried out on the efficacy of the <Col N="987" />&ldquo;big lay-off&rdquo; solution for big companies. I ask the Minister and the board of Telecom Éireann to perhaps consider changing trends in the States where big conglomerates and multinationals are reconsidering the policy.  &ldquo;Big lay-offs&rdquo; tend to reduce the company's bank of talent and expertise which can lead to uncertainty and to a decline in the morale which affects overall performance.  The employment content in Telecom Éireann is an important factor, with over 300,000 people on the dole queue, we do not want to add unnecessarily to it.  If this Bill was passed it would add to the dole queue, there would be an immediate impact on employment in Telecom Éireann because competition would make inroads into its control of the market and certain services it offers.  That would have a negative detrimental impact on the numbers at work and on the future of the company.</P>
    <P>It is very sad that it seems to be a national pastime to undermine State institutions and companies.  There has been little acknowledgment from the Opposition of the tremendous progress in the telecommunications sector here in the last decade.  There has been a quiet revolution.  The service now on offer is far superior to that offered ten or 15 years ago, there is no comparison.  An incredible amount of State resources has been invested in our modern telecommunications system which ranks among the best in Europe because the policy adopted by the Taoiseach when he was Minister in charge of that area gave priority to the need to develop our telecommunications system for strategic economic reasons.  We have had very successful development since and an ongoing capital investment programme. Telephone usage has increased dramatically over the last decade.  That should be acknowledged as should the contribution of the staff of Telecom Éireann.  This Bill does not acknowledge the progress made.  Many speakers attacked the company and endeavoured to undermine it.  That is sad and unacceptable because it made tremendous progress in recent years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="988" /> There is no room for further improvement and the Minister made that point in his speech last night.  We cannot peremptorily throw Telecom Éireann to the wolves.  The Minister outlined measures which the company was undertaking to prepare it for competition which will come in tandem with European directives and policy.  There is no immediate pressure from Europe to privatise the company. It is sensible to have a policy to strengthen the company and improve its capacity so that in ten years' time it will be in a position to complete meaningfully with outside interests.  The Minister put forward a valid point and I cannot understand why the Opposition parties cannot accept it.</P>
    <P>If we privatised Telecom Éireann it would have a disastrous impact on the company and on employment there.  The telecommunications area has strategic importance for any country and, because of that, there will always have to be some degree of political control over telecommunications policy.  We should not lightly throw away the investment we have made in the company.  The significant debt that hangs over Telecom Éireann is something that will have to be addressed before we can talk about privatisation.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in a difficult situation, endorsed the decision of the board arising from the Culliton report to rebalance telephone prices.  Culliton stated that the very high cost of international telephone calls was a retarding feature of our economic performance, giving rise to an impediment to unemployment in the industrial field and hampering our export drive.  What happened when the Minister attempted to deal decisively with that? The Opposition cried &ldquo;foul&rdquo; and opposed him tooth and nail despite the fact that they want Telecom Éireann to go into open competition.  That rebalancing was part of a set of measures the Minister had to introduce to strengthen the position of Telecom Éireann.  The policy of reducing the price of international telephone calls was to strengthen Telecom Éireann in the event of international competition in the years ahead.  When that measure was <Col N="989" /> introduced the Opposition made no attempt to amend it but opposed it outright just for the sake of opposition in an effort to gain party political advantage. The objective needs of Telecom Éireann were far down on the priority list of Fine Gael and other parties.  I accuse Fine Gael on that score alone of being hypocritical in introducing a Bill to abolish the monopoly given its stance on reducing international telephone calls.</P>
    <P>The decision to rebalance the charges was not an easy one.  I am glad that in the Minister, Deputy Cowen, we have a man who is prepared to make the right decision and take the flak, if necessary. If we are to make progress in this country we need to display political courage.  I respectfully suggest that this has been in evidence since 1987 and it has been of help in turning the economy around.</P>
    <P>Very often legislation is presented without first consulting with the people who would be affected in the companies concerned.  I have discussed this issue with workers in Telecom Éireann and they are genuinely concerned about their jobs.  I put it to the Opposition that before it introduces a Bill such as this it should enter into consultations with the people who would suffer in order to ascertain their views and ideas on how the company concerned should be developed.</P>
    <P>It has been mentioned time and again in this House that there is a need for worker participation, but there is little evidence of this in the context of this Bill. The views of the workers have not been taken into account by the Fine Gael Party.  When this Bill is rejected by the House I urge that party to seek their views.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I reiterate that rather than enhancing the position of Telecom Éireann, the Opposition has undermined it.  We should do everything possible to strengthen its position so that in years to come it will be able to compete internationally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher (Laoighis-Offaly) Mr. Gallagher (Laoighis-Offaly)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> At the outset I thank Deputy Martin for sharing his time with me and giving me the <Col N="990" /> opportunity to make a contribution to this debate.</P>
      <P>This debate about Telecom Éireann and the telecommunications industry in general is timely in the sense that this time last year, when we were tramping the footpaths during the general election campaign, in my area the question of privatisation was to the forefront of the minds of workers in Telecom Éireann. While that threat has now receded, serious issues in the telecommunications industry have to be addressed if we are to protect employment and develop an industry of a standard high enough to allow our business compete strongly on international markets.  In that respect this debate is timely.</P>
      <P>However, this Bill is badly thought out and lacks a strategy for the development of telecommunications services.  Given its timing, one could argue that the Opposition is being opportunistic and trying to kill a number of birds with one stone. However, it has failed to hit any of them. I am convinced that this Bill would lead to job losses.  As we are aware, in recent years the number employed in Telecom Éireann has decreased from 18,000 to 13,000 and the company hopes to gradually reduce this number by a further 2,000 in coming years.</P>
      <P>This Bill would only make matters worse and lead to chaos, given the mystical belief in the free market.  This is strongly held in one party and more tentatively in another, depending on the audience it is trying to reach.  In addition there would be no guarantee that prices would be reduced; indeed, there would be danger that prices to the consumer would be increased.  In effect, we would have another quango which would not be held accountable to this House; and social and national developmental objectives would not form part of our telecommunications policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Community has decided that competition for telephone companies in their home markets will be permitted in the 12 member states from 1 January 1998.  There is a possibility of a derogation for a further five years, but 1 January 1998 is the operative date.  A <Col N="991" /> minority of member states has already introduced a element of competition.  It should be understood that in the Single Market co-operation among telephone companies will be promoted to exploit the advantages associated with the right of access which they were previously denied when operating within the boundaries of their national states.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House contains one good idea and at least one bad idea.  The one good idea is that the monopoly of Telecom Éireann in voice telephone services should be counterbalanced by the statutory regulation of prices charged by Telecom.  However, the appointment of a director of telecommunications as proposed in the Bill is not the way to proceed. In effect it is being proposed that we should appoint another Minister.</P>
    <P>The functions of the director are laid down in section 4 of the Bill.  These are to promote the interests of consumers, purchasers and users; to maintain and promote effective competition; to promote efficiency and economy; to promote research into new techniques; to encourage major international users to establish in Ireland; to enable Irish service providers to compete outside Ireland; and to enable manufactures of telecommunications apparatus to compete both inside and outside Ireland.  At present the Minister is entrusted with these tasks and we can put questions to him in this House.  We may not be happy with the replies, but at least there is accountability.  That would not be the case if this Bill is implemented.</P>
    <P>In recent years the establishment of independent officers and agencies, which were established for good reasons, has led to a position where Ministers can no longer be held accountable to this House. Often questions, motions and other parliamentary representations are reflected on the grounds that the Minister no longer has responsibility for a particular agency or office.  If a director of telecommunications as proposed in the Bill is appointed, that is what would happen in the area of telecommunications also.</P>
    <P>In particular the proposal that the new <Col N="992" /> director be given unspecified powers to set a schedule of charges for telecommunication services could be very dangerous in the sense that no parameters or objectives for pricing policy are set out in the Bill.  The director would be given the power to set charges, but it is not indicated what factors would have to be taken into account in setting those charges.  Under current policy, factors such as cost, fairness and the objectives of national development have to be taken into account.  The proposals contained in the Bill could lead to a situation where factors such as these and the needs of the less well off in society, including pensioners and the disabled, are not taken into account.  At present these groups are given a telephone rental allowance and a limited number of call units free of charge.  It is mentioned in the Bill that a number of advisory group would be set up.  It is proposed to set up a general advisory group and an advisory group for small business, the disabled and the voluntary sector.  However, these would have little power.  It is not specified in the Bill how the director would take those needs into account in deciding pricing policy.  It seems that we would be able to avail of more advice but have little action.</P>
    <P>As I said, the Bill contains one good idea and one bad idea.  The bad idea is that Telecom Éireann's privileged position should be abolished now rather than wait until 1998, when we would have to do so under EC regulations.  If we recall the purchase of Cablelink by Telecom Éireann from RTE and the speculation at the time that US interests wanted to acquire that company to provide a telephone service in competition with Telecom Éireann, then surely Deputy Noonan must be under a delusion that competition in this industry is simply an automatic gain without any losses.  The reason Telecom Éireann purchased Cablelink was to protect the investment of £1 billion provided through the people for a comprehensive and national telephone service.  The logic of this Bill is that we should have sold Cablelink and allowed a competitor to supply telephone service to those outlets which the Cablelink <Col N="993" /> service covered.  Telecom Éireann, as the poor relation, would still have to carry the cost of subsidising telephone lines in sparsely populated areas while new operators would be allowed to concentrate on providing a service to the profitable parts of the markets, particularly international calls.  As seen in examples in many countries, privatisation allows so-called competitors to cream off the lucrative section of the market, leaving the dregs to the public sector which is then unable to earn the revenue needed to sustain these costly services.</P>
    <P>Section 87 of the 1983 legislation which established Telecom Éireann recognised this need and that a truly national service involves subsidisation of some lossmaking services by profitmaking services. International competition from AT&amp;T has already forced the recent reduction in call charges.  We can expect the business growth in telecommunications to be mainly in new services rather than in the expansion of existing services.  Because Telecom Éireann owns a majority stake in Cablelink, it will retain an effective monopoly on internal calls even after 1998, as the cost of providing an alternative national network, even via satellite, would be prohibitive.  Of course, under existing legislation, the Government can already service operators who would be in direct competition with Telecom Éireann, and it has already done so in cases other than voice telephony.  The proposal to abolish Telecom Éireann's privilege will simply lead to a demand by competitors to be allowed to provide a similar service to that provided by the British company, Mercury, in competition in the United Kingdom with British Telecom.</P>
    <P>In the context of what is proposed in the Fine Gael Bill it would be useful to look at what happened in the UK market &mdash; in practice theoretical competition does not yield lower prices.  The profit per telephone line of British Telecom is the highest in the 12 member states of the EC.  A three minute local call through British Telecom costs 22.5p and 21p through Mercury compared to the 9.5p <Col N="994" /> rate here.  There is no evidence that the consumer is better off because of the arrival of Mercury on the scene.  This is because the size of the market would not justify the initial investment.  I suggest that the Government's approach of allowing Telecom Éireann to use the five year breathing space to increase its competitiveness and to continue to subsidise services valued by the community through cross-subsidisation is the best option not alone for Telecom Éireann but for the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>At this stage, despite having a number of &ldquo;apostles of faith&rdquo; here in the House, privatisation is no longer the great white hope it was ten or 15 years ago.  In reality it is a diversion from the issue which a small country like Ireland needs to face up to and address, particularly in regard to transport and communications.  If we want comprehensive links with the outside world, we cannot rely solely on the market to provide them.</P>
    <P>The best option for Telecom Éireann is to learn from the disaster that befell Aer Lingus because correct action was not taken in time.  Privatisation for that company would be no answer.  In the case of Telecom Éireann, business alliances to secure a foothold in the growth areas which are constantly being opened up in new technology are essential.  In return, the business partners would gain access to the Irish market.  What the privatisation lobby have not demonstrated is what impediment the State's shareholding has placed on the development of Telecom Éireann, including its contracts with Alcatel in France, and, indeed, with British Telecom in the United Kingdom. There is also the vital issue of the capital investment required to update Telecom Éireann's services.  In the context of securing business partners which would open new markets for Telecom Éireann, the issue of a minority shareholding being swapped with a suitable partner could be looked at.  I raise the issue as the outright privatisation of Telecom Éireann will not take place as long as the Labour Party is in Government.  That does not mean that we will hold back the development of the telecommunications sector which is vital <Col N="995" /> for investment and the retention of existing employment.</P>
    <P>I regret that Deputy Noonan's Bill does not address the key strategic issues which Telecom Éireann will face.  The introduction of a competitor to Telecom Éireann at this stage would seriously weaken its attractiveness as a partner to any suitable company currently operating in the EC because it would have precisely the same effect that the competition on the Dublin-London route had on Aer Lingus and Ryanair.  Any competitor in the telecommunications area would concentrate on the profitable areas, Dublin, Cork, Galway and Limerick.  There would be no question of a second system of cabling being introduced.  What section 3 of this Bill really implies is the compulsory divesting of Cablelink by Telecom Éireann probably to a company hostile to Telecom Éireann.  This would amount to a massive own goal and no Irish Government who understands that competition is never free could countenance it.</P>
    <P>There are some areas of policy over which the Government should retain control. For example, the new bilateral agreement which will retain transatlantic services for Shannon in a new form would not be implemented if an open skies policy operated.  Similarly, an open communications policy is unwise until we see how the Single Market in the European Community works in practice as opposed to theory.  If the best that Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats can offer is the so-called magic formula of free competition and privatisation, then there is not much hope that Ireland's development will proceed with the objective of jobs and investment in Ireland given the priority it deserves.  For those reasons I cannot support this Bill, and I urge the House to reject it.</P>

      <P>This House should welcome the debate on the issues thrown open by this Bill introduced by Deputy Michael Noonan, the Fine Gael spokes-person on Transport, Energy and Communications.  The aim of the Bill is to introduce an issue for debate into this House which, as the Minister recognises, is high on the agenda at European level. This is an industry sector experiencing dramatic change in all the member states &mdash; a fact not recognised by the speakers I have listened to here this evening &mdash; an industry in a business sector likely to face increasing competition in the future, needing a new regulatory framework which would clearly lead to legislation in this country to ensure that it is managed properly.</P>
      <P>The Minister was dismissive of the Bill, he described it as opportunistic, as did the previous speaker.  On the contrary, it is opportune.  Now is an appropriate time to discuss the future structure of the telecommunications industry because of the dramatic changes expected and happening at a rapid pace at European level at present.  It is opportune because, by the end of the decade, telecommunications is likely to be Europe's largest equity sector ahead of banking. As a recent article in the <i>Financial Times</i> pointed out, in the next three years alone telecommunications companies with combined capitalisation of £44 billion are expected to come to the market.  It is clear, of course, that the balance of pressure varies between countries and the European Community is now resolved to liberalise the national markets for telecommunications traffic from January 1998.  It is obvious the pressures will increase.</P>
      <P>The Minister is wrong in saying that the Bill cannot be considered as a serious contribution to the development policy in the communications sector.  It is clear that this issue needs to be discussed in this House at this time when the industry is facing such international challenges and the public are demanding choice and flexibility in service.  Clearly, they want a telecommunications service at a price they can afford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="997" /> Far from Fine Gael being the only party to raise this issue, it has been quite remarkable how strong, heated and real the debate has been for the public.  Now people believe they cannot afford the service and are avoiding using it because of concerns about its cost.  People are having to censor their behaviour in relation to the telephone.  This applies particularly to vulnerable groups.  I do not believe that the implications of this Bill are as has been suggested &mdash; that those vulnerable groups would no longer get special treatment or be dealt with in an appropriate way.  Telephone calls would probably be cheaper for them. Surely we do not want to create a culture in Ireland where using the telephone has become so problematic for people that they must monitor and avoid its use. Surely we can do better than scare people off from using a service which they pay for.</P>
    <P>I will remind the House of the international position.  A portion of all the telecommunication operators in Denmark, Spain, Italy and Portugal are listed companies.  Only one-third of the shares in the Spanish company are owned by the State and nearly one-half of the shares of the Italian telecommunications holding company are in private hands.  A Bill to privatise the Dutch postal and telecommunications service is currently before the Dutch Parliament.  The coalition Government in Turkey has agreed to privatise 40.9 per cent of the country's postal and telecommunications operations. I agree with the Minister when he says that any moves in this direction must be undertaken in a way which ensures we control the change rather than letting it control us.  Deputy Martin talked about not appreciating the work of Telecom Éireann, its staff and how that would pose a threat to employment in the telecommunications sector.  Far from threatening employment, the fact that we do not face up to some of the issues this Bill poses a threat to employment in this sector.  This House is faced with a challenge to address those issues before it is too late.  We have seen the dangers of delayed action in other areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="998" /> We need to consider the issues raised by the Bill.  The Minister acknowledges that allowing increasing competition is an important route to greater economic efficiency and this must also be good news for customers.  If there is greater efficiency within the sector then surely customers will also be beneficiaries.  I welcome the setting up of a neutral referee with adequate regulatory powers, and by acknowledging this the Minister is acknowledging also the need for some of the provisions in this Bill.  The Minister could have been somewhat more generous in acknowledging the important issues on the international agenda which the Bill raises.</P>
    <P>I want to consider an area which is separate from the issues addressed by the Bill but which does not in any way rule out that the sector could be dealt with in a special way, as recommended by the advisory groups associated with this area. I have had detailed correspondence with the Minister in relation to the various organisations and help lines which have applied to him for help in relation to the increased charges.  Many voluntary organisations and help lines expressed their concerns to the Minister about telephone price restructuring and its effects on their organisations.  Mr. Fox, head of the telephone service marketing department in Telecom acknowledged that the representations made to him went way beyond what the company could deal with in terms of deciding to make a special fund available to provide relief. He selected eight organisations and offered them a 1800 freefone number, and they are grateful for that, but he could not deal with the range of organisations who approached him seeking help.</P>
    <P>Those organisations are very concerned about the rebalancing, which has not worked in their interest and has made life difficult for them.  The Minister has received representations from the Carmichael Centre for Voluntary Groups, which deals with many organisations, and from Women's Aid and Parents Under Stress.  He has received information from them to the effect that the average cry <Col N="999" /> for help, the average call, could last for 45 minutes.  This does not apply only to those who are working in the headquarters of those organisations; it applies throughout the country.  How can people working in those organisations possibly tailor telephone calls so as to keep bills at the pre-September level?  Those organisations are dealing with people in stress and in a crisis for whom the telephone has been a lifeline.  They have been put under extraordinary pressure by the rebalancing exercise, which has increased their costs.  Many of those organisations are performing the work of the State and it is important that we do not penalise them further for carrying out this work.</P>
    <P>The same position applies to many people at home.  It is a misrepresentation of Culliton to say that the increased telephone charges was one of its recommendations, although it addressed the issue of cheaper international calls.  Many organisations have informed the Minister of their concern in respect of the increased charges.  For example, Focus Point undertook a study and found that 40 per cent of all telephone calls made to its organisation during the day were in excess of three minutes.  The increased charges raise many problems for those organisations.</P>
    <P>The Bill is timely.  It raises appropriate issues abouty the future development of telephone services in an increasingly competitive international environment. It is critical that the issues raised by it are faced up to by the Government.  One Deputy mentioned that ten years should be enough time to enable Telecom Éireann to become more competitive, but I would be very concerned about a ten year time scale.  It is a long time scale to allow for that process and such a time allocation would pose many problems for industry.  There are serious questions about research into consumers' needs and attitudes, as illustrated by the difficulties experienced by the groups I mentioned. Recent decision making has not given central attention to the customer. In a changing world those businesses who do not place the customer at the centre <Col N="1000" /> will find themselves in serious trouble. This Bill attempts to place the customer at the centre and ensures that the customer gets a cheap, effective and efficient service and suggests a way forward to provide a cost efficient telecommunications service.</P>
    <P>Why should the general public be penalised for using what should be a cheap form of communication?  The needs of business and the general public have not been balanced appropriately.  In telephone users terms the performance of Telecom Éireann has been incompetent. In human terms its performance has been insensitive and anti-customer.  While the Minister may feel he must make a ritual defence of a State sponsored body that falls within his bailiwick, in this case he is defending the indefensible.  I recommend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill was first announced in the wake of the controversy which arose as a result of the rebalancing of Telecom Éireann's charges.  At that time I published a Bill calling for the establishment of a Telecommunication Users Council.  When this Bill first appeared it seemed to be in line with the critique the Fine Gael Party made of the rebalancing of charges.  On studying it and listening to the case made for it, I regret to say it is not a Bill my party will support.  The Bill is dressed up as consumer protection, but it seems to be designed to facilitate the carve up and ultimate privatisation of Telecom Éireann.  The privatisation of Telecom Éireann is the real agenda in this Bill. It is refreshing to get the full blooded ideological manifestation of Fine Gael on issues like this because, notwithstanding one of the commissioners, it appears that party is fairly committed to the principle that as much as possible of the public sector, and certainly anything that is profitable, should be sold off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the stench of greed and corruption that has surrounded previous privations, particulary the Greencore-Irish Sugar affair, a straightforward privatisation no longer appears to be something that can be argued for in polite <Col N="1001" /> company and does not appear to be a politically wise option.  The proposal for privatisation is therefore dressed up as something else.  As a former Fine Gael contracted handler said, it is a case of the iron fist in the velvet glove, and that is very much a feature of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Telecom Éireann is very vulnerable at the moment.  It is open to legitimate criticisms because of the botched rebalancing of telephone charges which has angered and alienated many customers.  It is worth recalling that when the charges were first announced in May, Fine Gael appeared to make scapegoats of Telecom Éireann workers by suggesting that over-manning was the reason for the increased charges. Despite the controversy surrounding the new charges a broader view has to be taken of the record and the long-term prospects of Telecom Éireann.  Great progress has been made and the contribution of the workforce in turning Telecom Éireann around should be acknowledged.  An annual loss of about £80 million in 1984 has been turned around in recent years to annual profits of £80 million.  The reduced profits last year were due almost exclusively to the interest repayments arising from the currency crisis.  Waiting times for connections have been cut to a matter of weeks in most cases, and all of this has been achieved against the background of a reduction in the workforce of Telecom Éireann of about 5,000 people.</P>
    <P>In making the case for privatisation it has been stated that it will produce leaner and more efficient companies and so on, but that is not what has happened in the United Kingdom.  Privatisation in Britain certainly did not lead to an improvement in the level of service to the public and there is no reason to assume that the position would be any different here.  Our limited experience has shown that those who benefit from privatisation are not the public but rather the stockbrokers, consultants, speculators and, in some cases, senior management of the companies being privatised who realise there is something in it for them and that the salaries they earn in public ownership may triple or quadruple.  In addition they <Col N="1002" /> have access to share options and are on the inside track in terms of the sell-off and purchase of parts of their company.</P>
    <P>The privatisation agenda for Telecom Éireann is not confined to Fine Gael. Earlier this year there were reports that a British company, Cable and Wireless, was attempting to acquire a 25 per cent stake in Telecom.  According to <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> of 17 October Cable and Wireless is still stalking Telecom.  The report in that issue of <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> makes interesting reading because it suggests that a deal is being done with Cable and Wireless in such a way as to make it palatable for the Labour Party to accept.  It states that Cable and Wireless want to acquire part of Telecom Éireann and is prepared to offer the Government a share swop deal designed to make acceptable to the Labour Party what would amount to a privatisation bid.</P>
    <P>My party has no objection to a joint venture between Telecom Éireann and Cable and Wireless, or any other such company.  Such a joint venture may well be necessary in the context of the liberalisation of telecommunications in the EC.  However, any such joint venture must not be in the form of a take-over. It must be designed to create additional jobs and wealth producing services rather than simply a take-over of existing jobs and services.  Telecom Eireann has a high level of technical expertise and there is great potential for expansion abroad. The fact that British Telecom again turned to Telecom Éireann recently for assistance in carrying out repairs after flood damage is testament to its standing abroad.</P>
    <P>If a new joint venture can be mounted between Telecom Éireann and Cable and Wireless, or any other company, that would be acceptable provided it is done in the way I have suggested.  However, there should be no question of forcing Telecom Éireann to surrender to any multinational the services it has carefully built up on the domestic market.  Neither should Telecom be forced into such an arrangement because of the starvation of funding by the State or indeed, as is happening, by the Government bleeding <Col N="1003" /> Telecom Eireann of its resources. Recently Telecom Éireann expressed its disappointment that the share of EC funds it had been expecting was far short of what it required.  I understand it made a case for in the order of £200 million to £250 million but it received about £32 million, less than the amount it paid in dividends to the Government last year.</P>
    <P>Telecom Éireann argued for these resources in order to maintain its competitive advantage and to maintain itself as one of the finest telecommunications companies in Europe.  Independent consultants have recommended that an annual capital investment of £180 million per annum would be necessary in the course of the next years if the service is to maintain its present standards and that an additional £40 million would need to be invested to maintain Telecom's competitive advantage.  Against that background there is clear evidence of penny-pinching at the level of investment through the national plan.  The company is being bled by the Government in the form of dividends paid to the State.  Telecom Éireann has to repay a crippling level of interest payments.  In addition to the rebalancing of charges by Telecom Éireann the States added extra VAT charges to telephone bills.  Telecom Éireann certainly needs the Government to get off its back and stop bleeding it financially which, in turn, leaves it vulnerable to the marketplace.</P>
    <P>The case being made by Fine Gael, and the case being teed up in a much sweeter way by the Government for privatisation needs to be rebuffed.  Statements were made recently about the productivity of Telecom Éireann's employees.  A question was raised in the House and there were newspaper commentaries about the number of employees per telephone line.  My understanding is that that is not the basis on which productivity should be assessed.</P>
    <P>If one looks at the revenue generated by Telecom Éireann one will see that the revenue generated pre employee virtually doubled between 1987 and 1993. The revenue generated by Telecom is <Col N="1004" /> now as high as that of British Telecom, which is regarded as the most competitive telecommunications company in the world.  People who use the argument that productivity can be assessed simply by dividing the number of employees by the number of telephone lines, without taking into account the other activities in which Telecom Éireann is engaged, including the contracting out of its services to other telecommunications companies and the revenue generated by that, are missing the entire point.</P>
    <P>Telecom Éireann needs to display a greater degree of accountability and responsiveness to its customers than has been the case up to now.  Much of the criticism Telecom Éireann has attracted has been very much of its own making. Issues such as the handling of customer complaints, including complaints about telephone bills, and the arrogance often displayed by Telecom need to be dealt with.  One of the ways in which these issues could be dealt with &mdash; this is the way I proposed following the rebalancing of the charges &mdash; is through the establishment of a telephone users' council on a statutory basis.  A telephone user's council was established on a statutory basis under the 1983 Act, but it was abolished by the Fianna Fáil Government in 1987.  If that body was still in place we would not have had the mess we had with the rebalancing of charges.  There was no statutory group to assess the charges from the consumer perspective before the Government agreed them.  This was a great pity.  The Government's subsequent announcement about the setting up of a telecommunications users' advisory group is no substitute for a proper users' council, particularly when it has not been given adequate funding &mdash; I think it was set up with a derisory budget of £3,000.  This group may just as well not have been set up.</P>
    <P>A telephone users' council needs to be established on a proper statutory basis so that the people who use the services of Telecom Éireann will have some method by which they can air their grievances. Deputy Gallagher made the point that when Members come in here and attempt <Col N="1005" /> to ask the Minister questions about certain aspects of Telecom Éireann's services they are told that the Minister is not responsible to the House for this, that it is a semi-State company, etc.  There has to be some accountability.  The consumer has to have some form of realistic redress and there has to be some mechanism to review the charges which have been rebalanced.</P>
    <P>During Question Time yesterday there was a debate on the absurd situation the Government has got itself into, where the new charges have literally made people afraid of using the telephone and, on top of that, have resulted in Telecom Éireann losing £750,000 per week.  There is a loss on both counts &mdash; the consumer is afraid to use the phone and Telecom Éireann is losing revenue.  The Minister told us that the charges will balance out and that one cannot assess their impact after four weeks.  That is probably true &mdash; usage of the phone will probably change over a period &mdash; but I should like to know what it means.  I think it means that the £750,000 Telecom Éireann is losing every week will be taken out of the pockets of the consumer.  One cannot have it both ways. If there is increased usage of the phone and domestic users revert to using the phone at peak times it means the money will be coming out of their pockets.  The coded message given to the House yesterday by the Minister was: it has not happened yet, but telephone bills will increase.</P>
    <P>The response now needed is not another call for the privatisation of Telecom Éireann, however it is dressed up. What the consumers need is a users' council on which they will be properly represented, which will deal properly with complaints, which will properly assess the rebalanced charges and which will make firm recommendations to the Government.  This users' council should not be the kind of toothless tiger set up by the Government.  It should have real power, a budget and resources and should be able to represent and protect the consumer.  If we have such a users' council I believe it would ultimately be good for Telecom Éireann &mdash; it would <Col N="1006" /> make it more responsive and restore consumer confidence in it.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the job it has done in extending services to the public, I believe there has been a very big diminution of public confidence in Telecom Éireann. There has certainly been a very big diminution of public confidence in the Minister and his ability or willingness to deal in a responsive way with the complaints made by the public over the past few months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate.  In the course of a canvass I carried out 12 months ago in County Westmeath, I found that the major concern among many Telecom Éireann employees was that the company would be privatised.  This Bill, which proposes to deal with competition and consumer protection, is the first step in an attempt to privatise Telecom Éireann.</P>
      <P>The Telesis report on industrial policy and the Culliton report both called for the development of indigenous companies and their promotion as &ldquo;national champions&rdquo; which would give us stability and lead our industrial development.  The main weakness identified in our industrial policy has been our over-reliance on foreign multinationals.  Telecom Éireann is clearly the type of Irish company which fits the description of a &ldquo;national champion&rdquo;. This company is owned by the Government in trust for the people of Ireland.  It is clear that if a company like Telecom Éireann is privatised it will come under foreign ownership and control sooner or later.  Telecom Éireann is one of Ireland's largest employers and is the second largest investor in the economy. Under public ownership this company has been transformed into one of the leading telecommunication companies in the world.  This profitable company is undoubtedly of major strategic importance to the Irish economy.  It is a major investor and purchaser of goods and services in the Irish economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to confuse the House with a surfeit of numerical data, but it is <Col N="1007" /> worth putting some facts and figures in regard to Telecom Éireann on the record. The number of staff in the company decreased from 18,300 in 1984 to 13,000 in 1993, a reduction of almost one-third; the annual turnover of the company is £814 million; annual investment is £160 million, and increasing; and net assets amount to £1,500 million.  Telecom Éireann contributes significantly to economic activity and Government Exchequer returns.  Payroll taxes amount to £73 million; dividends, £26 million; corporate tax, £12 million and VAT, £81 million.  Therefore, it is an important investor in the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>Public ownership of Telecom Éireann is important from a social perspective because of its universal service obligation, which means that Telecom Eireann provides equal access to all citizens regardless of where they live.</P>
    <P>It is surely naive to expect that other privately owned companies, motivated as they are by profit, would be willing to provide, for example, a sufficient level of public payphones in rural areas of Ireland or indeed in many of the housing estates throughout Ireland.  Would these competitors be prepared, for instance, to ensure that a telephone line would be provided to a widow who lived alone in an isolated rural areas some 1,200 metres off the main road?  Would not the impact be simply a further withdrawal from rural Ireland?  That is what this provision is about at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>These are the questions that must be addressed and no amount of pretension that the sole objective of this Bill is to promote competition, which will be for the benefit of the customer, will gloss over the social implications which would arise if this Bill was passed in its current form.  Surely right wing parties who pursue and espouse their particular ideology, which was similarly enunciated during the Thatcher era in the United Kingdom, are quite aware that the declared purpose of the Bill is to introduce competition in Telecom Éireann. The scenario that would emerge would be for private companies to enter the <Col N="1008" /> market and focus their capital investment on the more profitable high density population areas of the country which are urban based.</P>
    <P>This would represent a serious blow to the public policy aim of developing infrastructure in a manner consistent with national objectives, such as providing the means to locate data processing and other information technology industries in rural areas.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the question of efficiency.  We now have one of the most modern telecommunications services in Europe.  Losses of £80 million have been transferred into profits of that amount in 1992 and staffing levels have been reduced by one third.  Such changes were effected without an industrial dispute or disruption of any sort.  The quality of the service is excellent.  It is clear we have a very modern system, one of which we can all be proud.  We now have very valuable assets backed up by a skilled and competent workforce who have adapted extremely well to the rapid technological advances of the past decade.</P>
    <P>In the past few weeks British Telecom have had to rely upon that expertise by engaging Irish workers to carry out repairs in the United Kingdom.  Let there be no doubt that these are the first shots in the privatisation issue of Telecom Éireann and we can expect this campaign to gain momentum in the future.</P>
    <P>I want to set out clearly my view in this debate.  My political belief is based on the fact that people should always be considered first in every decision that is made, and that consideration be given to the area of job security, pensions and conditions of employment.  Those issues have not been properly addressed in the Bill.  To be parochial, if one examines the position in Westmeath, Telecom Éireann employs 175 people in Mullingar and approximately 200 in Athlone.  Is it not a fact that increased competition will undoubtedly lead to the privatisation of the company and will see many of the people involved consigned to the unemployment register?  That has been the experience in the United Kingdom and the facts are there to prove it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1009" /> The reason for this is simple: profit is the sole motive and its pursuit requires cutting staff numbers to a minimum. Telecom Éireann is important not just for the service it provides and the profit it makes now but also because of the people it employs.  It is an important source of employment as the figures in my county clearly demonstrate.</P>
    <P>The Bill as it is drafted is an attack on Telecom Éireann.  It is a clear manifestation of confused and woolly thinking and is nothing more than an attempt to ape the United Kingdom's Telecommunications Act of 1984.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that Telecom Éireann has been focused upon because it appears to be a popular exercise following the rebalancing of charges which has taken place recently.  However, the preliminary results just published &mdash; they are only preliminary and things can change over a period &mdash; which chronicle the effects of this rebalancing, make interesting reading when compared with some of the figures that were bandied about here two or three months ago.  Some people seemed to engage in what I call &ldquo;fork speak&rdquo;&mdash; they want Culliton and the other reports implemented, but as soon as the Government takes steps to effect some of those proposals, there is an outcry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a clear attack upon the Deputy.  A preliminary perusal of the Bill indicates that it contains a number of inherent contradictions.  I would ask Deputy Noonan to take note of those. One has only to examine section 4, subsection (4) to realise the confused state of thinking which bedevils the proposal and indeed the proposers of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While quite clearly advocating competition, it proposes that a schedule of charges be put in place which in my view, and I have been examining this from a different perspective, does not tally with the competitive environment which the Bill states it wishes to create.  I now have no doubt that my initial perception that <Col N="1010" /> the Opposition parties are hellbent on privatisation has been proved to be well-founded.</P>
    <P>We now have approximately ten years to prepare for the full liberalisation of voice telephony.  We should give full-scale support and encouragement to Telecom Eireann in its quest to prepare itself for these changes and developments. I realise that the telecommunications industry will have to keep pace with such developments.  For example, the growth in electronic data interchange, electronic mail, videotex and other services is expected to grow from 4 billion ECU in 1991 to over 11.9 billion ECU in 1996, or an annual growth rate of 27 per cent.  The provision of these value added network services represents the main growth market for Telecom operators.</P>
    <P>Telecom Éireann cannot be bypassed in the Irish market for some considerable time as the costs of a new competitor establishing an alternative network would be prohibitive.  We have a derogation option after 1998 of a further five years.  We should await the development of the Single Market in practice before deciding when competition should be allowed in the home market.</P>
    <P>I suggest it is the duty of the Government and this House to ensure that Telecom Éireann is given the opportunity to position itself to face such competition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>Telecom Éireann has been through some rather dramatic changes in the past ten years, as has the whole technology industry.  It is very important that at this crucial stage in its development an objective and positive attitude is adopted by all parties towards this company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his initial comments, Deputy Penrose referred to the growth potential for Telecom Éireann's business outside the country.  Having travelled recently in eastern Europe, I agree that the investment programme, the upgrading and the development of Telecom is very much suited to many of the developing countries in the Eastern Bloc.  The experience, the technical know-how and the success <Col N="1011" /> of Telecom in modernising its network here should be fully exploited.</P>
    <P>Having listened to Deputy Gilmore, who rolled off the hundreds of millions of pounds of necessary funding required by Telecom Éireann by way of further capital investment, expressing disappointment at the figure allocated for that purpose in the National Development Plan, I have to say that, as is typical of Democratic Left, the free availability of vast amounts of funding is never reconciled with its source.  For example, the Deputy was critical of the level of charges, some of the work practices and other aspects of the operations of Telecom Éireann and he sought further Government investment which would have to be aligned with additional charges, increased taxation or borrowings, allowing them very few options.</P>
    <P>The automation and advancement aspects of technology have left Telecom Éireann, indeed the whole engineering, electronics and telecommunications industry, with very high manning levels. As one moves from semi-automatic to fully automatic, to fibre optics, to satellite, one ends up with a tremendous amount of automation and advancing technology with ever reducing requirements for staff.  Telecom Éireann, when viewed per line or by any other criterion across the European Community, probably do have large numbers of staff. Having engaged in a massive investment programme the company now has many surplus staff which will mean they will either have to introduce redundancy packages continuously or, alternatively, develop external business.  If there is to be any further interface with Government, I hope it will be in support of that aspect of Telecom Éireann's activities in the future.</P>
    <P>Advancing technology, and the need to grasp it, is best highlighed by the job creation successes of the Japanese economy.  In the European community we resisted advancing technology in many sectors.  The Japanese grasped that opportunity, deployed their staff in building robots and other technological innovations <Col N="1012" /> which could assemble cars, improve design and so on.  The United Kingdom car assembly industry resisted such advancement and lost out on the technological uplift which has been the order of the day elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Telecom Éireann went from being semi-manual to automatic.  In the course of my commercial activities I was involved in the design and installation of air conditioning in telephone exchanges. Fortunately, as they were about to equip those buildings the ACTEL system was perfected in France which meant that Telecom Éireann did not take the disastrous step of purchasing equipment that was going rapidly out of date but rather converted to the advanced French digital system.  This put Telecom Éireann in the front line of technology in the telecommunications sector.</P>
    <P>The board and senior management of Telecom Éireann, in attempting to address this rebalancing of their operations, probably got itself involved in much controversy, was the subject of varying views, of many wild exaggerations and many speculative figures about what the rebalancing exercise might mean.  Now that the first set of figures in relation to that rebalancing exercise are available much of the hysteria appears not to have been well founded.  Nonetheless there is quite a distance to travel.  The £750,000 reduction in revenue to Telecom Éireann came about as a result of prudent use and/or maximising of the low-tariff period and lower revenue receipts from the commercial sector.  The trends have been incorporated into the Telecom Éireann statement.</P>
    <P>Telecom Éireann has a crucial role to play in marketing the attractiveness of this country.  When industrialists, native or foreign, consider establishing a plant here, labour, transport, energy and telecommunications costs are the main overheads which will be taken into account in calculating the potential viability or otherwise of a project.  Unless Telecom Éireann changed, acknowledging the statement in the Culliton report that its rates were extremely expensive by international <Col N="1013" /> standards, it would not remain uncompetitive.  There has been reference to approximately 1,500 jobs being created arising from a more competitive telecommunications level of charges.  For example, I do not think our Financial Services Centre would have been so successful had our telecommunications network not been so advanced, leading to linkages facilitating the overnight transfer of information and data.</P>
    <P>As we head for the year 2000 the operations and networks of the telecommunications sector will become ever more sophisticated.  The Fine Gael Bill is premature and there is some concern about the practicality of creating the climate sought by the Bill.  The way forward for Telecom Éireann lies in the promotion of a number of joint ventures. From the point of view of the State, the distributions network, the main framework of the telecommunications sector positively should remain in public ownership and operate in that manner. However, there are many fringe activities in which Telecom Éireann is involved, which can be developed by way of joint venture on a commercial basis.  Based on the non-availability of equity from Government in the future, probably that will constitute the way forward for Telecom Éireann.  It would be my hope that they will not make the mistakes it would appear Aer Lingus made, of not being out in the international marketplace over the past decade, signing up and co-operating with other international organisations to ensure continuous growth and development.  It would by my hope that Telecom Éireann would embark on that type of dynamic investment programme and job creation.</P>
    <P>If one travels to the Czech Republic, to Poland, to Hungary or any former Eastern bloc country, one will observe that their electricity, telecommunications networks, their technical infrastructures are all defective and outdated, akin to Ireland in the 1950s.  The investment programme, the dynamic solutions Telecom Eireann introduced to resolve the dreadful dilemma of public representatives &mdash; for example when I first entered public <Col N="1014" /> life the single biggest issue every Dáil Deputy encountered was the lobbying about telephones &mdash; are an example of its positive achievements.  The delays in every constituency and the various difficulties encountered are all history mainly due to the major investment programme undertaken by Telecom Eireann.  However, that was at a very severe price.  I note reference to borrowings of £1 billion.  In the course of that investment programme I recall there was not co-operation within Telecom Éireann at staff level.  A great amount of work was contracted out which could have been carried out internally but, because of a reluctance to grasp advancing technology, there were various sweetheart financial deals done.  This meant that Telecom Éireann ended up having a capital investment programme costing more than should have been the case. The company is now reaping the rewards of that £1 billion borrowing.  It is a very substantial sum to service and a fine financial balancing act will have to be performed to ensure the company's ongoing prosperity, the protection of the maximum number of jobs and expansion and development.  That may involve joint ventures.  Telecom Éireann, with its technical expertise and other attributes, apart from equity, probably represents the best opportunity for growth in the telecommunications sector.  It will not have vast surplus resources to invest abroad, other than its internal expertise.  Therefore, as the Minister said last evening, the Fine Gael Bill gives us an opportunity to carry out a fairly comprehensive examination of Telecom Éireann and a discussion on the more immediate aspects arising from the rebalancing.  Obviously, we will vote down the Bill.</P>

      <P>The Minister already made constructive criticisms concerning those aspects.  Telecom Éireann will have to improve its efficiency and it should not have waited until now to recognise the disincentives and the unacceptable level of charges to the business sector, particularly to the international calling network. <Col N="1015" /> It was very expensive to do business abroad.  I hope a major impediment to the cost of industry will be removed, particularly as telecommunications, fax and other communications weigh very heavily on the facilities Telecom Éireann provides. It has a vital role to play.  I see Telecom Éireann's future in the State sector, possibly in a joint venture concept.  There is no reason or need to privatise good, profitable State companies.  It is much better for shareholders to receive a transfer annually rather than a profit take-out every eight or nine years from selling the shareholdings in State companies.  It is possible that aspects of Telecom Éireann could be open to competition.  The main frame of the telecommunications network, which is similar to the ESB, would be best left in public ownership.  For valid reasons this side of the House proposes to reject the Bill.  I hope that Telecom Éireann will continue to improve its efficiency and give a good international and domestic service.</P>

      <P>Deputy Noonan, in moving his Bill last evening, used his considerable parliamentary skills to cloud what he really had in mind.  If we look at this Bill carefully we could reduce it to sections 3 and 10.  The whole concept of a director general of communications is nothing more than a smokescreen, to enable him to bring about a situation whereby Telecom Éireann would be privatised. Before we proceed down that road we should look at the matter very carefully.  The Act we are seeking to amend by the Telecommunications Bill, 1993, is legislation in which Deputy Noonan played a major role in 1983.  Is he now saying, ten years down the road, that it is defective?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Telecom Éireann has served the country well and our greatest asset is its workforce. It has achieved a level of efficiency unmatched in the technical sector, at enormous cost to people who get no benefit from the system, namely the taxpayer who does not have a telephone and who contributed to setting it up.  They will <Col N="1016" /> never enjoy the benefits of the telecommunications network and will lose out on this deal.  I have an article from <i>The Irish Times</i> of 29 September 1991 by the former leader of the Fine Gael Party, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, which states:</P>
    <P>One argument in favour of public enterprise is that a purely commercial approach to the person of some services would inhibit the initiation, or the continued provision, of certain services that are generally of social benefit...</P>
    <P>It is significant that a person of Dr. FitzGerald's stature should make this statement. The Fine Gael Party is trying to scuttle that point of view in no uncertain terms.  Deputy Noonan quoted from an article in <i>The Financial Times</i> by Andrew Adonis and Andrew Hill which was similar to the Devil quoting scripture.  I will also quote from the article:</P>
    <P>Although the goal of open competition is all but agreed, the path ahead is littered with obstacles.  As Mr. Carpentier says: &ldquo;I don't know a member state or an operator which has said we shouldn't liberalise.  The question is when and how.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I have only four minutes.  Deputy Noonan and his party are attempting to dismantle a successful State enterprise.  It cannot be said often enough that Telecom Éireann did not come about as a result of any ideological decision by any party in this House since the foundation of the State.  It was for purely pragmatic reasons.  There was a reluctance on the part of private investors to put their money and their capital at risk for the setting up of a telephone network.  The one thing on which I would fault Telecom Éireann is that it claims full credit for the development of the telephone system since 1973.  I am proud <Col N="1017" /> that a Coalition Government, in which Labour was a partner, was the first to recognise the need for investment in the telephone system.  Indeed the first Minister to make such capital available for its development was Cornor Cruise O'Brien. It was fairly late in the day when Telecom Éireann came on the scene but it did its job efficiently.  What will follow the privatisation or the liberalisation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>About three weeks ago the Government launched the National Development Plan creating great expectations for the future of our country. Indeed, the opening sentence on page 7 says that the National Development Plan is a plan for employment.  Today, that statement is being contradicted.  Already, the aspirations of the plan are not being met because of the lack of matching funds and jobs are being lost.  Infrastructural developments are outlined in Chapter IX and it is proposed to expend £275 million on improving mainline rail networks. This includes track renewal, new signalling systems and the purchase of modern rolling stock.  Among the lines to be improved is the Dublin-Belfast and the Dublin-Mullingar-Sligo lines.  A programme of track renewal is already under way and there is great expectations that the new rolling stock, promised for mid-1994 will improve the computer service between Dublin and Mullingar.  As the Minister knows, an improved service will attract more customers and that, in turn, will bring more badly needed revenue to Iarnród Eireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, these great plans have, unfortunately, been derailed because, from today, the programme of track renewal on the Dublin-Belfast and on the Dublin-Mullingar-Sligo lines will stop. Iarnród Éireann is making 31 employees redundant because it cannot provide the matching funds to continue this work. Ten of these married employees work <Col N="1020" /> from Mullingar and they and single men will now go on the dole and draw money from Government resources.  The other 21 workers operate from Drogheda.  The track renewal needs to be done and the work will be done, if not this year next year or the year after, it is merely being postponed.  The funding from Europe is available but the matching Irish funds are not.  I call on the Minister to make these relatively small amounts of money available to Iarnród Éireann to keep these men at work; to keep the development plan on the rails; to provide a better commuter service on the Dublin-Mullingar line and to improve the rail network throughout the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my constituency colleague for sharing his time.  I join in expressing my concern at the news that ten workers were given notice that they were being laid off.  They were engaged in relaying new track on the Dublin-Mullingar-Sligo railway line and this involved the continuing CWR track renewal programme. As Deputy McGrath points out, £275 million is provided in the National Development Plan for a major investment programme in the rail network over the next five years.  We all know that the upgrading of the Dublin-Sligo line and the provision of new track, new signalling and new rolling stock needs to be carried out.  Why delay the process?  It is vital work required to ensure that the public who use public transport do so in the greatest of comfort.  It is important to provide a comfortable commuter service to entice the public to utilise it.</P>
      <P>I see this as important for the provision of employment.  This is especially important in a rural area and for those who live in the area around Mullingar.  Ten men will go on to the live register and this is demoralising so near Christmas.  Some of the workers are married.  They were laid off in October 1992 and re-employed on 4 January 1993, a break of two months.  In view of the fact that the work is urgently required I appeal to the Minister to make available to Iarnród Eireann the necessary matching funds to allow the necessary work to continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the concerns expressed by Deputies McGrath and Penrose.  I should point out first that staffing levels, recruitment of temporary staff and related issues in the CIE group and its subsidiaries are the responsibility of the boards and management involved.  It would be inappropriate for me as Minister to become involved in any way in such matters and I have no intention of doing so.</P>
      <P>For the information of the Deputies, however, I understand that Iarnród Éireann's annual track renewal programme involves the recruitment of seasonal employees every year.  These employees are laid off as the individual elements of that year's track renewal programme are completed in mid-autumn. The track renewal programme is carried out on this basis primarily because the work concerned is outdoors and has to avail of maximum daylight and favourable weather conditions.  The position in CIE in this regard is similar to other sectors, including agriculture and construction, which feature significant seasonal employment.  The lay-off of temporary workers in Iarnród Éireann is not, therefore, related to the level of Exchequer finance available to Iarnród Éireann.</P>
      <P>By way of background, I should point out that the Exchequer grant to CIE for 1993 is £108.4 million.  Given the constraints on the Exchequer, this very substantial amount illustrates beyond any question this Government's commitment to public transport.  I should also mention that the public Capital Programme for 1993 provides for capital expenditure of up to £97 million by the CIE group on a number of major capital and track renewal projects including:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;upgrading of the Dublin-Belfast line; provision of commuter services on the south west rail corridor;</P>
      <P>&mdash;new railcars and locomotives which are due for delivery early next year; and new signalling equipment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1022" /> Both the Dublin-Belfast and south west Dublin projects are receiving significant EC financial support.</P>
    <P>The Deputies will be aware that the National Development Plan which was published recently and submitted to the European Commission includes provision for an EC assisted investment programme of £185 million in the period 1994-99 on the upgrading of the mainline railway network.  In addition, a further £90 million approximately of unco-financed investment is proposed over the period of the plan subject to the resources available to CIE.  The investment programme, which covers all the major lines on the inter-urban mainline railway network which includes the Dublin-Sligo and Dublin-Belfast lines will include expenditure on track renewal, new signalling systems and the provision of modern rolling stock.</P>
    <P>Finalisation of the investment programme, as regards specific expenditures on individual lines, will follow from consultations over the coming months between my Department, CIE and the European Commission.  I am sure there will be more seasonal employment next year and perhaps these people will avail of that opportunity at that stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  It was stated in the National Development Plan that the DART would be extended to Greystones, County Wicklow.  While this may seem a minor detail it is a matter of grave concern to the large population in north Wicklow, particularly those living in Greystones, in view of the Minister's response to my parliamentary question of Tuesday, 2 November, when he stated that the issue was being examined only in the context of the draft operational programme on transport.  The natural expectation was that the proposal would be included in the national plan, particularly as a consequence of its inclusion in the Dublin Transportation Initiative <Col N="1023" /> interim report which recommended that £28.6 million should be spent on upgrading suburban rail services and specifically included a figure of £6 million to extend the DART service to Greystones. However, the National Development Plan specifies that only £20 million will be spent in that area.  There is a shortfall of £8.6 million between the two figures and that is a matter of concern for the people in Greystones.  There was no firm commitment in the Minister's reply in regard to its placing in the operational programme.  He stated that the Dublin Transportation Initiative report would be substancially implemented by 1999.  In view of the shortfall, what will be omitted? That is what the people of Greystones are concerned about.</P>
      <P>It is worth mentioning that the area covered by the report includes 50 per cent of the population of County Wicklow. Yet, the only recommendation to invest in public transport in the country appears in danger of being ignored while all the money may be spent on public transport in County Dublin.  If this is the case it would be a total negation of the Dublin Transportation Initiative report which recognises that, to relieve Dublin's traffic congestion, it is necessary to provide a good public transport service beyond County Dublin.  The Dublin Transportation Initiative report recommends that the DART service should be extended to Greystones, the only definitive DART extension recommended in any report.  The managing director of Iarnród Éireann considers the DART the most logical and cost effective solution to the transport problem of Greystones. That argument is further reinforced by the fact that an extension of the DART service to Greystones will pay its capital cost within 12 years through increased usage.  That would make it the most financially viable rail investment set out in the national plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not talking about simply improving the service to Greystones but about upgrading it to a level which pertained in the past.  During the years 1983 to 1989 nine direct trains travelled each <Col N="1024" /> day from Greystones to Pearse Street station, that has been reduced to one train per day.  In ten years the population of Greystones has increased by 50 per cent, but the train service has been almost wiped out.  When Greystones had its service withdrawn other commuter rail services such as those to Malahide, Maynooth and, more recently, Clondalkin, were vastly improved as a result of substantial Government investment.  I assure the Minister that the people of Greystones would not take to the streets &mdash; as they did last year &mdash; unless they believe in what they are doing, the case they have presented during the past number of years is a strong one.  The DART service is the most effective solution to the transport needs of Greystones, it is also the most cost effective solution because far more people would use a direct and reliable service than a diesel shuttle service.  The extra users would more than pay for the extra capital cost involved.</P>
    <P>The proposal outlined by the Dublin Transportation Initiative group would provide a park and ride site in Greystones which would service people from Delgany, Kilcoole, Kilpedder and Newcastle and relieve traffic congestion in Bray and in the city of Dublin.  That proposal has been welcomed by the Dublin traders.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister make a clear commitment to the people of Greystones to extend the DART to their town?  Strong arguments were advanced in favour of this and the Dublin Transportation Initiative group was seen as the body to advise the Minister on the best way forward.  No greater signal could have been received by the Minister from DTI than its clear and unequivocal support for the extension of the DART service to Greystones.  What we and the people of Greystones now need is similar unequivocal support and direction by the Minister to provide an extension of the DART service to Greystones.</P>

      <P>In my reply to the question mentioned by the Deputy, I indicated that the National Development Plan includes provision for an EC assisted <Col N="1025" /> investment programme of £220 million of which up to £200 million expenditure is proposed for the development of a light rail transit system for Dublin.  A further £20 million has been included in the plan for other important public transport projects, including the development of public transport interchange facilities, integrated ticketing and the upgrading of suburban rail services, including the possible extension of the DART to Greystones and Malahide.  These issues are being further evaluated at present under the ongoing Dublin Transportation Initiative process and the outcome will be reflected in the final report of the DTI which is expected shortly.  It would not be appropriate for me to pre-empt the final report of the Dublin Transportation Initiative in relation to specific transportation options which may be recommended for Greystones.</P>
      <P>In general terms the overall cost of the main priorities which have been outlined above will exceed the level of funding available.  Accordingly, it is essential that the expenditure of £20 million to non-LRT work is carefully allocated to the most effective projects in overall public transport terms.  In this context, I am aware of the concerns of residents in Greystones concerning the extension of DART to Greystones.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Demolition of Dublin Georgian Buildings.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The buildings to which this matter refers are two buildings side by side at the bottom of Harcourt Street on the corner of St. Stephen's Green in Dublin.  In construction terms, both buildings date from the 1780s and are four storey Georgian buildings of significant architectural importance.  The roof of each building has lost its slating and neither of the buildings, for some peculiar reason, was given list one status in Dublin Corporation's plan.  In any self-respecting city in Western Europe neither of those buildings would be demolished. In no country in Western Europe would a building dating from the 18th <Col N="1026" /> century be demolished in similar circumstances. The buildings look shabby because they have no slating &mdash; but I do not believe that is the result of strong winds &mdash; and because their windows have been blocked up with cement blocks. However, because of clandestine photography it is evident that inside those buildings there is significant treasure of late 18th century plaster work which is part of our architectural heritage and which will be destroyed if the buildings are knocked down.</P>
      <P>The local government planning and development code dates from 1963 and is fundamentally an engineers' charter.  It is not a conservation code.  Although it provides that county councils and local authorities such as urban district councils and county boroughs can list buildings in their areas as conservation buildings, it does not provide any means to ensure that such buildings are preserved.  Anybody owning a Georgian building in this city is free to remove its slates and there is nothing a local authority can do to stop that person.  That is the law.  There is no positive duty to conserve any part of our architectural heritage.  If a building is dangerous or derelict, even though it is listed for conservation, the State can do nothing positive to oblige the owner of the building to conserve it.  Ownership has its duties as well as its rights and that is written on the plinth of the Drummond statue in City Hall.  In a modern urban environment and in this day and age we should recognise that buildings are part of our heritage and are not the free and disposable property of their owners to destroy them at will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In making a submission to An Bord Pleanála on this issue a local representative in whose constituency the buildings are situated must now pay a charge of £30 for making a submission as to why the buildings should not be destroyed.  I am not charged £30 for writing to the corporation when the original decision is made, or if I write to a Minister, or for bringing it up in this House, where doubtless I am using far more State resources than I would by writing to An Bord Pleanála.  I sent a one page letter to <Col N="1027" /> An Bord Pleanála asking it to consider the architectural and historical significance of this building and the fact that it is the birth place of Sir Edward Carson. The letter was returned to me with a note saying that it would be considered if I had the good grace to add a £30 cheque to it and send it back to An Bord Pleanála. That is wrong.  As a public representative I am entitled to represent my constituents.  I am entitled to make a public statement where it matters to a body charged by the public to decide these matters.  I am entitled as a public representative to have my views heard.  I went through the process of election and having won an election it confers on me the right to have my views heard on issues such as that.  If public representation means anything it means that.</P>
    <P>If it is the view of the Department of Finance that I am not entitled to make a submission without paying a fee I would ask the Minister to indicate to the House what measures the Government has in mind to reimburse Members for representations made not out of private interest but in the public interest to a body such as this.  I have never heard of a public representative being charged for giving evidence at a licensing session in a District Court or for giving evidence in support of any proposition in any court of the land.  I have never heard of a public representative being charged for sending a letter to a corporation who decide these matters in the first instance.  How can it be that a public representative should be charged money for making a representation in relation to a matter before An Bord Pleanála when it is done out of public duty?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Recently a number of people, including the Rev. Ian Paisley, expressed serious concern about the threatened demolition of No. 4 Harcourt Street.  The reason is that Mr. Edward Carson was born there.  He is remembered for his role in the creation of a Northern Protestant State, often referred to in those times as being Carsonian.  Mr Carson has left an indelible mark on our <Col N="1028" /> history and his place of birth should be preserved.  At least it would be seen as an expression of tolerance and political maturity by people in the Republic.</P>
      <P>Little has been said about No. 3 Harcourt Street, where Mr. George Fitzmaurice, the great Kerry dramatist, lived for a number of years until his death on 12 May 1963.  He was one of the pioneer dramatists of the Abbey Theatre, a contemporary of Synge, Yeats and Lady Gregory and he played a major part in the Irish literacy revival in the early part of the century.  According to Mr. Fintan O'Toole, the literacy critic of <i>The Irish Times</i>, Fitzmaurice was arguably the most imaginative Irish writer of this century. No less a critic than Irving Wardle wrote:</P>
      <P>Fitzmaurice is obviously a remarkable writer, one of the great originals among folk dramatists and an innovator of more than national interest.</P>
      <P>Mr. George Fitzmaurice was born in Bedford House near Listowel in January 1877.  His father was the local Church of Ireland parson, who had married a local Catholic girl, a thing unheard of at that time.  Their sons, including George, were brought up as Protestants while the daughters were brought up as Catholics. Every Sunday morning Parson Fitzmaurice would drop his wife and daughters at the local Catholic church and then proceed to his own church to conduct his service.  That says much about the level of tolerance, acceptance and ecumenism which existed in north Kerry at that time. This broadmindedness survived and is reflected in several ways in the north Kerry community.</P>
      <P>Fintan O'Toole said:</P>
      <P>George Fitzmaurice's importance and his curse was that when he started to write he was able to create a synthesis of Protestantism and Catholicism to make a nonsense of the great opposition of Irish culture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fitzmaurice's works are based on <Col N="1029" /> material which he took from the peasant culture in north Kerry, especially the parish of Duagh.  The language, the folklore, the social realities reflected in his plays are those of the Catholic community. His first play &ldquo;The country Dressmaker&rdquo; was produced in the Abbey Theatre in 1907 and was very well received.  His next two plays &ldquo;The Pie Dish&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Magic Glasses&rdquo; were also produced at the Abbey.  &ldquo;The Magic Glasses&rdquo; was also produced in London as part of a small selection of plays taken to London by the Abbey.  These included plays by Yeats and Lady Gregory.  The critics in London placed his play ahead of the plays of both Yeats and Lady Gregory.  He has a number of other plays, including the &ldquo;Dandy Dolls&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Linnaun Shee&rdquo;, &ldquo;Twixt the Giltenans and the Carmodys&rdquo; and so on.</P>
    <P>George Fitzmaurice became an employee of the Congested Districts Board of the Land Commission in November 1901 and later served in the British Army in Flanders from 1914 to 1918.  He retired from the Civil Service in 1943 and led a secluded life on a small pension until his death in May 1963 at No. 3 Harcourt Street.</P>
    <P>This week An Taisce expressed concern about Nos. 3 and 4 Harcourt Street. It fears that they will be demolished unless preventive action is taken immediately. Demolition can be prevented if a preservation order is placed on the buildings by the Office of Public Works.  Mr. Fintan O'Toole, in a most enlightening article in <i>The Irish Times</i> today, said:</P>
    <P>By all means, let us preserve Carson's house.  It marks our history and speaks to us of what for good or ill we have built.  But it is even more important, in this present darkness, to preserve that other haunted house of hope next door, that house of quiet despair where unseen amidst the silence, a great Protestant Catholic defeated by that same history, dared to put on paper his mad tales, subverting oppositions and celebrating the stubborn, perverse, defiant imagination of humanity.  For if that house falls, then <Col N="1030" /> not only Carson's house, but the whole streetscape of political civilisation on this island goes with it.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to mandate the Office of Public Works to immediately, place a preservation order on these two buildings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. Gallagher, Donegal South-West) Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. Gallagher, Donegal South-West)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. Gallagher,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Donegal South-West</i>): I thank Deputies McDowell and Deenihan for their contributions.  Nos. 3 and 4 Harcourt St. are Georgian buildings which are in a bad state of repair and have not been occupied for some time.</P>
      <P>Application was made for planning permission for the six storey office development over a basement carpark, involving the demolition of houses Nos. 3 and 4 Harcourt St.  This application was refused by Dublin Corporation on 10 September 1993 on the grounds that the building was too high and out of scale and was contrary to land use zoning of the 1991 Dublin City Development plan in that the office content was excessive. This decision was appealed to an Bord Pleanála and a decision on the appeal is pending, but must be decided by 10 February 1994.  Anyone wishing to make observations may do so in writing by 10 November 1993 on payment of a fee of £30.</P>
      <P>The Office of Public Works are considering the appropriateness of using the National Monuments Acts to afford protection to these houses.  In this connection they are arranging to have the houses inspected under section 8 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputies mentioned, both of these buildings have historical associations, No. 3 having been the residence of playwright George Fitzmaurice &mdash; like Deputy Deenihan, a Kerryman and a distant relation of his &mdash; and No.4 having been the birthplace of Sir Edward Carson.  While these would be consideration in any decision relating to the preservation of these houses, regard must <Col N="1031" /> be had to other factors such as their structural condition and the cost involved.  The Office of Public Works expects to have the inspection of Nos. 3 and 4 carried out in the near future and we must await that report.</P>
    <P>With regard to the matter of An Bord Pleanála fee, which was raised by Deputy McDowell, I understand from my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, that he has been advised by the board that it gives due and courteous consideration, within the statutory provision governing the appeals process, to all representations received from public all representatives.  If a public representative writes to an Bord Pleanála merely making an inquiry as to the position on an appeal or indicating general support for or opposition to an appeal, the board takes the view that this is not a submission within the meaning of planning law and that no fee is payable. However, where representations from a public representative raise new and substantive issues in relation to an appeal the board has to consider whether these are such as to constitute formal submissions <Col N="1032" /> or observations which would be governed by the provisions of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1992, and the fees requirements. The Minister would expect that the bulk of correspondence received by the board from public representatives would not come within the category and that no fee would be payable.  It might also be pointed out that no fee would be payable where a public representative appears at an oral hearing on behalf of a party to an appeal or on behalf of any person who has made formal written submissions to the board about the appeal.</P>
    <P>The payment of a fee to the board by a public representative only arises therefore where the public representative makes formal and substantive submissions or observations.  It is not considered that the charging of a fee in these circumstances is unreasonable and I understand from my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, that there are no proposals to alter the position.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.5 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 4 November 1993.</P>

      <P>The Task Force on the Travelling Community, which was set up by me on foot of a commitment contained in the Programme for a Partnership Government, has set up a sub-committee to examine the discrimination experienced by travellers and to make recommendations aimed at promoting mutual understanding and respect between the travelling community and the settled community.  At the same time, I have been keeping in touch with events in relation to travellers and with the situation in Glenamaddy as it developed.  I arranged for my programme manager and a senior official from my Department to attend the court case which preceded the events of Monday 11 October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated in my press statement of 12 October, I was extremely concerned at the reports of the disturbances in Glenamaddy. I condemn ouright any actions of physical violence as being totally inappropriate to the norms of a civilised community. <Col N="889" /> The fundamental principle at issue is the right of each and every citizen of Ireland to access to public facilities on a basis of equality, whether a member of the travelling community or not.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have already indicated on numerous occasions I am bringing forward legislation to extend legal redress against discrimination in relation both to the employment and non-employment areas. The preparation of the proposed legislation on employment equality is progressing and I expect to introduce the legislation next year.</P>
    <P>I hope to have the legislation in respect of non-employment areas passed in 1994.

    <P>The grounds on which discrimination will be prohibited are those set out in the Programme for Government and include sex, marital or parental status, sexual orientation, religion, age, handicap, race, colour, nationality, or national or ethnic origins, or membership of the travelling community.</P>
    <P>Discrimination by a publican against travellers will be prohibited.  However, discrimination on grounds other than those referred to above, such as mis-behaviour, will be lawful.</P>

      <P>The use of nuclear energy for weapons purposes does not <Col N="893" /> come within the scope of the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM).  The matter is thus outside the Community competence.  The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), of which Ireland and its partners are members, has the twin purposes of promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, and ensuring that nuclear activities are not used to further any military purpose.</P>
      <P>Ireland has always been a strong advocate of nuclear non-proliferation.  We were one of the original proponents of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), and the first to sign and ratify it in 1968.  At present almost 160 states are parties to the Treaty but about 30 states have not yet acceded to it.  Of the States Parties, over 90 have concluded safeguards agreements with the IAEA.  The Twelve member states of the European Union are parties to the Treaty.  All five acknowledged nuclear-weapon states are now parties to the Treaty, since France and China signed in 1992.  In 1991 South Africa became the first state which has admitted developing a nuclear weapons programme to accede to the Treaty, as a non-nuclear weapon State.  The most notable non-parties include Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Cuba, India, Israel and Pakistan. Of these, India has carried out a nuclear test, in 1974.  Of the states of the former Soviet Union, Kazakhstan and Ukraine, which still retain nuclear weapons, have committed themselves to accession to the NPT as non-nuclear-weapon states as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>During the last Irish Presidency of the EC, the European Council adopted a Declaration on Nuclear Non-Proliferation at its meeting in Dublin on 25-26 June 1990.  This was the first common declaration on non-proliferation by the Twelve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland, together with its partners in the European Union, is also a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group which is designed to control exports of nuclear materials and technology, particularly to non-parties to the NPT.  We are also members of the Missile Technology Control Regime, <Col N="894" /> which controls exports relating to missile technology, which could be used in the delivery of weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons.</P>

      <P>The Cultural Relations Committee is an expert body of leading figures in Irish cultural life appointed to advise the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the merits of Irish artistic and cultural projects to be undertaken abroad and to recommend whether or not such projects should be assisted from the annual allocation for cultural relations, which in 1993 is £213,000.</P>
      <P>I have approved already this year more than 250 recommendations by the committee which cover the whole spectrum of cultural activity in theatre and dance, music, the visual arts and literature.  I am convinced of the value of these projects in creating new outlets for Irish cultural expression and in enhancing the image of Ireland abroad.  I note with particular interest a significant number of projects in Eastern Europe, the Far East and South America, as I believe that through increased cultural activity it is possible to develop and expand relations with countries with which we have had little contact in the past.</P>
      <P>The committee have furthermore recently recommended financial support in a number of priority areas:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash; Visual Arts: This year, for the first time in some 30 years, Ireland was represented at the Venice Biennale. I have recently endorsed a proposal from the CRC that in future Ireland participate in other major international art exhibitions and fairs to create a greater awareness internationally of the exciting work currently being undertaken in the visual <Col N="895" /> arts here and to develop new outlets for Irish artists.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Film: One of the barriers to bringing Irish cinema to foreign audiences is the lack of availability of prints.  The Cultural Relations Committee has, accordingly, adopted an ongoing programme, in co-operation with the Irish Film Institute, to purchase prints of Irish films for screening at festivals abroad.</P>
    <P>&mdash; Literature: To create new markets for Irish literature, particularly on the continent of Europe, the CRC has given its support to the establishment of the Ireland-International Literature Agency which will promote the translation of writing in both English and Irish and the publication of contemporary Irish literature abroad.  The Agency, which will be based in the Irish Writers Centre, will, I understand, will be in operation early next year.</P>

    <P>It should be noted that the licensing <Col N="896" /> year for the main intoxicating liquor licences runs from 1 October to the following 30 September and that those who applied for Spirits Retailer's On-Licences (Publican's Licences), Spirits Retailer's Off-Licences and Wine Retailer's Licences in the 1992-93 licensing year were required, under the provisions of the 1992 Finance Act, to have obtained a tax clearance certificate from the office of the Collector-General before they could renew their licences.  As a result, figures for the latest years are not strictly comparable.</P>
    <P>Because many of those who applied for tax clearance post-October, 1992 were initially unsuccessful (because their tax affairs were not in order) but subsequently were successful in 1993, there is a marked reduction in the figure shown for the 1992 calendar year when compared with figures quoted for previous calendar years.  In other words, many licences which would in previous years have been renewed before the end of December were not in fact renewed until between January and September, 1993. Similarly in so far as the 1993-94 licensing year is concerned, it is expected that some licences will not be renewed before the end of December, 1993 because the applicants may still be in the process of securing tax clearance certificates.</P>
    <P>As regards tax clearance, the Revenue Commissioners estimate that about 13,800 out of the 15,598 licences issued in 1991 would require tax clearance for renewal.  For the licensing year 1 October 1992 &mdash; 30 September 1993, 12,737 tax clearance certificates were issued, 582 applications were refused and the balance of potential applicants did not apply for tax clearance.</P>
    <P>I should also mention that in relation to tax clearance that the Collector-General's Office is prepared to meet with publicans who are in arrears and who are prepared to make realistic efforts to discharge those arrears over a reasonable period of time.  I would suggest that such individuals should act accordingly with a view to obtaining a Tax Clearance Certificate and also a current intoxicating liquor licence.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 30 and 31 together.</P>
      <P>The tax code already has a number of tax reliefs to encourage the preservation of heritage property.  These reliefs are as follows:</P>
      <P>(1)  <i>Section 19, Finance Act, 1982</i></P>
      <P>Section 19, Finance Act, 1982 provides for relief from income tax or corporation tax to owner/occupiers of approved buildings in the State in respect of certain expenditure incurred by them after 5 April, 1982 on the repair, maintenance or restoration of buildings (or of any land occupied or enjoyed with an approved building as part of its garden or grounds of an ornamental nature in respect of which determination have been made&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>*by the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland that it is a building which is intrinsically of significant scientific, historical, architectural or aesthetic interest, and</P>
      <P>*by the Revenue Commissioners that reasonable access is afforded to the public.</P>
      <P>(2)  <i>Section 29, Finance Act, 1992</i></P>
      <P>Section 19, Finance Act, 1982 was recently extended by the provisions of section 29, Finance Act, 1993 to provide tax relief on expenditure incurred on the maintenance or restoration of gardens which are not attached to significant buildings but which are determined by the Commissioners of Public Works to be of significant horticultural, scientific, historical or aesthetic interest.  The rules for granting relief under section 29, Finance Act, 1993 are the same as those for section 19, Finance Act, 1982 and the Revenue Commissioners are also empowered to make determinations in respect of reasonable access.</P>
      <P>(3)  <i>Residential Property Tax</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to granting tax relief on expenditure incurred on the repair, maintenance or restoration of a building, a <Col N="899" /> determination under section 19, Finance Act, 1982 also removes the building from the charge to residential property tax (section 95, Finance Act, 1983).</P>
    <P>(4)  <i>Section 4, Finance Act, 1989</i></P>
    <P>Section 4, Finance Act, 1989 provides for relief for heritage houses in designated areas as part of the urban renewal reliefs.  The section provides for relief from income tax in relation to houses in designated areas which are determined by the Commissioners of Public Works to be of scientific, historical, architectural or aesthetic significance.  The relief consists of an income tax deduction in respect of 25 per cent of the relevant expenditure incurred by an individual in the first year of claim with a further deduction of 5 per cent allowable in each of the following five years, i.e. a total of 50 per cent.  The expenditure must be in respect of repair, restoration or maintenance which is consistent with the original character or fabric of the building and the house must be used by the individual as his sole or main residence.  As this relief is part of the urban renewal reliefs, it is due to terminate with the other such reliefs on 31 July, 1994.</P>
    <P>(5)  <i>Section 39, Capital Acquisitions Tax Act, 1976</i></P>
    <P>Section 39, Finance Act, 1978 provides that certain heritage houses and gardens situated in the State are exempt from capital acquisitions tax provided that they are not sold within six years from the valuation date.</P>
    <P>The requirements for exemptions are</P>
    <P>*the house or garden must not be held for the purposes of trading and must be shown to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners to be of national, scientific, historic or artistic interest,</P>
    <P>*reasonable facilities for viewing must be allowed to members of the public on a continuous basis and also for the three years immediately prior to the acquisition.</P>
    <P>In view of this range of tax reliefs in <Col N="900" /> relation to heritage property, I have no plans to introduce further incentives in this area.</P>

      <P>The carer's allowance, which I introduced in 1990, provided, for the first time, for the payment of a weekly allowance directly to a person providing fulltime care and attention to an elderly or incapacitated person.  Some 4,600 carers are in receipt of the allowance.</P>
      <P>Since its introduction, the carer's allowance has been increased and improved each year.  From July last the rate was increased by £6.20 to £59.20 a week.  This substantial increase of 11.7 per cent brings the rate into line with the rate of long term social assistance payments.</P>
      <P>The carer's allowance scheme is currently under review and the recommendation of the Second Committee on the Status of Women that the means test should be based on the means of the person being cared for rather than on the means of the carer will be considered in that context.  I should mention, however, that any change in the present means-testing arrangements would have financial implications which could only be considered in the light of available resources.</P>

      <P>The person concerned appealed the decision to the independent social welfare appeals office.  On 21 October 1993 he was examined by a different medical referee who expressed the opinion the he was incapable of work due to the occupational injury.

      <P>Irish copyright law complies with the current requirements of EC Directives.  However, changes in the law will be necessary to comply with the future effects of current and upcoming Directives.  Changes in legislation will also arise from the review of copyright law announced earlier this year.  The new legislation will have to ensure that there is a correct balance between the rights of owners and users.</P>

      <P>As Minister for Tourism and Trade I have responsibility for national tourism policy including identifying development priorities, and for monitoring the implementation of tourism policy.  I also seek to influence other aspects of public policy which are the responsibility of Government colleagues for the benefit of tourism development.</P>
      <P>My specific powers are set out in the Tourist Traffic Acts, 1931-1987, and relate mainly to policy matters specifically concerning the development of Irish tourism.  My statutory powers include the provision of grant-in-aid to Bord Fáilte for the development and promotion of tourist traffic, appointment of board members, etc.  I am also responsible to the Dáil for the provision of an annual grant-in-aid to CERT and SFADCo in respect of tourism traffic promotion.</P>
      <P>However, day to day business of Bord Fáilte, CERT and SFADCo including grant approvals, registration of individual premises and operators, details of expenditure, etc., are matters for the relevant boards, or council in the case of CERT, in accordance with statute and/or memoranda and articles of association.</P>

      <P>I have recently received a proposal from Bord na Móna for the provision of a new 120MW peat-fired electricity generation station to be located in the East Midlands. Bord na Móna's choice of location was based on the result of a feasibility study which included a detailed survey into available peat resources.  The conclusion which Bord na Móna reached was that the most appropriate location for such a station would be the East Midlands where peat resources are greatest.  The Derryfadda group of bogs were not considered as containing sufficient peat to supply such a station and therefore not capable of meeting the requirements for the proposed station.</P>

      <P>The provision of transport to sheltered workshops is primarily a matter for the workshops. In many instances workshops <Col N="914" /> provide transport by means of mini bus service.</P>
      <P>People attending workshops would normally qualify for free public transport. In areas where no public transport exists or where persons are unable, because of their disabilities, to avail of public transport health boards generally provide assistance towards transport costs to community workshops &mdash; usually the equivalent value of a monthly commuter ticket &mdash; currently £44 per month. In the Eastern Health Board a monthly allowance of £11 per person is also available where a person with a disability has to travel approximately 1.5 miles from a local railway station to a community workshop.</P>

      <P>At present people in sheltered workshops receive their disability or other allowance of approximately £60 per week plus an additional workshop payment of, on average, between £15 and £20 per week giving a total of up to £80 per week take-home pay.  In addition they continue to receive the benefits associated with their allowance such as free travel, free electricity allowance, free telephone rental allowance and a fuel allowance and are usually entitled to free health services.</P>
      <P>There would be considerable difficulties in introducing a minimum wage level given the wide range of activities pursued and varying productivity levels of sheltered workers.  There would also be significant cost implications. However, I recognise the need for a more structured system of sheltered employment, including payments for people with disabilities.  I would hope to have this matter examined in the near future.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 67 and 68.</P>
      <P>The present basic rate of salary for a 39-hour week for a hospital intern is £13,603 per annum.  Generally, interns are also paid a living out allowance of £1,355 per annum and are rostered to work a 65 hour week, for which they are paid overtime.  The average salary for an intern therefore is, in excess of £22.000 per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Intern salaries attract the increases agreed under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  There are no <Col N="916" /> proposals with my Department for any further salary increases for interns.</P>
    <P>Although the internship year forms part of the postgraduate training process, its main aim is to qualify medical graduates for full registration with the Medical Council.  As postgraduate training systems vary considerably between some European member states and Ireland, comparisons of salaries between both are not valid.</P>

      <P>As I advised the House on 6 October last, my Department, in conjunction with the Education Research Centre in Drumcondra, Dublin, conducted a survey of 11-year old and fifth class pupils in May 1993 to establish their reading attainment levels and to monitor trends in reading achievement over time.  Pupils with low levels of achievement in reading were a specific focus of the survey.  The data gathered is being analysed at present and I expect that the findings will be submitted to me in due course.</P>
      <P>In addition, a survey aimed at identifying the extent of disability in ordinary national schools, including difficulties associated with reading, was undertaken by the Special Education Review Committee in 1992.  This survey had the purpose of informing the committee in recommending what additional support services are required to meet the education needs of the children in question. Among the surveys findings was that an estimated 1,744 children with specific learning disability, including reading disability, were attending ordinary national schools.</P>
      <P>In relation to teacher training, the position is that teachers are trained as a normal part of their teacher training course to identify specific learning disability and indeed a variety of other reading problems.  Also, in-service training for remedial teachers is provided on an on-going basis at six centres throughout the country.  Teachers who are not in recognised remedial posts are accommodated, where possible, on some of these courses.</P>

Under these regulations, the vehicles in question, while engaged for school transport purposes, may carry 3 pupils for every authorised 2 seats.

      <P>The preparation of tender documents has been completed for this project.  Because of other demands deemed to be of a higher priority which had to take precedence it was not possible to include this project in the national schools capital programme for 1993.  It will be considered for inclusion in the 1994 building programme in the light of other commitments and priorities.</P>

      <P>Over 17,000 adults participated in part-time adult education courses in the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee area in 1992-93, involving almost 350 courses.</P>
      <P>I understand that there are low participation rates in general adult education courses in some areas where there are a high number of disadvantaged people. The vocational education committee encourages participation in adult education in these areas through special interventions and programmes which include the following:</P>
      <P>&mdash;Assistance with fees for attendance at general part-time courses for adults.</P>
      <P>&mdash;Under the Adult Literacy and Community Education Scheme, the vocational education committee funds 11 literacy schemes in the city and 53 voluntary groups engaged in community adult education activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;Over 1,000 long term unemployed adults are engaged at present in fulltime <Col N="925" /> education in the Vocational Training Opportunities scheme and under the Department of Social Welfare second level scheme for the long term unemployed.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Over 350 young adults who left school without qualification undergo specially designed education programmes under the Youthreach scheme.</P>
    <P>&mdash;A large number of young adults receive tuition in numeracy and literacy in Community Training Workshops and Travellers Workshops.</P>
    <P>My Department is in regular contact with the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee concerning various aspects of adult education and it provided substantially increased funding to the vocational education committee this year for the special interventions indicated above.</P>

      <P>I am aware that despite very substantial investment in school buildings over the years, much of which was needed to cater for increased enrolment, the condition of some schools leaves much to be desired.  In recognition of this the Programme for Government (1992) states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We will allocate an increased amount in each of the next five years to implement a planned programme of replacing or refurbishing sub-standard school buildings&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>However, I would like to assure the Deputy that my Department is satisfied that the procedures governing the choice of materials and the supervision of construction are satisfactory.  These procedures are regularly reviewed and updated to ensure that the materials used in school buildings comply with all relevant Irish and European standards and codes of practice.</P>
