      <P>It is proposed to take No. 5.  It is also proposed notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders that: 1. Business shall be interrupted at 4.45 p.m. today; 2. Second Stage of No. 5 shall be taken today and the proceedings thereon shall be brought to a conclusion at 4.45 p.m. today; 3.  The proceedings on Committee Stage of the Waiver of Certain Tax, Interest and Penalties Bill, 1993, being dealt with in Select Committee, shall be brought to a conclusion at such time tomorrow as the committee may see fit to discharge and complete Committee Stage by one question which shall be put from the Chair of that Select Committee and which shall in relation to amendments include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Finance; and, 4.  The Dáil shall sit tomorrow at 10.30 a.m. and shall adjourn not later than 4 p.m.</P>

      <P>Is the proposal that business be interrupted at 4.45 p.m. today agreed?  Agreed.  Are the arrangements for dealing with No. 5 satisfactory? Agreed.  Are the arrangements for dealing with the Waiver of Certain Tax, Interest and Penalties Bill, 1993, agreed?</P>

      <P>The Select Committee <Col N="762" /> is sitting at present; it sat at 10.30 a.m. Deputy Cox, the Progressive Democrats' spokesman on Finance, was anxious to be here to raise points about certain aspects of this matter.  However, he had to be at the committee.  It is impossible to operate in this fashion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand a briefing by the Department of Finance is taking place at present.  I do not know how long that briefing will take.  A two day debate on Committee Stage of this Bill is inadequate. The committee should be allowed to decide the time it wants to conclude rather than having it laid down in advance by this House.  It is very unusual to have the House dictating to the committee the period it should sit and imposing a guillotine on it.  These committees were set up so that there would be adequate time to discuss difficult matters which needed teasing out. The committee will not have the opportunity to do this if it is being guillotined from above by this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the import of what Deputy O'Malley has said.  Eighty one amendments have been put down to the Bill.  Until we had spent time going through the detail of the Bill, I do not think any of us could have envisaged this happening.  The motivation behind the House ordering the work of the committees has been the traditional poor attendance on Fridays.  That will not happen in the case of this Bill, which, for example, permits statements of self-declaration by people seeking to avail of the amnesty and the granting of a certificate in return for that.  This means they can never be probed by the Revenue Commissioners at any stage in the future or have their statement looked behind&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Government to permit the committee to order its own affairs so that it can deal with the 81 amendments in the order it thinks appropriate. This would be a major improvement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night the House agreed to complete Committee Stage of this Bill at 1 p.m. tomorrow.  This motion seeks to give the committee flexibility to extend the debate for an hour, two hours or three hours tomorrow.  If the committee wants more time it has the flexibility to take it.  This motion is helpful to the committee; it does not take away its flexibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems that this problem could be overcome by the deletion of the word &ldquo;tomorrow&rdquo; so that the committee is allowed to complete the debate &ldquo;at such time as it sees fit&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Government has a majority on the committee &mdash; one assumes that the Government TDs will attend &mdash; it can decide the time it wants to complete the proceedings.  This would meet the point of concern.  I understand that there was general agreement to the time schedule.  It appears that a number of people who gave their agreement now feel, in view of the number of amendments which have been tabled, that they will need more time.  That is understandable; at the time they gave their agreement they probably did not foresee the number of amendments which would be tabled.  The deletion of the word &ldquo;tomorrow&rdquo; might allow a measure of flexibility, which in any event the Government could control because it has a majority on the committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The stumbling block is clearly the proposal that the committee can conclude the debate at whatever time it sees fit &ldquo;tomorrow&rdquo;.  Given that he wants to have the debate concluded by Tuesday, would the Taoiseach <Col N="764" /> agree that if the facilities of the House were available to it on Monday, the committee could continue tomorrow until whatever time it wished and resume on Monday and continue until whatever time it wished to conclude?  It would be better to adjust the proposal today to allow the committee to conclude its business by Tuesday.</P>

      <P>May I put the question in respect of the amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We want to take Report Stage on Tuesday: the other arrangements can be reviewed today if Deputies wish.  There was agreement last night that the Committee Stage proceedings of this Bill would finish at 1 p.m. tomorrow.  On a request for more time, we built in flexibility this morning to allow it to go on for a few more hours to facilitate Members.  The Government's objective is to complete the Report Stage by Tuesday and we had agreement on this.  Why do some Members continually row back from the agreements reached? I know the Fine Gael Party is not doing it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Whips spent a considerable amount of time discussing whether this Bill should be referred to a select committee.  It is fundamental that the Bill, in the first instance, is referred to the select committee.  I am happy that a degree of flexibility has been built into the committee system which allows committee members to discuss the Bill at greater length.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the Whips meet at 3 p.m. today to review the position and if the Members feel that the proceedings should continue on Monday, we could deal with that at our meeting at 3 p.m. today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>That is perfectly acceptable, Sir, but may I clarify the matter?  If the Whips agree today that the committee should reconvene on Monday is there anything in the order to be put to the House that disbars it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We will deal with that tomorrow morning and if necessary we can clarify matters.  Are the proposals in respect of No. 3, the Waiver of Certain Tax, Interest and Penalties Bill, 1993, agreed subject to talks among the Whips?  Agreed.  Is it agreed that the Dáil shall sit tomorrow at 10.30 a.m. and shall adjourn not later than 4 p.m.?  Agreed.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach give an indication as to when the legislation dealing with alleged miscarriages of justice will be brought before the House? We have agitated about miscarriages of justice in other jurisdictions and have been successful in having some of the cases reviewed but we do not have any mechanism for looking at miscarriages of justice in our own jurisdiction.  That weakens considerably the case we are putting to other nations.</P>

    <Title>Road Traffic Bill, 1993 Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Road traffic legislation sets standards for motorists and other road users which are essential for road safety and for effective and orderly use of road space.  With the exception of drink driving legislation, which was last reviewed in 1978, the vast bulk of Irish road traffic law is contained in the Road Traffic Acts of 1961 and 1968.  A general review of all existing road traffic legislation is now desirable, but this will be a major task and take several years to complete.  In the meantime certain aspects require urgent change and this Bill will address these. In particular it will restate and strengthen the law relating to drink driving; introduce new measures to secure better enforcement of road traffic law; introduce more streamlined arrangements for making traffic regulations; and devolve a range of functions to local authorities. Before dealing with individual provisions in the Bill, I propose to order my remarks on the basis of the general objectives I have just mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The law relating to drink driving has been updated and amended on a number of occasions.  The Road Traffic Act, 1933, contained a prohibition on driving &ldquo;while drunk&rdquo;.  This was replaced, in 1961, by an offence of driving while under the influence of an intoxicating liquor or a drug, and a separate offence of being in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicating liquor or a drug.  The Road Traffic Act, 1968, added an additional <Col N="770" /> offence of driving, or being in charge of, a mechanically propelled vehicle with a blood alcohol level exceeding 125 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood.  That Act was the basis for the current system of analysing specimens for levels of alcohol and for the use of the results of the analyses as evidence in drink driving prosecutions.</P>
    <P>The Road Traffic (Amendment) Act, 1978, introduced further changes to the drink driving laws, including a reduction in the blood alcohol level to 100 milligrammes. Some of the changes arose from successful court challenges while others were made to take account of developments, including new technology, over the previous ten years.</P>
    <P>The present Bill is designed to introduce further policy changes and to update and strengthen the law in the light of experience since 1978.  It will replace the 1978 Act entirely but, while there are significant changes, care has been taken to retain those provisions and procedures set out in the 1978 Act which have successfully withstood legal challenge.  I am sure the House will agree that it would not be advisable to change tried and trusted statutory provisions purely for the sake of change.</P>
    <P>The main new provisions in relation to drink driving are as follows.  The maximum permissible alcohol level will be reduced from 100 to 80 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood, with a corresponding reduction in the level for urine.  There is provision for the introduction of evidential breath testing and for a maximum permissible breath alcohol level which would equate with the reduced blood and urine alcohol levels. There will be power to vary the maximum alcohol level, by regulations, and to set different limits for different classes of drivers.  Any such regulations will be subject to the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Garda will have power to detain intoxicated drivers for up to eight hours where the release of the drivers could be a threat to the safety of themselves or other persons.  There will be a specific power for a garda and a designated doctor to enter hospitals to <Col N="771" /> take a blood or urine specimen from a driver involved in a traffic accident.  The type of specimen to be provided &mdash; breath, blood or urine &mdash; will be at the discretion of the garda.  There will be mandatory orders directing persons convicted of drink driving offences to pay the costs and expenses incurred by the State in taking a prosecution.  Additional amendments to existing drink driving provisions will be made to close loopholes shown up by court cases.  These include power for a member of the Garda Síochána to enter on private property to secure an arrest.</P>
    <P>The second broad purpose of the Bill is to strengthen the powers of the Garda Síochána in enforcing the Road Traffic Acts and to provide for increased penalties for certain offences.  A number of these measures were recommended by an inter ministerial group on motor insurance.  The most significant new provisions are: a requirement to carry a driving licence at all times when driving a vehicle; power for the Garda Síochána to impound vehicles where the vehicle is not taxed, for uninsured driving, or where the person driving is in the opinion of the Garda too young to hold a driving licence; and increased periods of mandatory disqualification, and a requirement to pass a driving test, following conviction for drink driving offences or for a dangerous driving offence.</P>
    <P>The new drink driving and enforcement provisions are aimed primarily at improving safety on our roads.  To appreciate the need for such measures it is essential to reflect on some basic statistics.  In 1992 a total of 415 people were killed in 384 fatal accidents on Irish roads and a further 10,000 people were injured.  International statistics are even more chilling.  Every year road accidents are the cause of about 50,000 deaths and more than a million and a half injuries on the roads of the European Community. Since the Treaty of Rome was signed almost two million people have been killed in the 12 countries which are now Community members and almost 40 million injured.  There are statistics.  Behind <Col N="772" /> those statistics lie the trauma and tragedy, the loss in human, social and financial terms which is not easy to describe.  Young life has been cut off in its prime.  Parents leaving the home in perfect health have, minutes or hours later, crossed the great divide.</P>
    <P>For a long time the increase in road accidents was regarded as an unavoidable corollary to the increase in motor traffic. However, experience in recent years has shown that this need not be the case and that it is possible to reduce the number and seriousness of road accidents.</P>
    <P>Driver behaviour has been identified as the single most important factor causing road accidents.  The challenge which we face is to persuade road users to change habitual behaviour: each road user has to be made aware of his or her personal responsibility and of the risks they take or impose on others through behaviour which is careless or contrary to the normal rules of conduct.  Driver behaviour can be conditioned both by education and information programmes and by laws and regulations and their strict enforcement.</P>
    <P>In 1990 a new approach was adopted towards the promotion of road safety in this country.  A campaign was launched in September of that year which recognised that a successful road safety programme had to have a multi-dimensional focus. Thus the campaign, which is now in its third full year, features initiatives in the areas of publicity, education, enforcement, research and legislation.  These campaigns and other initiatives have contributed to a reduction of the order of 7 per cent in deaths on our roads in each of the past two years.  The support of the Garda has been crucial in achieving this. Equally, the financial support provided by the Irish Insurance Federtion to the National Safety Council has been significant. Legislative initiatives have also featured in the approach adopted.  Particular emphasis has been laid to date on initiatives relating to vehicle safety.  Most realistic speed limits have also been introduced, coupled with better enforcement, and a new <i>Rules of the Road</i> booklet has been published.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="773" /> While these initiatives have changed public attitudes to drink driving and other bad driving practices, more needs to be done.  Promotional road safety campaigns will continue but they must be completed by adequate legislation and enforcement to provide a real deterrent to the hard core who have yet to be convinced of their individual responsibility. On this point, it is worth nothing that in both 1991 and 1992 more than one-third of all specimens analysed by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety had alcohol concentrations of more than twice the legal limit.</P>
    <P>The level of death and injury arising from road accidents is simply not acceptable. I am confident that the provisions in the Bill, supported by increased enforcement, will reduce the levels of tragedy and trauma for many of our people by reducing road accidents.</P>
    <P>The third broad function of the Bill is to streamline procedures for making traffic regulations.  The current code governing traffic and parking rules is fragmented. General traffic regulations, which outline the basic rules of the road, are provided in regulations made by the Minister for the Environment.  These regulations are complemented by a series of local traffic and parking by-laws, or temporary rules, which are made by the Garda Commissioner for each county. This arrangement has given rise to a significant element of duplication and so this Bill provides for an amalgamation of the two codes.  This will simplify the procedures, remove duplication and anomalies between the two codes, and provide a single reference point for the gardaí, traffic wardens, local authorities and the motoring public as to the source of traffic and parking regulations.</P>
    <P>The fourth broad element of the Bill involves devolution of functions to local authorities in line with the Programme for a Partnership Government.  The existing role of local authorities in road traffic matters is based on the provisions of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, which was enacted at a time when local authorities had little expertise or experience in traffic <Col N="774" /> matters and when there was an undue emphasis on central controls.  The Bill will give greater recognition to the contribution which local authorities can make.  It proposes a significant shift of power to local authorities in relation to the implementation of traffic management measures, in the introduction and operation of parking controls and in applying speed limits to roads in their areas.</P>
    <P>I would now like to draw attention to some of the more important provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Part III contains major new provisions to update and strengthen the law in relation to drink driving.  Sections 10 and 11 contain the most significant policy change.  They reduce the maximum permissible alcohol level from 100 to 80 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood, with a corresponding reduction in the level for urine.  These sections also introduce a new breath alcohol level of 35 microgrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath, equating with the reduced blood and urine levels.  The present alcohol limit has been in existence since 1978 and now ranks as the highest in the European Community. The reduction of the limit will bring us into line with the majority of our European partners.</P>
    <P>Sections 10 and 11 also empower the Minister to make regulations varying the levels of alcohol permissible in a person's blood, urine and breath, and to set different limits for different classes of drivers. This provision will facilitate implementation of any further amendments in the maximum permissible alcohol level without the need for primary legislation. However, because of the sensitive nature of these provisions and the fact that the current levels are set out in primary legislation, the Bill provides that any such regulations will only be made with the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>A new power for a member of the Garda Síochána to enter on private property to secure an arrest for an offence under either of these sections is also proposed. This is necessary because the <Col N="775" /> Supreme Court has determined that, in the absence of such a specific power, an arrest effected on private property is unlawful as the Garda would be trespassing.</P>
    <P>Section 13, which replaces sections 13 and 14 of the Act of 1978, contains the provisions which require persons to provide breath, blood and urine specimens following arrest.  This section, together with other provisions in the Bill, will facilitate the use of the results of breath tests as evidence in drink driving prosecutions. The use of evidential breath testing apparatus is now the norm in many European countries.  The advantages of this method of analysis are obvious: the breath test is easy to administer, the presence of a doctor is unnecessary, specimens will not require analysis by a laboratory, and the result of the test is available on the spot.  The procedures to be followed in the taking of breath specimens are outlined in section 17.</P>
    <P>As the addition of evidential breath testing to the drink driving code is a new departure here, it will obviously take some time to build up confidence in the system.  Accordingly, I propose to phase in its operation and to use the system in the early stages in tandem with blood and urine testing.  Prosecutions will not be grounded on breath test results until such time as we have gained sufficient experience of its use.  In time, however, I anticipate that evidential breath testing will become the norm in drink driving cases and that it will eventually replace blood and urine testing.</P>
    <P>In section 15, both the Garda Síochána and a designated doctor are provided with a specific power to enter a hospital to take a blood or urine specimen from a driver suspected of being involved in a traffic accident.  This section removes the anomaly under existing law whereby a person can avoid having to supply a specimen if he or she has been involved in a traffic accident, is injured or feigning injury, has been removed from the scene of the accident, and is under the care of a doctor.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="776" /> Section 16 provides a new power for a member of the Garda Síochána to detain an intoxicated driver who has been arrested where the person's release could constitute a threat to his or her own safety or that of another person.  A number of safeguards to protect the rights of a detained driver are specified and the maximum period of detention is limited to eight hours.</P>
    <P>Section 22 introduces a new provision which will require a person found guilty of a drink driving offence to pay a contribution towards costs incurred in the detection and prosecution of the offence. This will be in addition to any fine, term of imprisonment or disqualification. While the payment of costs will generally be mandatory, the court will have power to waive payment where it is satisfied that there are special and substantial reasons for doing so.</P>
    <P>Part IV makes important changes in the law on driving licences.  Under the Road Traffic Act, 1961, a person is required to produce a driving licence if demanded by a member of the Garda Síochána but is allowed a period of ten days within which to produce the licence at a nominated Garda station.  It is only where a driving licence is not produced within ten days of the demand that an offence exists.  This system has given rise to difficulties in the enforcement of the road traffic code.  The new section 25 provides, therefore, that a driving licence must be produced immediately and thus effectively requires a driver to carry a driving licence at all times when driving a vehicle.  This will give the gardaí immediate proof of the identity of the driver and will be of great assistance in enforcement.</P>
    <P>Section 26 sets out the mandatory disqualification periods which will apply for drink driving and other road traffic offences.  The principle of mandatory or consequential disqualification, which has applied since 1933, is that the court must, on conviction of specified offences, impose a minimum period of disqualification from holding a driving licence.</P>
    <P>Under section 26, a person found guilty <Col N="777" /> of an offence listed in the Second Schedule will be automatically disqualified from holding a driving licence and the court will have the option of imposing a disqualification until a certificate of competency &mdash; on passing a driving test &mdash; or a certificate of fitness, is obtained.  The section introduces a new requirement to the effect that a person found guilty of drink driving offences or dangerous driving will, in addition to the minimum period of disqualification, be automatically disqualified until the person passes a driving test and produces a certificate of competency.  This new requirement gives effect to a recommendation of the inter-ministerial group on motor insurance and is to be applied to offences which clearly signal doubts about a driver's judgment and competence.</P>
    <P>Section 27 amends the provisions which govern the removal of disqualification orders.  It inserts a new subsection into section 29 of the 1961 Act extending the minimum period which must pass before an application may be made to the court for a review of disqualification orders and for the removal of such orders where they apply for a period of two years or more.</P>
    <P>Section 28 restates section 42 (4) (d) of the Road Traffic Act, 1961 which provides for licensing authorities to be notified of disqualifications to endorsements and extends it to include other prescribed persons.  This extension will facilitate the notification of details of disqualifications or endorsements to other bodies, for example, insurance companies.  Section 29 puts beyond doubt that certain provisions of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, will apply to provisional licences, as well as to driving licences.  The sections concerned are mainly those relating to disqualifications and endorsements.</P>
    <P>Part V introduces new arrangements for applying speed limits to roads with the primary aim of assigning the maximum responsibility to local authorities.  Existing legislation provides for four different types of speed limit.  One of these categories, described as ordinary speed limits, applies to specific categories of vehicles such as buses and goods vehicles, <Col N="778" /> whereas the remainder apply to the road. The general speed limit of 60 mph normally applies to roads in rural areas and a built up area speed limit of 30 mph normally applies to roads in urban areas. Both these speed limits are currently determined either in primary legislation or in regulations made on a national basis by the Minister for the Environment. Exemptions to those speed limits can be found generally on roads approaching urban areas where special speed limits of 40 to 50 mph apply.</P>
    <P>Section 31 provides for a new motorway speed limit of 70 mph.  This will automatically apply to all motorways and will avoid having to make a separate statutory instrument every time a new section of motorway is opened to traffic. Section 32 and 33 contain the main devolution proposals in this Part of the Bill.  They assign responsibility to county councils and county boroughs for determining the speed limits which will apply to individual roads in their areas.  The need for ministerial approval is eliminated, except in the case of national roads.</P>
    <P>Part VI replaces the present statutory arrangements for the regulation of traffic, including parking controls.  In section 35 and 36, the procedures for the making of traffic regulations are streamlined and greater power will devolve to local authorities. Section 35 provides for national traffic regulations to be made by the Minister.  Issues which should be dealt with at a local level, such as systems of paid parking controls, are to be dealt with in separate local by-laws to be made by local authorities under section 36.</P>
    <P>Section 37 assigns greater responsibility and discretion to local authorities in the application of traffic management measures in their areas.  Local authorities will no longer be obliged to obtain the consent of the Garda Commissioner before providing traffic signs.  As traffic management measures are generally implemented by the provision of traffic signs, the House will appreciate the significance of this change.  Under the amended provisions, local authorities will have full discretion, subject only to a requirement <Col N="779" /> that they consult the Garda Commissioner in advance of providing regulatory traffic signs.  The section does, however, introduce a public consultation process before certain regulatory signs can be provided.  The intention is that this requirement will be limited to signs which implement significant traffic management measures which could have a serious impact on road users and property owners in the areas affected.  An example would be a new one-way street system.  The final decision in relation to the provision of these special category signs will be taken in all cases by the elected members, after the public consultation process has been completed.</P>
    <P>The most significant provision in Part VII, section 39, will empower a member of the Garda Síochána to detain and impound vehicles for motor tax and motor insurance offences or where the driver is, in the opinion of the Garda, too young to hold a driving licence.</P>
    <P>Non-payment of road tax and motor insurance evasion are serious offences which impact on law abiding motorists who, essentially, subsidise the offenders. The income lost to the Exchequer in unpaid road tax must be found elsewhere and, in the case of motor insurance, the loss of premium, income coupled with the cost of paying compensation for the actions of uninsured drivers, results in an added burden for the vast majority who meet their own obligations.</P>
    <P>The impounding provisions are designed to give the Garda Síochána the powers they need to tackle both motor tax and motor insurance evaders and to eliminate this unacceptable practice.  The power to impound vehicles being driven by under-age drivers is specifically designed to help tackle the problem commonly known as joyriding and I have no doubt this will be particularly welcomed by the House.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the overview of this important legislation that it does much to improve and update road traffic law.  I look forward to a positive and constructive debate on the Bill and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Col N="780" />
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The word &ldquo;carnage&rdquo; has been used often in reference to the numbers killed and injured on our roads.  It has become almost acceptable as part and parcel of the transportation we use.  From 1981-90 almost 5,000 people were slaughtered on our roads in the Republic and 83,700 were injured.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Energy has had a great input to legislation to protect the public.  He introduced the Local Government (Multi-Storey Buildings) Act, 1988, and fire safety regulations are strictly enforced.  The Minister can be sure that the siting of a national toxic waste incinerator and any potential safety problems will be rigorously analysed and controlled by regulation, but road accidents, the greatest cause of death, and our tolerance of this carnage is a tragedy and a national disgrace.</P>
      <P>Many factors contribute to these appalling statistics.  The Environmental Research Unit's annual publication <i>Road Accident Facts Ireland, 1992</i> lists these factors which include the environment, road conditions, the driver or rider, pedestrians and passengers and the quality of the vehicle.  In so far as it is possible to be sure, the major contributory factor in both road fatalities and injuries is the driver.  In 35 per cent of cases drink is a major cause of driver error and accidents. The maxim &ldquo;two will do&rdquo; no longer holds.  One drink, for some, will be a drink too many when this legislation, which we will support on Second Stage, is passed.</P>
      <P>The reduction in the blood alcohol limit to 80 milligrams is the most significant element.  We are also departing radically from previous practice in regard to impounding vehicles for non-insurance &mdash; I think we will be the only country in Europe to do so.  The serious penalties for breaching the law will, I hope, bring about a climate of intolerance to drink driving, a greater awareness of the value of human life and of how much unnecessary death, suffering and expense could be avoided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that the reduction in the blood alcohol limit to 80 milligrams brings us into line with Europe.  I am not <Col N="781" /> sure it does.  Perhaps it would be honest if we admitted we are doing too little too late on this issue.  This was promised on at least four occasions, twice by the Minister, and by previous Ministers, Deputy O'Hanlon and Mr. Flynn.  The Minister has now brought the legislation before the House, but it has been a long time coming.  We have had the most liberal regime in Europe in regard to the legal limits for blood alcohol.  We are changing just in time before a directive from Europe can be issued on rationalisation in this area.  The increased penalties and stringent regulations will have to be balanced with safeguards and phased penalties to which the Minister already referred.  The Minister said he is bringing us into line with Europe.  However, in Europe the blood alcohol limit is 50 milligrams, not 80 milligrams.  Many states in the US, Australia, Finland, Greece, the Netherlands, Japan, Norway, Portugal, Sweden and Scandinavia, which have been the most successful countries in eliminating drunken driving as a major cause of accidents and fatalities, are looking at the possibility at zero or, at best, 50 milligrams of blood alcohol as the tolerated legal limit.</P>
    <P>The validity of a legal limit of 80 milligrams is now being questioned by socially aware people.  If one has 95 milligrams of alcohol in one's blood today and is stopped by the Garda one is considered to be below the legal alcohol limit.  However, if one has 85 milligrams of blood alcohol some time next week when this Bill has been passed one will be over the limit and subject to very severe penalties.  I support the thrust of the Bill but I would request safeguards in regard to the implementation of the law in this area.  Many people having consumed 90 milligrams of alcohol have driven safely and this has been tolerated; but next week people who consume 85 milligrams could find themselves subject to stringent penalties.  A phased introduction of penalties in this area is necessary. I do not consider it possible to put the person who consumes a small amount of alcohol and who drives safely home in the same category as a person with 350 <Col N="782" /> milligrams of alcohol in their blood system who would be a serious danger to themselves and the public.  The phasing in of penalties in this area should be considered.  If such a measure is taken the courts and the Judiciary can be asked to rigorously enforce penalties in the drink driving area and other areas.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute to Mrs. Gertie Shield and Mothers Against Drunk Driving who, as a result of personal tragedy and suffering, have invested great energy and effort into increasing the collective consciousness of the nation of our appalling record of drink driving.</P>
    <P>No legislation will be effective if it is not enforced.  My greatest concern in regard to this Bill is that the enforcers, the Garda authorities, may not be given the necessary resources to implement its provisions effectively.  It is only through effective and even-handed enforcement of the law that our present tolerant attitudes to drunk and dangerous driving will be changed.  The Garda will need increased financial resources and increased numbers to deal with this problem. I ask the Minister to assure the House that such resources will be provided and that his colleague, the Minister for Justice, and the Cabinet collectively will ensure that resources are available to allow the effective enforcement of this legislation.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to increase the remit of the National Safety Council and I commend it for its work on the safety campaign, especially in my county of Wexford.  That campaign should be reconstituted into the National Road Safety Council as recommended to the Minister in January 1992 in a submission on road accidents prepared by the transportation policy group of the Institute of Engineers of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Given the enormity of the problem, the Minister should consider allocating responsibility for road safety to the Minister of State.  With the proposed devolution of certain traffic management functions to local authorities, which is welcome and long overdue, each local authority should be required <Col N="783" /> to establish a road safety committee of elected members, officials and gardaí to inquire into accidents and propose any necessary action to reduce such occurrences. These committees could then prepare road accident reduction plans for their functional area.  They could be serviced by a road safety officer who would be experienced in road traffic management and road design and be responsible for the investigation of road accidents in his or her area.  Local road safety committees and road safety officers could establish close liaison with the proposed National Road Safety Council.  Each local authority would need to be allocated a specific budget for accident reduction plans and such a measure would provide substantial savings to the insurance companies and to the State. Given the exceptional generosity of the Irish Insurance Federation to the existing National Safety Council &mdash; an amount of over £2 million in the last two years &mdash; I am sure its continued generosity could be relied on.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to reintroduce the &ldquo;black spot&rdquo; elimination grant to help in their identification, assessment and elimination. Road surfacing and skid resistance need greater investment as there has been a dramatic decline in recent years in the standard of road surfaces generally.  Will the Structural moneys be applied specifically to road surfacing and skid resistance as distinct from major capital investment in new roads, bridges and by-passes?  Where possible pedestrians and cyclists should be segregated from vehicular traffic.  Traffic calming measures &mdash; ramps, rumble strips and street narrowing &mdash; should be introduced to areas where pedestrians are at greatest risk from any vehicular traffic.  Flyovers rather than roundabouts should be considered where possible in major road reconstruction.  Consideration should be given to the use of dipped headlights during daylight hours.  Regulations requiring parking on the correct side of the road on which vehicles travel should be introduced and enforced and I will be tabling an amendment to provide for such <Col N="784" /> regulations, which I hope the Minister will accept.</P>
    <P>Are we having an MOT type system for older vehicles?  Some soundings were made about this some years ago, but I am not sure what the position is in regard to this issue at present.  Everybody who owns a two or three year old car need not be hounded nor should legitimate bona fide motorists and drivers be burdened with massive expenses.  However, some vehicles on our roads are in an apalling condition and are a major source of danger both to the driver and the general public.</P>
    <P>Why has the Minister not availed of this Bill to introduce the mandatory wearing of helmets by cyclist on our roads, especially by the under 18 year olds?  I will table an amendment on this matter on Committee Stage and I would urge the Minister to accept it.  The logic of this measure is overwhelming.  However, young people especially because of peer group pressure, will need the force of law to ensure they minimise risk to themselves while cycling on our roads.  There is a public clamour for legislation in this area to compel perhaps all cyclists, though I would be pleased at this stage if it were the 18 year olds, to wear helmets. I balk at insisting that all adults should wear helmets.  If it were compulsory for young people to wear helmets I believe that once the habit was established those who continue to use cycling as their mode of transport in later life would continue with that good habit.</P>
    <P>Apparently Ireland is the only country in Europe that does not have a fully trained paramedical service to ensure that road accident victims are treated quickly and in a suitable way.  Perhaps the Minister would explain why he has not gone down that road or examined that option.  If we are the only country in Europe without this service, it obviously is a very successful one.  Would the Minister discuss with his colleague, the Minister for Health, the implementation and establishment of a paramedical service to help road accident victims and provide a team in each county who could respond immediately to traffic accidents.  Such a <Col N="785" /> service would reduce the number of fatalities and serious injuries and would provide quick treatment of road accident victims.</P>
    <P>There are other matters I wish to raise and I will deal with the Bill section by section on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Minister's proposal to impound uninsured vehicles, would he explain whether uninsured vehicles and those not displaying tax discs even though insured will be treated in the same way? Practical recovery arrangements and a phased penalty system are needed, depending on the severity of the crime involved.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister considered restricted driving licences such as those which operate in Northern Ireland?  When young people pass their driving test they are category R drivers for a few years until they gain more driving experience. I believe young people who have passed their driving test are the best drivers on our roads.  However, they do not have experience, nor can they anticipate situations as well as someone who has many years driving experience and has come to know what to expect around each corner.</P>
    <P>It is demoralising for the Garda and the other law enforcement authorities that traffic offences are not always treated sufficiently seriously by the Judiciary.  I would like the Minister to impress on the Judiciary the need to treat offences in this area more seriously, particularly minor traffic offences, because bad habits, once established, can lead to major traffic offences.  The courts need to recognise and respond to public and political concern in regard to road traffic offences generally.  Did the Minister consider weight restrictions on our county roads and bridges?  Many of the county roads, particularly in County Cavan and so on, are experiencing serious problems because the roads were not structured for the type and weight of vehicle they are now forced to support.</P>
    <P>I am confused about the interchange of miles per hour and kilometres per hour here.  The distance is given in kilometres but apparently the speed limits will continue to be in miles per hour.  We must <Col N="786" /> rationalise this.  We are either using the metric system and are with the rest of Europe using kilometres per hour, or we are not.  If a dual system continues it will be confusing.  Will the Minister give us his view on that issue?  The matter must be resolved because we cannot expect the public to respect the law when it is so confusing.</P>
    <P>The speed limits on our county roads will now be the responsibility of local authorities and I agree with that decision. However, there could be a difficulty when, for example, one drives from Wexford to Carlow, Wicklow or Kilkenny. While driving on the same county road at a certain spot, which is not immediately recognisable one suddenly is in Kilkenny where there may be a higher or lower speed limit than Wexford.  A person could be driving within the law in Wexford but, without realising it, be transgressing it, a short distance further on under a different speed limit.  We must have some co-ordination and devolve power to each local authority to do what they feel is best for their region.</P>
    <P>Did the Minister consider the possibility of a points system when driving licences are endorsed for different offences &mdash; such a system is effective in the UK I understand.  Under that system the licence could be withdrawn following the accumulation of a number of points.</P>
    <P>Local authorities will also need a once off grant to cater for this devolution of authority, which I welcome.  Since 1987 the local authority in Wexford has been applying for a range of speed limit revisions, the introduction of speed limits in areas and the extension of speed limits zones on the outskirts of towns and villages. The cost to Wexford County Council of signposting our revised limits, assuming they would be accepted, would be £70,000.  Apparently speed limit signs are expensive.  I was unaware, I did not think that was the case.  I suggest that next year, or at the appropriate time local authorities be given a once-off increase in their block grant to accommodate the cost of adjusting speed limits and erecting signposts.</P>
    <P>I would also like to see an extension of <Col N="787" /> the on-the-spot fine system, particularly for minor traffic offences such as going through red lights, exceeding the speed limit not involving dangerous driving, lane hopping, cycling without lights and using trailers that do not have adequate lighting.</P>
    <P>I broadly welcome many of the measures in the Bill.  I recognise, without equivocation, the need to tighten up the law considerably in this area.  Stringent regulations must be balanced with safeguards and a phased system of penalties. Above all, this Bill must be accompanied by extra resources for the enforcing authority, the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>Road transport is vital to industrial development and the private car is fundamental to modern life.  It has introduced a freedom of movement that is unparalleled in history.  However, these advantages must not blind us to the fact that road transport in Ireland kills and maims more than private guns, pollution, fire or many of the other hazards or supposed hazards to which stringent legislation applies.  That is a matter of considerable public concern.  We must recognise that a licence to drive is not a licence to kill or be killed.  It is time we did something about fatalities on our roads.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Members, I welcome this Bill.  However, it is unfortunate that Bills are being rushed through the House at the end of the session.  I am glad this Bill is being referred to a select committee because it is deserving of minute scrutiny and, perhaps, the Minister will take some amendments on board.  It will be an ideal opportunity to show the advantages of the Committee system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the purpose behind the Bill? The Minister, and Deputy Doyle, alluded to this.  Our objective must be to reduce fatalities and injuries.  We are all aware of people who have suffered as a result of road accidents.  I know of a tragic case involving friends of mine where one of twin sisters was killed in a simple road accident which arose as a result of drunk <Col N="788" /> driving.  It is a problem of which I am acutely aware.  We must take the most stringent action against drink driving in particular.</P>
    <P>It is not only the fatalities that cause concern but also the horrendous injuries that can result from road accidents.  One visit to the National Medical Rehabilitation Centre, Rochestown Avenue, County Dublin, which is adjacent to my home, would convince anyone of the appalling chances people take.  On drink driving, young people in particular will take unnecessary risks believing they are immortal.  The result is tragedy for the families of these young people and many others.  The pain and suffering caused by such accidents is incalculable.  In addition to the appalling human cost, there is another consideration, the cost in monetary terms.  Young people find it virtually impossible to obtain car insurance due to the number of accident claims. There is an undoubted connection between the two.  Despite our environmental consciousness we are becoming more dependent on the car as a mode of transport.</P>
    <P>According to the National Safety Council, 415 people died as a result of road accidents in 1992 and of that figure 115 were pedestrians and 169 were car users.  It is not realised that although car drivers may be largely responsible for accidents the number of pedestrians killed as a result of road accidents is enormous, approximately 28 per cent of the total.  That is a huge percentage.</P>
    <P>Three decisions are credited with reducing road fatalities.  They were the obligatory wearing of seat belts, the lowering of speed limits and the traffic calming measures, particularly in built-up areas.  The Bill provides for tougher drink driving laws.  If we do not ensure enforcement of these laws we might as well forget about them altogether.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to seat belts though they are not referred to in this Bill.  There is widespread recognition of the importance of seat belts.  If a person who is involved in an accident makes a personal injuries claim, the first question the insurance company concerned asks is <Col N="789" /> whether the claimant was wearing a seat belt at the time of the accident.  I am concerned about the position in regard to the obligatory wearing of rear seat belts, particularly in the case of children, and should like some information about enforcement of the regulation in this regard.  One thing that greatly upsets me is to see a child in its mother's arms in the front seat of a car.  Any time I have approached someone in such circumstances to point out the risk to which they were exposing their child, their reaction, on realising the danger involved, was one of shock.  In safety campaigns and so on it should be emphasised that very young children must be placed in child seats in a car while older children must travel in the back seat, and use the seat belts.  I try to ensure that my children wear seat belts all the time and they have now got over moaning about it.  In regard to road safety parents should not give in to children who are not keen on complying with the regulations.  I support the lowering of permitted alcohol levels for drivers.  We should lead the way in Europe on this matter.  Safety campaigns should specify the amount of alcohol a person is allowed to have consumed before driving.  A number of people asked me about this last night and I told them that, after the implementation of this legislation, a pint would probably be enough to put them over the limit.  The message must go out that one should not drink and drive.</P>
    <P>Thankfully, for the last number of Christmases there has been a reduction in the number of road fatalities.  This is due not to the imposition of limits but to the implementation of the law by the Garda who, as everyone now knows, are particularly on the alert at Christmas time.  Christmas is a time of festivities and people travelling from parties etc., know that a garda may be around the corner waiting to breathalyse suspected offenders.  That ought to act as a major deterrent to driving after consuming alcohol. If people know that measures, be they tough or otherwises, are implemented they will adhere to the law. The critical element must be enforcement <Col N="790" /> or the threat of enforcement and the Garda must have the resources necessary to enforce the law.</P>
    <P>The exploitation by clever lawyers of loopholes in the law as a way of ensuring their clients evade justice, brings the law into disrepute.  The introduction of evidential breath-testing is sensible, as is the strengthening of the powers of the Garda to enter a hospital to take specimens from drivers suspected of being involved in traffic accidents.  Yesterday, I spoke to a person about an accident in which an intoxicated driver in a big car rammed a van in which six or seven children were travelling.  Fortunately, there were no fatalities.  However the car driver fled the scene leaving a number of children in great distress and needing hospitalisation. Subsequently that driver, as a result of the exploitation on his behalf of a loophole in the law, got away scot-free. Such loopholes must be closed.  Powers of entry to premises should be available to the Garda to apprehend someone who would behave as that driver behaved.</P>
    <P>We hear about people locking themselves in their cars to avoid the Garda. All these matters are dealt with in the Bill and I have no hesitation in supporting them.  If people think they will get off on technicalities they are more likely to abuse the law.  Unfortunately, that happens in too many cases.  Initially I had misgivings about empowering the Garda to gain entry in order to make arrests.  I accept that safeguards must exist in regard to personal liberty, but each case must be taken as it arises.  Where there is just cause for entering a premises for the purpose of making an arrest the Garda must be given the necessary powers to do so.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill refers to the carrying of a driving licence at all times.  I was surprised that a number of people reacted against this idea.  Ireland is one of the few countries in the world where people do not have to carry a driving licence.  In other countries this document is often used as a means of identification.  I suggest that we introduce a more user friendly licence.  While the present licence is more acceptable than the old <Col N="791" /> red covered document which was quite bulky, if it was designed along the lines of a credit card, it would be convenient to have with one always when driving.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with the question of the mandatory disqualification period of one year for a first offence and the necessity to pass a driving test thereafter.  The latter measure will strike fear into the hearts of many older people who may never have had to sit a driving test.  This is a matter that may have to be considered, perhaps along the lines suggested by Deputy Doyle but some penalty should be introduced in this area, depending on the seriousness of the offence.  On the question of the mandatory disqualification period for a first offence, in many areas in the US a type of community order is served under which if a person needs a car for work he can use it for that purpose during the day and the car is then impounded outside those times.  That is a penalty we should consider for less serious offences where discretion could be allowed.</P>
    <P>In talking about our motorways, Deputy Doyle referred to the MPH signs as opposed to kilometre speed limit signs. People are confused by the fact that our speed limit signs are miles per hour whereas our directional signs are in kilometres. That should be tidied up.</P>
    <P>Local authority members, especially Dublin members, will be pleased with section 33 which devolves responsibility on local authorities for speed limits.  That power, linked with provisions in Part VI of the Bill, will enable local authorities to grapple with the constant headaches caused by parking, traffic regulation and traffic calming measures.  Speed regulation and traffic calming measures have an impact on road fatalities, especially in urban areas.  The dangers to children in built-up areas is evident.  I have had many complaints about people speeding through housing estates but the authorities say that according to the criteria people are not speeding and that there is no need for traffic calming measures which the people in the community and local councillors seek.  In many cases it <Col N="792" /> takes a fatal accident to prove a point. Now we will be able to respond properly to the needs of local communities.  One of the principle bones of contention in Blackrock, Dún Laoghaire and in other areas of the constituency relates to traffic management.  If the local authority has greater autonomy in dealing with these matters, we can alleviate the problem somewhat.  I welcome that.</P>
    <P>With the local authorities gaining control of traffic management we will come back to the question of funding.  Whatever about a once-off grant towards these measures, local authorities will later use lack of funding as an excuse not to provide traffic signs and traffic calming measures.  We must look at providing resources in tandem with the implementation of this Bill.  Perhaps we could divert some Structural Funds towards roads.  I am sure there are ways and means to provide funding to make the implementation of the Bill easier.</P>
    <P>The local authority should put much more emphasis on road safety.  It would be a good idea to have a locally based road safety officer or a small safety council.  Even though there are nationwide road safety campaigns, there are often local problems, particularly in tourist areas where people might be unfamiliar with the area, where a local organisation could better deal with the problems.  There is a case to be made for funding for that project.</P>
    <P>With regard to road safety in general, it is obligatory in many countries to have a rear window brake warning light.  Studies indicate that this is very sucessful in reducing tail-end accidents.  There is an anomaly here in that such brake lights have to be disconnected when the cars are imported.  The Minister might be familiar with the adage in the retail trade that &ldquo;eye level is buy level&rdquo;.  The Minister could use that analogy in terms of driving. This is a small safety feature which costs nothing.  In fact, it costs money to have the lights disconnected.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage, I will table a number of amendments but not on the limit on alcohol.  The Minister has shown <Col N="793" /> vehemence in relation to his opposition to drink driving.  We must focus on implementing the law in this area when this Bill is enacted.  We can have all the aspirations in the world but it will not do any good unless we implement the laws. There must be communication between the Departments of the Environment and Justice in order to ensure that the Garda get the resources to implement the drink driving laws.  I heard a story last Christmas to the effect that the Garda had run out of breathalyser kits and were relying more on the threat than on the implementation of the law.  That is a small illustration of how under-resourced the Garda can be in what is a very important area.  I hope a measure of the success of the implementation of the provisions of this Bill will be that, when we calculate the number of fatalities and injuries on our roads, it will be considerably fewer than 400 annually.  One fatality is too many.  I hope that the provisions of this Bill will help to highlight the dangers of drinking and driving and persuade people to be more responsible.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the debate on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputies Doyle and Keogh, I will support this Bill but I am disappointed with its narrow provisions. I had very high hopes that this Bill, which we had been promised for some time past, would address the many serious problems with regard to road accident, deaths and injuries.</P>
      <P>The explanatory and financial memorandum &mdash; repeated by the Minister in his introductory remarks &mdash; sets out four objectives, first, to restate and strengthen the law relating to drink driving; to introduce new measures to secure better enforcement of the Road Traffic Acts; to introduce new arrangements for making traffic regulations and to devolve certain functions to local authorities.  While the provisions of this Bill probably restate and strengthen the law relating to drink driving I am not sure they achieve effectively the other three objectives set out &mdash; they may in a fairly limited way &mdash; but do not go far enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="794" /> The press release by the Minister's office, in announcing the publication of this Bill, declared it was addressing the problem of drink driving.  The first sentence said that this Bill would take drink out of driving.  I believe it will certainly do that but it is important, and Deputy Keogh referred to this, that the public understand very clearly what is being done here.  It is also important that the rationale behind it is understood.</P>
    <P>In this Bill there is a range of measures which will &mdash; rightly &mdash; render it more difficult for people charged with a drink driving offence to get away with it, either by locking themselves in their car, driving into their driveway or, through the use of a clever lawyer, finding some technicality under which they can get off.  I welcome those very good provisions.</P>
    <P>The Bill also contains a reduction in the drink driving limit.  I often asked in this House like other Members, for the drink driving limit here to be brought into line with the European norm.  In the course of this debate it will be important to tease out what exactly is involved. Effectively &mdash; and the public will need to understand this very clearly &mdash; it will no longer be possible for somebody to take a drink and drive; that is the bottom line. The conventional wisdom was that the existing limit for drink driving allowed one, depending on one's capacity, to take perhaps up to three drinks and still drive home.  Let us take the example of a farmer after his day's work, the existing limit enabled him to drive two miles to the pub, have his couple of drinks and drive home.  That will not be possible under the provisions of this Bill.  Depending on one's capacity, the limit of 80 milligrammes falls somewhere between a pint or a pint and a half of beer.  For all practical purposes, the reduction of the limit to 80 milligrammes means that one does not drink if one is driving.  That needs to be spelled out in very clear terms to the public.  There is no point in being sanctimonious about this, we have had a drink culture here, indeed there is hardly a Member of this House who has not at some stage, been over the limit as they drove home.  There is hardly a <Col N="795" /> person who has not been over the limit if he or she takes a drink and drives.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed the Minister did not spell out the rationale behind the reduction in the limit.  He said that in the analysis undertaken by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety, half the samples tested were over twice the permitted limit.  Clearly there is a big problem if, under the existing limit, somebody when tested has 240 milligrammes, which means one is talking about a person who may have drunk six, eight or more pints, and is driving.  The Minister did not outline the proportion of those tested who fell into the category between the new and old limits and did not explain why, or to what extent, reducing the limit to 80 milligrammes will reduce traffic accidents. How big is the problem in that area?  I support the reduction in the limit but, if the public are being asked to totally abandon drinking if they are driving which is effectively what they are being asked here then the rationale behind it will have to be explained.  Why is the focus of this Bill on people who drink between one and three pints?  That has not been explained to date.  I am glad the Minister is indicating he will explain it. We need to know the extent of the problem in that area and if it is anticipated that, by reducing the limit, the incidence of road accidents will be reduced.</P>
    <P>We need to be clear that reducing the drink driving limit alone will not eliminate, or perhaps reduce to the degree we would like, the problems of road accidents and deaths.  A broad range of other measures is needed.</P>
    <P>I have spoken here before on the question of road safety.  For example, I recall doing so in the course of the debate on the 1992 Local Government (Planning and Development) Act.  Indeed I recall tabling a number of amendments to the Roads Bill last year addressing the issue of road safety.  The Minister, in response to amendments tabled on Committee Stage, indicated he intended to address those areas in the Road Traffic Bill now before us.  Quite clearly there is a major problem in the area of road safety.  As <Col N="796" /> already pointed out, the number of deaths on our roads is over 400 annually and the number of injuries runs close to 10,000.  That is far more, for example than the casualties in Northern Ireland; it is the equivalent of a Stardust disaster every month.  Indeed if one wanted to put that in the context of other tragedies in this country, for every death due to fire, there are nine on our roads.  Its cost and pain in terms of human suffering is immeasurable.  However, the cost of road accidents to our economy has been measured.  Indeed the environmental research unit in the Minister's Department has put the cost of road accidents here somewhere in the region of £600 million annually.  As we have not taken the issue of road safety seriously, there is a need for a radical reappraisal.  While one aspect of the problem is being addressed in the Bill in a dramatic way, it fails to carry out the radical reappraisal required if we are to reduce the number of deaths and injuries on our roads.</P>
    <P>The problem must be tackled on a number of levels.  Those involved in road safety talk about the three E's &mdash; enforcement, engineering and education.  On the question of enforcement, it is not enough to have road safety legislation, it has to be enforced.  It is immaterial whether the drink driving limit is 80 milligrammes or 120 milligrammes if the driver is not stopped and checked.  It is also immaterial what the speed limits are if they are not enforced.  It is a fact that the speed limits here are a joke; they are not enforced or taken seriously.  On a long stretch of main road there is the occasional speed trap, but few speed checks are carried out in urban areas where many pedestrians are killed.</P>
    <P>Little is being done to address the problem of dangerous driving which may not be related to drink driving.  I suggest that the young super stud who is trying to impress his girlfriend and who may have no drink taken is probably a greater danger on the road than the farmer ambling home at a leisurely pace having had two or three pints late in the evening. Irrespective of the cause, the problem of dangerous driving has to be addressed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="797" /> As we are aware, the Garda Síochána have their hands full at present in dealing with serious crime.  When I make inquiries about traffic problems it becomes very clear that the over-stretched Garda force do not have the time or the resources to enforce our traffic laws.  What we need &mdash; and I am disappointed no proposals have been made in this regard &mdash; is a special traffic police force which would operate under the control of the local authority, as is the case in other countries. It would be its responsibility to deal with traffic offences such as illegal parking, dangerous or drink driving, the condition of vehicles, speed limits and so on.  This option should be considered if we are serious about addressing the issue of road safety.</P>
    <P>We need to adopt a different approach in relation to the way in which traffic offences are prosecuted.  Reference has been made to the need to get the Judiciary to take traffic offences more seriously.  Many courts seem to regard traffic offences as routine and a great deal of thought it not given to the penalties that should be imposed unless a serious injury or a death is involved.</P>
    <P>We should consider the possibility of introducing on the spot fines in respect of minor traffic offences and a points system, as is the case in other countries, whereby one would be given penalty points for dangerous driving and traffic offences such as illegal parking, the nondisplay of a tax disc and so on.  Some years ago an organisation representing driving instructors made proposals to the Minister's predecessor.  They suggested that we should consider introducing such a system for driving offences whereby, on a graded scale, one would be given two points for a minor offence and so on. They also suggested that once a person had accumulated a certain number of points over a period of time &mdash; I think they suggested 12 &mdash; they should have their licence endorsed or suspended.  This system is being operated successfully in other countries and we should consider introducing it here.</P>
    <P>We are not talking here about somebody who is found to be over the limit <Col N="798" /> just once; somebody who drinks two pints may be a very careful driver in normal circumstances but under this law he could lose his licence for 12 months and have to do his driving test all over again.  On the other hand, a persistent offender, when it comes to minor offences such as having no tax disc, bald tyres etc., who is a danger on the roads, can get away with it consistently.  We should have a points system to ensure that persistent offenders can lose their licence.</P>
    <P>Apart from the question of drink driving &mdash; I agree with what has been proposed in the Bill in this regard &mdash; we need to address the question of dangerous driving and road courtesy.  We all have our stories to tell about road hogs who are a menace on the road.  The person who refuses to pull in to allow someone to overtake them can cause accidents, too.  In this regard I have received many complaints, particularly from women, that some drivers use this as a form of intimidation.  Women have complained that when they are being overtaken on the road various non-verbal signs are sometimes given to intimidate and harass them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Harassment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore the issue of road courtesy needs to be addressed.</P>
      <P>On the question of education, we need to review the driving test.  At present we have driving instruction which is aimed more at passing a test rather than good driving behaviour.  Driving instruction should be aimed at good road behaviour rather than simply passing a once off test following which one is given a driving licence for life.  The Minister can correct me if I am wrong, but as far as I am aware only three local authorities employ fulltime road safety officers.  Given the number of deaths in road accidents as opposed to fires, it is clear that sufficient priority is not being given to road safety education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of engineering, we need to consider the condition of our roads.  In recent years there has been a <Col N="799" /> shift in emphasis in road policy, largely driven by the availability of European funds, towards the construction of new roads.  There has been a corresponding reduction in the moneys available for the maintenance of the existing road network. Every Members of this House and of a local authority knows of the roads in their own area which are substandard, full of potholes and in a bad condition. Indeed, they can be considered to be dangerous for road users; in addition to bad junctions and blind bends, bad roads are a contributory factor in road accidents.</P>
    <P>Pedestrians account for almost one-third of the number of fatalities on our roads.  Last Sunday <i>The Observer</i> published an OECD table which showed that Ireland has one of the highest levels of pedestrian road deaths.  We do not give enough priority to the safety of pedestrians. Very often roads are designed without footpaths.  A section of the N11 between Cornelscourt and Cabinteely in my constituency was designed and built without a footpath.  New roads are being designed and built without footpaths and cycle lanes which would provide safety for pedestrians and cyclists.</P>
    <P>Before the Department of the Environment will fund a pedestrian crossing a pedestrian count has to be carried out and the number of pedestrians has to reach a certain level.  The present levels, which were originally set by An Foras Forbartha, are unrealistically high and need to be reviewed.  More priority needs to be given to these crossings, which enable pedestrians to cross roads in safety.  Similarly, the roads in housing estates are designed to accommodate two cars passing each other.  Very little attention is paid to the safety of pedestrians or children when designing roads in housing estates.</P>
    <P>As a result of the reductions in the rate support grants for local authorities, the public lighting in many areas is inadequate and has not been brought up to standard.  In some cases lights are turned off during the summer.</P>
    <P>There was the absurd situation last <Col N="800" /> year when Dublin local authorities turned off public lighting on the main roads in and out of the city for a few months during the summer because they did not have the resources to maintain the system.  We are dealing with legislation which will tackle the issue of road safety, and one of the basic requirements of road safety is that roads are properly lit and well maintained at night, which is when the bulk of accidents occur, so that motorists, pedestrians and cyclists can travel in safety.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keogh referred to the need to address the traffic problems in urban areas.  I very much identify with this need. One of the issues most frequently raised with me as a public representative is traffic and traffic problems.  When I first looked at the Bill it seemed that powers would be devolved on local authorities to address issues such as traffic management, traffic movement and traffic speeds in their areas.  However, on closer examination, I am not sure that the Bill will resolve these problems.  Perhaps we can deal with this issue in greater detail on Committee Stage.  There are a number of problems which need to be addressed, for example, the ambiguity which exists between the local authority as the roads authority and the Garda as the traffic authority.  While the Bill goes some way towards removing that ambiguity, there is still scope for further improvements. Consideration should be given to the establishment of a body to police traffic under the aegis of the local authority, thus making the local authority both the roads authority and traffic authority for its area.  That would eliminate the very bureaucratic procedures which exist at present for dealing with even the simplest aspects of traffic management.</P>
    <P>As I understand it &mdash; perhaps I am misreading the Bill &mdash; local authorities will be given the power to set speed limits for particular areas within their jurisdiction. However, they will be limited in doing this to the speed limits as already defined &mdash; in other words, the 30 miles per hour speed limit in built-up areas and the special speed limits of 40 and 50 miles per hour.  I should like to know if it will <Col N="801" /> be possible under this Bill for a local authority to introduce a speed limit of less than 30 miles per hour.  The main problem in many areas, including areas in my constituency, relates to traffic which tries to take a short cut through residential areas at peak times.  The local people in those areas have two problems. First, there is too much traffic and they want to put a stop to it.  They are constantly demanding the provision of ramps and other measures which will discourage traffic from using these roads as short cuts.  Second, there is the problem of speed.  If local authorities had the power to set low speed limits of five, ten and 15 miles per hour for certain residential areas and had the power to enforce those limits &mdash; there is no point in having a speed limit if it is not enforced &mdash; that would eliminate many of the problems.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the powers of local authorities to provide ramps, bollards, etc.  Even though local authorities have this power at present, they do not have the necessary resources to provide them.  My local authority has 100 requests for the provision of ramps on various roads in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown area.  However, it only has money to provide ramps on one road per year; it does this with a certain amount of imaginative use of the block grants available to it. The Minister may say that the money can be taken from somewhere else, but it is the same story when it comes to the provision of traffic signs.  Local authorities have limited resources for the provision of traffic signs.  If a residents association wants a &ldquo;Children at Play&rdquo; sign put up in its area it will be told that there is a waiting list for such signs. However, if a residents association offers to put up the money for the sign it will be provided.  There is this two speed system for the provision of traffic signs.</P>
    <P>The devolution of powers to local authority will be useless unless the local authorities have the resources to exercise those powers.  If the Minister increased the road grants to local authorities in order to give effect to the measures provided for in this legislation it would be money well spent.  When one considers <Col N="802" /> that the cost of road accidents is approximately £600 million per year, a small amount of money spent on traffic management and traffic abatement would be money well spent.  We need to look at the issue in this way.</P>
    <P>The Minister's Department has been very good at standardising procedures in many areas.  However, one area which still requires attention is parking control. Local authorities have introduced various kinds of parking controls, for example, parking discs, ticket systems, etc.  There is a need to standardise the system of parking control.  It is absolutely absurd that if you visit Cork you have to buy a red parking disc, if you visit Limerick you have to buy a green parking disc and if you visit Galway you have to buy a maroon parking disc.  The colour of the parking disc is the same as the county colours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difference even within counties.  The parking disc in Enniscorthy is different from the parking disc in Wexford town.</P>

As I understand it, it will be possible for the Garda to seize a car in certain circumstances when this Bill is enacted.  This is aimed at joyriders and I welcome that.  However, I believe that the power is confined to cases where the Garda believes the driver is too young to have a driving licence.  It is important that this provision is enforcible because joyriders present a huge problem. I recently came across a case where joyriders were driving a car for several days but all the Garda could do was to ask the occupants politely to produce their driving licence and insurance within ten <Col N="803" /> days.  It was not until they managed to knock over a Garda motorcycle that the car was taken from them.  Quite clearly that makes a joke of the law and I hope the Bill will address that case.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to commend this far reaching and incisive Bill to the House. We have not always been pro-active in the area of road traffic legislation and for this reason I congratulate the Minister for introducing what he describes as &ldquo;the most significant changes in road traffic law to be introduced in Ireland in the past 25 years.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I will take this opportunity to read into the record the horrific statistics on road traffic accidents.  Over the past ten years there have been over 4,000 deaths on the road, of which one-third occurred between the hours of 9 p.m. and 3 a.m. in the morning.  On average there are 400 deaths on the road each year.  A staggering 100,000 people were injured in road accidents over the same period. The facts speak for themselves: the need for this legislation is self-evident.  Drunk driving is a very serious crime.  Accidents as a result of drunk driving shatters lives and leaves a legacy of heartbreak for the bereaved.  I am sure every Member has attended the funeral of someone who was the innocent victim of drunk driving.  The lives of family members have been shattered because someone was not careful and drove under the influence of drink.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting that one rarely reads about a person convicted of drunk driving repeating the offence.  The reason is that the individual concerned learned his lesson, but unfortunately it was too late for the victim who died.  I believe that if people became more aware of the hazards of excessive drinking the number of accidents on our roads could be significantly reduced.  Over the years Ministers <Col N="804" /> have taken the opportunity coming up to long weekends, holiday periods and occasions of celebration to appeal strongly to people to refrain from drinking. While this has worked to some extent, it appears to be forgotten very soon after the campaign.  We have to examine how we can put the message across more widely.</P>
    <P>When one considers the statistics I have just referred to one must surely admit that something is very seriously wrong.  I was delighted to see the stringent measures in this Bill.  It is time to address the daily number of drink related traffic accidents which result in death or serious injury.  This Bill introduces a number of new measures relating to drink driving offences which can only be warmly welcomed.  This includes the reduction of blood alcohol levels from 100 milligrams to 80 milligrams.  Some people believe that if you drive you do not drink and it would make it much easier for the Garda to enforce the law if blood alcohol levels were reduced to nil. People would then get the message that if you drink do not drive and if you drive do not drink.  However, the community are divided on this.</P>
    <P>A person convicted of a drink driving offence will have to pay the costs incurred in the detection and prosecution of the offence.  Furthermore, persons convicted of drinking offences or dangerous driving will, in addition to being disqualified from driving, have to re-sit a driving test before the licence is returned.  This is only right and proper as the drunk driver through his or her behaviour forfeits the right to drive.  They should be forced to indicate that they have become responsible drivers by sitting a new test.  People may feel this is a severe penalty, but if we can reduce the number of deaths and save lives the Minister need not apologise to anybody.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister re-examine the current system of driving tests?  I am convinced that many drivers on the road today do not understand the rules of the road and Members have given examples of drivers who believe that once they are behind the wheel nobody else exists but <Col N="805" /> themselves.  One only has to be behind someone to see this.  They pull out and overtake without indicating.  I believe if people were more aware of the simple rules of behaviour we could significantly reduce the number of accidents on our roads.  There is no easy answer to this problem, but if we could get this message across we would be doing a good day's work.  Very often people complain that they failed their driving test for a very simple reason, either they touched the kerb or made some minor mistake and they become very incensed.  I think those taking the test would benefit from being more aware of the rules of the road.</P>
    <P>Section 36 refers to the revenue raised from parking.  Will the Minister consider giving the local authorities discretionary powers to spend the moneys collected by them from on street and off street parking?  In my constituency Cork Corporation had a major difficulty in finding the moneys to run the city.  Money was available from one area which would have offset the difficulties that confronted the councillors in bringing in an estimate, but unfortunately because of the restrictions the councillors were not in a position to use for essential services the money raised from parking and cut-backs had to take place.  I believe there would be no difficulties if the Minister were to amend the regulations and give greater discretion to the manager, because as I understand it this money has to be used at present for building car parks or providing other parking facilities. Roads in other areas of the city would benefit if there was discretion to use this money and perhaps the Minister would examine that issue.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are being given a greater level of power and freedom.  The Programme for a Partnership Government provides that under new legislation local authorities will have greater autonomy and responsibility for a wide variety of functions, such as traffic control, land acquisition and disposal and by-laws.  It is important to state that prior to the Programme for a Partnership Government the Minister had already gone down the road of giving greater powers at local <Col N="806" /> level.  An example of this is that decisions on small housing schemes can be taken at local level.  The process of local autonomy has been going on for some time but it may not always have been recognised or highlighted.</P>
    <P>The new powers introduced in section 37 will give local authorities the power to control their own traffic management and introduce their own parking controls. They will also set the speed limits for roads in their own areas.  It has long been promised that local authorities would have greater scope for local initiative in decision making.  We have heard for too long that statutory controls requiring local authorities to obtain ministerial approval in carrying out various functions will be removed so as to widen the freedom of local authorities to act.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Minister and I am delighted that this Bill allows for substantial new powers to local authorities in the area of traffic control and will give those local authorities a more meaningful role.  There is nothing more frustrating for local councillors meeting deputations and residents' associations, particularly in urban areas, in relation to speeding through their estates and inconsiderate drivers not taking due care, than to have to await the sanction of the Garda Commissioner and the Department for the changes they have made.  It is recognised as a major step forward that decisions can be taken at local level.  Decisions do not always relate to the 60 miles per hour limit or the 30 miles per hour zone.  In my own area in the older part of the estate there are eight or nine roadways where there are no footpaths.  This is an area where the local authority will have discretion in relation to the control of speed limits.</P>

      <P>The other new powers contained in the Bill which I should like to highlight include the fact that each driver will have to carry a valid driving <Col N="807" /> licence at all times.  Some people may be concerned about this regulation, but it is a valid measure and one that is not uncommon in other countries.  This will make it easier for the Garda to ascertain whether a driver has a current driving licence.  The Garda will also have the power to impound untaxed vehicles which may be driven without insurance cover and any vehicle being driven by an under-age driver.  This is a major step forward so far as the Garda is concerned.</P>
      <P>This Bill is all about encouraging responsible behaviour.  The motorcar is an integral part of modern living and is an invaluable form of transport. However, in the wrong hands a car can turn into a deadly weapon, no less lethal than a gun or a knife.  Car ownership carries with it therefore a burden of responsibility.  This Bill is designed to develop a sense of care and responsibility. For that reason I welcome it and I am happy to commend it to the House.</P>

      <P>The statistics given to us this morning by the Minister are staggering and frightening.  One would have thought that the revelation of these facts alone would instill sufficient awareness in <Col N="808" /> the public psyche to avert such carnage in the future.  Many of my colleagues, including the Minister, felt they should use that horrific word &ldquo;carnage&rdquo; as that is precisely what we are faced with in this context.  Unfortunately, that awareness is not there.  We must aspire in this and other legislation to create an air of extreme urgency with regard to the whole area of road safety.  It is obvious that this is the Minister's intention.  Already there is a growing awareness regarding drink driving.  The vast majority of Irish drinkers today are very responsible.  I have noticed nowadays that people tend to make special arrangements when they set out on a social evening.</P>
      <P>We must remember that a drink and the pub is an integral part of the Irish scene and will continue to be so.  As legislators, we must not try to abolish or interfere with that long standing tradition but to create a responsible attitude so that people can get home safely.  In the case of a couple, I perceive a growing trend whereby one partner enjoys a drink while the other abstains.  Neighbours and people living adjacent to each other in remote areas also engage in this responsible sharing arrangement.  Frequently taxis and mini-buses are involved.  This shows that the graph of a responsible approach to drink driving is definitely going in the right direction.</P>
      <P>The vast majority of publicans also are ultra-responsible in this regard.  I know of publicans who regularly take responsible action in the interests of their customers and, indeed, in their own interests.  From a purely practical or even a selfish viewpoint, what publican wants to have an accident or a series of accidents related to drink driving adjacent to his premises, his clients, his friends or family?  That responsible attitude I am endeavouring to portray exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier, Deputy Gilmore referred to the young macho driver trying to prove a point with or without alcohol.  I agree with Deputy Gilmore that the potential hazard in such a case is much more serious than the rural dweller who makes his way home at night having availed of the single social outlet available to him <Col N="809" />&mdash; a drink and a chat in his local country pub.  Most young people and legitimate young drivers are becoming increasingly responsible in their approach and are making arrangements to allow them socialise and still be responsible on the roads.  We do have the rogue publican who is prepared to serve and supply drink to our young people, sometimes at a cheap price on a take-away basis.  Drink is still too accessible to our young people. The issue of the availability of drink at cheap prices from outlets over which there should be greater control must be tackled and dealt with on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>I welcome the new powers the Minister is giving to the Garda.  They will lessen the frustration felt by gardaí in endeavouring to carry out their duties in a proper manner.  It is ludicrous that at present they can track down a wrongdoer to a private premises and be deemed to be trespassing if they enter that premises to carry out their duties.  I am glad the Minister is dealing with that matter in the legislation.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the new provisions which will deal with the dubious and untoward measures which have been instrumental in offenders getting off scot free in the past.  Heretofore, slick lawyers have not only found loopholes in the legislation, but have driven the proverbial coach and four through the provisions which were in place.</P>
    <P>I welcome wholeheartedly the measures the Minister has included in this legislation and, hopefully, the next time we debate this matter he will be able to supply us with much improved statistics instead of the horrific figures he presented to us this morning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister decided to include much more than drink driving matters in his legislation. In particular, I welcome the new and increased powers local authorities will have as a result of this legislation. However, in spite of the fact that the Minister made every effort to devolve minor functions to local government, I regret that fundamental reform of the <Col N="810" /> local government system appears to be still a long way down the road.  In spite of successive Governments making all sorts of promises and indications about the need to reform local government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the Minister could still walk into the policy statement trap his predecessors walked into if he generates too many expectations about the pace and speed of this reforming process. I agree that some of the powers for which he has assumed responsibility as Minister should have been part and parcel of the powers of local authorities many years ago.  The fact that the Minister had to seek permission from so many people to sanction speed limits to introduce by-laws and to create new taxi ranks in major urban areas, makes a mockery of our local government system.  I hope the devolvement of functions to local authorities will be speeded up and that we will see further evidence of the Minister's commitment in that regard before the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Many of the improvements to our roadways over the past ten or 15 years have enabled traffic to travel at greater speed.  The £8.6 billion to which the Taoiseach referred this morning will provide a unique opportunity for us during the next seven years to make further improvements on our road network and will generate even greater speed in regard to traffic in the future.  The Taoiseach has gone on record on many occasions since the Edinburgh Summit stating that he had the £8 billion in the bag plus the 10 per cent devaluation, making a total of £8.8 billion.</P>

Such decisions are made in the secrecy of a room in Government Buildings without informing the Houses of the Oireachtas or the general public about how this, or any other, Minister, intends to spend those moneys in the next seven years.  The greatest single opportunity for people to participate at local level and to give a clear indication of where they would like this money to be spent in the next seven years has been lost on the Minister.  In spite of his glowing statements recently about the need for greater local input and participation by local government, he has failed miserably to give local government and local communities an ideal opportunity to participate in local planning and in the implementation of local economic and development plans, including road plans.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the role of local government and the input it can make to the National Development Plan, it is essential that we do not spend all our money on road traffic management and safety on national primary and secondary routes.  People also live along county and regional roads.  In the past few years, the mandarins in the Department of Finance and, to a lesser extent, those in the Department of the Environment, have sought to exercise their discretion and priority on spending money on roads used mainly by traffic en route to ports and airports.</P>
      <P>In the next round of Structural Funds, a proportion of money must be earmarked for the improvement of county and regional roads.  People living along those routes create their own sense of community, implement their own economic development plans and meet their own standards of living.  Tourists, in particular, cannot gain access to such routes because of inadequate funding during the past ten or 15 years.  It is not surprising that many accidents occur on our county routes.  Due to lack of finance, local government has given inadequate attention to the improvement of those roads, even in respect of surfacing.  More funding should be allocated to make those routes safer by way of hedge cutting and hedge cutting notices should be served on land and property owners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is regrettable that the Minister did not take an opportunity in this legislation to amend existing legislation in regard to hedge notices and fines for people's failure to carry out their responsibilities in this regard.  The Minister should have given himself power to increase fines so that land and property owners would take their responsibilities seriously and road users, particularly those using country <Col N="813" /> and regional routes, would feel safer.  I have received many complaints in the last couple of years about the inadequate amount of money the councils have to spend on this type of work.  At the end of the day it is the responsibility of the adjacent landowners to put into train the work necessary to make those routes safe.</P>
    <P>A major deficiency, referred to by Deputy Gilmore, has been the lack of attention to facilities for pedestrians traversing those roads.  The Minister is well aware of the problem on the Waterford-New Ross route at Glenmore where a parish has been practically divided. People have great difficulty in traversing that route now because of the speed of traffic resulting from the major improvement works carried out with the help of EC regional funding.  Greater attention should be given by the Department of the Environment to making those routes safer with the provision of overhead pedestrian bridges to allow people to cross safely.  Animals need to be able to cross too because, if animals break out they can cause serious problems for road users.</P>
    <P>Another problem relates to expenditure on an inner relief road in Kilkenny city which has received substantial funds in the last few years and will be receiving more in the next couple of years.  No account has been taken of the fact that the route goes through a housing estate and that there is no pedestrian crossing which would enable old people in particular to cross that route which they have crossed all their lives to go to church, to shop or to avail of various services.  These facilities should be incorporated as part of any plan.</P>
    <P>In regard to drink driving generally, the legal blood alcohol limit has been reduced substantially in the last few years, but there has not been a substantial reduction in the numbers killed on our roads.  The Department gives the impression that reducing the alcohol limit will automatically bring about a corresponding reduction in fatalities on our roads.  I do not share that view.  The reduction in the alcohol limit has not <Col N="814" /> resulted in the improvements the Minister for the Environment expected.  We are further reducing the legal alcohol limit but I do not think this will add significantly to a reduction in fatalities on our roads.  There should be different punishments for different offences under this legislation.  I do not see how anybody could indulge in any sort of social drinking in view of the penalties proposed in this legislation.  I know that people must be responsible and that those with large intakes of drink must be kept off our roads because of the danger to the public. However, it is difficult for me, as a legislator, to support a situation where a person who has had two pints is hammered by the same penalty as a person who has had 32 pints.  A distinction should be drawn.  The Minister should give guidelines on the treatment of such cases.  I do not accept that a person who has taken two pints will be the cause of any fatality on our roads but I accept that people who have taken excessive amounts of alcohol would.  There are unfortunate innocent victims of legislation but I know the Minister will say that he cannot legislate for the minority, that he has to legislate for the majority. There needs to be a mechanism to permit leniency in the case of responsible people.</P>
    <P>I brought to the attention of the Minister recently the difficulties and inconsistencies in driver testing in the Kilkenny area.  I have received complaints about possible collusion between inspectors and those involved in the business of teaching people how to drive.  Even though the statistics from the Kilkenny centre will clearly indicate that they are in line with the national average, the Minister should investigate to see if there is collusion between inspectors and driving instructors and to examine the pass and failure rates in respect of individual driving instructors.  I ask the Minister to do a survey in relation to this matter so that I will not have to raise the matter again by way of parliamentary question. An allegation of that sort has been made to me in respect of the Kilkenny Driver Testing Centre and I would be greatful if <Col N="815" /> the Minister would check out the authenticity of that information.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Jacob that the sale of alcohol through supermarkets and other outlets is not controlled.  Too many young people are roaming our streets under the influence of alcohol, particularly at weekends, because of the ease with which they can get it.  They can cause much more serious damage to the environment and to society than people who are penalised for having just two pints of Guinness or Smithwicks in their system at a particular time.  We should focus on the parents' responsibility in this matter and ensure that they take full responsibility for the activities of their minors in relation to alcohol.  As the House is aware, at this time of the year when examination results are out large numbers of young people, 14 and 15 year olds, traverse our cities and towns with plenty of alcohol in their bloodstreams but nobody is taking responsibility for how they acquired it.  This matter should be urgently addressed.  Some towns have introduced a system of identity cards which has yielded practical results.  I understand that in Mullingar this practice is operated by publicans and is quite successful in clamping down on and reducing the number of irresponsible young people who have access to a large amount of alcohol.</P>
    <P>There was a reference to the problems associated with getting insurance, particularly for young people.  As an insurance intermediary, I have to declare a vested interest in this matter.  The former Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce, Deputy Brennan, said that if he reduced the commissions for intermediaries it would automatically result in a reduction in insurance premiums. He directed that the number of counsel in accident cases should be reduced and the resulting saving should be passed on to policy holders.</P>
    <P>In recent years regulations were introduced by the Department of Industry and Commerce to regulate the insurance industry without considering what was happening in the marketplace.  There has <Col N="816" /> been a 150 per cent increase in the cost of motor insurance premiums for young people and some of them will not be given cover.  Many young people cannot afford to pay the insurance premiums quoted and as a result there are a large number of uninsured vehicles on our roads.  I am pleased the Minister has provided in this Bill for the impounding of uninsured vehicles.  We must ensure that responsible people are not treated shabbily. Accidents caused by uninsured drivers cause great difficulties for a third party.  Harsh measures must be adopted to deal with uninsured drivers.  I hope the Minister will ensure that young people under 25 years will be able to insure their motor vehicles at a reasonable cost.  Cars are a necessity, not a luxury, and people need them to get to work.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about section 11 which grants extra powers to the Garda Síochána to arrest people without a warrant and to forcibly enter premises if necessary. The penalties the Minister proposes in this legislation are sufficient to deal with irresponsible people identified by the Garda Síochána without the inclusion of the extra powers in section 11.  I welcome the Bill, with that reservation.  I hope it will be possible to introduce different penalties for the various offences under this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on introducing additional measures in this comprehensive package.  The Bill deserves close examination as its provisions will have far-reaching consequences.  I am sure the Bill when enacted will set a pattern of safer driving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any measure that improves road safety is to be welcomed.  The figure of more than 400 deaths per year on our roads is often quoted and is indicative of a problem which must be addressed in legislation and capable of evolving.  The figure <Col N="817" /> of more than 400 deaths per year only hides a huge human tragedy of young widows, widowers and children left to grieve the loss of a parent, son or daughter who in the majority of cases are blameless.  Any measure to reduce that number is to be welcomed.  The Bill will also reduce the number of those injured as a result of road traffic accidents.  Many thousands of people are injured annually &mdash; many seriously and their enjoyment of life is considerably curtailed.  Many of those people are bedridden for months or years and in many instances they never recover from their injuries and are hospitalised for the rest of their lives.</P>
    <P>The effects of bad driving practices on our roads not only hide a huge human cost but also an economic and social problem of dimensions which is no longer tolerable.  Millions of pounds each year is expended on hospitalisation of road traffic victims.  A person's life can be changed overnight from one of gainful employment to the misery of subsistence living on the social welfare system.  The court lists continue to grow with personal injury claims, choking the court system and providing a handsome living for many solicitors, barristers and court experts.</P>
    <P>Up to now, our conscience as a Legislature was absolved in the knowledge that this human misery could be compensated in the majority of cases by a suitable level of court awards for the victims of car accidents.  In cases where the offending driver was not insured the Motor Insurers Bureau saw to it that the majority of road victims were handsomely compensated.</P>
    <P>Many thousands of uninsured drivers, mainly young people starting out in the world of employment use our national road network.  A car is now a necessity and is not longer a luxury.  Young people are being quoted prohibitive premiums &mdash; a young male driver was quoted a premium of approximately £1,600.  Often the premium is more costly than the value of the car.  Young people are compelled to flout the provisions of the Road Traffic Acts and take an uninsured car on the road or, alternatively, not take up offers of employment in the services sector and <Col N="818" /> elsewhere and as a result live in a culture of dependency at an age in life when they can contribute most to this economy.</P>
    <P>Recently a local radio station in Mayo, MWR, held a phone-in on the cost of car insurance.  The programme was on air for approximately one hour in the morning and it was inundated with telephone calls regarding car insurance.  Telephone calls were received from counties Mayo, Sligo and Donegal.  Those calls related to job offers which required people to have their own car.  The jobs ranged from photographers, salesmen to many other categories of work in the services sector. Those people were not able to take up those job offers and begin their working career because of the extremely high motor insurance quotations they received.</P>
    <P>I welcome the measures in the Bill. The widest possible publicity campaign should be undertaken to inform the public of the major changes being introduced. The public should also be informed by radio, television and newspaper advertisements of the consequence of a successful conviction.</P>
    <P>Fear of detection or apprehension is a powerful deterrent to persons who may think of driving while under the influence of alcohol.  Previous Garda campaigns, particularly at Christmas, have been successful but the resources devoted to the road safety campaigns by the Road Safety Federation and the Department of the Environment will have to be substantially increased.  According to a recent radio programme the insurance industry, which has expended approximately £2 million on road safety campaigns, should save a considerable amount following the implementation of the provisions of this Bill.  I am sure once this Bill is enacted it will have the effect of substantially reducing the number of road traffic accidents.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the mandatory disqualification from driving for a period of one year for dangerous driving simpliciter.  There are two categories of dangerous driving, dangerous driving simpliciter and dangerous driving causing actual bodily harm.  From my 14 years <Col N="819" /> experience as a solicitor I know the vast majority of drivers who commit driving offences are charged with the appropriate offences.  Many dangerous driving summonses are for minor incidents where an error of judgment or momentary lapse of attention results in vehicular damage only.  In most of those cases drink is not involved.  The majority of road traffic accident cases which come before the courts occur in the morning and no alcohol is involved.  Under this Bill if a judge does not accept a plea to the lesser charge of careless driving, drivers will face automatic disqualification for one year.</P>
    <P>I do not like tying the hands of our Judiciary in the sense of consequential or more correctly described mandatory orders which follow conviction.  I have the utmost confidence in our Judiciary to hand out appropriate sentences, particularly at District Court level, either comprising monetary penalties, community service orders or discretionary disqualification orders, depending on the circumstances of accidents arising from incidents not involving drink.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have left the position which prevailed previously, namely, mandatory disqualification for dangerous driving only for a second offence within three years and not for the first offence or, alternatively, increase the period of disqualification from six months to one year but leave the question of disqualification discretionary in the hands of our Judiciary depending on the circumstances of each case and not tie their hands to the extent contemplated under the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Gardaí operating in rural towns are faced with many pressures when trying to apply their responsibilities with an even hand and they are, of course, conscious of the consequences of bringing a person before the courts charged with a particular offence.  Gardaí will now increasingly bring charges for careless driving, rather than dangerous driving which prevailed heretofore, for vehicular damage cases only.  Alternatively, the Circuit Court appeal lists will now increase dramatically, further clogging up quarterly <Col N="820" /> sittings of the Circuit Court outside the Dublin area which will impact severely on the determination of civil and family cases.</P>
    <P>From my experience in the west the vast majority of court summonses are for dangerous driving.  A mandatory disqualification for a year is a serious penalty. These people will have no option but to go to the Circuit Court.  The first cases heard in the Circuit Court are criminal cases which means that civil and family law cases will be put back repeatedly.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in relation to driving without insurance, the Bill provides for mandatory disqualification for one year.  This will impact particularly on young people who are forced into evasion because of their inability to pay the cost of premiums or even to obtain a quotation.  The discretion of the District Court should not be removed for a first offence under this heading.  We are going too far and removing the equity and discretion which, in most instances, should be left to the Judiciary, depending on the facts of any particular case.  I know of young people particularly, but also others charged with driving without insurance, whose cases relate primarily to circumstances involving acts of charity carried out on behalf of a neighbour or friends, or emergencies which required a person to drive without insurance.  In such circumstances, when the full facts were accepted by a judge, a suitable monetary penalty or the Probation Act was applied.  This discretion is now being removed.  I would not feel so strongly about this if the other provisions of the Bill were introduced and if other proposals were implemented with the intention of substantially reducing insurance premiums.</P>
    <P>I put forward the following proposal for consideration by the Minister's Department, in conjunction with the insurance industry, to reduce costs of motor insurance primarily for young drivers. This proposal would entail insurance companies introducing a daytime insurance policy.  The main beneficiaries should be young people who are currently hindered by the excessively <Col N="821" /> high cost of motor insurance but this proposal will also be suitable for other people who only use their cars in daylight hours.  If introduced it would enable the majority of young people to drive to and from work without suffering the current high insurance cost.</P>
    <P>The typical cost of insurance for drivers between the ages of 18 and 25 is, as has been stated, £1,600 or more.  This is ridiculously high.  The majority of fatal and serious accidents occur at night and involve drivers between the ages of 18 and 23.  Insurance companies are constantly quoting these statistics in their defence of the cost of motor insurance for young people.  The practical enforcement of my proposal would involve only the requirement of additional information on car insurance discs.  The insurance industry is at present spending huge sums of money on advertising new insurance products, particularly financial and mortgage type products.  They should become more flexible to suit the needs of many young drivers who are forced to drive without car insurance.</P>
    <P>I would like to have the opportunity of carrying out a comparable study of insurance products available in other European countries as I am sure that such products are more flexible than those currently offered to Irish drivers.  If my proposal could be implemented, it would generate substantial additional income for the insurance industry.  Figures available indicate that the PMPA is the only insurance company who did not make an underwriting loss in 1991.  I understand it is the only company prepared to quote insurance premiums for young drivers. Guardian Royal Exchange, who were the leaders in this field, made substantial underwriting losses.</P>
    <P>My proposal for a daytime insurance policy is practical because if a son or daughter is added to an insurance policy, as a named driver, the insurance broker could state that the person is covered, say, from 8 o'clock in the morning or from 4 o'clock in the evening on a certain day but that the cover becomes ineffective at a certain hour, perhaps six <Col N="822" /> months down the line.  It may be argued that this could lead to an increase in fraudulent claims.  I am satisfied that would not be an unsurmountable problem because named drivers are already added to policies.</P>
    <P>We must take steps to reduce the cost of car insurance for young people.  I ask the Minister, in association with the insurance industry, to examine this proposal. I apologise to Deputy O'Sullivan for taking up too much time.  I would have liked more time to deal with other provisions of the Bill.  I congratulate the Minister and hope that the Bill will be passed.</P>
    <P>There was a reference to the provisions concerning driving licences.  Certainly this will cause some difficulty until people change their habits in this regard.  It is reasonable to expect drivers to carry a means of identification because vehicles can be used for various purposes.  However, it is necessary to implement these measures fairly.  There could be many instances of people leaving their children to school in the mornings who may not have their driving licences with them.  I have no doubt that these provisions will be implemented fairly by the gardaí.  The intention behind this, referred to by the Minister in his speech and in press releases, is not to apprehend the innocent person.</P>
    <P>I welcome the devolved powers to local authorities, which are long overdue.  The totality of the package, with the vast improvement in our road system in the past four or five years under the Structural Funds, is welcome.  No doubt we will see further improvement as a result of forthcoming funds from Europe.  I hope this will result in an improvement in road safety and a reduction in the number of road accidents and the number of claims coming before our courts.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on introducing this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. T. O'Sullivan Mr. T. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this legislation. The Road Traffic Bill, 1993, is by far the most important legislation of the past 25 years in this area.  I welcome the devolved <Col N="823" /> powers to the local authority, as I have been a member of one for the past number of years.  This will give people at local level the opportunity to deal swiftly with problems which affect the regulation of traffic in their respective areas.  In the past, a cumbersome centralised system operated.  It did not afford the local authority the opportunity to come to grips at an early stage with problems that were capable of being resolved locally.  I welcome the measures in this regard.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dan Wallace said there should be greater flexibility in regard to funding at local level.  The present system is restrictive, for example, Cork Corporation has a fund of several million pounds which can be used only for matters relating to traffic.  Local authorities should have greater flexibility and discretion as to how this money should be used.  Deputy Wallace's suggestion is a sensible one and I ask the Minister to accept it.</P>
      <P>One of my fears regarding this legislation is that the driver is seen as a potential criminal.  That is an attitude that should not be encouraged; drivers should not be seen in this light.  For too long there has been a tolerance on the part of Irish people towards the person who goes for a few pints.  To refer to such a person as a social drinker is somewhat dismissive of the seriousness of the problem.  Such tolerance should not be accepted in view of the serious problem of deaths on the road.  As somebody who, at the age of 12 years, experienced a fatality in the family &mdash; a close relative was killed at an early age while playing outide his own door &mdash; I am very conscious of the effect this can have on family life.  Such a tragedy is a serious blow to any family and is a matter that should not be dismissed.  I welcome the reduction in the limit of alcohol allowed to drivers.  I also welcome the introduction of new technology in regard to breathalyser testing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hughes raised the question of carrying a driving licence at all times. Bearing in mind that there now exists a ten year licence it should be possible to introduce a licence along the lines of a <Col N="824" /> credit card which could be held in a wallet.  In addition, a driving licence number should be permanently displayed on the windscreen in the same way as road tax.  I accept that proof would be necessary to show whether the driver is the holder of the licence.  We must discourage people, particularly young people, from driving without a licence. There is an awful description of young people who break the law, that is &ldquo;joyriders.&rdquo; That terminology should not be used.  Young people who take cars for pleasure or sheer vandalism must be discouraged.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that untaxed and uninsured vehicles be impounded by the Garda.  I spoke yesterday with a member of the staff of this House whose car, which was parked outside his own door, was damaged beyond repair by a person who did not hold a driving licence and did not have proper insurance cover.  That person's car should be impounded.  This matter must be addressed and I welcome the steps taken by the Minister in this regard.</P>
    <P>While I agree that additional powers should be given to the Garda, like Deputy Hogan, I would sound a warning in this regard.  The question of access to private property must be further considered as this is an area where problems could arise.  While it may be legitimate to enter a hospital in pursuit of a person there is a danger that to enter private property would infringe the rights not alone of the person involved but of the owner of the property.  This is a matter that must be thrashed out bearing in mind the question of the invasion of privacy. This measure may create more problems than it will resolve.  For that reason, I ask the Minister to consider further the section dealing with this matter.</P>
    <P>The Bill refers to the garda in charge of a station.  The person involved should be a garda above a particular rank.  At present some Garda stations are closed down for a number of hours a day and a garda on motor patrol who may arrest a person could also be the garda in charge of the station.  Conflict could arise in these circumstances and it could lead to <Col N="825" /> many problems.  For that reason the person in charge of a station should have a rank of sergeant or inspector.  I am not questioning the honesty or integrity of any garda but bearing in mind that eventually the garda will have to fight the case in court, conflict may arise.  This matter needs further consideration.</P>
    <P>In regard to signs erected by local authorities, many signs for guesthouses, factories and so on, are similar to local authority signs.  There should be a clear distinction between local authority signs and those put up by people to display their business.  Otherwise confusion is created.  As somebody who drives 13,000 miles a year, I am conscious that there is a tendency to confuse road traffic signs with bed and breakfast signs and so on. A standard sign which would be clearly identified should be introduced for local authorities.</P>
    <P>I am a member of a local authority that introduced an extensive one-way system. As far back as 1975 An Foras Forbartha held a seminar in Dublin entitled &ldquo;Streets for Living&rdquo; at which an expert from Holland spoke on what he called &ldquo;the Delph experience threat&rdquo; of the one-way traffic system.  While it is acceptable to regulate traffic and make better use of the space available and allow for a better flow of traffic through towns and cities, there is a disadvantage to the one-way system.  It has been proved conclusively that this system encourages increased speed which results in deaths.  For that reason I would sound a warning about the greater use of the one-way traffic system.  One need only a walk along Bachelor's Walk in Dublin to observe the speed at which traffic travels in the inner city.  McCurtain Street in Cork is another example of that.  The volume and speed of traffic in the city pose a threat to pedestrians. I accept that the one-way system makes it easier for people to travel between points but it creates problems for pedestrians and this is a cause for concern.  Perhaps the Minister can deal with those points on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Throughout the country at this time of the year silage and hay making is engaged in and during the harvesting there is quite <Col N="826" /> a lot of traffic on country roads.  As a warning that farm traffic is coming on to the main road, farmers place an oil drum on the road.  We should have a recognised standard sign for this purpose, as people unfamiliar with travelling in the heart of the country might not realise the significance of the oil drum.  This device is also used on national primary routes.  It should be possible to devise a cheap standardised sign which would ensure that people would know that farm machinery was coming on to the road. This sign could be included in the rules of the road.</P>
    <P>On the cab of each tractor in France a revolving light indicates that the vehicle will be travelling at a slow pace.  We should make that standard practice for this country because there is a growth in the use of farm machinery and proper traffic regulations should apply to it.  With regard to public transport it is common enough for a CIE bus to break down and the only warning sign is seats removed from the inside of the bus placed a number of yards behind the vehicle.  We should have a warning light which can be connected to the electrical system of the bus.</P>
    <P>Tachometers are used in commercial vehicles.  People drive long distances in private vehicles and there should be an upper limit on the number of miles a person may drive in one day.  I may appear to be asking the Minister to dig a hole without specifying the depth, but this area should be examined as should the use of mobile phones in cars.  One often sees people travelling at excessive speeds while engaged in conversation on a mobile phone and this is a danger to other road users.  If a person must have a phone some type of speaker should be fixed in the car to enable a person to engage in conversation without holding the applicance.</P>
    <P>I will refer to some figures from the International Road Traffic Database of the United Nations Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development as reported in <i>The Observer</i> of last Sunday.  Car ownership per 100,000 head of the population in Ireland is 29,100.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="827" /> We have 14 deaths per 100,000 of the population, whilst in the Netherlands, with 45,300 vehicles per 100,0000, of the population, there are 9.2 deaths.  A far more frightening statistic is the number of pedestrians killed on the roads.  In Holland it is one per 100,000 of the population. Although Holland has more cars on the road we have 4.3 pedestrian deaths per 100,000 of the population.  The only country where more deaths occur is Greece, where they have fewer cars.  This must relate to the quality of the roads and that factor must be taken into account.  In Italy, we have the highest rate of car ownership with 58,700 vehicles per 100,000 of the population and there are 12 road deaths per 100,00 of the population and of that only 1.9 are pedestrians.</P>
    <P>We run a very effective campaign during the Christmas period in order to reduce road deaths.  It has now been proved that in Britain there are more deaths between June and August than between December and February.  There are 3,000 accidents between June and August and 2,500 accidents between December and February.  There is far more activity on the roads during the summer months and as a result deaths have increased.  I imagine it is largely due to social drinking.  I do not know whether the Minister has the statistics available, but they are worth considering.  I thank the Minister for introducing this Bill which I hope will contribute to a reduction in road deaths.  Will the Minister take on board some of the points I have made and introduce measures on Committee Stage in order to minimise the carnage on our roads?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be brief in my comments.  I think Members will be aware that, whenever they offer me time, I avail of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like other Members, I welcome this Bill.  I remain very concerned about the manner in which juggernauts and container trucks speed along our roads.  The owners of those vehicles are used to driving on continental motorways, and while <Col N="828" /> we have a few motorways of that kind they are not sufficient to deter drivers, on leaving the motorways to slow down. One need only observe the way many of these juggernauts and container trucks speed along the Chapelizod by-pass any day of the week, way in excess of the 40 mile speed limit.  I often wonder why the authorities stipulate such a speed limit because only occasionally, do I see vehicles being pulled up for speeding.</P>
    <P>Always the emphasis must be placed on speed in regard to traffic movement generally, which was touched on by Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan who has just spoken.  &ldquo;Speed Kills&rdquo; was the slogan used in an excellent campaign in Britain. The speed with which many motorists drive on our roads leaves much to be desired; they rely totally on the capability of a motor vehicle to respond to their actions, believing that whenever they put their foot on the brake the vehicle will stop, whereas sometimes brakes do not work.</P>
    <P>While welcoming the extra powers being given local authorities to implement minor traffic changes I suggest that, in the months of November and December, when traffic comes to a standstill in and around Dublin, the Minister might authorise substantially increased fines.  Many people are very inconsiderate of other road users and should be punished for their selfishness.  I am a member of the Dublin Road Safety Council who constantly deal with road safety, meeting once a month.  Always we have been very concerned about drunk drivers, particularly the fact that one-third of all drunk drivers caught are found to have consumed twice the legal limit of alcohol; itself a dreadful indictment of the sense of responsibility of our drivers generally.</P>
    <P>The hit and run driver has not been mentioned.  Personally I would lock him up and throw away the key because it is one of the most cowardly crimes.  I cannot understand somebody who has taken a drink, or even somebody who has not, driving on having hit somebody, particularly when a person's life might have been saved had they stopped, got out <Col N="829" /> of their vehicle and ascertained whether they could render assistance.  That, in itself, almost amounts to a form of murder.  I have met and spoken with parents who have lost loved ones and who have witnessed such hit and run drivers, when caught, being sentenced to something like 22 months imprisonment, leading them to believe that 22 months imprisonment was all the life of their loved one was worth, sometimes such people being released even earlier.  Once a person is caught and convicted of a hit and run drunk driving offence, they should be banned from driving for life, should never be allowed behind the wheel of a car again.  Such a ban should be mandatory, not left to a judge.  I would strongly support such a ban.  I know that anybody who has ever suffered a bereavement within their family on that account would also support that view. That begs the question: why do we have to await some such happening to ourselves before we do anything about it? As Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan said, when he was 12 years old his family suffered such a bereavement and knows what it is like.</P>
    <P>While the stipulation that motorists should carry their driving licence with them is fine, everybody would agree that it is foolish to leave a driving licence in the glove compartment of a car because, if the car is stolen, and perhaps burned, the likelihood is the licence will not be recovered.  The Minister might examine the possibiity of issuing a plastic card that could be kept easily with one's credit cards.  The modern driving licence is somewhat bulky to carry around, particularly in these days when we endeavour to carry as little as possible.  While we men have not yet got round to carrying handbags a driving licence the size of a credit card, carrying the photograph of the licensee, should be sufficient.  If the authorities wanted to charge an extra 50p or £1 for such a card, I do not think anybody would object.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to note that the provisions of this Bill will be applied to people who, when involved in an accident, quickly book themselves into a <Col N="830" /> hospital.  There are too many smart merchants engaging in that practice and the Garda should be able to take a blood test or urine specimen and obtain the results, particularly in the case of accidents in which people may be injured.</P>
    <P>While realising that much of the problems in this area overlap and/or interact with the remit of the Minister for Justice I contend that the families of persons killed by drunken drivers should be compensated by the perpetrator of the offence.  I am glad to note that at least such people will have to pay something towards the cost of prosecution, which is also important.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I wanted to refer was the practice of motorists using telephones while driving.  It is most annoying to see people driving recklessly while speaking on the telephone.  It was my understanding of the law that they are not allowed do so.  Perhaps the Minister will confirm whether my interpretation is correct.  My understanding was that it is illegal and that prosecutions have been brought against people for so doing.  Perhaps people generally are not aware of this and should be made realise that they can be prosecuted.</P>
    <P>When briefing us at a party meeting yesterday the Minister told us that 35 per cent of accidents occur between the hours of 9 p.m. and 3 a.m.  That is a horrendous figure because we know there is not much traffic on our roads between those hours.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  We cannot be too severe on those motorists who have no consideration for others.  I hope the numbers of people killed and injured on our roads will be reduced enormously once the provisions of this legislation are implemented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Although I have mixed feelings about the provisions of this Bill I should make it clear that I do not condone drunken driving nor do I believe would any other Member of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there are enormous difficulties in this area the provisions of this Bill may be somewhat too narrow in their application.  There are other factors which contribute to deaths on our roads <Col N="831" /> which should be taken into consideration and debated.  As Deputy Briscoe has just pointed out, 35 per cent of fatalities on our roads occur within a six-hour period between 9 p.m. in the evening and 3 a.m. in the morning.  That gives rise to the question whether not merely our drunk driving laws but also our licensing laws should be amended.  I have never agreed with the present law under which publichouses, such as your own, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, must close at 11.30 p.m. for one half of the year and 12 midnight for the other half.</P>
    <P>These rigid pub closing hours are a major contributory factor in road fatalities that occur late at night or early in the morning.  No attempt has been made to address that problem in the Bill.  If our licensing laws were more liberal there would not be a mad rush to the pubs 30 minutes before closing time when people drink three or four pints.  These people are a danger to other road users as well as to themselves.  It would be far more civilised and conducive to safety if pubs could remain open for an unlimited number of hours as is the case in many other countries.  The rigid closing hours provide an impetus to the rate at which accidents occur late at night and early in the morning.  This is one of the holy cows which has never been addressed; we have extended the hours by 30 minutes to an hour depending on the day of the week or the season of the year but until such time as we adopt a more mature attitude this will continue to be the prime time for accidents.</P>
    <P>As I said, the licensing laws should be incorporated in this legislation.  Publicans should be obliged to ensure that people have access to food on licensed premises so that they are not found to be intoxicated in the eyes of the law.  If a substantial meal was available they might not be over the limit.  There are many deficiencies in that regard.  I do not think that we have adopted a civilised approach to this problem.  The holder of a publican's licence should be compelled to <Col N="832" /> provide a substantial meal in addition to serving drink.  Our outlook is too narrow.</P>
    <P>People living in Dublin, or other major cities and large towns have access to public transport, hackney and taxi services. This facility is not available in a predominantly rural community.  There is a bias against those living in remote areas.  It is all very well to say that people should make arrangements to ensure they have a drive home or organise a hackney cab or a taxi but this is easier said than done.  There is a social aspect and it creates a difficulty.  Under this new law the difficulty will be exacerbated.  I am not attempting to defend the drunken driver; all I am saying is that the legislation creates an additional social problem. I would be less than honest if I did not state this; I suspect that nobody else will say it but it needs to be said.  However I do not know what the solution is.</P>
    <P>Five years ago the Department of the Environment launched a safe driving campaign prior to Christmas when they told people that they should not take any more than two drinks.  That was the keynote of the advertisements carried on radio and television and in the newspapers. This campaign cost hundreds of thousands of pounds.  The insinuation was that it was quite safe to drive if a person had just two drinks.  I presume this meant two pints as well as two half ones.  I am not an expert when it comes to milligrammes of alcohol per millilitres of blood but I suspect that under this legislation a person may be over the limit if they have one pint and will definitely fail the test if they have two.  That is inconsistent.</P>
    <P>I suggest that most people, if they have two drinks, are not a hazard on the road. This is backed up by the advertising campaign which was launched by the Department of the Environment.  I do not recall any medical association contradicting the message given in that campaign.  We can be too puritanical at times.  This begs the question as to how people living in rural areas who like to go for one or two pints, as they have done for 20 to 30 years, are going to cope with the difficulties that will be created for them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="833" /> Nobody could attempt to justify drunken driving and I am not going to vote against the changes proposed but I wish to point out that there are contradictions and that difficulties will be created for those who have little else to do in life expect to have a chat at night, particularly in remote rural areas.  One cannot compare rural areas with densely populated urban areas either in this country or in continental countries where there is a massive flow of traffic.  One must take every aspect into consideration.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan spoke about those people who use mobile phones while driving.  I think that most of the men and women concerned are not talking to anyone; this is just a fad for show-offs and yuppies.  Most of them probably vote for the Progressive Democrats.  They try to create an impression when they are stopped in traffic; one wonders at times if the phone is connected.  I assume that it is an offence to use an object such as a telephone, be it dead or alive, while attempting to drive.  Obviously drivers need both their hands in an emergency. If the use of mobile phones in cars is not an offence, an amendment should be put down to make it so.  The use of mobile phones in cars, either on a genuine or bogus basis, needs to be discouraged.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat amused at the Minister's statement that there will be power to vary the maximum alcohol level by regulation.  Does this mean that a person from the city, who can avail of public transport or a taxi, can be summonsed for having a certain level of alcohol in his blood while a person in a rural area who has the same level of alcohol in his blood will not be summonsed because he is disadvantaged?  We tell the people in the west and the mountainous areas of Waterford, Wicklow and elsewhere that they are disadvantaged in many ways. Yet under this Bill they will be treated the same as the yuppies living in Dublin.  I ask the Minister to explain his statement. Does it mean that the man living on the top of the mountain may have three pints while a person in Mount Merrion may have only one pint?  It is not very clear. <Col N="834" /> This power is also contained in sections 10 and 11.</P>
    <P>I support the provisions in section 15. It has been a cause of concern for many years that a person involved in an accident and who was clearly over the limit could have himself rushed off to hospital and put under medical care so that the alcohol level in his blood could not be tested.  This was an abuse of the system. Many people over the legal limit who either killed or maimed others avoided such a test by using this subterfuge.  I am glad that this practice will no longer be allowed.  In future the Garda will be able to go into a hospital and test the alcohol level in a person's blood.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the proposed change in local traffic laws and by-laws.  I persume that the designation of a 30 mile per hour or 40 mile per hour speed limit, the painting of double yellow lines and the erection of no parking signs will, in future be the responsibility of the local authorities, in consultation with interested groups.  Up to now the procedure was so complicated that it irritated just about everybody &mdash; the general public, the Garda and the members and staff of local authorities.  Sometimes the erection of a 30 mile per hour speed sign could take two years because of the toing and froing between the local authority and the Garda.  It is a very cumbersome procedure.  I am glad that responsibility for these issues is being handed over to the local authorities in its entirety.</P>
    <P>I suppose it is too much to expect that all the money collected by way of road tax would be handed back to the local authorities to enable them to fund their road networks.  That was the original intention behind the introduction of this tax.  However, this has been forgotten about along the way.  The money collected under this tax goes into the general coffers and a fraction of it is dished out to the local authorities.</P>
    <P>Motorists can often be regarded as soft targets when it comes to apprehension. It can be more dangerous to walk through the streets of our towns and cities nowadays than it is to drive through them. The real area of lawlessness is not being <Col N="835" /> tackled as it should be.  The Garda often feel impotent to deal with this matter. The public are up in arms at the fact that the criminal element in our society is able to get away with so much and we do not seem to have the resolve, manpower, commitment or will to tackle this problem. Crimes such as violent assaults, murder, rape, child abuse, etc, appear to go unheeded in many cases.  The authorities do no appear to have the ability to tackle the real crime in our society. This is why I say it is more dangerous to walk through O'Connell Street or the main streets of many of our towns and cities than it is to drive through them. Murders and assaults occur on a daily basis, and the level of crime is increasing rather than decreasing.</P>
    <P>Cyclists in Dublin give the impression that there is no law governing lane discipline &mdash; they cycle all over the place.  I do not know of any jaywalker who has been prosecuted for walking out in front of traffic.  Some of them do this because they know they can get away with it.  The Bill deals with drunk driving, an issue which has to be addressed; the accident rate has to be reduced and, if possible, eliminated.  However, the Bill is too narrow in its focus &mdash; it does not deal with the greater problems in this area. The Department of Justice should have an input into such legislation so that the wider issues in this area for example, the licensing laws can be tackled.</P>

      <P>Due to other commitments, I did not have an opportunity to listen to the contributions to the debate.  The only contribution I heard in full was Deputy Deasy's contribution which covered a wide range of issues from the use of car telephones to signposting. I hope his assertion that all the users of mobile telephones vote for the Progressive Democrats is incorrect.  The number of people using such phones is increasing all the time and we will all be in political difficulties if his analysis is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  I do not have a thorough knowledge of all the provisions <Col N="836" /> in the Bill, but obviously the concept of making our roads safer has to be fully supported.  When one introduces regulations which place a strict limit on the amount of alcohol which can be consumed by motorists etc., inevitably people will point the finger and accuse one of being a killjoy.  We must disregard that attitude because a great many people are killed on our roads as a result of drink-driving and bad driving, this must be highlighted and policy measures taken to deal with it.  Over the past five to six years great progress has been made, which is evident from the statistics, but we have a long way to go.  The current advertising campaign which illustrates the hundreds of deaths still being caused is proof positive of the need for this legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy referred to the problems caused by cyclists and pedestrians in our major cities.  When I did my driving test, the strong emphasis in the rules of the road was on the three Cs: care, courtesy and consideration.  If those qualities were displayed, not only by drivers but by cyclists and pedestrians, many of the problems would be solved.  In cities, in particular, drivers face major difficulties because pedestrians cross in front of them instead of waiting at the lights for the signal to cross.  Pedestrians may cause unnecessary danger but the attitude is to do what you like and not to bother with the rules.  It is very different in most European countries where people appear to have greater respect for civil laws.  I hope we can instil through our school system and the junior traffic wardens programme a more positive attitude to obeying the rules of the road.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision to reduce the blood alcohol level allowable when driving. This is necessary and, as mentioned by previous speakers, we are not even keeping abreast of the European limits. Europe has moved ahead and reduced the limits further and we are still behind. This measure is a step in the right direction and I have no difficulty with it.</P>
    <P>I accept some of Deputy Deasy's points on pub closing hours, the law needs to be updated for the Ireland of the nineties.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="837" /> There is no reason to believe that a person leaving a pub at 11.30 p.m. is a safer driver than a person leaving at 1.30 a.m. and, as was pointed out, there is the added difficulty that everyone leaves together.  I hope a Minister in another Department will deal with this problem. Drink-driving is now less socially acceptable, but people are ambivalent about it. There was public disquiet at the clampdown on drink-driving over the Christmas periods of 1991 and 1992.  It is almost accepted that people should try to beat the system and the rules and that those who succeed are the heroes of the hour.  That is a very negative attitude but the attitude of a number of people is to ignore the civic rules.  We must try, through civic classes in our schools, to inculcate respect for law and order and life and limb.  Drink-driving must be totally unacceptable.  At present it is acceptable if the person gets away with it but we must change that.  The recent graphic TV advertisements highlight forcefully the consequences of drink-driving and succeed in bringing home to the majority the danger of such anti-social behaviour.</P>
    <P>The measures the Minister is introducing and which have the support of Members will not be successful unless the proper resources in terms of manpower and cash are made available to the guardians of the law, namely, the Garda Síochána. Legislation can be put in place but unless the manpower is there to enforce it, it will not be effective.  I was encouraged to hear the Minister for Justice in recent weeks talk about recruiting extra members to the Garda Síochána.  I hope that will happen over the next couple of months.  There is a major need for extra gardaí on the beat, not only to deal with the problems of drink-driving but the many other problems throughout society. If this Bill is not simply to be enacted but enforced, additional resources are necessary.</P>
    <P>There have been certain changes in regard to driving licences and it will now be necessary to have a driving licence in one's possession when driving.  That is a welcome change.  While it will not produce numerous advantages there is no <Col N="838" /> reason to oppose it.  However, one point, which is not connected with this Bill needs to be made.  I am unhappy with the current driving test system.  It has not worked very well and it is basically hit or miss.  Year after year, the number who pass the driving test is raised in parliamentary questions, 50 per cent of applicants pass it the first time, the rest will do the test twice and pass it on the second occasion.  I favour a different system which would involve every applicant having to undertake a minimum number of driving lessons from a registered qualified instructor, that is more important than tests.  For example, if you do the test at 4 p.m. and everybody before you has passed, statistically your chances of passing are diminished.  The system to obtain a driving licence could be improved resulting in better driving practices.  As it is now part of the culture people are more willing to wear safety belts although those who obtained their licence ten or 15 years ago are not as safety conscious as they could be.  That could be changed if we found a new way of implementing testing regulations and provisions in relation to driving tests.</P>
    <P>I welcome the additional powers being given to local authorities.  As a local councillor I and my colleagues throughout the country find it amazing that we do not have control over such matters as the extension of speed limits.  It makes a mockery of local councillors that they and their managers cannot decide to modify a speed limit from 30 to 40 miles.</P>
    <P>The provision in this Bill which gives a minor power back to the people, in whose hands it should always have been, is welcome. I hope it will be introduced in the very near future and that at local authority level we can get to work in implementing changes which we have been seeking for many years.</P>

    </Speaker>

      <P>It is very unsatisfactory that all those questions are lumped together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>On 13 June 1993 Aer Lingus submitted to me their proposals, entitled <i>Strategy for the Future</i>, to restore the Aer Lingus Group, and particularly the core airline business, to financial viability.  Details of the Aer Lingus' proposals, excluding commercially sensitive information, have been circulated to all Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>These proposals have been formulated against the background of a major cash and financial crisis which threatens the viability and very survival of the Aer Lingus Group.  The crisis has developed progressively over the past four years. Group profits of £28 million in 1989-90 have been transformed into a loss of £116 million in 1992-93, excluding restructuring costs; shareholders funds in the same period have gone from £443 million to £104 million and are forecast to fall to £36 million in 1993-94.  The group is currently losing over £1 million a week; committed cash facilities will be exhausted by end August; and the group's uncommitted facilities, which can be withdrawn at a few days' notice, have been reduced from £173 million to £78 million.  The number of banks providing these new critical facilities has declined from 22 to ten and there is no possibility of any new source of borrowing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="842" /> Aer Lingus state that there are four main elements in their strategy: (1) restructuring the operating divisions, (2) removing artificial constraints on the development of the airline, by amending the Shannon stop policy, (3) reducing the airline cost base by £50 million annually, and (4) pursuing alliances with other carriers. Aer Lingus also state that the success of the strategy is also contingent on a programme of non-core asset disposal and an equity injection of £175 million by Government.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus have assured me that there is no change in their strategy as presented to me and as circulated to Members of the Oireachtas.  There was some confusion&mdash; admittedly caused by the company itself &mdash; over the company's plan for its transatlantic operations.  However, Aer Lingus issued a press statement on 29 June clarifying its Shannon-based transatlantic fleet plans.</P>
    <P>The judicious disposal of a number of assets which are not essential to the core business is an intrinsic element of the strategy.  The programme of non-core asset disposal will be an orderly one and not a fire-sale one.  The sale by Aer Lingus of any of its subsidiaries is primarily a commercial matter for the company. However, I have been informed that there are currently no proposals before the board for the sale of any specific subsidiary.</P>
    <P>The strategy also proposes an equity injection of £175 million by the Government on a phased basis over a number of years.  This amount is considerably higher than expected by the Government. However, the Government have indicated that, while an equity injection of this level represents a major injection of scarce taxpayer's funds, it is prepared as shareholder to make its contribution to returning the airline to profitability and ensuring its long term future when all other interests make the essential contributions which are called for under the strategy.  However, no decision has yet been made by the Government on the amounts and timing of equity injections. The question of obtaining EC Commission <Col N="843" /> approval for an equity injection does not, therefore, arise at this stage.</P>
    <P>The Aer Lingus proposals envisage the shedding of 1,530 jobs and the board have indicated to me that this is a full extent of job losses sought within the group.  The anticipated job losses are 1,280 in the airline and 250 in TEAM Aer Lingus.  Outside of the airline and TEAM, there are no current proposals for job losses.  While any job losses are to be regretted, the Government is on record as stating that it wishes employment in Aer Lingus to be at the maximum level consistent with commercial viability for the company.  The Government, in addition, indicated its commitment to try to achieve job losses through a voluntary redundancy scheme.  Most of the job losses envisaged will be in Ireland as this is where the main base of Aer Lingus' operations is located.  Aer Lingus will, however, try to reallocate in Ireland, where possible, operations abroad which could be more effectively located here.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Government have agreed with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions that in order to identify new employment opportunities for surplus Aer Lingus staff a special enterprise development unit would be set up right away with a mandate similar to the special task force for Shannon Airport recently established by me.  This unit will consist of representatives of the unions, Aer Lingus together with the IDA, Fingal County Council, FÁS and the Department of Enterprise and Employment.</P>
    <P>The Aer Lingus proposals relating to transatlantic operations would involve a modification of the Shannon stopover policy as provided for in the Ireland/US Air Transport Agreements.  As the Government has not yet completed its evaluation of the Aer Lingus strategy, existing policy still remains and the question of a re-negotiation of the air transport agreements between Ireland and the United Stats does therefore not arise at this stage.</P>
    <P>I would also like to inform the House that I met with local public representatives, <Col N="844" /> the Status and Signal Groups as well as local business and tourism interests to hear their concerns regarding a change in the Shannon stop policy.  I have assured them that these concerns would, in addition to the Aer Lingus proposals, be brought to the attention of Government before any decision was taken on the Shannon stop policy.</P>
    <P>The Aer Lingus proposals are currently being evaluated by a Cabinet sub-committee on aviation matters which is to make a report on the matter to the Government shortly.  No response has yet, therefore, been made to Aer Lingus on their proposals.</P>
    <P>The Cabinet sub-committee on aviation matters met a delegation from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to discuss the Aer Lingus strategy.  Following the meeting, which was held at the request of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, a full and agreed statement, was issued.  I have nothing further to add to this statement.</P>
    <P>The proposed voluntary severance/ redundancy terms are broadly similar to those previously offered by Aer Lingus. They depend on age and length of service with the company.  Basically, the terms include a severance payment and pension. For those aged 50 and over, the pension would be payable immediately, while for those under 50 the pension would be preserved until age 55 or 65, depending on length of service.  The formula for calculating the severance payments varies, depending on age and length of service.</P>
    <P>In relation to the so called &ldquo;Aer Rianta Memorandum&rdquo;, I would like to put on the record of the House the statement by an official spokesman for that company. He said the company had not made any comment whatsoever on the Aer Lingus plan and the reported document was apparently an individual's personal assessment of the plan and in no way reflects the views of Aer Rianta.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus has had discussions with a number of American and European airlines over the past year or so about the possibility of some form of joint venture <Col N="845" /> or alliance.  No airline, to date, has shown any serious interest in forming a total operating alliance with Aer Lingus, although some marketing alliances have been entered into.  Aer Lingus have, however, recently concluded a memorandum of understanding regarding a marketing and carriage alliance with British Airways for co-operation on freight carriage which will open up new opportunities for Irish exporters on a worldwide basis.</P>
    <P>In its present financially weak position Aer Lingus do not believe that they have a strong negotiating position with a potential partner airline in an alliance arrangement.  However, they expect that they will be in a much stronger position to forge beneficial alliances with other airlines when their <i>Strategy for the Future</i> plan has been successfully implemented.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated to the House, it would not be appropriate, for reasons of commercial confidentiality, to publish the strategy submitted to me by Aer Lingus.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Many answers are rolled together here into one long statement by the Minister.  I put it to him that even though he has collated all the information about Aer Lingus already in the public domain, he has not carried the case forward today and provided us with any new information.  I would like to ask the Minister three supplementaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister indicate if the Government has already taken a decision in principle to implement the Cahill plan and that the outstanding matter is an explicit decision on the Shannon stopover? While the Minister has not said so, the flavour of his reply was that of a Cabinet Minister who has already accepted in principle that the bulk of the Cahill initiative would be forming the basis of the rescue plan for Aer Lingus. The Minister stated that £170 million in equity will be provided to the company, that £43 million of that is earmarked for the Aer Lingus redundancy package and in effect that the remainder will go to the banks and not to Aer Lingus, because it <Col N="846" /> will be used to improve its balance sheet and the banks will be the beneficiaries. It is propagandistic to come in here and suggest that the banks, as it were, are putting a gun to the heads of those in Aer Lingus and that they will foreclose in early August while Aer Lingus await £140 million in Government equity.  Is the Minister aware that the new chief executive of Aer Lingus, Mr. Owen, is on public record as stating that if the Government changes its policy on the status of Shannon and if that results in an &ldquo;open skies&rdquo; policy, with carriers coming in from the United States, Aer Lingus will be off the North Atlantic route within three years and that fundamental to the proposal for Aer Lingus is a renegotiation of the bilateral agreement with the United States to confine access to one carrier only?  Have any soundings been made with the US authorities in regard to their position on that matter?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>No Government decision has been taken in relation to the Aer Lingus strategy forwarded by the board. That will be taken when the evaluation by the subcommittee has been completed.  I am on record publicly as stating that, given the precarious financial position of this company &mdash; a matter which I have stated with clarity from the outset so that people might understand the problem&mdash; the central thrust of this strategy is necessary to save this company.  On a number of occasions I have stated that there is little room for manoeuvre if we want to save Aer Lingus because the precarious financial position is such that redundancy payments cannot be made by the company. There is a cash crisis in the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The beneficiaries of an equity injection, on the basis of a successful implementation of this programme for the survival of the company, will be the taxpayer.  On behalf of the taxpayer we are proposing to inject a sum of £175 million as a contribution to the salvation of the company on the basis of a viable recovery plan being implemented.  I reiterate that that equity injection cannot be made unless such a viability strategy <Col N="847" /> is in place, because of the disciplines imposed on us by the European Commission in regard to State aids and their compliance with EC competition policy and, more importantly, in respect of the wider responsibilities we have to investment of taxpayers' money.  The Deputy stated that I was propagandistic, but it is propagandistic to suggest that one stakeholder is the beneficiary of an equity injection.  The company and all stake-holders will be beneficiaries of the equity injection.  Given the cash crisis in the company, it is necessary for the Government to show the seriousness of its intent by providing the equity injection it has promised.  That will show the Government's commitment to support the company, subject to the other conditions in regard to its viability being met, which include a cost reduction programme totalling £50 million per year in order for the company to survive.  Therefore, the beneficiaries will be those making the investment, the Government on behalf of the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>A renegotiation of the bilateral agreement is subject to whatever Government decision is taken in the final analysis.  The US have been indicating for some time that they want an amendment to the bilateral agreement.  That indication has been flagged on many occasions during the past number of years, particularly since deregulation became part of the air transport regime in the United States.  As the Deputy is aware, the European Community will be seeking to enter into negotiations with the United States on an ECUS air transport agreement later this year.  There will be no change in the bilateral agreement until such time as a change is negotiated by the parties concerned, and until such a decision is taken the present position will remain.</P>

      <P>I will make a number of points in the very short time allowed to me in regard to the changes that have taken place in the plan and on the hit and miss approach to it.  It was announced originally that three 747 aircraft would be based in Shannon.  Having refused to meet the committee of this House which was set up for the purposes of dealing with semi-State commercial bodies, Mr. Cahill, on the directions of the Minister, went to Shannon last week.  A document dated 23 June 1993, which he circulated there to a number of parties states: &ldquo;Two 747s will be based at Shannon and crewed from Shannon.  The third operates Dublin/Shannon/Boston and will need to be Dublin based&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;Aer Lingus seems to have changed its mind at least twice on that matter.  On how many other aspects of this is Aer Lingus changing its mind?  For example, the figures for losses on certain routes appear to change on a daily basis, because they are purely arbitrary.  Will the Minister take into account the analysis done on behalf of Aer Rianta by one of its senior staff which was published in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 24 June, which Aer Rianta now say is not a board document but which contains many compelling arguments that undermine many of the arguments put forward by Aer Lingus?  Will the Minister reply to Question No. 3, tabled in my name, which, despite his long reply, he did not deal with?  That question asked him whether the statement issued by his predecessor, Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, at the end of October 1992 regarding the status of Shannon Airport still represents Government policy and, if not, the reason therefor.  I would like the Minister to begin by giving a specific answer to that question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I can answer that question specifically.  The present position is that the Shannon stop policy remains unless and until there is a change of policy. Deputy O'Malley was a member of two previous Governments during the time when these difficulties arose.  I am satisfied that we now have an accurate fix on the depth and scale of the immediate and urgent problems facing this company on which the necessary remedial action must be taken if it is to survive.  In that context all aspects of operations must be looked at to see what contribution can be made towards the successful viability of this company.  I stated in reply to Deputy Noonan that there will be no change in that bilateral arrangement until one is negotiated if a Government decision requires it.  I further made the point that evaluation of all the considerations, including those mentioned by Deputy <Col N="850" /> O'Malley, are at present under consideration by the sub-committee which will subsequently report to the Cabinet for final decision.</P>
      <P>I have already said that the Aer Rianta document does not represent Aer Rianta policy.  The claim that a fully laden 747 cannot take off from Dublin Airport is not correct.  I refer in my document to the Aer Rianta statement and to refer to it as an Aer Rianta memorandum is incorrect.</P>
      <P>In regard to questions about Shannon and the transatlantic fleet, some confusion seems to have arisen over the weekend.  Aer Lingus provided a clarifying statement pointing out the exact position and, given the understandable intensity of opinion in Shannon, the statement was necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>This statement clarifies the position.  In regard to the past performance of Aer Lingus in relation to Shannon, people in Shannon feel that there has not been sufficient transparency on the question of costs, revenue and the contribution of the Shannon operation to the overall performance of Aer Lingus. It is proposed to set up a self-contained transatlantic fleet with its resources, revenue and costs specifically identified. That is the kind of transparency for which people at Shannon have been arguing for quite some time.  What is proposed in the strategy for the survival of this company is a fleet of three 747 aircraft managed, operated and marketed from Shannon.  I want them to be airborne as often as possible because that is where they will make money.  It is in the American airports on turn-around that the planes spend the longest time.</P>

I have been given an undertaking that there will be full consultation with me, as Minister, before any such policy decision is taken.  If the Deputy is interested in the survival and return to viability of this company, the debt of £540 million has to be dealt with and there is no way round that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I have answered the Deputy's question.  The Deputy asked what will happen if we do not get the £50 million cost reduction programme, the company will continue to lose money and there will be no future for it.  There is no getting away from the fact that the company is losing more than £1 million a week and if that simple problem is not addressed the company cannot survive. Unless the company gets that £50 million cost reduction programme to meet the criteria for viability of the company, the equity injection of £175 million cannot be made because it would contravene EC competition policy.  There is no way round that dilemma.  Everybody must face the magnitude of the problem and get down to the business of cutting costs and making sure that the company survives.</P>
      <P>It is the intention of everybody, management, unions, Government and anybody associated with enabling this company to survive that no compulsory redundancies will be necessary.  I suggest that the company be allowed to proceed on that basis, which is the basis on which ICTU and the Government met and agreed their statement, which included a judicious asset disposal programme.</P>

        <i>(Limerick-East):</i> While Telecom Éireann is a large company in the Irish context, it is a rather small telecommunications company in the European context.  Would the Minister agree that the development of our telecommunications system in the nineties will require partnership to joint venture relationships between Telecom and other telephone companies in other EC states?

These include the French telephone company and others. There are no specific proposals before me from any company at present in relation to joint venture arrangements <Col N="854" /> or strategic alliances, but discussions are ongoing.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 21 together.  The Deputies will be aware that I sent a detailed and wideranging submission to the UK Minister for the Environment and the UK Inspectorate of Pollution. This submission conveyed in the strongest possible terms the Government's total opposition to the continued operation of all nuclear activities carried out at Sellafield and to any expansion of these activities.  In particular the submission expressed the Government's grave concerns about commissioning the proposed new THORP plant on the site and the proposed new levels of authorised discharges from Sellafield into the atmosphere and the Irish Sea and called for a full public inquiry to be held before any decision is taken to proceed.</P>
      <P>On 28 June the UK Secretary of State for the Environment announced that, after consideration by him and the UK Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food of the report of the Inspectorate of Pollution, it has been concluded that no points of substance have been raised that should cause them to reconsider the terms of the draft authorisations. However, because a number of submissions had raised questions as to the justification for the operation of THORP it has been decided to delay the commissioning of the plant until a further round of consultation to deal with the wider issues has been held.  It is understood that this consultation will take place over ten weeks.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to object in the strongest possible terms to the conclusions reached with regard to the draft discharge authorisations.  In addition, while our original submission raised important questions on the basic justification for THORP, I will make a further submission to the UK authorities after consideration of any material made available as part of the further public consultation. Deputies can be assured that I will also continue to press the UK authorities to hold a full public inquiry on THORP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Government has always been and continues to be committed to legal action against Sellafield if a sufficient <Col N="857" /> case for it can be shown to exist, it cannot initiate such action without a firm legal case based on sufficient evidence. The Attorney General has advised that any such legal action would have to be based on scientific evidence as to the injurious effects of operations at the Sellafield plant on Ireland.</P>
    <P>Furthermore there is no evidence to suggest that activities at the entire complex, including the proposed operation of the THORP plant, are or will be in breach of EC law and international conventions which would sustain a successful legal action.</P>
    <P>The Government is open to information and evidence from any source to support a sustainable case regarding closure of Sellafield.  It is not, however, prepared to proceed to legal action without a sustainable case.</P>
    <P>In matters of law and legal opinion, the Attorney General alone is the Government's adviser.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been changes since the Government stated its objections and I thank the Minister for reminding the House of them.  Question No. 21 relates to whether the Minister or the Attorney General has been in contact with the legal advisers of organisations, such as Greenpeace, because there appears to be a difference of opinion in regard to what is possible.  Would the Minister indicate the outcome of any such meetings?  Given that there is still a chance the THORP could be commissioned in spite of the Government's submissions would the Minister be prepared to take any action since the public inquiry demanded by the Government has not been forthcoming?  Would the Minister consider withdrawing Irish taxpayers' money from contributions to EURATOM or rejecting the electricity link with Britain, a proportion of which would be nuclear powered?</P>

I wish to confirm that the issue was raised at last week's Council of Energy Ministers in Luxembourg in the context of assistance being given by the EC to render more safe nuclear stations in central and Eastern Europe as part of a programme that is being run by the Energy Council.  I pointed out that it would greatly strengthen our standing in that regard with those countries if we were to use more widely Article 35 of the EURATOM Treaty to have an inspection of nuclear plants within the EC.  That would encourage others, who are in a worse economic position and who depend on these stations, to upgrade those plants.

      <Quest>the implications for Irish road hauliers arising from the decision by the EC Council of Transport Ministers to totally de-regulate the European Community's road haulage market by 1998; the level of representation Ireland had at the meeting; and the position Ireland took on the proposal.</Quest>

      <P>The Council of Ministers, at their meeting which I attended on the 19 June 1993, agreed a gradual phasing out of restrictions on road freight cabotage, leading to complete liberation by 1 July 1998.  This decision means that from that date Irish international road transport operators may carry out road haulage operations domestically within the territory of other EC member states.</P>
      <P>Ireland has always supported liberalisation of road haulage in the EC in furtherance of the free market principle. The very limited cabotage regime available under existing EC regulation has been availed of by a small core of Irish international hauliers interested in expanding their operations by undertaking internal work in other EC member states.  The further liberalisation of road cabotage is therefore seen as providing opportunities for our haulage industry and should provide for an expansion in the number of our hauliers operating abroad.</P>

      <P>It is important for the Department and the Government to ensure that whatever regime comes into operation is favourable to Ireland.  This was agreed at a 12 hour meeting on 19 June.  We fought a major case and secured a very positive deal which has been welcomed across the board by the haulage industry.  We will have further negotiations with the Irish Road Haulage Association and other interests to ensure that any benefits can be maximised in favour of Ireland, the haulage industry and job creation.  Every co-operation will be given to ensure a positive environment for international road haulage from an Irish point of view.</P>

      <P>This matter has been promoted by Germany for a number of years and has been discussed throughout the Community over the past three years at various meetings of COREPER, in the Commission and at meetings of the Council of Ministers.  Initially, the proposal was a 4,000 ECU per annum charge for all hauliers crossing from one country to another.  As a result of the meeting of 19 June, during which Ireland forced a total of four different votes, the final proposal put forward by us was the one agreed by the Council.  This ensured that the figure was reduced to 1,250 ECU per annum.  We included a <i>pro rata</i> daily, weekly and monthly rate and Ireland <Col N="862" /> obtained a derogation on this charge until 1997.  We persuaded five countries to agree to a co-operative regional vignette which means that Irish hauliers will be required to pay only a single charge in those five countries during each year. This is very satisfactory from an Irish point of view.</P>

      <P>I am aware of concerns expressed by the Irish Hotels Federation about the potential impact of the directive on packaged home holidays sold by them, particularly in the area of the protection of the consumer, where insolvencies arise.</P>
      <P>Draft regulations circulated by our Department on 8 April last to interests affected, including the Irish Hotels Federation, dealt with, <i>inter alia</i>, the protection of the consumer against insolvency.  The draft regulations were designed to be as flexible as possible and were drawn up to suit the varying circumstances of the range of package organisers offering home holidays.  Following full examination of the views received, I intend to make the necessary arrangements for the implementation of the directive in this area as soon as possible.</P>

Is he aware that the likely effect of such an imposition would place <Col N="863" /> severe obstacles in the way of those who wished to promote activity related holidays on which further growth in Irish tourism is so dependent?

      <P>I would not accept that my Department is broadening the interpretation of the directive.  We are obliged to interpret the directive as it is laid down and we must take legal advice in that regard.  Based on the principle of subsidiarity, we must conform, as a member of the Community, to the directive. I accept the directive will place new impositions on people involved in package holidays and will certainly change the traditional way of promoting those holidays.  There has been growing concern over the years right across the community about consumer protection, as a result this directive has been introduced. I met organisations about this matter and their views are being taken on board. When we have concluded consideration of the submissions received and discussions have taken place we will come up with a formula by regulation, primary legislation or both.</P>

Will he also agree that this directive will involve the production of detailed brochures and security for deposits as well as the provision of bonds, insurance cover and so on involving costs which the ordinary hotel or guesthouse operator cannot afford? There will be severe implications for those involved.  The Government should take greater cognisance of the objectives of the Irish Hotel's Federation in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 16 together.</P>
      <P>I have noted the contents of the Electricity Supply Board's Annual Report for 1992.</P>
      <P>The issues raised in the report will be subject to separate discussion and examination as appropriate under the powers assigned to me under the Electricity Supply Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 2 of the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 1982, ESB's capital expenditure programme is subject to ministerial approval.  Approval has been given for the construction of a 150MW combustion turbine at Poolbeg. ESB has sought approval for the installation of further capacity at the Poolbeg <Col N="865" /> plant but no decision has been taken on that application.</P>
    <P>In considering ESB's capital expenditure proposals my Department examines the economic justification of such investments.  Detailed design of the generation plant is a matter for the ESB subject to planning permission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the ESB annual report and the discussions between the ESB and the Minister's Department, is the Minister in a position to say when he intends to make an announcement about the ESB's request to increase electricity charges for its customers, reported as being imminent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I answered questions on 27 May on the ESB's application for a price increase.  Briefly I repeat that my approach to examining its request for an increase is to strike a balance between the obvious benefit to consumers and the economy of making the smallest increase possible and the need to maintain the financial stability of the ESB.  I put particular emphasis on the need to fully evaluate the cost and timing of the proposed capital expenditure programme. The ESB has not increased its prices since 1986 and consumers have benefited from the decision to hold prices at current levels.  I hope it will be possible to avoid an increase this year.  While I am anxious to defer increases for as long as possible I have to consider the overall financial position for the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the price evaluation process my Department has been discussing a framework with the ESB to assess the need for price increases which distinguishes between the various cost factors involved in the ESB's application for a price increase.  Work to date has highlighted the importance of the proposed capital expenditure programme and external factors such as exchange rates and fuel costs in determining the ESB's financial position.  Achievement of internal productivity improvement will contribute to moderating any necessary price increases.  I will be expecting considerable efficiency improvements <Col N="866" /> throughout the ESB to reflect improved technology and generally better management of resources.</P>

Is it his intention to divest his powers and responsibilities in that area to the ESB to enable it to increase charges as it sees fit?  Is that what is planned in terms of rebalancing ESB charges?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that whereas the power station at Poolbeg referred to in the two questions would have to be largely built from scratch, there is already a partly build unit of 300 megawatts at Moneypoint on which the ESB in the early eighties spent perhaps tens of millions of pounds.  Why not complete that unit rather than build a new station in Dublin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Deputy's <Col N="867" /> geographical concern but why not provide for new peat fired generating stations which, as a result of new technology, would compare favourably in terms of efficiency with imported fuels such as coal or oil?  That matter is important in terms of the strategic energy policy that will be pursued.  When the Kinsale gasfield reserves expire at the end of the century the only indigenous fuel available will be peat.  Given the major restructuring in Bord na Móna without assistance from anybody, which has resulted in huge job losses but increased efficiency, it is time that careful consideration was given to that part of the country so that it can make a contribution to future energy policy.  That is a very competitive proposal, particularly in view of technological advances.  In that context I look forward to the feasibility study on a new peat fired station for the midlands.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware the board has put a proposal to me for the immediate closure of Allenwood power station because it has outlived its design life.  My chief executive advisers have to finally advise me on the proper decision to take in that context.  I take the point that the region on the North Offaly-Kildare border is where there is greatest peat availability.  While we await the feasibility study, one could expect, as the new peat fire station will consume something like one million tonnes of peat per year, that the generating station will be located in the area with the greatest peat resource to add to its efficiency prospects. We must await the details of the feasibility study before any final decisions are made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister reconsider his comment that peat is our only indigenous fuel?  Notwithstanding the fact that we have gas, will the Minister consider the renewable energy sources which are far more plentiful than any of the fossil fuels?  I was interested to hear that a decision on Poolbeg will be based on economic considerations.  Will that also include ecological considerations?  I asked the Minister if he was aware that many of the objections to the Poolbeg plan lodged with the local authority related to the absence of a combined heat and power facility which, in today's technology, is standard.  Not only would it prevent waste water flowing into the bay, it would be used for heating glass-houses or for domestic heating.  This would ensure that the price would not be increased because the heat would be more efficiently used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that ecological considerations must also come into the equation and renewable energy is actively being considered in my Department. We must try to get renewable energy products going.  I want to meet European guidelines in this area.  Combined heating power is extensively referred to in the Programme for Government and is being actively promoted. <Col N="869" /> I hope to be down in Mallow next week to open such a project.</P>

      <P>The SAVE programme, which was adopted by the EC Energy Council in October 1991, is a wide-ranging five year programme, which forms part of the Community strategy to limit CO2 emissions, in this case through improving energy efficiency.</P>
      <P>Activity within the programme ranges from defining standards, through encouraging initiatives in member states, to international information networks.</P>
      <P>Clearly SAVE is a developing programme, but since its adoption Ireland has been actively involved in its implementation at EC and national level.</P>
      <P>As an illustration, I can use the recent Directive under the programme which was agreed at the Ministerial Energy Council meeting on 25 June.  This directive requires measures such as the energy certification of buildings, thermal insulation of buildings and energy audits of businesses to be introduced by the end of 1994.  Ireland in fact submitted projects for Community support to establish pilot projects, in both the certification of houses and audits in business in 1992. These are now underway with Community support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where regulations are required I expect EC implementation deadlines to be met.  In some cases we have taken the <Col N="870" /> initiative.  For example a Directive on energy labelling of fridges is still in preparation. However, a voluntary scheme has been introduced in this country and EC assistance under the SAVE programme has been sought to extend this in co-operation with the Consumers' Association of Ireland, Eolas and the ESB, this year.</P>
    <P>Finally, Ireland is very much involved in the international information network where Eolas is the managing contractor on behalf of the European energy network and is doing an excellent job on behalf of our country in the European Community.</P>

      <P>The ALTENER Programme, which was formally agreed at the Ministerial Energy Council meeting on the 25 June 1993, aims at doubling renewable energy use from 4 per cent of consumption in 1991 to 8 per cent by the year 2005.  ALTENER is a five-year framework programme which provides a basis on which to stimulate and assist various actions to ensure greater penetration of renewable energy technologies.</P>
      <P>These measures will help to achieve Community objectives in limiting CO2 emissions.  Increased use of renewable energy sources also has an important contribution to make to the targets set in Ireland's national CO² abatement strategy, which my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, recently published and is part of the reason for this Government's commitment to supporting appropriate alternative energy technologies.  It is expected that ALTENER will assist in this development.</P>

      <P>The three Boeing 747 aircraft operated by Aer Lingus were constructed in 1970.  Aircraft do not have a fixed or alloted lifespan. The operation of all three Aer Lingus aircraft is in accordance with their certificates of airworthiness which are issued annually by my Department following major inspection.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that these aircraft can continue to operate subject to them meeting the requirements of the normal ongoing maintenance and overhaul programmes as specified by the manufacturers. These programmes are agreed with my Department.  The operation of the aircraft is monitored on a continuous basis by the relevant airworthiness experts in the Air Navigation Services Office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that 23 years of age for aircraft like these is very unusual in the case of operators either in Europe or in North America?  Would he agree that it is usually in more remote parts of the world that aircraft of that type and age continue to be operated and that other airlines in Western Europe, for example, would tend to dispose of aircraft like these after ten or 12 years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I might make the point to the Deputy that, regardless of the age of the aircraft, very stringent safety standards apply to the airworthiness certification process of the Air Navigation Services office, I might also point out the excellent safety record of Aer Lingus. Despite the age of such aircraft, it would not be correct to suggest that they were in some way substandard, because that is <Col N="875" /> not the case.  Quite clearly, should the cost reduction programme and survival strategy of the company be implemented, thereby generating extra revenue and greater profitability, the ability to replace aircraft in the future will be greatly enhanced.  That is provided for in the survival strategy planned to begin in 1995-96, but in the first instance one must generate the type of revenue that will allow that to happen.  Quite clearly, one need not examine outright purchase, as in the case of the European fleet, which got the company into severe difficulty but rather the type of very competitive leasing arrangements now available, given the present state of the aerospace industry worldwide.  It is within that context that one would examine this overall area.</P>
      <P>I must re-emphasise Aer Lingus' excellent safety record, comparable with any other airline worldwide, of which they are proud and the very high safety standards applied by the Air Navigation Services office.  In no way are any of these aircraft substandard.  Their replacement would be greatly enhanced in the future through this company achieving the type of cost reductions necessary to generate the requisite revenues for that purpose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first instance the question of their replacement arises only within the context of the company's viability plans being implemented.  At present one cannot so presume.  Basic commercial decisions are day-to-day matters for management &mdash; for example, whether one should deploy more fuel-efficient 747-200s or 747-300s to replace the present 747-100s being used, or whether one should acquire newer, more technologically advanced aircraft.  The commercial decision as to whether they should be new or secondhand is something that should be decided at that stage. The ability of the aircraft to fulfil their function is not based on their age.  Their certification of airworthiness is done annually and very high and stringent standards are set for them.  As we know, great advances have been made in the overhaul and maintenance of aircraft, including in this country.  That type of line maintenance and general overhaul is a very important factor in the longevity and usefulness of these aircraft.  On the separate question of the Boeing 767 aircraft, as I do not wish to give an inaccurate answer I will convey the information to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>As the B767 aircraft are referred to in Question No. 30 in the name of Deputy Cox I presume the Minister has the information available but may I remind him that Aer Lingus does not own any of the five aircraft that we are talking about here &mdash; the three B747 aircraft and the two B767 aircraft?  It did own them at one stage but it sold them and then leased them.  In view of what the Minister said about the B747 aircraft and the fact that the B767 aircraft have a higher unit cost of operation than larger long haul aircraft does he think that Aer Lingus might do better if it retained the new B767 aircraft rather than the elderly <Col N="877" /> B747 aircraft given that the B767 aircraft are only about one year old and are regarded throughout the world as being excellent and cost efficient aircraft?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a commercial matter for the company in the first instance to decide on the configuration of the Aer Lingus-Aerlinte fleet.  On 7 September 1989 the board of Aer Lingus endorsed a management recommendation to lease two Boeing 767-300ER aircraft for operation on the North Atlantic and sought Government approval to proceed with the leases.  The Government approved the proposals subject to the condition that there would be no recourse to the State for either equity or State guarantees of borrowing in relation to the aircraft. At that time, Aer Lingus planned to operate the services to Los Angeles but, for commercial reasons, the company subsequently decided not to proceed with these plans.  In its recent review of strategy Aer Lingus decided that in relation to its North Atlantic operations services would be confined to New York and Boston.  Aer Lingus is of the view that these points are best served by the B747 aircraft as the B767 aircraft have higher seat-mile cost than the B747 and lower aircraft mile costs making them suitable for long range thin routes but relatively unsuitable for shorter routes with heavy traffic flows and low seat rates.  As the B767 aircraft are surplus to Aer Lingus requirements, the company proposes to dispose of them as soon as possible.  To respond to Deputy Noonan, two B767 aircraft were leased in 1991 and the rental is of the order of $750,000 per month.</P>

      <P>Like old machinery, aircraft maintenance costs would presumably be higher in respect of older aircraft.  What is at issue here is the inability of the company to make provision for the replacement of the Transatlantic fleet.  There is a need to address this problem.  This forms part of the proposed strategy.  I have outlined the technical reasons the B747 aircraft are regarded as more appropriate than the B767 aircraft.  Because of the breaks in the lease we have been able to get rid of the B767 aircraft and lease them even if the rates do not match what Aer Lingus is paying for them.  The company is in a tight financial position at present and it will have to try to replace the fleet during the period of the plan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to driving licences&mdash;admittedly this is extraneous &mdash;I was making the point that the driving test regulations must be reviewed.  I am unhappy with our present hit and miss system.  From the statistics one will see that 50 per cent fail the test on the first occasion but pass it second time around. I would like to see a system introduced under which applicants for a driving test would have to demonstrate that they had taken a certain number of lessons from a registered driving instructor.  It would be a step in the right direction if applicants received a licence only after they had completed a certain number of driving lessons.  This would lead to an improvement in standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the provision in the Bill under which local authorities will be able to alter speed limits.  Those of us who are <Col N="913" /> members of local authorities, in particular county councils, have always found it difficult to accept and explain to our constituents the reasons local councillors do not have sufficient powers to alter a speed limit.  I have been a member of Cork County Council since 1985 and we have had only one opportunity since then to alter a speed limit in the county. The Minister's decision, therefore, to give us the authority to carry out that simple but important task will be welcomed by councillors all over the country. They know that they will have discretion within their own communities. This is welcome.</P>
    <P>The Bill also appears to give discretion to local authorities in relation to road signs, another welcome provision.  I would like those who design our road traffic signs to show more imagination. Most of the signs used today have not been changed for a long time and familiarity breeds contempt.  As people ignore most of our signs there is a need to make them more dramatic and eye catching.  I hope local authorities will use their discretion and introduce new signs and have them approved by the Department. Signs can be an effective extra road safety feature if they catch the eye.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, which will improve road safety and hopefully reduce the number of accidents on our roads, thereby ensuring that fewer people are killed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. B. O'Keeffe Mr. B. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation is very wide ranging.  In many ways it calls for a social revolution in terms of the attitude of Irish people to drink driving. The reduction in the permissible alcohol level from 100 milligrammes to 80 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood, with a corresponding reduction in the level for urine, is significant in view of the startling statistics in relation to road accidents, 35 per cent of which occurred between the hours of 9 p.m. and 3 a.m., an average of 400 deaths per year.  We have to be concerned about the trauma caused to the families of those who were killed.  It is incumbent <Col N="914" /> on the Minister and the Government to take these figures seriously.  When one considers that an additional 100,000 people have been maimed and badly injured in accidents, it is timely that the Minister has introduced this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister's proposals are laudable. Driving while under the influence of alcohol is a very serious crime which people in Ireland have tended to brush under the carpet&mdash;we seem to think that it is part of our culture and way of life.  In saying that, we tend to forget our responsibilities in this area.  For example, we tend to forget that a car driven by a person who is drunk is a lethal weapon. Anyone who has lost a loved one or had a member of family injured as a result of drunk driving will commend the Minister on the introduction of this Bill.</P>
      <P>This is not to say that the Bill will not have other consequences.  People who come from rural areas are very much aware that those who live in very remote areas visit the local bar, which could be two, three or four miles away, in order to socialise and meet other people.  This Bill will require those people to think twice before taking their car to the pub if they are going to drink.  It will be a culture shock for them.  Why has the Minister not decided to go a step further and ban drink driving altogether?  Those people may well surmise that under the law they can have either one pint or one and a half pints and at that stage they will have to use their discretion about whether to drink any more, but it gives them no discretion about whether they should drive.  While I welcome the reduction in the permissible alcohol level, I believe the Minister should have gone the whole hog and banned drink driving altogether.  I know this Bill is a major step forward, but I am of the view that drink and driving should be totally separated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The owners of rural pubs will look at this Bill with a jaundiced eye.  They may think that things were tight enough without this restructured legislation, which will add to their difficulties rather than help them.  However, people have <Col N="915" /> to look at this Bill in an objective way and consider the high number of deaths which have been caused by people driving under the influence of drink.  This Bill is only one of a series of measures which will have to be introduced by the Minister and his colleagues to tackle the drink driving problem.  Does the Minister have figures on the percentage of accidents between 9 p.m. and 3 a.m. which are directly related to drink driving?  There are people who will say that there is a greater possibility of an accident occurring at night-time than in the day time. For example, a person who gets up at 6 a.m. and drives a long distance will be tired returning home late at night and may nod off, thus causing an accident.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision which will require drivers to carry their driving licences at all times when driving a vehicle.  This requirement is not any different to the requirement that a person must have a ticket before getting on a train.  I ask the Minister to look at the laws governing the mandatory closing of pubs at certain hours during the day. If there are regulations in place which provide that a person may consume only a certain amount of alcohol before driving, what is the point in putting extra pressure on Garda resources in ensuring that pubs are closed at certain hours during the day?</P>
    <P>The Bill addressed to some extent the question of insurance.  It is fair to say that the cost of insurance for young drivers is a national disgrace.  I can think back to the time when we were told by the insurance federation that insurance premiums would be reduced if the jury system was done away with.  Having done that, premiums, instead of being reduced, continued to rise and the amount of awards increased by, I think, 25 per cent.  I am glad the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Brennan, has decided to look seriously at the cost of insurance.  I ask him to look in particular at the contentious interaction between insurance companies, the legal profession and the engineering profession. <Col N="916" /> There is a perception abroad that the administrative costs in the insurance industry are exceptionally high.</P>
    <P>There is plenty of evidence to suggest that the cost of medical witnesses&mdash;and as many as five or six medical personnel may be involved&mdash;as well as legal representation and engineering witnesses adds up and is a major factor in the cost of insurance.  It is not before time that we took a serious look at the industry to see how we can cut out unnecessary costs.  It is necessary also to examine the conduct of solicitors who approach individuals in hospital who have been involved in accidents of one type or another and say that they will handle the case and it will not cost anything; but they will take anything from 10 per cent to 20 per cent of an insurance award and the individual keeps the balance.  Obviously that is unprofessional conduct, but it is going on.  We are all concerned about it and it is time we faced up to it and ensured that something is done about it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the devolution of functions to local authority members.  In fact I advocated this for a number of years.  I always thought it extraordinary that when we wanted to set speed limits it often took five years before it was implemented, but when the function is devolved to local level at least the local authority in conjunction with the Garda Síochána will have the power to decide where the speed limits should be.  I suspect the danger is that we could have a proliferation of speed limits and the effect of that is that they could be honoured more in the breach than in fact. However, that is a matter for the local authorities.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore raised the question of different parking discs all over the country.  I certainly agree that there is a case to be made to standardise the parking discs throughout all local authority areas.  It is particularly galling for tourists who tend to travel throughout the country to find that they need a different parking disc for each area.  Surely the local authorities can come together to work out the unit cost of the parking discs and provide that they are interchangable in <Col N="917" /> any area throughout the country.  For example, there seems to be no reason that someone from Dublin cannot use his parking disc in Cork.  There is a <i>quid pro quo</i> and the other counties will benefit.</P>
    <P>Towards the end of his speech the Minister says:</P>
    <P>The impounding provisions are designed to give the Garda Síochána the powers they need to tackle both motor tax and motor insurance evaders ... The power to impound vehicles being driven by under-age drivers is specifically designed to help tackle the problem commonly known as joyriding and I have no doubt this will be particularly welcomed by the House.</P>
    <P>Members certainly will welcome anything that can be done to reduce the number of people involved in joyriding. However, how will this provision help in this case, given that the joyrider, generally speaking, will steal someone else's car?  Will the Minister clarify the benefit, if any, of impounding a stolen vehicle?</P>
    <P>This is an extremely important Bill and I give it my full support.  This Bill, in conjunction with other legislation to follow from other Ministers, will help to make us more conscious of our behaviour on the road and make us more aware of the need to be courteous and caring on the road.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much welcome this wide-ranging, comprehensive and integrated Bill, which strengthens our laws relating to drink-driving.  It introduces welcome measures for the enforcement of the Road Traffic Acts.  There has been a large measure of criticism and dissatisfaction with the enforcement of the Road Traffic Acts.  It is very welcome that this Bill strengthens the enforcement procedures.  I very much welcome the devolution of powers to the local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The genesis of this legislation was the setting up of a task force by the Progressive Democrats Party Leader, Deputy O'Malley, a long time ago to look into the whole matter of the cost of motor insurance.  Many of the recommendations <Col N="918" /> of that task force have been taken on board in this legislation.  This Bill was driven by economics, given the huge cost of road accidents, estimated at £600 million per annum.  It is important also that we as legislators are motivated by the overwhelming public policy need to concentrate on road safety and the prevention of death and serious injury on our roads.</P>
    <P>The number of deaths on our roads has decreased over the past couple of years. The decrease, though small, is welcome. A number of factors have contributed to this decrease, not least the intensive road safety campaigns mounted by the National Safety Council.  These campaigns have brought about an increased awareness of road safety as evidenced by the change in public attitude to drink driving, which is no longer seen as socially acceptable at any level in society. However, it is still acceptable to speed, and perhaps the thrust of our campaigns should concentrate equally on speeding. I think speed is just as much a killer and I do not think the social awareness of the consequences of speed is as well developed as it is for drink driving.</P>
    <P>The number of road deaths is still too high, with an average of eight people dying on Irish roads every week.  We need to do much more work both in preventive engineering, that is, intervening in the planning of our roads and in the education field.  Half of those who die in the age group seven-24 die as a result of road accidents.  Those are startling figures and everybody needs to be very concerned that so many of our young people end up dying on our roads.</P>
    <P>It is important to appreciate that the Irish Insurance Federation has been sponsoring the National Safety Council's campaigns and they very generously have given £650,000 to the 1993 campaign in addition to the £248,000 given towards the promotional work of the National Safety Council.  I am a member of the Dublin Road Safety Council, an excellent committee comprised of elected members of Dublin Corporation and representative of the motor industry, the Insurance Federation and others.  We <Col N="919" /> have a common interest in preventing road accidents and devising safety campaigns for the Dublin Corporation area.  I believe three other local authorities have such councils which specifically target their own local areas with a view to preventing road accidents.  I think it would be a good idea to establish such a council in each local authority area.  for example, we initiate campaigns on safe cycling and pedestrian safety and we run a traffic school in Clontarf for children.</P>
    <P>It is right to teach children of primary school level how to get about and weave their way through traffic.  Our committee has been substantially improved by the very valuable contribution of Dr. Ray Fuller, Head of the Department of Psychology in Trinity College.  He is making an excellent psychological input and educating us on the need for an evaluation of safety campaigns and methods which could be used to change attitudes.</P>
    <P>Road safety in the context of child safety is an important political issue, particularly in urban centres.  Many people in Dublin South East&mdash;where I am a local authority member&mdash;and in my constituency of Dublin South have been politicised by the growing dissatisfaction at the level of commuter and freight traffic going through residential estates.  The most frequent reason people contact me as their political representative is in relation to traffic management. The quality of people's lives is diminished because traffic management in Dublin city is at crisis point.  Because of that the Dublin Transportation Initiative was set up by the local authority committee of which I am a member.  This is an excellent initiative and we have just completed our final report of phase I.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Transportation Initiative seeks to establish a vision of the city and to study the area of transportation and land use policy.  In the past our planning and transportation policies were not synchronised which meant that the roads policy was not integrated with planning.  That is why there is a chaotic traffic problem, particularly in Dublin city.  The neglect of public transport services down through the years has given <Col N="920" /> rise to the need for the Dublin Transportation Initiative which comes down very firmly in favour of moving priority from the use of the private motor car and enhancing public transport by way of quality bus corridors and light rail. Planners and road engineers need to be integrated with a view to the final report of the DTI becoming part of our national development plan.  I see light at the end of the tunnel in terms of transportation and planning in the greater Dublin area.</P>
    <P>Port access in Dublin is vital, many proposals for which&mdash;including a tunnel under the Liffey&mdash;are being put forward. That is preferable to the now discredited eastern by-pass.  Of course, the completion of the C ring is vital.  These matters have considerably diminished the quality of people's lives in Dublin city and county.  There has been a positive chorus of requests in my constituency for traffic &ldquo;calming&rdquo;&mdash;which is now the buzz word.  Basically, people are crying out for ramps or anything that will relieve the sense of frustration because their residential roads are no longer safe for their children.  As politicians we should take an interest in the quality of people's lives. If people are happy they are better parents and better citizens.  This is particularly so in areas of high social deprivation.  If we had good, cheap public transport for areas of high density population, the quality of life would be substantially improved with a resultant decrease in crime and family stress.  All these issues are related and, therefore, we need to have a broad approach to matters such as public transport.</P>
    <P>The fact that local authorities have so little money to spend on pedestrian crossings is a constant source of annoyance. The annual budget allocated to Dublin Corporation for the provision of pedestrian crossings is scandalous, enabling us to complete only a couple of schemes each year.  In the context of DTI and traffic management proposals, I hope some mechanism will be found for funding local authorities to provide better pedestrian facilities.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Environmental <Col N="921" /> Research Unit who have carried out excellent surveys on driver attitudes, speeding, drink driving, etc.  Their 1992 survey showed up interesting attitudinal facts.  For example, 54 per cent of drivers correctly stated that the general speed limit was 55 miles per hour; 30 per cent believed the limit was higher than 55 miles per hour and 12 per cent believed it was less.  This is an area of confusion as many people do not know the speed limit.</P>
    <P>In regard to drink driving, over half the drivers interviewed said that having consumed up to two alcoholic drinks they would drive, indeed, almost a quarter said they always did.  Since this Bill reduces the level of alcohol permitted we will have to make it clear just how many drinks people can take.  That will have to be part of the public awareness campaign. As the number of drinks consumed increased the proportion of people who were willing to drive decreased, although one fifth of motorists surveyed would drive after consuming more than two drinks.  Even in the most extreme scenario 4 per cent of motorists said they would drive after consuming over six alcoholic drinks; 4 per cent is still enough to do a lot of damage on the roads.</P>
    <P>Further analysis of the research findings showed that males and those with the longest driving experience were most likely to risk driving after consuming large quantities of alcohol.  By comparison the survey showed that those least likely to risk drink driving were young drivers in the 17 to 20 age group and female drivers.</P>
    <P>In respect of the largest number of drinks consumed before driving, 6 per cent admitted to six pints or more; 5 per cent admitted to five pints; 6 per cent admitted to consuming four pints and 59 per cent admitted to consuming three pints.  This suggests that approximately 30 per cent of drivers admit to driving on some occasions with blood alcohol levels which are probably in excess of the legal limit.  Three-quarters of the drivers interviewed believed that someone convicted of driving with a blood alcohol level over <Col N="922" /> the legal limit would face disqualification. This ties in with their perception that the most effective deterrent for drink driving would be the risk of losing their driving licence.  The research showed that the threat of disqualification was a greater deterrent than the risk of being involved in an accident.  For that reason I welcome the mandatory disqualification of one year for first offences.</P>
    <P>The following startling statistic was brought to my attention by the Dublin Road Safety Council; in 1991 males accounted for 96 per cent of drink driving convictions while females accounted for 4 per cent.  At that time I asked the commissioner if he could account for the difference. With a high percentage of female drivers in the State it is extraordinary that 96 per cent of the drink driving convictions should be males. Could it be that women are more responsible or is the Garda more lenient towards women in not asking them to be breathalysed?</P>
    <P>I should like to see the development and implementation of rehabilitation courses for drink driving offenders.  That provision should be stitched into the present legislation which requires the taking of a driving test before a driving licence is restored.  Development and evaluation of a driver training component, which includes risk assessment skills, would be useful.  We will be tabling amendments to the Bill but, in general, we welcome it and look forward to Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies who contributed to an open and interesting debate on this important legislation.  I listened with great attention and I will endeavour to respond as positively and constructively as possible.  The main policy issues in the Bill have been well aired.  In responding, I intend to deal with the main themes running through the debate and to clarify as many of the specific issues as possible.  In the time available it would be impossible to deal in detail with all aspects of the Bill. However, I hope to tease out the finer points of the legislation on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased that there is a broad level of agreement in the House on the general thrust of the Bill.  While there may be divided opinions on points of detail, there seems to be a consensus that drink driving laws need to be updated and strengthened. There is a broad level of support for greater enforcement of the laws and widespread support for the concept of <Col N="924" /> devolving more power to local authorities. That level of agreement is welcome and augurs well for the debate on the remaining Stages of the Bill.  We hope to take Committee Stage in the week commencing 12 July and to conclude it the following week.  In the meantime, in those three to four weeks, between 30 and 40 people will die on our roads, the sense of urgency we attempted to bring to this debate is heightened by that unacceptable realisation.  I hope when we conclude Committee Stage we will be able to move towards implementation and enforcement of the provisions of this Bill as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Deputies Doyle and Keogh suggested there was a delay in finalising this Bill and that it should have been published last year.  When I became Minister for the Environment at the beginning of 1992 I quickly finalised proposals for new road traffic legislation.  At that time, it was my intention to confine the Bill to drink driving and general enforcement measures.  During the year I identified other key areas which I decided also required urgent change and I expanded the scope of the Bill.  The end result is a significant programme of devolution of power to local authorities and a new basis for more effective administration of traffic management measures.  I have already assured Deputy Doyle that I intend to be a reforming Minister, she has doubts in that regard which I hope to dispel as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I will respond to some comments made about the drink driving aspects of the Bill.  In my opening contribution I outlined in detail the reasons for the measures and, therefore, there is no need to repeat them.  Many Deputies raised the question of the proposed limits.  Some Deputies queried why the level was reduced from 100 to 80 milligrammes. Deputy Doyle mentioned a level of 50 milligrammes but then spoke of a phased implementation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Phased penalties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore queried the rationale behind the limit of 80 milligrammes. <Col N="925" /> There is no doubt that the existing limit should be reduced. However, it is almost impossible to reach a consensus on the correct statutory maximum level of alcohol permissible for drivers.  Some people argue that the existing level is adequate; more say that the limit should be lower&mdash;that it should be 50 milligrammes&mdash;while others suggest a zero limit.</P>
      <P>The most important point is that there is no safe limit.  It is international practice to set a statutory maximum limit beyond which an offence is committed, with very high penalties for non-compliance while at the same time, through educational and publicity programmes, conveying a strong message that drinking and driving do not mix.  In recent road safety campaigns, the message stressed to drivers was&mdash;and will continue to be&mdash;&ldquo;if you drink don't drive&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The maximum permissible blood alcohol level for drivers in most European countries is 80 milligrammes.  The Government decided that the limit in Ireland should be brought into line with the majority of EC member states.  This limit will be kept under review and, if changes are desirable, or if there is EC agreement on a different standard limit in all member states, there is a mechanism in the Bill which will permit the limit to be varied by way of regulations. Any such regulations will, of course, require the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies are well aware that small quantities of alcohol can impair a driver's concentration.  Factors such as fatigue, illness, stress and drugs can exacerbate the effects and cause severe concentration loss, even when a small quantity is consumed.  When blood alcohol levels exceed 80 milligrammes the normal reaction is overestimation of ability.  A recent report commissioned in the United States highlighted that when 100 milligrammes is compared with a zero limit, the risk factor is doubled and rises dramatically above that level.  Therefore, there is no argument for reducing the limit.  When blood alcohol levels exceed 80 milligrammes, there is impairment of <Col N="926" /> peripheral vision and of the eye's reaction to light and dark.  Judgment of distance and speed of oncoming vehicles, impairment of ability to react and a tendency to take risks also arise.  Many Deputies asked me to specify how much drink one can consume.  Taking those facts into account, it is not possible to give an accurate reply because too many varying factors are involved.</P>
    <P>Deputies Doyle, Keogh and Gilmore referred to the necessity for strict enforcement of road traffic legislation, I accept that is vital to the success of the provisions of this Bill.  During the past two to three years there has been increased Garda activity in road traffic law enforcement generally and considerable additional resources have been made available to the Garda traffic corps. My colleague, the Minister for Justice, has assured me she will continue to provide the Garda with the necessary resources and back-up facilities in an effort to make roads safer.  While road traffic enforcement is an all-year-round effort, regular intensive campaigns will continue to ensure, in particular, that the momentum of anti-drink driving campaigns is maintained.</P>
    <P>In regard to Deputy Keogh's query about rear window lights which were prohibited at one stage, I changed the regulations in that area last year.  Such lights are now permissible.  The use of seat belts for children and rear seat belts is not mandatory.  It is desirable that cyclists should wear helmets but, it is not mandatory but I will encourage their use.</P>
    <P>Deputies Doyle, Gilmore and Briscoe referred to a stricter enforcement of the speed limit requirement.  We all accept that speed is a major cause of road traffic accidents and a variety of measures have been taken to deal with this.  The major road safety campaign which I referred to in my opening contribution has targeted speed as one of the elements of driver behaviour to be eliminated.  The Garda Síochána are acutely aware of the need to tackle the problem and new initiatives have been taken in recent years.  The use of in-car video units has proved most successful elsewhere in Europe in combating <Col N="927" /> reckless speeding.  Late in 1991 the Garda traffic corps took delivery of three such units which were immediately installed in unmarked patrol cars.  The video units allow the Garda to film breaches of the speed limits as they occur and record the actual speed of the vehicle in question on the screen.  The film can then be played in court to facilitate prosecution. In addition, six units came into operation in 1992 making a total of nine. A further six units have now been acquired and these will come into operation in 1993.  An additional 30 state of the art radar speed guns were acquired by the traffic corps in 1991.  This brings the number of speed detection devices available to the Garda to nearly 300.  The speed guns are used in all areas of the country and are extremely effective in detecting breaches of the speed limits on all roads and in particular on national and primary routes.  I accept the point that speed, where drink is not involved, is one of the major contributing factors to accidents and in consultation with my colleague, the Minister for Justice, I will continue to ensure the provision of the necessary resources to convict those who take such terrible risks and cause such carnage on our roads.</P>
    <P>In July 1992 I introduced a comprehensive new structure for speed limits in this country.  I had noted the unsatisfactory position which existed in regard to observance of the existing limits and decided that a more realistic structure which took full account of safety and environmental considerations should be introduced.  This new structure brings us more into line with the position in the rest of the European Community.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy referred to local authorities and the resources collected by way of road tax and said that these should be fully available for expenditure on roads by local authorities.  This, of course, would have the effect of reducing the amount of resources available to local authorities because the total amount available exceeds that collected in road tax.  There is of course the overriding principle of not dedicating resources <Col N="928" /> exclusively in the areas in which they are raised because education, social welfare, health and many other essential services would not have anyting like the same resources if we did not adhere to that principle.</P>
    <P>The format of the driving licences was referred to and since we have very little time I will just display the new driving licence which is easy to carry and causes no inconvenience.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bradford referred to the standard of driving tests.  Our tests fully accord with the current EC directive on this subject.  Certain changes will need to be introduced by July 1996 in order to comply with the new directive which will be effective from that date.  The principle change relates to the knowledge test, which will need to be expanded and broadened, and consideration is being given at present to how best to provide for this.  Certain other changes in relation to the practical driving test must also be provided for.</P>
    <P>The use of mobile telephones in cars was raised by several Deputies, including Deputies Deasy, O'Sullivan and Briscoe. This is covered by the general requirement on drivers to drive with due care and attention contained in section 52 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961.  Breaches of the section attract penalties of up to £350 in fines and three months imprisonment. I have no plans to make regulations specifically to deal with the matter.  I am satisfied that this requirement is a sufficient deterrent.</P>
    <P>On the side of the driver education, the most recent edition of the <i>Rules of the Road</i> has incorporated advice to drivers to find a safe place to stop before using a car phone.  In addition, on my Department's initiative Bord Telecom now incorporates on its bills to mobile phone customers a prominent notice reminding users not to driver while using the phone.</P>
    <P>I would like to specifically refer to the role envisaged under this Bill for elected members of local authorities.  The main objective in pressing forward with devolution proposals is to place local government in a position where it has the <Col N="929" /> freedom, the discretion and the autonomy to tackle matters of local concern. This Bill has identified important areas of road traffic law in which that freedom and autonomy is to be developed.  Specific care is being taken to maximise the role of elected members.  They will take key decisions under the new devolution arrangements.  The elected members of a local authority will decide the speed limits to apply to roads in their areas. They will take decisions on parking controls under section 36 of the Bill.  They will have reserve power in relation to the most important traffic management measures.  The measures are a significant boost to local democracy and I am confident they will lead to more effective and efficient administration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Sir, <Col N="930" /> for the opportunity to raise this important matter here today.  From the very beginning the performance of the successive Governments responsible for negotiating Ireland's Structural Fund allocation under the Delors II package has been a tale of gullibility, ineptitude and downright dishonesty.  It is worth briefly recapping.</P>
      <P>The saga began in the lead-up to and at the Maastricht Summit where, allegedly to ovecome some Spanish opposition, the Taoiseach was taken aside with the other three so-called &ldquo;cohesion&rdquo; countries and given a peep at what Mr. Jacques Delors would be proposing in his second Community budgetary package. This was interpreted to mean that Ireland's receipts from the Structural Funds would be doubled in 1997 compared to 1992, that is, £1.8 billion compared to £0.9 billion, and that over the five year period to 1997 Ireland would receive a total of 7.8 billion ECU, that is, £6.25 billion at today's exchange rate. Thus was the £6 billion myth born, which in the following six months in the lead-up to the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty was hawked around Ireland by the four largest parties here in their campaign for a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote.  At the appropriate moment the twin oracles, Delors and MacSharry, were invited over, each of whom confirmed that the £6 billion was in the pipeline, provided of course that we voted &ldquo;yes&rdquo; in sufficient numbers. Those of us who challenged this version were labelled unpatriotic, or worse.  In the crude terms in which the &ldquo;yes&rdquo; campaign was conducted, a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote was worth two loaves where a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote earned no bread at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the referendum out of the way and a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote safely in the bag, the ground was gradually prepared for a climbdown.  The Lisbon Summit failed to reach agreement on a drastically reduced version of Delors II, which left the initiative up to the UK Government, whose Edinburgh Summit was charged with reaching agreement.  Here another myth was born and, apparently on the strength of a chat between two civil servants over a cup of coffee, the Taoiseach, Deputy <Col N="931" /> Reynolds, claimed that after a tough fight he had achieved a great victory by winning £8 billion over the seven year period 1993-1999.  The political and news media establishment who had been so enthusiastic in promoting the &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote in June conveniently chose not to make any unfavourable comparisons with the cast iron promises which were very much a crucial part of the &ldquo;yes&rdquo; campaign six months previously.  Even now it is not too late to show up the difference.  By the crucial year 1997 when receipts are supposed to have doubled, the Edinburgh £8 billion package will yield approximately £1.3 billion compared to £1.8 billion guaranteed during the referendum by MacSharry and Delors and 90 per cent of the Deputies in this House. It would seem that if the votes are in the bag, what is half a billion pounds per year between friends.  Now even that balloon is beginning to lose air and given that it is difficult to cut the allocation to Portugal and Greece the implications for Ireland are obvious and serious.</P>
    <P>Now as everybody starts to run for cover and shift the blame, journalists who could not previously get a quote are being briefed at the drop of a hat.  One version is that it was all nailed down by the Taoiseach at Edinburgh and that it is now up to the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, with Commissioner Flynn as his inside man, to do the easy part and bring home the money.  Clearly neither the Tánaiste nor Commissioner Flynn are too happy with that scenario.  Meanwhile anybody in Brussels who is prepared to listen is being assured that for six months now the Commission has been telling Irish Ministers that there never was an £8 billion deal and to scale down expectations.</P>
    <P>It has even reached the pathetic stage where the Commissioner and Commission official responsible, are dispatched to Madrid to intercede with Felipe Gonzalez and perhaps allow a few extra pounds to be allocated to Ireland. How low can we sink?</P>
    <P>If it was not so serious and degrading it might be funny.  Our economic and fiscal policy has been made dependent <Col N="932" /> on receiving the £8.6 billion allegedly promised at Edinburgh.  Not content with misleading, even lying to, the electorate at the time of the referendum 12 months ago, it now seems that even the inferior Edinburgh package is melting away.  As usual, the price will not be paid by anybody in, or associated with, the golden circle&mdash;rather the effect will be felt in more health and social welfare cuts, and by lack of investment in education, training and the upgrading of our technological capacity on which wealth and job creation substantially depend.</P>
    <P>It is time for the Taoiseach to come clean.  We need to know exactly what undertakings were received with regard to Structural Funding at the Edinburgh Summits.  We need to know what discussions took place and who was involved in those discussions which led the Taoiseach to proclaim that he had £8 billion pounds in the bag.  We need to know what advice, if any, was received at that time and immediately following, from Commissioner MacSharry.  It would also be useful if Mr. MacSharry would explain what caused his pre-referendum confidence to evaporate so quickly.  We need to know, in view of previous experiences, why whatever assurances were received in Edinburgh were not obtained formally or at least written into the record of Commission business as the Spaniards apparently did.</P>
    <P>We need to know what communications, if any, there have been from the Commission suggesting that the £8 billion deal proclaimed was not assured and would probably not be met.  We need to know what efforts are now being made to ensure that something is rescued from this fiasco.</P>
    <P>Finally, we need to know whether the Taoiseach, and his Ministers responsible, will take the honourable course and resign if we fail to obtain the full moneys promised at Edinburgh.</P>

      <P>The European Council at Edinburgh in December 1992, in its programme of future financing for the Community, not only <Col N="933" /> increased the amounts to be spent on Structural Actions, but also specified:</P>
      <P>expenditure on Structural Actions should be concentrated on the least prosperous member states, outermost regions and rural areas of the Community in accordance with Article 130A of the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
      <P>It set aside an amount of 85 billion ECUs for the four Cohesion countries, for the period 1993 to 1999.  Part of this&mdash;somewhat over 15 billion ECUs&mdash;was for the new Cohesion Fund.  This fund has already been put into operation, on time, by a decision taken at the General Affairs Council in March.  Our share of this will amount to over £1 billion.</P>
      <P>The Structural Funds regulations for the period after 1 January 1994 must now be settled.  This debate is under way at present and as the current round of Structural Funds runs out at the end of the year the new regulations should be in place in good time before then.</P>
      <P>In line with the undertakings which the Taoiseach received in Edinburgh, Ireland submitted, in May, detailed objective indicators to the EC Commission, justifying the maintenance of our share of the funds for the Objective 1 Regions of the four Cohesion member states.  These criteria, which follow from the Edinburgh Conclusions, include not just income per head, but peripherality, unemployment and long term unemployment, migration, rural disadvantage and other factors.</P>
      <P>The emphasis on peripherality is important.  Two regions could have the same income per head, but one could for example, be more peripheral and face correspondingly greater difficulties requiring a higher level of funds.</P>
      <P>There have of course been leaks or reports, of a selective nature in recent weeks about the views of some as to the share Ireland will actually get.  These are not new.  From our direct contacts with the Commission at the highest level we know that they do not represent the official Commission position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure the House that the Government is pursuing the question of <Col N="934" /> our share of the funds in the firmest way, to ensure that we get an outcome in line with the Edinburgh Conclusions.  It is not surprising that others should put their positions too.  It is for us to put our case, which we are doing, and will continue to do.  I have every confidence of success.</P>
    <P>The regulations that will be coming before the Council tomorrow deal with the implementation of the Structural Funds.  They include two general regulations: the Framework Regulation and the Co-ordination Regulation, as well as separate regulations on the three funds: the Regional Fund, the Social Fund, and the Guidance part of the Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund.  In addition, there is a Finance Instrument on fisheries.</P>
    <P>The Council meeting tomorrow, which will be attended by the Tánaiste and myself, will not finally adopt these regulations. When the Council completes its consideration, the European Parliament will have to examine them again before the Council finally takes the decision to adopt the legislation.  The texts of the regulations contain many of the improvements foreseen by Edinburgh and by the Maastricht Treaty.  Among these, I might mention that the rate of Community funding in the Cohesion countries may be increased to 80 per cent in some instances, so as to reduce the requirement for matching national funding.</P>
    <P>In addition, the funds will be more flexible in that they will be available for a wider range of actions, in particular in the areas of training.</P>
    <P>There are many aspects of the regulations that are still of concern to other member states, who may not yet be in a position to agree on the texts of the regulations.  For example, the question of the designation of Objective 1 regions, outside the Cohesion countries, still has to be settled, as has the procedure for designating Objective 2 and 5b regions, outside Objective 1 regions.</P>
    <P>The texts of the regulations do not set out the allocations for the various regions.  However, this is such an important issue for Ireland that we would naturally insist on being satisfied with regard <Col N="935" /> to it before the regulations could be adopted.</P>
    <P>The adoption of the regulations will require the agreement of Ireland.  This is because the key regulation, the Framework Regulation, must be adopted by unanimous vote under Article 130D of the Treaty.  The question of availing of the Luxembourg compromise to hold up agreement does not therefore arise. Ireland's vote is required to allow the regulation to be adopted.</P>
    <P>The situation therefore is that we have a clear commitment at Edinburgh to give increased concentration of funds for structural purposes in the four Cohesion countries.  The rate of increase for all of these must therefore be significantly higher than the rate of increases for regions outside these.  The Copenhagen European Council confirmed that the Edinburgh principles should be respected.  We are confident that we will achieve our share.</P>
    <P>The House can be assured that the Government will continue to negotiate firmly, that all necessary steps are being taken to ensure that the negotiations are successful and that Ireland gets an allocation of £8 billion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>During the recent heavy rains the canal operated by the Office of Public Works at Kilmore, County Wexford, flooded.  The surrounding land is below sea level.  Although four pumps were available only one was operated on the night in question.  Resulting from this gross negligence large tracts of farmland in the Kilmore-Bridgetown area were flooded.  Following the rain storms, one farmer found his 11 acre field of potatoes <Col N="936" /> under three feet of water, and this happened in free-draining soil.</P>
      <P>The early potato crop, which is the mainstay of local agriculture, was destroyed.  Grassland and other horticultural interests suffered badly.  Farmland in the district is fertile and well farmed. Families working the land, like farmers everywhere, have suffered the difficulties of recent times.  They certainly did not need the gross negligence of the Office of Public Works to add to their burdens. In time the grasslands in the area will recover, but the potato and vegetable crops are lost forever.  As I speak, farming families are wondering what they will say to their bank managers and other creditors.  Heavy liabilities have already been incurred, unbearable in certain instances.  In more than one case the penny-pinching refusal of the Office of Public Works to turn on the three remaining pumps on that fateful night will be responsible for these families leaving the land.</P>
      <P>The State has a moral obligation to compensate for this negligence.  I plead with the Minister to follow the right course in this matter.  The State's bureaucracy is frustrating the rights of citizens and is costing them dearly in terms of time and money.  The Minister should be aware&mdash;and legal precedents have shown this&mdash;that such a course of action leads only to huge legal bills, the costs of which must be borne by the State. In particular, I refer to the Rowe case. The case for compensation for farmers in the Kilmore/Bridgetown area is clear and straightforward.  It is based on morality and the law.  In case the former does not impress the Minister, I will state the latter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Rowe case involved similar damage from the same system.  A 12 acre field of carrots was destroyed.  The case, which commenced in 1983, dragged on until 1991, when it was settled on its second day in court.  Substantial damages, in addition to enormous costs, were paid.  I understand the total bill was approximately £150,000.  We must pay <Col N="937" /> the farmers what they are owed and let the lawyers sing for their supper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I support my colleague, Deputy Byrne, in the case he has made for the farmers and people living in the Kilmore/Kilmore Quay area of County Wexford.  The area concerned is part of the Ballyteigue/Kilmore arterial drainage scheme that was developed between 1959 and 1961.  At the time the 2,300 acres were drained by the deepening of channels and the installation of electrical automated pumps.  These pumps are triggered when the water level reaches a certain point.  Quite frankly, they are now out of date and are incapable of taking flood water such as we had over the last couple of months.</P>
      <P>In supporting the case for damage and compensation for the potato farmers and, indeed, the grassland and dry stock farmers in this area, we must also remember the many families on the periphery of this area who suffered severe flooding for weeks.  They include the Sinnotts, the Rossiters, the Bates and the Winters, all residing from Sarshill to the Grange area of Kilmore, and indeed many more.  In addition to calling on the Office of Public Works to stand by the local people, who through its negligence have now lost a serious portion of their annual income for this year, we should also compliment Wexford County Council for the work now in train in relation to cleaning the drains in the area adjacent to the arterial drainage scheme.  The run-off from county council roads and drains exacerbated the problem of the natural flooding of this 2,300 acres, which is below sea level.  We now need the combination of proper action between the Office of Public Works and Wexford County Council.  This 2,300 acres of the Ballyteigue/Kilmore scheme is the direct responsibility of the Office of Public Works.  I support my colleague, Deputy Byrne, in calling on the Office of Public Works to immediately provide, through the Government, the necessary compensation for those farmers and households whose income and living areas have been destroyed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="938" /> I would like confirmation also that the sea defences in this area are being properly maintained.  I would like the Minister to place on the record that the sea defences are presently maintained in such a state that there is absolutely no risk to those living or working on the farmland behind these sea defences, which, as I said, is below sea level.  This would allay the fears of people in that area.</P>
    <P>Is the maintenance of the scheme sufficient in the area?  Is the subhead Vote from the Office of Public Works sufficient? It is the same as it has been for many years; it has not been increased or inflation indexed.  The scheme is now out of date.  It is over 30 years old and has had no major capital investment over that time.  It now requires a complete overhaul with the provision of modern, larger pumps capable of coping with a larger volume of water.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the passage of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, the Ballyteigue/Kilmore catchment in County Wexford was included at No. 2 on the priority list of minor rivers then established and on which, in conjunction with a corresponding list of major rivers, the national arterial drainage programme has since been based.  A scheme for the catchment designed to confer benefit on some 2,300 acres of agricultural land was carried out by the Commissioners of Public Works on the river between 1959 and 1961.</P>
      <P>Though not unique, the Ballyteigue/ Kilmore scheme is unusual in that two distinct drainage systems are employed.  Upland regions are drained by gravity through an embankment channel system.  The low lying area has frontal sea defences and all of the waters from these lands are pumped out to sea.  The main pumphouse is situated at Cull at the outfall of a very wide channel which, presumably, is the canal to which the Deputies refer.  This pumphouse contains four pumps which are capable of dealing with flows from normal rainfalls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While no scheme is capable of giving complete protection from flooding because of economic constraints the <Col N="939" /> scheme as designed generally provides adequate drainage for grazing and tillage. With exceptional rainfall, such as occurred in May and June of this year, some flooding is inevitable.  However, the standard of maintenance carried out by the commissioners and the pumping arrangements are such as to minimise the extent and duration of any flooding which may occur.</P>
    <P>The commissioners are aware of the need for care and attention in the management and operation of this scheme and are satisfied that these requirements are fully complied with.  The specific details raised by Deputy Byrne and Deputy Doyle will be passed on to my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Dempsey.  I will request him to examine the matter and report back directly to the Deputies.</P>

      <P>Although these allegations were made on 20 May last, I decided not to raise this matter in the House because the case was adjourned until last Monday.  As the case has now been disposed of I availed of the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment this evening.  Because the Adjournment Debates commenced at midnight for the last two nights, this has been my first opportunity to raise this matter following the disposal of the case in the Dublin District Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this drink driving case came before the Dublin District Court for the second occasion it had to be adjourned because the investigating garda, who was the prosecuting garda, from Donnybrook Garda station, said: &ldquo;Summonses keep disappearing in connection with these charges.  Somebody has been interfering with this case internally.&rdquo; I regard that as a very serious matter.  It is important in <Col N="940" /> the enforcement of our laws, particularly in regard to the enforcement of our criminal law, that we have a fair and equitable system.  The establishment of the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions under the 1974 Act was done not just to streamline the way we deal with prosecution but in order to have an independent office holder.  Under section 6 of the Act, it is an offence for any person to communicate in any way or to seek to influence the Director in the taking of a prosecution or in the proceeding with or dropping of charges.  That office has worked extremely well.</P>
    <P>However, I was very disturbed to read the comments of the investigating garda. It is interesting that counsel for the defence in this case sought to have the case dismissed last Monday on the basis that there was a long delay between the initial complaint and the hearing of the case.  Obviously, there was a long delay because on two occasions the case had to be adjourned due to the fact that the summonses, although they had been served, were not available to be proceeded with.  It is important not just in terms of this case but of the legislation that is going through the House this week that no citizen, regardless of how influential he or she might be, should escape the full rigours of the law.</P>
    <P>The person involved in this case suffered a dreadful ordeal and I do not wish to make it more difficult, but the gardaí involved were extremely upset at what they perceived to be happening.  If there is a simple explanation I would like to hear it from the Minister.  I would also like an answer to a number of questions. Did the Garda Commissioner carry out an inquiry as to the truth or otherwise of the allegations made by the garda involved and, if so, what was the result? Was there interference on the part of the gardaí or at district court level?  I accept that names cannot be mentioned in this case and I do not wish to do so, but would the Minister accept that had Judge Thelma King not re-entered the summonses the case could not have proceeded last Monday?  I compliment the judge, but this case should not have involved the judge having to re-enter the summonses.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="941" /> Interference with prosecution has serious implications for the enforcement of law and order.  There is a view that we are not fair and impartial in enforcing the law in that there is one law for one section of the community and that others in a different strata of society escape the law. That should not be the case and the Minister should be clear on this matter.  If the garda's allegations were not correct, the Minister should say so.  The Garda Commissioner has used no opportunity since 20 May to deny the allegations made by the prosecuting garda in this case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The best way to respond is to set out clearly and comprehensively what happened in this case stage by stage.  The person in question was arrested under the Road Traffic Acts on 20 May 1992 and the prosecuting garda subsequently completed a summons application in the usual manner.  However, the application was not processed and the prosecuting garda reapplied for a summons in the first week of August 1992.  This application was processed and the case was listed for hearing on 25 February 1993.  However, the gardaí were unable to serve the summons. On 3 March the Director of Public Prosecutions directed that the summons be reissued.  This was done and the case was listed for hearing in court on 26 March.  Over the course of several weeks gardaí made a number of further attempts to serve the summons but were unsuccessful as the person in question was apparently away from home.  As a result it was necessary to again reissue the summons and the case was listed for hearing in court on 20 May.  This summons was successfully served by the gardaí and the case accordingly came to court on 20 May 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the hearing, the judge asked the prosecuting garda about the late entry of the summons.  In response the garda expressed concern about the manner in which the case had been processed.  On hearing the garda's submission the judge decided to adjourn the case to 28 June, and it was subsequently heard on that date.  The court imposed a fine of £100, the person's driving licence was endorsed <Col N="942" /> and she was disqualified from driving for 12 months.</P>
    <P>An investigation ordered by the Garda Commissioner following the reports of the prosecuting garda's comments at the court hearing on 20 May found no evidence to show there was a deliberate attempt to frustrate prosecution in this case.  In regard to the original summons application, no explanation can be established for its disappearance.  In this regard it is important to note that the removal of such a form would be in no way a bar to prosecution, as is illustrated by subsequent developments in the case.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Harney that regardless of who someone is or who they happen to know in any walk of life, if they are involved in crime, are arrested by a garda or are summonsed to appear in court they must face the full rigours of the law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his presence tonight and I regret having to drag him in here to deal with this matter.  The issue has now reached crisis point as Kerry County Council proposes to close Ballinaghar Bridge shortly and the local people are very concerned about that decision.  Ballinaghar Bridge over the river Brick is in extremely poor structural condition.  The bridge which was erected in four spans is 25 feet long and is supported by five pairs of tubular steel piles driven into the river bed and filled with concrete.  The quality of the concrete in the deck is extremely poor and the steel troughing on which it sits is in very poor condition, is very rusted and has collapsed in a number of places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The saga of Ballinaghar Bridge has been going on for some time.  In January 1955 a resolution was passed by Kerry County Council that plans be prepared for a new bride at Ballinaghar.  On 6 July 1970 a preliminary report was received and the estimated cost of providing a new bridge then was £62,500, which was considered too expensive.  In May 1975 Kerry County Council agreed to finalise plans for a new bridge.  The consultant engineer was instructed to proceed with the preparation of a full set of documents. <Col N="943" /> On 23 February 1977 the county secretary was instructed to submit documents to the Department of the Environment for sanction.  In February 1978 an estimate of £202,000 was submitted for the all-in cost of a new bridge.  On 22 February the Department of the Environment replied to Kerry County Council stating that even though the existing bridge was in an extremely dangerous condition the road was not of sufficient importance to warrant the provision of a new bridge.</P>
    <P>A suggestion was then made to provide a Bailey bridge at a cost of about £32,000. In March 1980 a loan of £190,000 was applied for to the Department but the application was rejected.  This has been a saga of promises and commitments but no action has been taken.  More than 200 plot holders who use Ballinaghar bog will be affected as most of them come from the Ballyduff side of the bridge.  Closure of the bridge will mean a 15 mile round trip for most of these people, some of whom have no transport and still use the old reliable donkey and cart or horse and cart.  A number of farmers who have land on both sides of the bridge will be considerably inconvenienced by closure of the bridge and management of their farms will be seriously interfered with. The area between Lixnaw and Ballyduff is an important tourist route.  Close by at Rattoo is the only round tower in Kerry which attracts a large number of tourists during the summer months.</P>
    <P>A proposal was put forward that Kerry County Council purchase a Bailey bridge and this seems to be the most feasible solution as a new bridge could cost in the region of £750,000.  Kerry County Council has in stock a section of Bailey bridging spanning about 60 feet. However, in the case of Ballinaghar Bridge a span of 125 feet is needed.  At a cost of about £100,000 Kerry County Council could provide a Bailey bridge which would ensure access from both sides.  I would like the Minister to respond to a request for a grant from the Department for a Bailey bridge to overcome this serious problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>Kerry County Council notified my Department on 1 June that they were proposing to close Ballinaghar bridge until further notice, using powers conferred under section 35 of the Local Government Act, 1955.  Under the Temporary Closing of Roads Regulations, 1956, local authorities are obliged to inform the Minister for the Environment when making use of these powers.  I have the power to annul that proposal but because of the risk involved I would not contemplate taking any such action.</P>
      <P>The road in question is the primary responsibility of the local authority.  It is an non-national road and the question of repair, maintenance or the provision of bridges on these roads are the clear responsibility of the local authority; but the resources available to the local authority are supplemented by discretionary grant.  The total grant to Kerry County Council was just less than £3 million for non-national roads in 1993.  Of that, £250,000 was a supplementary element for improvement works.  I allocate all the grants available to me at the beginning of the year, so I do not have funds available to contemplate this work at this time.</P>
      <P>I informed the local authority in the memorandum on road grants issued earlier this year that the cost of any necessary bridge strengthening improvement works on county roads and bridge strengthening on regional roads in 1993 could be charged to the block grant for improvement work and that special grants were not being provided for this purpose in 1993.  I understand from the deputation from Deputy Foley and Deputy Deenihan that there is a proposal of the order of £750,000 for a new bridge.  I accept the point made that that is totally unrealistic and any alternative proposals will certainly be examined as sympathetically as possible.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.25 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 2 July 1993.</P>

      <P>Under the Operational Programme on Peripherality 1989-1993, it is expected that Structural Funds assistance of £24 million will be available in 1993 for investment in rail projects.  The proposed funding will be allocated as follows: (a) upgrading of the Dublin-Belfast Line &mdash; £5.04 million; (b) Dublin-Cork rail upgrade project &mdash; £7.39 million; (c) Dublin-Waterford rail upgrade project &mdash; £2.46 million; (d) provision of commuter rail service on the South West Rail Corridor &mdash; £4.68 million; (e) provision new rail freight gantries at Sligo, North Esk (Cork), Limerick, <Col N="879" /> Dundalk and North Wall &mdash; £2.7 million; (f) Belview Harbour Rail Link project &mdash; £0.98 million and (g) Lavistown Junction (County Kilkenny) rail development project &mdash; £0.75 million. An allocation of £128,500 is also being made under the EC Interreg Programme for the refurbishment of Sligo Rail Station.</P>
      <P>Provision has also been made within the overall Cohesion Fund allocation for Ireland for 1993 and the first quarter of 1994 for assistance for rail projects.  The Department of Finance and my Department are at present in discussions with the EC authorities regarding eligible rail expenditure and the allocation of assistance from the fund.  Pending completion of these discussions, it is not possible at this stage to provide details of the specific allocations for individual rail projects.</P>
      <P>With regard to 1994 and subsequent years, work is already underway under the supervision of the Department of Finance on the preparation of a national development plan which will set out the Government's priorities for the use of EC funds available to Ireland from the next tranche of the Structural Funds and from the Cohesion Fund.</P>
      <P>As part of this process the Government will be seeking EC funding for an integrated package of transport measures, including improvements in strategic rail links.  Decisions on the allocation of EC funds to the mainline railway network will be dependent on the Government's assessment of overall national priorities and on the outcome of detailed negotiations with the EC authorities.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24, 63 and 64 together.  I have received An Post's Annual Report for 1992 and I presented it to both Houses of the Oireachtas on 27 April, 1993.  Where necessary, my Department is having discussions with An Post on issues arising from the <Col N="882" /> Annual Report, including monitoring of progress on the programme of measures to restore An Post to financial health now being negotiated by the Company with the unions.  The specific measures currently being negotiated with the assistance of the Labour Relations Commission are intended to achieve a significant improvement on An Post's financial position as well as safeguarding long term employment in the Company. However, An Post has informed me that there will be some job losses arising from the recovery measures.  The precise number of job losses, some of which will be temporary jobs, will not be known until the negotiations have been completed. I should, however, inform the House that An Post is not proposing compulsory job losses for permanent staff. A voluntary severance/early retirement package will be available.</P>
      <P>The House is already aware that An Post's proposals for the closure of sub-post offices and the installation of roadside letter boxes have been the subject of a socio-economic study carried out by consultants.  I am examining the report of that study and, pending the completion of my examination, An Post is not proceeding with the two proposals in question.</P>
      <P>On the other hand and as part of its plans for modernising the postal service, An Post, in co-operation with the Department of Social Welfare and the National Treasury Management Agency, has started work on a four-year major computing project involving the automation of its services in 600 post offices nationwide at a total cost of £36 million. This project will provide significantly improved quality of service as well as an extended range of services for customers using these post offices.</P>

      <P>At a meeting of the Council of Ministers (Telecommunications) held on 16 June 1993, Ministers agree on a Resolution dealing with the situation in the telecommunications sector and the need for further development in that market.  The Resolution recorded the support of Ministers <Col N="884" /> for the intention of the Commission to prepare before the 1 July, 1996 the necessary amendments to the Community regulatory framework in order to achieve liberalisation of all public voice telephony services by 1 January 1998.</P>
      <P>In order to allow member states with less developed networks to achieve the necessary structural adjustments in particular of tariffs, certain member states (including Ireland) were granted an additional transition period of up to five years.</P>
      <P>The implications of this Resolution for Ireland are that liberalisation will offer Irish service providers the opportunity to compete in an Europe wide market and, as a corollary, that the public voice telephony market in Ireland at present reserved to Telecom Éireann will be open to competition from service providers from Ireland and from other member states.  The conditions governing the liberalisation of public voice telephony in the Community have yet to be worked out and will be the subject of political agreement among Ministers.  The Resolution envisages the working out of arrangements for suitable measures in relation to specific difficulties encountered by peripheral regions with less developed networks so as to assist network development and universal service in peripheral regions.</P>

      <P>The configuration of the Aer Lingus/Aerlinte fleet is a commercial matter for the company to decide.</P>
      <P>On 7 September, 1989 the Board of Aer Lingus endorsed a management recommendation to lease two Boeing 767-300ER aircraft for operation on the North Atlantic, and sought Government approval to proceed with the leases.  The Government approved the proposal, subject to the conditions that there would be no recourse to the State for either equity or State guarantee of borrowing in relation to the aircraft.  At that time Aer Lingus planned to operate services to Los Angeles.  For commercial reasons, the company subsequently decided not to proceed with those plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In its recent review of strategy, Aer <Col N="886" /> Lingus decided that in relation to its North Atlantic operations, services would be confined to New York and Boston.  Aer Lingus is of the view that these points are best served by B747s as the B7667s have higher seat-mile costs than the B747, but lower aircraft-mile costs, making them suitable for long-range thin routes but relatively unsuitable for shorter routes with heavy traffic flows and low seat rates.</P>
    <P>As the B767s are surplus to Aer Lingus requirements, the Company proposes to dispose of them as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The provisions for paying equal treatment arrears to married women for the period December 1984 to November 1986 are contained in the European Communities (Social Welfare) Regulations, 1992 (S.I. No. 152 of 1992).  The Regulations provide for (a) the payment of a higher personal rate in the case of certain social welfare payments, (b) the extended duration of unemployment benefit, (c) payment of a household supplement in respect of a dependent husband and-or dependent children and (d) payment of unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with the legislative provisions payment of arrears is being made on a phased basis in 1992, 1993 and 1994. Phase 1 provides for the payment of arrears in respect of the higher personal rates and extended duration of unemployment benefit while Phase 2 provides for the payment of arrears of household supplement in respect of dependants and the payment of unemployment assistance. The legislation provides for Phase 2 arrears to be paid in two equal instalments&mdash;the first instalment to be paid not later than 31 December 1993 and the second instalment to be paid not later <Col N="889" /> than 1 July 1994 with amounts of less than £100 to be paid in full in 1993.</P>
    <P>A total of 85,340 applications for equal treatment arrears were received and all these have been processed for Phase 1 entitlement except for a small number of cases where additional enquiries had to be made to determine entitlement.  Some 17,100 applicants were not eligible for Phase 1 payments.  These consisted mainly of widows, wives separated from their husbands and married women who had claims or who were single during the relevant period.  A small number of claims are still being received each week and these claims, while technically late, are being accepted.  The number of applicants eligible for Phase 1 payments was 67,755 and 67,554 have been paid.  Payments are issued once a week.</P>
    <P>Processing of arrears of household supplement due under Phase 2 of the provisions commenced last April.  To date some 17,700 applications have been processed.  Of those 11,200 were entitled to payment and the remaining 6,500 were not entitled to household supplement. Those not entitled to Household Supplement fall into two categories&mdash;(a) a married woman with no child dependants and whose husband was not considered a dependant because he was earning in excess of £50 a week, and (b) a married woman whose husband was in receipt of a social welfare payment during the relevant period.  As regards the latter category the husband received the full household supplement for child dependants on his claim at the time and in such cases the household supplement is deemed to be fully paid to both spouses. A total of 10,730 applicants have received their Phase 2 entitlements.  A further 67,640 claims have yet to be determined for Phase 2 entitlements.  Based on experience to date between 60 per cent and 70 per cent of these cases will be eligible for payment.</P>
    <P>Payments of arrears due are being made within the timescale provided for in the legislation.  Those qualifying for payments are being paid promptly after decisions have been made on their claims.  In summary almost all of the eligible <Col N="890" /> Phase 1 claims received have been paid.  As regards Phase 2 cases, 17,700 have been examined and, of the 63 per cent of those eligible for payment, almost all have been paid.  A further 67,640 cases will be reviewed for Phase 2 entitlements over the next six months and eligible cases will be paid promptly.</P>

      <P>In reply to a question by Deputy Harney of 13 May, I said that in the five year period 1988 to 1992 inclusive, 2,362 <Col N="891" /> awards amounting to £16.816 million have been paid by the Tribunal.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal that the more detailed information sought by the Deputy&mdash;specifically, the number and amount paid in awards for a particular county is not readily available and would have to be specially compiled.  This could only be done by diverting scarce staff resources from other more pressing tasks and this would not be warranted in the circumstances.</P>

      <P>My Department's Science and Technology budget for 1993 is £43.88 million as compared to an outturn of £27.84 million last year.  The 1993 provision includes £23.42 million for a new scheme to assist companies to undertake R and D projects.  Because there is no requirement for matching Exchequer funds, this amount does not appear in the Estimates.  To enable this scheme to get underway in 1993 it was necessary to redeploy funds as between different S &amp; T programmes.</P>
      <P>This has resulted in cut-backs in certain other schemes including the Applied Scholars scheme.  Within present budgetary constraints, my Department is looking at ways to maximise the use of funds available for the Applied Scholars scheme.  Research students who apply for these scholarships are being referred to the Irish-American Partnership element of the scheme which is jointly funded by Eolas and industry.</P>

      <P>Live Register statistics do not permit a comparison to be drawn between the rate of unemployment in any particular region relative to another.</P>
      <P>However it is possible, using data from the annual Labour Force Survey, to make such a comparison.  The most recent survey report relates to 1991, and this indicates that the Dublin Region, with an unemployment rate of 17.1 per cent, had the second highest rate in the country at that time.  The highest rate, 19.7 per cent, was in the North-West and Donegal, while the national figure was 15.6 per cent.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to estimate what effect, if any, the Government's decentralisation programme is having on the relative incidence of unemployment in Dublin relative to the regions.  The Government believes that the more widespread location of public service employment is a desirable long term objective in itself and that it contributes to reducing regional imbalances and pressure on the Dublin region.</P>

In line with EC policy, the strategy is concerned primarily with CO2, the principal greenhouse gas.  An inventory of methane emissions will also be prepared under the strategy.  CFC emissions will, of course, be substantially reduced by reason of the operation of the UN Montreal Protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer, to which Ireland is a party.  In reviewing the national strategy, account will be taken of the contribution of various emissions to the greenhouse effect and the possibilities which exist for limiting such emissions.</P>

      <P>Application forms and Explanatory Notes and Conditions of the scheme for the restoration of potato production potential in County Donegal were circulated in April and about 450 applications for aid have been received.  The applications are now being examined in my Department and I expect that payments will commence within the next few weeks.</P>
      <P>Expenditure under the EC-assisted scheme is estimated at £1.6 million (£1.2 million from FEOGA and £0.4 national funding).  Producers who suffered losses in 1992 will be paid grants, in respect of 1993 plantings, of £900 per hectare of seed potatoes and £775 per hectare of ware potatoes.  These amounts represent the cost of purchase of seed for the 1993 crop, the cost of clearing the ground of damaged 1992 crop and interest on working capital for six months.  If the 1993 area planted exceeds the area in 1992, grants will be confined to latter area.</P>
      <P>A grant of £335 per hectare of seed potatoes and of £345 per hectare of were potatoes will be paid in respect of the cost of clearance of damaged 1992 crops in cases where the producer is not growing potatoes in 1993.</P>
      <P>The balance of the £1 million provided in the budget, i.e. about £0.6 million, will, subject to EC Commission approval, be used to supplement payments to seed growers.  Details of this supplementary scheme are not yet finalised as the actual amount available will not be known until the amount used under the EC scheme has been determined.</P>

      <P>My Department, in its series of perinatal statistics publications, defines stillbirth as death prior to the complete expulsion or extraction from its mother of a product of conception, irrespective of the duration of pregnancy.  A fetal death is indicated by the fact that, after separation, the fetus does not breathe or show any evidence of life, such as beating of the heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of voluntary muscles. Following WHO guidelines, a stillbirth refers to the death of a fetus weighing at least 500 grammes.</P>
      <P>For the purposes of the annual report of vital statistics compiled by the Central Statistics Office, a stillbirth is defined as the death of a fetus at or over 28 weeks gestation.</P>

    <P>When the provisions of the Health <Col N="907" /> (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 are commenced later this year, persons requiring nursing home care may apply to a health board for a subvention towards the nursing home fees.  It will be a matter for the health board to decide whether an applicant qualifies for a subvention following an assessment of the person's level of dependency and his or her means and circumstances.  Health boards have not yet been allocated funding for subventions under the Act.</P>

      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 72 and 73 together.</P>
      <P>As I already advised the Deputy in my reply of 23 June 1993 it was not possible to include the project in question in the national school capital programme for 1993 because of other commitments and priorities.  The project will continue to be considered for inclusion in the capital programme in due course in the light of other commitments and priorities.</P>
      <P>While the dimensions of the classrooms in the school at present are below modern standards my Department is satisfied the existing accommodation will be adequate, from the point of view of the health and safety of the children, until such time as the new extension is provided.</P>

      <P>Except in rare and exceptional circumstances school buildings provided without the prior agreement of my Department do not qualify for grant assistance under the scheme of capital grants for secondary schools.  The question of a retrospective grant for the sports hall at St. Mary's secondary school has been considered and having regard to all the circumstances I am satisfied that payment of a grant is not warranted.</P>

      <P>The provision of a physical education hall was proposed for the school in 1985 but because of financial constraints it was not possible to proceed with the project.  Due to demands on the capital resources available, priority has been given for some time to the provision of essential teaching spaces.  As a result, it is not possible to make funding available at this stage for the provision of physical education facilities at existing schools without such facilities, including the school in question.  However, physical educational facilities are provided in all major new school developments.</P>
      <P>The provision of indoor sports accommodation in existing schools, in the form of a general purpose area at primary level and a hall at secondary level, will resume as soon as pressure on available resources for urgent classroom accommodation has eased.  In the meantime, additional emphasis is being placed on the siting and common use of school and community recreational facilities and schools should make maximum use of other sports facilities in their area.</P>
