      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>This year's Book of Estimates, which was published yesterday, shows spending increases of more than £500 million this over last year without any apparent improvement in service.  I want to ask the Taoiseach whether there will be any arrangement for a debate on the Estimates.  From my experience in this House, there has always been a debate on the annual Estimates to give Deputies an opportunity of probing behind the figures to find out what the policy decisions are and to <Col N="590" /> underline the figures.  It is undemocratic not to have a debate on the Estimates this year.  I strongly urge the Taoiseach to allocate time, if necessary tomorrow, for a debate on the Estimates; otherwise this traditional democratic process will be further undermined.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter the Deputy raised can be discussed with the Whips. I hope the Government's initiative on Dáil reform will be a first step in making this House more workable, expediting its work and giving more time for scrutiny of all expenditure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, but may I make one comment?  If using jack-boot tactics to put a Bill through the Dáil yesterday and the cancellation of the traditional debate on the Estimates is an indication of the Government's thinking on Dáil reform, all I can say is God help the future of democracy in this country.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach confirm that it is not proposed to reconstitute the committee on secondary legislation of the European Communities and that the proposed foreign affairs committee will be given a mandate to deal with the question of European legislation and our involvement in the European Community?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, it is proposed to establish four standing committees of the House, including a foreign affairs committee.  I am certain there will be ample opportunity to discuss secondary legislation in that committee.  In relation to budgetary and expenditure matters, the budget will be introduced next Wednesday and expenditure and revenue matters can be <Col N="591" /> fully discussed in the context of the budget debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the Chair's guidance on whether parliamentary questions which seek to elicit information about the Estimates will be permitted and answered?  There has been some confusion about this in the past where such questions were disallowed on the grounds that they envisaged a debate.  As you well know it is very hard to debate the Estimates if you do not have the basic information of what is contained in those Estimates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> In respect of ministerial responsibility, may I inquire from the Taoiseach if the Minister for Equality and Law Reform has responsibility for the travelling community's equal rights to a proper lifestyle? I put down a question asking how travellers being removed from a temporary site could be facilitated on a permanent parking site but it was ruled out of order on the grounds that the Minister had no responsibility.  I do not understand how that question could be ruled out of order if the Minister has responsibity for the equal rights of travellers. What is the position in this regard?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick-East):</i> My interpretation of the Minister's role was that he would have a specific mandate for the weaker sections of society and that the travelling community must be near the top of that list.  I fail to understand how a question about the travelling community's right to live on a parking site could be ruled out of order and the Minister would not reply to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to promised legislation, may I ask the Taoiseach the position in relation to the family home legislation which was promised in January 1992 as a matter of urgency by the then Minister in response to a Supreme Court decision of December 1991?  When will we see the Bill &mdash; I think it is to be entitled the matrimonial home Bill &mdash; in this House?  The lack of legislation in this area is causing major problems on the ground, particularly for the spouse working at home.  May I also ask the Taoiseach whether it is intended to proceed with the Milk (Regulation of Supply) Bill which has been making tortuous progress in the Seanad for a couple of years now? Will that Bill be brought before this House or has the Taoiseach other plans in that regard?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>In view of the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to introduce legislation in 1993 to bring our laws into conformity with the European Convention on Human Rights, when does the Taoiseach intend to introduce a Bill to decriminalise homosexuality?  I note that it was not included in the list of Bills the Taoiseach intends to cover in this Dáil <Col N="594" /> session as mentioned in the media yesterday.</P>

      <P>A week ago I asked the Taoiseach the revised date for the publication of the White Paper on education but he did not have the information. In the meantime has he established when it is proposed to publish the White Paper, which is a necessary precursor to the education Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>

The Dáil reports are not being printed because the transcripts are not being made available.  This strike is causing a lot of inconvenience, and it has to be settled some time.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <P>I sincerely hope that the matter will be resolved as quickly as possible. This is the first dispute of this kind <Col N="595" /> I have come across during my many years in the House.</P>
      <P>My second question arises from the statement made yesterday by Commissioner Steichen about the application by the Irish Government for assistance for seed potatoes.  I understand that the information given to the European Parliament was that no money was being made available.  Would the Taoiseach or the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry clarify the position?  This is causing a lot of concern&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The section of the Programme for a Partnership Government &ldquo;Broadening our Democracy&rdquo; outlines measures which the Government believes will accelerate the process of institutional reform.  Specific reforms are proposed in the programme dealing with electoral reform, local government reform and Oireachtas reform.  The measures being debated today and tomorrow are a reflection of the Government's commitment to Oireachtas reform.</P>
      <P>Reform of the procedure and practices of a legislative assembly is not something which can be dealt with in a summary way.  A root and branch approach is necessary.  Rather than dwell on previous attempts at reform and perceived successes or failures, I should like today to reflect on the package of measures proposed in the Government document and outline the thinking behind them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="600" /> The purpose of reform of the Dáil is to improve the efficiency of the way the House does its business, to provide individual Deputies with a more effective legislative function and a more meaningful role in the consideration of public policy.  It is also necessary to ensure that the Government is fully accountable to the Dáil for its policies, decisions and actions.  These objectives are an expression of our commitment to open Government as outlined in the Programme for a Partnership Government.</P>
    <P>Over the years the perception has grown that Deputies' influence on the legislative process has diminished and that the role of a Deputy as an ombudsman for his or her consituents has assumed greater importance.  This has led to much discussion on the appropriate role for Members of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>Throughout the ages legislators, historians and philosophers have speculated about whether representatives' first loyalties should be to constituency, to party, to country or to one's own conscience. Perhaps the most frequently quoted authority is Edmund Burke who, in a speech in 1774 said:</P>
    <P>Parliament is a deliberate assembly of one nation, with one interest, that of the whole, where, not local purpose, not local prejudices ought to guide but the general good, resulting from the reason of the whole.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Society in the 20th century is different from the one in which Edmund Burke lived; yet, his classic statement serves as one ideal when we consider what the Dáil ought to be.</P>
    <P>Parliamentarians today represent a diverse electorate, and their ideas on the role of Deputies are equally varied. Deputies, for there part, must keep a balance between constituency and party endeavour and their duties as legislators. The measures proposed here are an attempt to enhance the role of the Deputy, and to strengthen the role of the Dáil as the key to maintaining confidence in our central democratic institution.</P>
    <P>I would now like to refer to the detail of some of the proposals.  The Government <Col N="601" /> document on Dáil Reform submitted to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in April 1992 contained a proposal for the relaxation of the <i>sub judice</i> rule. By longstanding practice, the House imposed on itself the convention of the <i>sub judice</i> rule, the purpose of which was to avoid the risk of prejudicing judicial proceedings or of being seen to interfere with the administration of justice in the courts.  The rule is, of course, commendable in itself.  However, as with any rule, no matter how well founded in principle, it has had a disproportionate effect on Dáil proceedings and over many years has become very restrictive and prevented the House from discussing matters of real public concern, excepting, of course, debate on legislation.  Guidelines have been prepared to assist the Ceann Comhairle in the implementation of the proposed new Standing Order.  The relaxation of the rule will open up debate on matters of public concern, particularly where so called &ldquo;gagging writs&rdquo; were utilised in the past.</P>
    <P>The guidelines set out the conditions that should apply to the raising of a matter which is <i>sub judice</i>.  The matter raised must be of general public importance. This is to ensure that only bona fide matters of public interest which clearly relate to matters of general public policy are raised.</P>
    <P>A matter may not be raised where it relates to a case where notice has been served, that is, to be heard before a jury; or is then being heard before a jury. This minimises the risks of prejudicing a hearing, on the presumption that in non-jury actions the risk would be minimal. A matter should not be raised in such a manner that it appears to be an attempt by the Oireachtas to encroach on the functions of the courts or a judicial tribunal. The long standing ruling of the Chair that &ldquo;members of the Judiciary are independent by virtue of the Constitution and they may neither be criticised nor have their rulings referred to in the House except on a substantive motion&rdquo; shall continue to apply.</P>
    <P>The principle of the separation of powers in the Constitution must be <Col N="602" /> observed.  Members may only raise matters in a substantive manner where due notice is required.  It is important that the Chair should not be placed in the position which requires him to make instant rulings during the course of a debate on the admissibility or otherwise of matters <i>sub judice</i> within the context of the guidelines. The Chair should have adequate opportunity to become aware that a matter to be raised is relevant within the context of the guidelines and to decide whether the matter to be raised is of general public importance.</P>
    <P>When permission to raise a matter has been granted, there continues to be an onus on Members to avoid comment which might, in effect, prejudice the outcome of proceedings.  Members should always be mindful of the fact that the possibility that comment might prejudice proceedings always exists, ever when raising a matter within the guidelines.</P>
    <P>This new <i>sub judice</i> proposal is subject to the established rules of procedure of the House.  Thus, for example, reference to specific cases being heard or to be heard by name or in such a manner so that the parties to the hearing may be identifiable, should not be made.  The general point of substance at issue can be raised without readily identifying or criticising the parties involved.</P>
    <P>The guidelines endeavour to strike a balance to allow matters of public interest to be raised while, at the same time, protecting as far as possible from the risk of prejudice or perceived interference in the courts.  However, a certain onus of responsibility should rest on Members for raising matters <i>sub judice.</i></P>
    <P>A register of Members' interests is being introduced, initially on a non-statutory basis, by wasy of motion in the House. A provision in this regard will be made in the forthcoming Ethics in Government Bill, which will put it on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the register is to give public notification of those material interests held by Members which could be thought by others to influence their parliamentary conduct or actions.  The motives in establishing the register is to provide Deputies with a means of <Col N="603" /> declaring relevant material interests.  It is not intended, nor should it be the case, that a Member's right to privacy should be invaded.</P>
    <P>It should be pointed out that Deputies debate public policy and hold to account those who take executive decisions.  All members have an interest, on behalf of their constituents, as well as in their own right, in all aspects of public policy and must be allowed to participate in their deliberation.  Members of the House are also entitled to engage in outside activities. We welcome into the Oireachtas people with a wide range of experience whether in business, trade unions, the agriculture industry, education, health or any activity that broadens the range of expertise in the House.  The business of the House and the duties of Members are so all-embracing that inevitably there will be occasions when a Member's personal interests may be pulled in a different direction from the policy of his party or his wider responsibilities as a legislator.</P>
    <P>The register of interests affects all Members directly and personally.  I know that all Members have views, many strongly held, on how far the register should seek to obtain information, whether the value of all the assets or interests held by Members should be declared, whether the interests of Members' relatives or spouses should be declared; indeed in an age of equality, whether the independent income or otherwise of spouse be declared.  For instance, if a spouse refused to declare such interest on the basis that he or she was not a member of the House, contending that his or her business interests are not open to public scrutiniy, how could we impose a sanction on the Member of the House?  Members also have view on whether such a declaration for Members or their spouses should be made either publicly or privately and the extent to which such a declaration should be made.  The debate tomorrow will provide an opportunity for all the Deputies to air their views and express their concerns.</P>
    <P>The Ethics in Government Bill is at <Col N="604" /> present in the course of preparation.  The views od all Deputies will be given careful consideration before that Bill is presented to the House.  It is intended that a copy of the register will be published and made available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>The new committee system being introduced is probably the greatest single change in the way the House conducts its business since the foundation of the State.  The potential for each Deputy to influence legislation and spending by Departments should not be underestimated. The first major business which the finance general affairs committee will consider wil be the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill.  I know a special committee considered the Finance Bill last year when the experiment was a significant success, a fact acknowledged by all Members who participated.  Indeed, the way in which parties co-operate when Bills are sent to committees was a factor in the decision on the formation of the new system.  In general, when special committees considered Bills in the past amendments and ideas from backbenchers on all sides of the House were accepted on all readily than across the floor of the House, the atmosphere being less confrontational and adversarial, everybody making a contribution.  The Government is anxious to ensure that this approach continues within the new committee system.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the attention of Deputies to a number of significant points in the terms of reference of the committees. First, the committees will be able to hire people with specialist knowledge to assist them, and may invite submissions in writing, if considered necessary, from interested persons or bodies; second, the Government envisages there will be close co-operation between Departments preparing legislation and the committees.  Before consideration of the Committee Stage of a Bill by the committee private briefing session shall be held between the officials of the relevant Department and Members of the new-style committees.</P>
    <P>Three further legislative committees <Col N="605" /> will be established in the near future, &mdash; the enterprise and economic strategy committee, the social affairs committee and the legislative and security committee. Legislation and Estimates from all Departments will be sent to committees, as the Dáil decides.  The new committee system is a significant development in the evolution of the role of committees.  It builds on the expertise gained over many years.  Each committee will have 30 members.  They will be properly resourced, their chairpersons and convenors, who will act as Whips will be remunerated.  Legislation regarding privilege and the question of compelling witnesses to attend will be introduced as a priority.</P>
    <P>A new foreign affairs committee is included in the Government proposals. This will be a joint committee of both Houses, the Dáil Members of which will consider the Estimates for the Public Services submitted to Dáil Éireann in respect of Foreign Affairs and International Co-operation and report thereon to the Dáil. The joint committee will deal with the Committee Stages of all Bills referred to it.  The joint committee will also consider those matters previously the responsibility of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities.  Members of the European Parliament elected from constituencies in Ireland, including Northern Ireland, may attend meeting of the joint committee and of its sub-committees.  Other members of the European Parliament may, at the invitation of the joint committee or of a sub-committees, attend particular meetings.  Members of the European Parliament attending on such occasions may take part in the proceeding but without having a right to vote.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the new committee system will necessitate many changes regarding arrangements for sittings to ensure more effective and efficient use of Dáil time.  These changes will take place after the fullest possible consultation. When the new system is put in place it will bring about a complete and fundamental change in the way operate in this <Col N="606" /> House.  I should like to put it on the record that that can only be done with the full assistance and co-operation of Deputies on all sides because it is a matter that affects all Deputies in the House.</P>
    <P>In relation to other reforms, a revamped adjournment procedure and separate Taoiseach Question Times are other measures proposed which represent a commitment to improved accountability a and scrutiny of the Government by Deputies.  A new procedure for the introduction of Private Members' Bill is also proposed.  This is designed to give Deputies on all the right to introduce Bills and explain to the House the purpose of their respective initiatives.</P>
    <P>In relation to voting procedures, there has been longstanding criticism &mdash; with which few would disagree &mdash; that current voting procedures waste time.  The introduction of electronic voting in the autumn should eliminate these problems. In the meantime new procedures are being introduced to streamline current practice while ensuring that Deputies have the right to vote against any measures with which they disagree.</P>
    <P>The measures are an attempt to ensure that, where possible, divisions will be postponed to a set voting time.  Voting will take place at that time in a manner which processes the divisions as speedily as possible while maintaining the rights of Deputies.  Obviously, divisions pressed on the Order of Business will have to be taken at that time.</P>
    <P>We have tried to streamline the taking of divisions on Committee and Report Stages of Bills to ensure that while the rights of Deputies to oppose sections or parts of Bills and propose amendments must be protected, the greatest amount of time should be spent debating legislation rather than voting.</P>
    <P>Reforms suggests a sharp transition from one condition to another but the increasing pace of change, the perception of the needs of the citizen, and the increasing complexity of the tasks of Government require a developmental strategy of change.</P>
    <P>The measures being introduced today are a progression of developments that <Col N="607" /> occurred in the last Dáil which saw the introduction of televising Dáil proceedings. This enabled the public to experience at first hand the operation of the Dáil.  There is an increased public awareness of the way in which we, their public representatives, carry our work on their behalf.  Last April, after examining existing procedures, the Government proposed a wide series of measures designed to address the perceived inefficience and inadequacies of the present system.  These measures were broadly welcomed by the Working Group of the Committee of Procedure and Privileges which was established to consider the Government proposals.  I should like to place on the record of the House my thanks to my colleagues in the group, Deputies Flanagan and Clohessy, the Minister for health, Deputy Howlin, the former Deputy McCartan, Deputy Enda Kenny and Deputy Rabbitte who responded to the proposals in an extremely positive manner.  Indeed, many of those proposals are incorporated in the proposals before us today.</P>
    <P>I should like to respond briefly to some criticism expressed recently on the attendance of TD's in the Dáil Chamber. As all Deputies are aware, as indeed are most of the general public, the majority of a Deputy's work does not involve sitting in the Dáil Chamber listening to debates.  I have no doubt that if Deputies sat in this Chamber listening to Dáil debates the criticism would be that it was a very unproductive way of conducting our business.  To a certain extent, the new committee system will allow Deputies to participate more fully.  Televised porceedings of Dáil debate are relayed to all Deputies' offices and to public areas in Leinster House.  Therefore, it is not necessary for Deputies to sit in the Chamber to listen, or follow, a debate.</P>
    <P>Apart from following the proceedings Of the house, as I said earlier, Deputies Must represent their constituents and Much of this type of work, such as contact With Ministers or Departments or attending with deputations, is undertaken while the Dáil is sitting, simply because Ministers <Col N="608" /> are available in the House, unless otherwise engaged on official business.</P>
    <P>Deputies are frequently criticised for doing constituency work.  Many people, particularly those in the media, take the view that Deputies should not do this work.  As every Member knows, Deputies who do not do constituency work will not be re-elected to this House. A balance has to br maintained and we, as legislators, are trying to maintain that balance.  It is unfair to attack Members of this House for doing constituency work, which is a vital part of their role as public representatives.  The criticisms in this regard are unfounded and, in some cases, display an ignorance.</P>
    <P>The measures being discussed today will be introduced by way of sessional orders.  This will allow further refinement, if necessary, before their incorporation in Standing orders.  The Government is preparing further reform proposals as part of a development strategy of reform and these will be brought forward for discussion shortly.</P>
    <P>As I indicated earlier, the government is committed to a programme of institutional reform.  The measures proposed today, or indeed Oireachtas reform alone, are not the complete answer to the development of the legislator who is focussed on the broader national, or indeed international perspective.  It would be instructive if Deputies expressed their views on any possible constitutional change which they believe would be necessary to bring this wider objective about.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish to say that the Government does not believe that only the reform measures it suggests should be pursued.  As Minister of State with responsibility for Dáil Reform, I wish to say that any party or Deputy with ideas or proposals for constructive change will be listed to.  For my part, I undertake to give full and careful consideration to all the suggestions put forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that this debate is taking place at a time when an unprecedented number of new Deputies have been elected to this parliament. <Col N="609" /> They will find the process of becoming acquainted with and understanding the constraints and the strictures of this House a very chastening experience.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael Party has always supported the concept of reform of the Dáil. Indeed, over the past number of years Fine Gael has produced a number of documents and put forward suggestions on how the Dáil could be made more effective and efficient and Deputy Bruton, who was the then Leader of the House, produced a fairly comprehensive document dealing with many of the items which were a cause for concern to parties and Deputies.</P>
      <P>The public are entitled to have an effective, vigorous, responsive and efficient Parliament.  The old ways in terms of parliamentary systems, inherited from the British Crown, must be revamped and changed.  That is obvious to anybody who has been involved in politics at national level for any length of time.  As the Minister said, there has to be a balance between the mandate given to a public representative by his constituents to represent them and the mandate he has been given by those constituents to act as a legislator in Parliament. Public representatives have to understand the problems of the country and deal with them by way of legislation in the Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Politicians are fair game for all kinds of criticism, and people in the public arena have to understand that.  The questions most frequently asked by visitors to the public gallery are: why is the Chamber so empty, and where are all the Deputies?  This matter was referred to by the Minister in his speech.  People at Heuston Station on a Tuesday who see Deputies arrive by train with their briefcase bulging with constituency work should remember that modern politics is the most accountable, most demanding, most transparent and most temporary job anyone can have.  Deputies hold a responsible position and they have to give responses to families who need their assistance.  Politics is a high pressure, very accountable, demanding and temporary job.  I should like to put down <Col N="610" /> some markers in terms of the general support the Fine Gael Party has for the concept of Dáil reform.  I wish to refer in general to some of the proposals mentioned by the Minister in his speech. Deputies will have an opportunity to discuss these matters in greater detail under there various headings.  It should be borne in mind that Dáil reform is being introduced by a Government which has the largest majority in the history of the State.  The Fine Gael Party believes that all these proposals should be referred back to the Committee of Procedure and Privileges for final analysis before being presented again to the House by way of sessional order.</P>
    <P>We do not have a problem with the proposals in regard to the <i>sub judice</i> rule. Members of the House are generally responsible in terms of the issues they seek to raise.  While the guidelines are technical, they allow for a relaxing of the present regulation.  To a certain extent, Members will be able to raise matters of national importance without interfering with court hearings that are underway or impacting on the decisions of a jury in a court case.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party accepts in principle that there should be a register of Members' Interests.  It would not be proper if all matters relating to Deputies were kept secret.  We are public representatives and, as such, the public have a right to know our interests.  However, the question is, how far down that road does one go?</P>
    <P>The proposals in regard to the Register of Members' Interests are a cause of concern to a number of people for good and valid reasons.  In the Fine Gael document published a number of years ago we recommended that a register of Members' Interests should be kept by a special committee of the House and that complaints arising therefrom should be investigated by that committee.  However, the Government proposes that the register of Members' Interests should be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and a complaints procedure laid down.  This would probably lead to a public examination or assessment of a Deputy's worth in terms <Col N="611" /> of financial assets and so on at the end of the year based on assumptions, many of them wild, that may appear in the public press.</P>
    <P>In regard to the declaration of the address and main business of the provider of benefits to Members, it should be borne in mind that there is a danger of entrapment of Members who may have received a gift or financial allocation for an election, etc.  If such benefit, assistance, service or goods as set out in the section are not declared in the register, a member could find he was being investigated by the committee.  Therefore, there is a clear need to define these services. There should also be a limit below which it would not be necessary to declare and register financial donations in the official register.  It is very important that the terms &ldquo;services, benefits and goods&rdquo; are clearly defined and that a lower limit is set in terms of financial allocations.  Otherwise there is a danger of entrapment.</P>
    <P>In relation to outside professions and remunerations, my party does not have any problems with this.  Some Deputies may have a second, or sideline, occupation which they validly consider to be of no interest to the public and which does not interfere with &mdash; and in some cases it may enhance &mdash; their ability to perform as public representatives and politicians.  We do not have any objection to naming a business that is owned in whole or in part by Member.  That is only fair.</P>
    <P>In regard to property which a Member may hold, it should be clearly outlined whether this refers to property held outside or inside the State.  If this proposal is to apply to Members, will it also apply to senior departmental officials?  This issue needs to be looked at.  We have no objection to a Member giving the details of a registered office or business he or she might have.</P>
    <P>The issue of shares needs to be clearly looked at.  We consider that &ldquo;a substantial shareholding&rdquo; in a company should really mean that a member is in a position to influence company policy by <Col N="612" /> having a majority shareholding in that company.  Otherwise, a declaration of speculation on the Stock Exchange in regard to any amount of shares could be traced for publication and there could be an assessment of an individual Deputy's worth at the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The definition of gifts need to be made clearer.  If Members are invited to go to Brussels on a deputation or to attend a conference of the Council of the European Movement, will the costs of the air fares, hotel accommodation etc., be regarded as gifts?  If Members who are asked by specific organisations to put down parliamentary questions, etc, are taken to lunch to discuss the issue, is that to be regarded as a gift?  That point needs to be clarified.</P>
    <P>In regard to disputes, it should be borne in mind that this is an area where Members could suffer unduly at the hands of the public if a complaint &mdash; completely invalid &mdash; is lodged about a Member and an unscrupulous person &mdash; I do not suppose there are many of them left&mdash;says a Deputy is being investigated by a committee, the public will think something is wrong and the Deputy must have something to hide.  We recommend that no publication take place until such complaints are resolved.</P>
    <P>We object to votes being postponed until Wednesday evening.  It is a fundamental right of Opposition parties to call votes, and we will strongly stand by that.  If all votes were postponed to Wednesday evenings many Deputies would only turn up at that stage.  It is important that there should be a plenary session each day.  It is very important that the Leaders of the Opposition parties can raise important matters of national interest.  If plenary sessions were abolished, the Opposition parties would not have this fundamental democratic facility.</P>
    <P>Under the committee system, a Member who has been elected to represent a particular issue may never get a chance to raise it if he or she is not appointed to a specific committee.  Therefore, it is important that every Member should have the opportunity to attend a <Col N="613" /> committee dealing with a matter which is of interest to him or her.</P>
    <P>In relation to Question Time, the first point I would make is that Ministers should give answers to questions.  When I first came into this House, information was always given by Ministers.  We now appear to have a Question Time which is either loaded with waffle or bloated with woolly answers.  This leads to frustration for Opposition Members and causes a number of difficulties for the Ceann Comhairle.  We also propose that written parliamentary questions should be allowed during the Dáil recess and that they should be answered within a month. It is important that Ministers responsible for semi-State bodies should answer relevant questions in the House.  If one puts down a question about Iarnród Éireann, Bus Éireann etc., one is told the Minister has no responsibility for these companies even though he has overall responsibility for their budgets.</P>
    <P>We have reservations about the proposed committee system.  We believe that the chairman should be appointed on a proportional basis.  We object to the conveners being remunerated &mdash; they are mandated to be here in any event.  While we support the general principle of the committee system, we will require further clarification on the facilities and staffing of these committees.  Fine Gael has always accepted that a great deal of work should be done throught the committee system.</P>
    <P>In regard to Private Members' time and the introduction of private Bills, we do not agree that one should have to give notice to the Government as this could enable it to steal the thunder, so to speak, of the Member who wishes to introduce the Bill.</P>
    <P>Finally, in regard to topical debates, Standing Order 30 should be relaxed to some degree.  Over the years there have been few occasions when the Chair has been in a position to allow a debate under Standing Order 30.  If this rule was relaxed it would allow for greater discussion of topical issues.</P>
    <P>I am glad that this debate is taking place at this time.  I hope Members who <Col N="614" /> make contributions under the various headings will put down some markers and put forward valid suggestions that can be sent back to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges for final analysis before being referred back to the House.  We all understand the need for a more efficient and responsive Parliament and we will be as helpful as possible in the suggestions we put forward in this regard.</P>

      <P>Sadly, over the past number of years the operation of this House and the way in which it conducts its business has become a byword for inefficiency; its work practices are antiquated.  This House has come to be regarded as a joke by many people.  Unfortunately, the grim reality is that many of their perceptions are correct in varying degrees.</P>
      <P>It is essential for the maintenance of a healthy democratic process in this State and ensuring the necessary respect, that our national Parliament, in its business and procedures, provides a positive lead and example for Irish society as a whole. Since the foundation of the Progressive Democrats we have made comprehensive Oireachtas reform one of our key policy objectives.  Over the past seven years we have spelled out a range of practical reforms to make the Dáil more effective, responsive and transparent, to use the present buzz words, thereby giving a positive lead to the Irish people. That is one of the reasons we ensured that the two programmes for Government we negotiated during our period in Government, between July 1989 and November last, set out detailed measures to tackle the more obvious anachronisms that have dogged the way in which this House has attempted to do its business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reforms we proposed included the setting-up of special committees to transact much of the business of the House, changing the bizarre <i>sub judice</i> rule, the elimination of the present cattle mart system of voting, the publication of a Register of Members' interests and, perhaps more importantly of all, longer sessions and a more normal daily timetable. <Col N="615" /> Despite my apprenticeship in the other House, I find the hours of the Dáil incredible. I think it was John Kelly who said we should work Godly hours and I agree with that comment.</P>
    <P>When we were in Government, unfortunately we found our Government partners singularly disinterested in the subject of Dáil reform, and it was only in the last year that we made any real headway on this vital agenda.  This culminated in the presentation of a detailed set of reform proposals by the then Government to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  Unfortunately, the planned implementation of these reforms was interrupted by the collapse of the Government and the general election. I am glad this issue has been addressed so promptly by this Government. However, it should be borne in mind that much of the ground work was initiated by the Progressive Democrats in Government.</P>
    <P>My words of welcome for the proposed reforms must end abruptly.  The proposals before us are riddled with deficiencies and anomalies.  Some of the measures are plainly inoperable and would reduce the role of this House to a mere cipher for the actions of Govenment. These proposals should not be taken seriously in their present form.</P>
    <P>I wish to say as an aside that this is not a debate; it is a series of statements.  I should like to put down a marker in regard to the future operations of this House and how we in the Progressive Democrats will approach this matter.  It is essential at all times to have the healthy cut and thrust of debate and from that point of view we will certainly oppose any attempt to have a series of statements on the way we operate our business.  In view of the fact that the Government has 101 Deputies, it is imperative and urgent that the Dáil resists becoming a compliant rubber stamp of the constitutional Executive, the Government.  The Progressive Democrats are determined that Dáil Éireann will not be reduced to the status of a rump parliament dominated by the Cabinet.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="616" /> I wish, in particular, to draw the attention of the House to the abysmal and shameful proceedings in this Chamber yesterday when legislation with far-reaching implications from a constitutional and practical point of view was forced through this House without any adequate debate and scrutiny.  The fact that a vital amendment had to be spliced into the Bill in the dying seconds of the debate is a reflection on the whole system of guillotining legislation for the convenience of the Executive.  This should not happen.  All the high-minded rhetoric in the new Programme for Government about Dáil reform and the need for and promise of an open and accountable Government was thrown out the window in what could only be regarded as a disgraceful manner.  The way in which Government ordered the business of the House yesterday meant that some parties were prevented from expressing their views on the Bill; the constitutional right of many Deputies to give their views on an important piece of legislation was ignored, trampled upon, in what some might regard as a very cynical fashion.</P>
    <P>As I said, the Progressive Democrats do not look with much favour on the proposals before the House.  Some of the proposals are seriously flawed and deficient, and we will be insisting on many changes.  I hope the Minister will be as co-operative as he promised to be. I am sure there is a degree of goodwill on the part of the Government, which I would like to see it display.  If these proposals were adopted in their present form, they would complete the process of emasculating or sterilising this Chamber and lead to an even less effective, more fragmented, less independent and more submissive Dáil than exists at present.</P>
    <P>Some proposals need extensive revision, while others should be rejected. Many of the proposals would only have the effect of giving the Dáil a bad name. For example, some people may think that the proposal to set up committees was a step in the right direction and at first glance that may seem to be the case.  It may be intended that such committees will, like the select committees at <Col N="617" /> Westminster, make this House more accountable.  In the aftermath of Black Wednesday, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Norman Lamont, was grilled by his fellow parliamentarians in committee about his apparent failure in the handling of the British currency crisis.  He was asked embarrassing questions about the way he had discharged his duties as Chancellor.  He was made accountable for his actions in a very real sense. Michael Heseltine, who has responsibility for the Board of Trade, was also asked about his plans for the mining industry.  British Ministers accept that their Parliament's committees are entitled, as of right, to closely scrutinise their performance.  We also saw how the Governor of the Bank of England, Sir Robin Pemberton, was examined about the BCCI scandal.  I wonder how many of our Ministers would be willing to subject themselves to that type of scrutiny?  We should be asking for a similar committee system here.</P>
    <P>What price accountability?  As has been pointed out by Mr. Justice Hamilton, if genuine Dáil scrutiny of ministerial performance and policy was allowed, there would have been no need for the lengthy and expensive beef tribunal. The absence of real ministerial accountability to this House is not only wrong, but addressing that wrong has literally cost us millions of pounds not to mention the hundreds of millions of pounds that might have been lost if no real barrier was put in the way of some ministerial policies.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be surprised to learn that the Government, which declared in the final page of its Programme for Government that the hallmarks of this Administration would be openness and accountability, has already suggested that its members will not be accountable in any way to the new committees.  This was made clear in a written reply by the Taoiseach to a question put down by party leader, Deputy O'Malley, on Wednesday, 10 February last.  The Taoiseach sought to suggest that there was some constitutional obstacle to Ministers <Col N="618" /> coming before committees of the Dáil. He said:</P>
    <P>Accordingly, it is proposed that Ministers will not ordinarily be involved in the deliberations of the new committees other than in the processing in the normal way of financial and legislative business.</P>
    <P>This is nothing more than a cop-out.  How does the Taoiseach's suggestion that Ministers can only be answerable to the Dáil square with the fact that they are also answerable to the Seanad and can be called upon to explain their policy decisions before a public tribunal?  If the present Dáil reform proposals do not include the introduction of a Westminster style committee system, before which Ministers can be summoned to account for their actions and policies, then the proposed committee system will be a farce, to say nothing about the chairpersons, the convenors or any of the technical aspects of such a system.</P>
    <P>The answer given by the Taoiseach was a fundamental error of law.  The Constitution does not provide that Ministers are answerable to the Dáil only and not to committees, as the Taoiseach claimed in his reply to Deputy O'Malley.  The Constitution provides that &ldquo;the Government shall be responsible to Dáil Éireann&rdquo;.  To say that under that paragraph Ministers are immune from being answerable to committees or sub-committees of the Dáil is a ludicrous and far fetched interpretation that would not wash with a first year student of politics or law.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's response is devoid of any constitutional basis in fact or law given that Ministers already answer questions in the Seanad.  If this is permissible, as opposed to being mandatory, then it follows that they must be accountable to Dáil committees if they so choose at the very least.  There is an unwillingness on the part of the Taoiseach and his Ministers for real accountability.  International parliamentary experience has shown that the only effective mechanism for ensuring accountability is examination before a committee.  To suggest <Col N="619" /> that our Constitution prevents Irish parliamentarians from following the same procedures and having the same level of accountability in place as on Capitol Hill or in Westminster is foolish and misleading.</P>
    <P>During this debate my party colleagues and I will outline further inadequacies in the Government's Dáil reform proposals, including the ludicrous voting proposals, the <i>sub judice</i> proposal and the proposals in regard to the Register of Members' Interests, which require major amendments.  We will go through each aspect of these proposals and make constructive suggestions so that we will have a more vibrant and more accountable Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Dáil reform is not merely about setting-up a few new committees, increasing the number of Adjournment Debates or introducing electronic voting.  All of these matters may be important in themselves, but Dáil reform is about making our national parliament relevant to the challenges that confront modern society.</P>
      <P>The people who have elected us expect and demand that our parliamentary institutions are capable of responding comprehensively, effectively and democratically to the many issues and problems that arise on a daily basis.  They expect us to give leadership in tackling the longstanding and deeply entrenched problems of poverty, unemployment, crime and discrimination of all kinds.  Our institutions are expected to facilitate access and encourage participation by all citizens in a full and satisfying life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Parliamentary democracy, as evidenced in Dáil Éireann, falls a long way short of people's expectations.  As a Parliament, we are besieged by our own growing importance, anachronistic procedures and the corrosive cynicism of sections of the public and the media. Powerful vested interests and their professional lobbyists, instantaneous communications and the increasing complexity of modern life means that any parliament which clings to traditional <Col N="620" /> procedures and structures is doomed to irrelevancy and impotence.  Precedent and tradition certainly have a place, but when they appear to be used primarily to restrict rather than enhance the role of Deputies then it is time to rewrite the rules.</P>
    <P>The structure of Dáil sessions and the arrangements for sitting hours date from an era when virtually all TDs were parttime. The exceptional lengthy summer recess had its origins in the need to facilitate large farmers during their busiest season.</P>
    <P>Most oral parliamentary questions are not reached and replies to questions which must be answered are frequently designed to confuse, obfuscate and minimise the information to be imparted. Priority questions were introduced to protect the lazy performers in the larger parties and restrict the effectiveness of smaller parties.</P>
    <P>The <i>sub judice</i> rule often reduces the Dáil to the level of farce when issues of public policy are debated throughout the media but may not be raised in this Chamber.  Ministers hold press conferences to make announcements &mdash; the same promises are often announced on several occasions &mdash; but they may not be questioned on these matters in this House.  In the recent example of the execution of an eminent journalist by the Iraqi régime the Ceann Comhairle did not permit the matter to be raised on the basis that it was of insufficient urgency. When we were allowed to raise the matter in the afternoon the journalist had been executed.</P>
    <P>Many Members who strive to represent their view of the public interest within the straitjacket imposed by the present system are understandably aggrieved at the growing disposition towards more sensational uninformed and destructive comment in sections of the media.  It is no comfort that although the regular press corps who monitor the performance of the House rarely unreasonably resort to such cheap comment, neither do they frequently defend the role of Deputies. From my observations, very few members of the press corps have been <Col N="621" /> forced to retire early by reason of overwork or exhaustion.  We have to admit that the reason those who cover the Dáil regularly do not come to the defence of the role of Deputies is that we really do not have a Parliament any more; we have an Executive that operates in a semisecret way, begrudgingly informing the Dáil about what it has done after the event.</P>
    <P>Expensive tribunals of inquiry would rarely be necessary if that Executive regarded itself as seriously accountable to the Dáil.  The effectiveness and credibility of the Oireachtas depends on procedures striking the proper balance between the right of Government to get on with the business of Government and the right of the Opposition parties to probe, query, challenge, initiate and, where necessary, to oppose.  The current rules of procedure and the Standing Orders of Dáil Éireann do not strike that balance and are unfairly titled in favour of the Government.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to one area that is not dealt with in the document presented by the Minister, and that is, the allocation of financial resources between the Government and the Opposition.  In addition to the entire resources of the Civil Service being at its disposal, the Government seems to have managed on this occasion to find what I estimate to be £2.25 million to pay for special advisers, programme managers, etc.  Yet it does not seem to be able to find enough money to employ a press officer to defend and present an image of this Parliament as a national inistitution.  Neither can it find money to provide Opposition parties, particularly Opposition Front Bench spokespersons, with the necessary backup facilities so that they are properly equipped to examine legislation being put through the House.  It seems extraordinary that, so far as one can establish, Ministers and Junior Ministers have up to four civil servants in their constituency offices to deal with their constituency business while an Opposition spokesperson who is required to examine legislation has only a secretarial assistant. That situation is exacerbated in the case <Col N="622" /> of small parties and Independents who have few rights and no financial entitlements as things stand in this House.  The necessity for the Dáil to project and present itself as a national institution which is central to the lives of our citizens rather than as some kind of beer garden for squabbling politicians is important. This question of the presentation of this House to the public needs to be urgently addressed while the question of the role of Independent Members and Members of smaller parties needs a great deal more consideration than it has received in the document.</P>
    <P>In the time available to me I want quickly to go over some of the matters dealt with by Deputies Kenny and Keogh.  I want to refer in particular to the question of electronic voting.  If we are to introduce electronic voting for most occasions then the proposal contained in the document that votes should be taken <i>en masse</i> on a Wednesday evening is nonsense.  I do not understand how we could debate a Bill if we did not know whether an important amendment would stand or fall and we had to move on to deal with the following amendment given that one's approach to it would be conditional on what happened to the preceding one.  If we are to be confined to voting on Wednesday evenings it would leave the House open to the charge which no doubt would be made by somebody from the <i>Star</i> on a rare visit, that a Government, which is fortunate enough to have 101 Members, could so arrange its affairs that it would need only have all Members present on a Wednesday evening.  I do not think that would be desirable.  Therefore, the Government will have to look at that issue again because it would not be in the interests of this House.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposal on the introduction of Bills.  However, will this be the only method open to Members to introduce Bills?  Will the old procedure, whereby a party with more than seven members had the right to introduce a Bill, be withdrawn in favour of the new system?</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenny referred to the need to <Col N="623" /> have a plenary session of the House each day.  It is imperative, given that the Government partners have 101 Deputies, that there be plenary sessions each day that the Dáil convenes.  This is the only pivotal opportunity open to the Opposition parties to pursue the Government on major issues of public importance.</P>
    <P>We need to look carefully at the role proposed for committees.  There is the important question of resources if these committees are to be effective.  I was a member of the Special Committee which met in the Seanad for a week last year to examine the Finance Bill.  Everybody concerned thought it was an unqualified success in terms of its examination of the legislation and the enactment of that Bill but the committee was under-resourced. Indeed we did not receive the official report of the Committee Stage debate before Report Stage and if memory serves me correctly, we did not receive it until many months later.  We were faced with the prospect of an industrial dispute on the day the debate started when hardpressed staff felt they could not service the committee and undertake the rest of the work of the Houses of the Oireachtas also.  Apparently, as we speak, there is an industrial dispute involving staff of the House which I am sure was not entered into lightly.  It goes without saying that that dispute should be resolved quickly. The staff of the House are under extraordinary pressure.  The <i>Star</i> newspaper does not advert to this but some of the staff of the House are under more pressure than many Deputies or members of the press corps who also attend the House.  Therefore, one cannot talk seriously about establishing committees of the House in the manner proposed in the document without also dealing with the question of resources.</P>
    <P>We will focus on the question of the register of Members' interests in tomorrow's debate.  The issue here is whether a conflict of interest could arise.  That is something we have to guard against in compiling even a temporary register.  It is proposed to enshrine it in law subsequently.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="624" /> In an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 7 August 1992, Geraldine Kennedy referred to the fact that the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Beef Processing Industry revealed to public scrutiny for the first time the extent of financial contributions to political parties and individual politicians in respect of one section of one industry.  She made the point, in passing, that the evidence before the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman (Mr. T. Foxe)</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a critical time to interrupt my flow.  Geraldine Kennedy stated in that article:</P>
      <P>The evidence before the Tribunal to date has shown that Hibernia Meats contributed £103,000 to Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats in a two year period.  It gave £75,000 to the minority Fianna Fáil Government between February 1987 and June 1989 in three separate lots of £25,000.  Is it purely coincidental that £25,000 was given to the party treasurer, Mr. Ray MacSharry, a few weeks after the crucial meeting on 4 September 1987 at which the Taoiseach, Mr. Reynolds, then Minister for Industry and Commerce, allocated export credit insurance cover to that company?</P>
      <P>That matter will be decided elsewhere but I make the point of illustration that the issue is whether major financial contributions influence policy decisions. That potential conflict of interest has to be resolved.  That is the reason transparency is necessary on this question of putting a ceiling on financial contributions and so on.  We will deal with this question in more detail tomorow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this debate.  It is the first time in many years that there has been such a debate in the House although a certain amount of lip service has been paid to the notion of Dáil reform.  I welcome the spirit in which the Minister introduced the report and his openness to take <Col N="625" /> on board suggestions that may be made during the course of the debate.  It is in the interests of this Parliament in making it relevant and central to the interests of the people who elect us, that it not only works more effectively and efficiently but is seen to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I welcome the moves being made by the Government to streamline our procedures to make the Dáil more relevant and accountable to the people it serves.  May I put the new committee system to which previous speakers have referred in context from our point of view?  One hundred and sixty-six Deputies are elected to this House.  Apart from the positions of Ceann Comhairle and Leas-Cheann Comhairle, whose roles in this House are defined, only 15 Members are elected to the Cabinet while another 15 are appointed as Ministers of State.  In a democracy it is very important that all other elected Members serve and have a meaningful input in formulating policy and drafting legislation.  This House should modernise the way it does its business to make this a reality.  For some time my party has called for the committee system to be strengthened to provide for a meaningful and detailed examination of policy and legislation. Very often the most important contributions made by Deputies are not made in the set pieces which grab the headlines but rather in their detailed input to legislation.  I hope that members of the media, many of whom are quick to comment on the inactivity of politicians, will take note of the work that will be done by the new Dáil committees. Deputy Rabbitte referred to the tremendous work carried out last year on the Finance Bill.  In spite of the fact that all those responsible were beavering away, playing a very important role, it went almost unnoticed in the media.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No Member who acts as a chairman or convenor of an important legislative committee of this House should have to make any apology to anybody if they are allowed an additional allowance for carrying out what will be an extremely <Col N="626" /> important job.  Mr. Gleeson referred to this in his recommendation.  He chairs an autonomous body which recommends to the Minister for Finance and the Government ways in which people should be compensated regardless of whether they take on additional responsibilities.  The media perception is that we grant ourselves additional salaries and so on when the reality is that somebody else makes a recommendation, the Government makes the decision and no backbencher of any party has any role to play or has an input into this matter.</P>
    <P>In today's society Government is a complex business.  Politicians need to scrutinise Government policy and legislation in a commonsense way, they must also have an understanding of the problems which communities face.  They also need to scrutinise in more detail complex measures which can have far-reaching effects.  Such scrutiny would be best served by having an effective committee system.  Legislative committees of this House which examined complex legislation such as the Child Care Bill, the Roads Bill and last year's Finance Bill improved the legislation in a constructive way.</P>
    <P>I welcome in particular the establishment of the Finance and General Purpose Committee which will deal with budgetary legislation.  Very often this is the most complex legislation dealt with in the House.  Armies of accountants and tax lawyers spend a great deal of time and money studying and scrutinising legislation line by line.  It is only right that Members of the House should receive some specialist advice in trying to meet the needs of their constituents in scrutinising legislation and policy in this area and have opportunities to study the issues concerned in detail.  We need to streamline the way in which we do our business in this House to bring it into line with best modern practices.  It is a welcome change that business under a number of headings will be transacted simultaneously at committees in addition to the plenary sittings of this House.  In this way we will be much more effective than we have been in the past.  The introduction <Col N="627" /> of electronic voting later in the year will lead to our operations in this regard being streamlined further.</P>
    <P>The way in which we use our time has also been subjected to public scrutiny. We are extremely busy people and have to balance our duties as legislators with our duty to deal with the problems that confront the public who elect us.  There is without doubt scope for manoeuvre in using our time more efficiently.  Over the years practices and procedures have evolved about the way in which we do our business in the Chamber &mdash; the Minister of State referred to this &mdash; which have not lent themselves to the most efficient conduct of our business.  Important legislation, such as the Social Welfare Bill which effect one in three citizens, have been guillotined while less important legislation can absorb a great deal of precious Dáil time.  This happened yesterday when Members of the Opposition precluded Government backbenchers from debating the important and urgent legislation introduced in the Dáil.  There must be scope for far-reaching agreements across the House on non-controversial issues or simple amending legislation so that more time can be given to debate issues which merit a more detailed examination. Under the new committee system there will be more scope for a genuine exchange of ideas across the table and fewer time filling speeches to keep a debate going.</P>
    <P>The question of the <i>sub judice</i> rule has been referred to.  The proposed changes to Standing Orders in relation to this rule are also to be welcomed.  Indeed, the Labour Party expressed reservations a number of years ago about the restrictive interpretation of this rule.  It is important that Deputies should be in a position to raise matters of urgent public importance in the Dáil having regard to the overall requirement that any matter which might prejudice a fair trial should not be permitted. The new rules will provide for due notice to be given to the Ceann Comhairle on any item to be raised by Members.  That will lead to a fair balance being struck between the public interest, <Col N="628" /> the role of the Legislature and that of the Judiciary.</P>
    <P>The question of declaration of Members' interests has been the subject of wide debate in the media in particular. This is one of the few western democracies where there is no formal mechanism under which Members' interests may be declared.  The Labour Party has long held the view that, as public repreprentatives, it is important for the health of our democracy that we instil confidence in politicians and the political system and that politicians should publicaly declare their interests.  Last year we prepared an Ethics in Government Bill which was voted down by the Fianna Fáil Party and, indeed, by the Progressive Democrats.  I am pleased to say that agreement has now been reached between the partners in Government in the Programme for Government to put a Register of Members' Interests as well as those of senior public servants and members of State boards on a statutory basis.  In accordance with the law local authority members &mdash; I am a member of a local authority also &mdash; have to register their interests in land or property in their authority's area of jurisdiction.  As most Members of this House would agree, members of local authorities have had no problem with this and we are familiar with this procedure.  The new system will extend that degree of public accountability and transparency to Deputies.  The Labour Party believes that this can only lead to confidence in politicians and the political system being enhanced.</P>
    <P>During the recent election campaign the Labour Party pledged to put trust back into politics.  These measures &mdash; the register and the forthcoming Ethics Bill &mdash;will be of importance in re-establishing that trust in politics.  The declaration of interests, of sizeable gifts and political donations alongside the introduction of State funding for political parties and limits on campaign spending, form an important package which will serve to enhance the political process and remove any suspicions the public may have of hidden influences on the actions of those involved in politics.  The public expects <Col N="629" /> that what you see is what you get; and greater openness can serve to remove some of the myths and unfounded suspicions which can flourish in its absence.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach is to be complimented for the way in which he spontaneously declared his own interests on taking up office for the first time last year.  The introduction of a Register of Member's Interests and the ensuing legislation should not be taken by any Deputy as casting any aspersions on any individual Member of this House.  Members provide a service of high standard.  Indeed, many of them have long service in this House, often at significant financial loss to themselves and their families.  Frequently, their family life has suffered.  The only interest many Members would have to declare are their overdrafts.  But this is not an issue on which we should be on the defensive, rather we should welcome the opportunity to clear the air.  A reasonable balance must be struck between the right of the public to information and the right of a Deputy and his or her family, particularly his spouse, to privacy.  In our previous Bill, which was modelled on the Australian system, the Labour Party proposed that the existence of financial interests, but not their amounts, should be disclosed, as was made very clear by my colleague, Deputy Howlin, now Minister for Health, in introducing that Bill in this House.  At no stage has my party envisaged that the actual sums involved in private bank accounts would be required to be disclosed.  Similarly in the legislation being propared by my colleagues in Government, there is no intention that the details of Members' private bank accounts should be subject to public scrutiny.</P>
    <P>Equally, there are areas where it would be desirable that a particular interest should be recorded by the Clerk of the House or other relevant authority, but in some instances where it would not be appropriate for details of that interest to be made public, there could be a balance. The correct balance needs to be struck between the public interest in having information made public and where the public interest is adequately served <Col N="630" /> through a priviate declaration.  For example, I do not believe it is appropriate that details of Members' liabilities be made public, although in many jurisdictions Members are required to declare the existance of liabilities above a reasonable threshold.  Nobody wants to undermine the credibility, financial or otherwise, of Members of this House who try every day, in a daily way and in a difficult time, to represent their constituencies.</P>
    <P>As the House embarks on this course to deal with this, it is important that what we do should be done right.  There is little point in trying to re-establish public confidence if the legislation concerned is clearly full of loopholes as it will have quite the opposite effect.</P>
    <P>I believe we should try to build on international practice in these areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a few points which are important, so I hope you will be reasonably liberal with me.</P>
      <P>We should try to build on the best international practice with regard to declaration of one's interest in property, ownership, partnership or shares in business, debentures or bonds and similar instruments, political consultancies and contracts with public authorities.  These are all vested interests.  I do not see that people should have any hesitation about declaring them because they could interfere with the independence of a Member's role here as a legislator. Interest held in another person's name, which have been purchased by the Member or disposed of for nil value could also be in question, or having client's because of one's political position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of these matters are covered in the register proposed by the Ministers and will be included in the framing of legislation.  I am pleased the Minister gave a commitment to listen to all points of view expressed here.  We will have to address the question of penalties if people breach these.  Any legislation <Col N="631" /> introduced will have to satisfy the test of time to provide for further eventualities, however remote, which we may not even see now.  The scandals currently besetting parties in Italy serve to remind us that corruption can take place and enter the political system.</P>
    <P>This is a new Dáil with an unprecedented number of new Members.  I hope today's debate will set a new beginning in how we can improve the conduct of our business and the standing of the political process in our institutions.  I know only too well how hard Deputies work and how a practical concern for the people who elect us is shared right across the parties and the political spectrum.  I welcome the views expressed.  Let us hope that today we can make a new start in making that work more effective, more open and more accountable to the public who elect us to do a job.</P>

      <P>May I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Dempsey, on bringing forward these proposals.  I have no doubt they will improve efficiency and the use of our time here.  They will improve the throughput of legislation and make the processing of legislation more orderly than it has been to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy Keogh that it will in any way cause a diminution of the role of Deputies, rather it will enhance it.  It will allow for greater participation by Deputies in the whole process of legislation and in the business of the House and of Government.  It will allow Deputies make better use of their time.  I am sure there are many Members who have sat in this House for two and half or three hours waiting for a Deputy on the other side to conclude his or her contribution so that they might speak. Many Deputies prepare speech material <Col N="632" /> but find they do not get an opportunity to contribute on the appointed day.  Then two or three weeks later the Bill may be guillotined so they do not get an opportunity to contribute.  I have no doubt the new arrangement will enhance the role of Deputies and give them a greater opportunity to participate.</P>
    <P>The advent of television in the Chamber certainly drew attention to the fact that at any given time there is not a large number of Deputies in the House.  It is important to reiterate what has been said already, that the vast majority of the Deputies are on the premises and they are working in the Chamber dealing with legislation or in their office on behalf of their constituents.  On many occasions when there was criticism of the small numbers present in this House, Deputies were working in committee rooms processing legislation.</P>
    <P>The committee system is an important new development and is a major reform in this House.  The committees will have wide-ranging powers and responsibilies. They will consider the Estimates and Committee Stage of Bills.  We have already seen the success of referring Committee Stage of Bills to a special committee of the House.  Deputy Ferris referred to this.  The Roads Bill and major legislation on child care in 1991 were taken in special committee.  It is important that we build on that success and I have no doubt the new committee system will be a major advance.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a foreign affairs committee is welcome.  It has wide-ranging terms of reference.  We are all committed to peace and justice, not alone in our own country but around the world. The new committee will deal with matters concerning our international relations.  It will consider EC programmes that may require legislation and will also consider the various EC regulations and directives.</P>
    <P>Each year there is an increasing volume of EC legislation which we are obliged to implement.  It is important for a committee, and indeed for Government, to monitor implementation of the legislation and to study how the legislation <Col N="633" /> is implemented in other member states.  At a time when the emphasis in this country is on the creation of new jobs and the maintenance of existing jobs, it is important that European Community regulations should not be imposed on us here and implemented here in advance of other European nations, very often to the detriment of employment in this country.  That is an issue the foreign affairs committee will have an opportunity to go into in detail, to ensure that EC directives and legislation are regulated in a proper way.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (7) of Appendix 6 of the discussion document on Oireachtas reform dealing with the proposed joint committee of foreign affairs states: &ldquo;That political and security issues relating to Northern Ireland shall not be considered by the Joint Committee.&rdquo;  That is too finite.</P>
    <P>While we all recognise the need for sensitivity in discussing the very tragic situation that exists in the north eastern part of our island, nevertheless there are times when it might be appropriate for that committee to discuss issues that may have a political or security connotation in Northern Ireland.  Perhaps it might be appropriate for the committee to meet the British-Irish parliamentary group which discusses such issues from time to time.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look at the relevant paragraph to see if a formula can be found.  There is provision in the section on the committee on finance to have sessions in private and perhaps that might be appropriate in this case also. There might be an occasion when the Minister for Foreign Affairs or the Taoiseach might want to refer to that committee to discuss something which might be of benefit to them.  It might be possible to find a formula that would take account of sensitivities and, at the same time, ensure that political and security issues in Northern Ireland could be debated or discussed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that MEPs from the whole island will be able to participate in the committee.  With regard to Northern Ireland, from paragraph (7) it appears <Col N="634" /> that it will be appropriate for the committee to discuss economic issues and that, of course, is important.  While the distribution of European Structural Funds is a matter for the Minister for Finance, nevertheless, I have no doubt the committee on foreign affairs would have views and an input in that issue.  The International Fund for Ireland, a fund that has contributed very much to improving the economic lot of the Border region, is also the responsibility of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>I would like to raise an issue relevant to but not specific to this debate, that is, voting.  I have previously raised the question of the provision of a pairing facility for ill Members.  I believe now is the appropriate time to raise that matter again, when we have such a massive majority, the largest in the history of the State.  There is a long established practice here where Members of this House who were seriously ill, and indeed terminally ill, were brought into the Chamber to vote, particularly in votes of confidence to save a Government from defeat.  On occasion, I have seen Members in here after serious surgery.  Their health might have been endangered for life by the very fact that they were brought in here in a wheelchair.  We have seen wheelchairs, stretchers and Members being helped in to vote.  Now that we have such a large majority, perhaps the Ceann Comhairle and the Whips of the various parties might bring forward proposals to ensure this will not happen in the future.</P>
    <P>I do not believe we serve democracy by acting in that way; we do not serve the Irish people and we certainly do not serve ourselves as Members of this House by bringing in colleagues, particularly against their wishes, to vote.  I would like our Chief Whip to look at this issue and bring forward a code of practice that would apply not just for the term of this Government, when we have a large majority, but would apply in the future when a Government may have no majority or a majority of one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking today about Dáil reform in the context of a Dáil <Col N="635" /> that has sat for no more than about 20 days in the past six months.  I would say to this Government that if it is seriously interested in Dáil reform, the first thing it should do is allow the Dáil to sit.  It is an absolute disgrace that this situation has arisen and it is no wonder we have such cynical comments in the media and among the general public about the situation. We are elected to the Dáil to come here to sit in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>I would like to see clear evidence from the Government that it is prepared not just to talk about Dáil reform but to act on it.  Quite frankly, I am not encouraged by what I have seen this week.  Jackboot tactics were used to put a Bill through the House yesterday.  That, to me, is the antithesis of what Dáil reform should be about.  Bills should be properly debated and further time should have been made available to debate that Bill.</P>
      <P>Last evening we had the very late publication of the Estimates.  I have been in this House for the past 15 years and every year we have had a debate on the Estimates. Now we have a Government talking about Dáil reform, but we have no debate on the Estimates.  We have no possibility of investigating the underlying decisions behind the figures.  Is this Dáil reform?  We had a very bad omen this week of the Government's intent in relation to Dáil reform and I remain to be convinced that its intentions are good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, real Dáil reform is necessary. On could look at other countries, for example, the United States, where they may have gone a bit overboard, and the committee system they have in operation there.  Can you imagine what might have happened in this country, if we had a proper committee system, in relation to the allegations that led to the beef tribunal?  That tribunal has already cost in 1992 in the Department of Agriculture Vote, £3.5 million, and other moneys under other votes.  By the time it has completed its findings that tribunal will probably have cost the taxpayer upwards of £10 million.  If we had a proper committee system it is more than likely that we here would have been able <Col N="636" /> to investigate the complaints, at least initially, and thus saved a lot of that expense.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, our proceedings would have been covered by parliamentary privilege.  We would not have the situation where Deputy Spring, now Tánaiste, was able to come into this House and make allegations and then, after the tribunal was set up at enormous expense, to go there and see fit to give what I can only term rather muted evidence.  That would be a further advantage of having a proper committee system.  Essentially our democratic system is ramshackle and needs to be reformed.  I believe, more and more, that the Executive has treated the Legislature as something to rubber-stamp its decisions, as virtually a nuisance to be dispensed with as far as possible.  That will have to change.</P>
    <P>I am all in favour of a proper committee system, but that has to be set up with the right attitude, the right approach, the right intent.  Such committees must be properly resourced and staffed.  They must have proper broad terms of reference.  Ministers must be amenable to and answerable to such committees and they must be willing to attend those committees.  If we have an approach along those lines, then the proposals before the House will have the support of the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    <P>There are, however, serious questions that have to be addressed to which the Minister might reply.  There are rather wicked rumours around this House that this whole rushed approach to Dáil reform and the setting up of committees is merely to provide jobs for the boys and girls, to provide jobs for the recalcitrant, disappointed members of the two Government parties and, in particular, of the Labour Party, in effect, to appoint them as chairmen and convenors of these committes in an effort to buy their silence. If that is the approach, I say to the Minister to forget it, we will not buy that approach.</P>
    <P>Another wicked rumour was that this &ldquo;grab all&rdquo; Government was going to grab the chairmanship of all these committees and, indeed, the other convenor appointments <Col N="637" /> as well.  That would be totally contrary to the democratic principle and contrary to what happens in other democracies. Again, I warn the Minister: if that is the attitude and approach of this Government in pushing through Dáil reform, forget it, we will not agree to that.  We are prepared not just to co-operate but to support the setting up of a proper committee system, but if these wicked rumours have any foundation, not alone will the Government be facing a summer of discontent but a spring and winter too.  We will do everything possible to make sure the Government do not get away with it.  There will be no co-operation whatever from the Opposition for that kind of approach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government should come clean on this issue.  I have a few points I wish to make in relation to the Foreign Affairs committee.  Let me say in general that there is probably a case for some payment for the Chair of committees, but as for this new appointment of convenors, no logical explanation has been given.  It lends fuel to the rumours about jobs for the boys and girls on the backbenches.  I do not recollect it being mentioned in the Gleeson report which went into this whole question and produced a very comprehensive report.</P>
      <P>On the question of the Chair of committees, let me say, very simply, in other democracies more than half the Chairs of parliamentary committees are reserved for the Opposition.  We expect a similar approach to be adopted here.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Foreign Affairs committee I will have to be brief.  I want an assurance that what we have before us is a draft only for discussion and it is not again going to be rammed down our throats.  Again, that will not wear with us.  We want reasonable discussion on the draft terms of reference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister might deal in his reply with a few issues I wish to raise. First, the draft terms of reference state <Col N="638" /> that a number of Members of the Dáil shall form the select committee.  How many Members of each House does the Government have in mind and from what side of the House will they come from? Second, in relation to consideration of the Estimates, I think it will be necessary to broaden the terms of reference.  The committee should be entitled to look at and consider some of the Estimates of the Department of Foreign Affairs and international co-operation.  Bearing in mind that the vote for international co-operation does not cover all the items of ODA, for instance, the Department of Agriculture Estimate in relation to the FAO is classified as official aid, it should be broadened to cover all items of official aid.</P>
    <P>In relation to the provision that &ldquo;the Joint Committee shall consider the impact on equality of policy and legislation in respect of the Department of Foreign Affairs&rdquo;, may I say quite frankly, this is gobbledegook.  What does it mean?  I have considered it from all angles and I cannot ascertain what is in mind exactly.  It could be a gesture to the new Minister for Equality and Law Reform.  I do not know, but the Minister might at least explain it.</P>
    <P>There is also a provision that Ireland's negotiating position in EC and other international affairs shall be excluded from the remit or the committee.  I am not sure this is a wise idea.  Why should not the negotiating position be considered? In Denmark, their committee has a very powerful role.  I understand that over the years the practice has developed in Denmark whereby the Government, prior to every Council of Ministers meeting, presents all the items on the Council's agenda for discussion with the committee.  I have found at EC meetings that the Danish Minister was able to use the threat of the foreign affairs committee in the Danish Pariament as a weapon to get more of his own way at the Council of Ministers' meetings on the grounds that he would have to secure their approval and consent.  I question the exclusion of that function.</P>
    <P>In relation to Northern Ireland, there <Col N="639" /> may be a case for excluding security issues but I have great doubts whether political issues should be excluded.  I want that matter reconsidered.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister explain what is meant in the footnote to item No. 11 which is quite unclear.  There should be transparency here.  People should have to attend and, indeed, the Minister should also have to attend.</P>
    <P>Finally, I note the Chairman is to have only one vote.  This reinforces the tradition as in the EC committee where the Chairman has only one vote, that the Chair should be from the Opposition.  He cannot upset the Government because he is confined to one vote.</P>

      <P>On reading the speech of the Minister this morning I was reminded of a great book I am engaged in reading at the moment.  It is by my own great predecessor, Dr. Conor Cruise O'Brien, it is entitled <i>The Great Melody</i> and deals with the life of Edmund Burke. It is clear when one is reading through this excellent biography that this House still, unfortunately, shares many characteristics of the House of Commons described by Edmund Burke in the mid to late 18th century.  Indeed, it was Basil Chubb who said in <i>The Government and Politics of Ireland</i> that many of the procedures and debating methodology of this House are archaic and badly need to be reformed.  That has to be the starting point of the debate today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Walter Bagehot said a parliament's four basic duties were to make the Government behave, to make the laws and to make war and peace.  As a new TD's first impressions, I suggest that on three of those duties this House is very far from achieving those ambitions.  I hope that under the programme bravely initiated by my colleague, the Minister and Chief Whip, we will now proceed <Col N="640" /> on a path of making this House a relevant and modern legislature like the Bundestag, the National Council of Switzerland or any of the other European or American assemblies behind whom we have badly fallen.</P>
    <P>A newcomer's impression of this House is not great.  First, on this critical debate, we have perhaps a dozen people looking at each other, not really engaged in debate, in contrast with my other chamber of Dublin Corporation, where I am leader of the Rainbow Coalition and where perhaps 30 members will seriously debate with each other on most key issues.  So far, I have not seen that happen in this House.  It is not the best use of parliamentary time to engage in foolish ritualistic procedures on the Order of Business or for people to seem to have themselves deliberately expelled from this House.</P>
    <P>There is also a shortage of general resources available to TDs.  I was surprised I was to share an office with two other TDs due to lack of resources.  I believe it is standard practice.  It is a decade since we had a secretarial assistant. We also have no research assistants. In a competition with, for example, the Library of Congress our Library in most respects would be second best.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy O'Keeffe entering a <i>caveat</i> in relation to the new committees. We have desperately sought these committees for 20 years, as his own colleague Senator Manning, has said so often but the first thing we now hear is that the Deputy is worried about the kind of money that may be paid to convenors or chairpersons.  What we should be doing in these five new committees, if we are serious about reforming this House, is setting up a counter bureaucracy.  We should have officials to research, instruct and, if necessary, write speeches for people in this House and at those committees, and inform them in every way necessary.  That will not happen unless adequate money is provided.  Deputy O'Keeffe mentioned convenors.  Most continental assemblies have rapporteurs. Often in a continental assembly the four <Col N="641" /> or five key committee chairpersons will sit alongside the Minister.</P>
    <P>I warmly welcome the Minister's proposals and I am delighted that I will be a member of at least one of these committees where I hope to give my own ideas on economics and finance.  I would like to see the five committees established and the Members enabled to participate fully in the proceedings.  This can be done if we get the proper resources.  If we do not get the resources the committees will not be successful, they will just be talking shops.  They can be very successful if they have their own staff aided by a good convenor, a good chairperson, with plenty of back-up facilities.  I welcome this development as a way of reforming this House.</P>
    <P>I also welcome &mdash; I know this is primarily for the debate tomorrow &mdash; the Register of Interests.  It is important to know who people are and who they represent. I am now a full-time politician. The Lord Mayor of Dublin said recently that politics was his business; politics is my business too.  When politics is one's business one should get the proper resources to do the job properly.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the relaxation of the <i>sub judice</i> rule.  We have had a lot of tom-foolery in this House over this, even in the short time I have been here.  I hope in future, we can have proper discussion of important matters.</P>
    <P>I would like the powers of the Office of Ceann Comhairle to be greatly strengthened.  For example, could the Ceann Comhairle have his own press office?  He has a duty to protect all the Members of this House.  Recently in a Sunday newspaper a comment was made about me which was totally untrue and which I may have to pursue formally in other areas as I have no other recourse. I would like the Ceann Comhairle to have a press office to represent all of us, irrespective of changes.  I welcome and support the Minister's contribution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>As a new Deputy I welcome any change that will streamline the system because it is still rather confusing trying to get to grips with the existing <Col N="642" /> procedures.  I welcome this motion before the House because a genuine effort is being made to streamline our work.</P>
      <P>The committee system can work and should be made to work.  I sincerely hope it does not lead to subcommittees of subcommittees which could drag out the process and make it more confusing than at present.  That would delay necessary legislation which should be enacted as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Register of Interests for Deputies but I have reservations in relation to its application to spouses.  I do not believe we should encroach on the privacy of spouses.  They are not elected and they do not have to face the public. Serious consideration will have to be given to that area.  Full-time politicians should not have anything to fear in relation to the disclosure of their intentions.</P>
      <P>From a public perception, the existing voting system in this House is seen as a joke.  It has been there for many years but in this day and age it is high time we changed the system and the proposal to change it must be welcomed by everybody. Yesterday, we saw people taken from other meetings where they could have got their business done.  Because of three or four votes, a great deal of time was wasted.  Is it any wonder people have an unfavourable image of us?</P>
      <P>The setting up of the Foreign Affairs committee must be welcomed.  It has great scope in view of the fact that our MEPs may participate and it is also open to our Northern Ireland colleagues.  In the long term this can be of great benefit to Ireland as a whole, particularly to this House.  I also welcome the fact that we can invite members from outside Ireland. Perhaps we could invite our British colleagues to participate at certain occasions.</P>

      <P>I have absolutely no doubt but that if a time and motion study were carried out on the productivity and efficiency levels of this House, the findings of such a study would be a devastating indictment on the stubborn <Col N="643" /> resistance of successive Dáil and Governments over the years to positive change, fundamental reform or restructuring of our procedures.  It is incredible that on the brink of entering the 21st century we should have clung for so long to a scheme of operation where all business is transacted here in this Chamber, where only one Member can speak at a time, where, apart from the Ceann Comhairle, 164 elected legislators are mere spectators or bystanders because only one Member can hold the floor at a time, and where the legitimate input indeed the valuable input of many Deputies is denied to them and to the House because of time constraints or because Ministers and front bench spokespersons get the lion's share of what is going.  This debate, therefore, is very welcome in that it signals a realisation and acceptance that things must change now.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael welcomes the broad thrust of what is proposed in this draft document. Indeed, large tracts of what is proposed are directly taken from the Fine Gael policy document &ldquo;Better Laws, Wiser Spending, Speedier Redress of Injustices&rdquo; produced by a Fine Gael committee headed by our Leader, Deputy John Bruton, and of which I was a member.  We are delighted if the Government should decide to flatter us by plagiarising our views, but we regret our proposals have not been acted upon earlier. Had that happened, it would have prevented much of the odium and scorn poured on this Assembly and its Members last week by a certain tabloid newspaper and radio presenter.  Indeed, the newspaper in question may even now decide to claim that it has stampeded us into bringing forward those proposals now even though they were in incubation well before last week's onslaught.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael has been pushing for Dáil reform for a considerable period of time, not simply as an answer and an antidote to criticism, but as a basic requirement and instrument of doing things better, of making better laws, of ensuring greater accountability and of maximising democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="644" /> A lot of damage has been done to the image, and indeed the integrity, of Members of this House because the mechanics and procedures of the House thwarted any kind of full and meaningful participation by the vast majority of Members, by a failure on our own part to challenge many of the unfair headlines and assumptions which were bandied about and to explain to the population outside how the archaic structures and procedures of this House have made meaningful involvement impossible for very many Deputies.</P>
    <P>As my colleague Deputy O'Keeffe said, we want to warn the Government, however, that even more damage will be caused if the proposal is accepted to have the convenors to the various committees paid as well as the chairperson.  It is legitimate to pay the chairperson of the committees. After all, that person would be presiding over the committees which will be carrying out minute and technical examination on a line-by-line basis of all legislation before them.  This work up to now was carried out here in plenary session in the Chamber.  By presiding over such work in the new committees, the chairperson will have an onerous task and he or she will be acting <i>in loco</i> for the Ceann Comhairle.  It is legitimate, therefore, to pay the chairperson.</P>
    <P>As Deputy O'Keeffe has said, there is absolutely no reason whatever, no justification, no valid defence of the proposal for payment of the convenor.  I listened with interest to Deputy Broughan where he tried to compare the role of the convenor with that of a rapporteur in committees in other parliaments. It has no such role.  There is no comparison or parallel.  It is a riduculous indefensible proposal and Fine Gael will fight it tooth and nail.  If it is proceeded with, it will be simply seen as a Labour Party proposal to placate the increasingly vocal, acutely disappointed and strident, threatening members of the Club of 22.</P>
    <P>Indeed, if you are to translate the principle of paying both the chairperson and the convenor of the other committees of the House as well as the legislative committee then it will simply be a case <Col N="645" /> of &ldquo;one for everyone in the Labour Party audience&rdquo;.  Fine Gael see absolutely no justification for the payment of the convenor of the committee.  This work can be done effectively by way of an instruction from the Chair, it can be done by the Chief Whip of each of the committees, or by an officer of the House.  I do not care who does the work but, as far as we are concerned, no payment should be involved.  This Government has appointed a plethora of advisers and programme managers costing, in total, £1 million.  The gravy train has to stop somewhere and it is going to stop here in this Chamber in relation to these committees.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the general package of reforms, now proposed in draft form, and look forward to a further development and refining of areas not properly addressed in the document, there is no doubt that the proposal to use legislative committees to deal with the Committee Stage of various Bills is the nub of parliamentary reform.  Because the legislative programme was not overcrowded when certain Bills were introduced, they received the line by line treatment they deserved.  How often, however, have we seen in this House a Bill half dealt with and the other half guillotined ruthlessly through, with all the amendments falling automatically except those in the name of the Minister?  How often have we seen emergency legislation bulldozed through by the Government, sometimes needlessly, after a totally inadequate and cursory examination of its contents?  How often have we seen billions of pounds of taxpayers' money forced through the House by way of Estimates with no examination whatsoever, with a nod, a wink and a promise of a detailed irrelevant <i>post-mortem</i> examination at some subsequent stage several months later?</P>
    <P>The dealing with important legislation or handling of public moneys in such a fashion is irresponsible, and indeed is the negation of public accountability.  It is important when we are making laws, that we make good laws.  In doing so we should allow participation by interested parties.  I suggest that in drawing up the terms of reference of such committees <Col N="646" /> we allow for public hearings.  For example, if you are having legislation that deals with Telecom Éireann, then the chairman and the board of Telecom Éireann should be able to come to the committee as should the members of the communication workers union and consumer organisations.  We could then have, at Committee Stage, a properly balanced, well proportioned Bill that will strike the necessary balances and produce good legislation.  The reason so many Bills find their way into the courts is as a result of an inadequate Committee Stage debate in this House.</P>
    <P>I want to see the semi-State organisations, which are the main lever, and the powerhouse of economic developent, brought to the committees as well.  I want to see accountability to committees by semi-State organisations or any organisations which have budgets of millions, and in some cases, billions of pounds but which are insulated from public accountability by reason of semi-State and autonomous role.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>In debates like this, one can grow used to contributions like the earlier remarks of Deputy Higgins which seek to condemn what takes place in this House and refer to the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, John Bruton as the source of all of the innovative proposals which he supposedly sponsored when he was a Minister.  As far as the Department of the Environment was concerned in that term of office there was one reforming piece of legislation, that dealing with dogs.  I suppose we had a lot of bark and no bite.</P>
      <P>This debate is concerned essentially with the way in which we carry out our work in this Office.  The Government is putting forward a package of reforms which, when implemented, will contribute significantly to the effective discharge by the Oireachtas of the role conferred on it by the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Members of this House, we must give a wholehearted welcome to these reform proposals.  The Oireachtas is the centre, the very heart, of our democratic <Col N="647" /> system.  It is essential to the health and well-being of our democracy that the Oireachtas should be effective in the discharge of its functions and should be seen to be so.</P>
    <P>The way we carry out our work in this House and in the Seanad is subject to a good deal of criticism, much of it unjustified, much of it ill-informed.  Some of the more cynical comments, I regret to say, tend to be made by people who not only should, but do, know better.  The Government has resisted the natural inclination in this situation to respond defensively and instead we brought forward proposals which are specific, practical and constructive.  I believe the reforms will make this House more effective, more relevant and more responsive. I trust that all sides will see them as they are, an honest, constructive and open attempt to improve the structures, procedures and practices of the House and thereby enable us to do a better job in the interest of all the people.</P>
    <P>Last year, in the Department of the Environment, we sponsored virtually 25 per cent of the Dáil legislation that passsed through the House.  I would like to thank Deputies on all sides who contributed on Housing, the Environmental Protection Agency and Electoral Reform Bills.  I particularly thank those Deputies who came to Setanta House during August for the Committee Stage of the Roads Bill, without getting a single line in the media for their efforts at the time.</P>
    <P>I would like to put the proposals for Oireachtas reform in a somewhat wider context by relating them to the closely associated field of electoral reform.  This relationship is specifically recognised in the Programme for a Partnership Government which deals with both Oireachtas reform and electoral reform under the general heading of &ldquo;broadening our democracy.&rdquo;  Under this heading, the Government programme sets out a very substantial catalogue of electoral measures.  It proposes: to introduce State funding for political parties; to introduce a system of registration of substantial donations and subscriptions to parties <Col N="648" /> and candidates; and to impose limits on the election expenditure of parties and canditates.</P>
    <P>These proposals have wide ramifications and raise issues which must be carefully weighed.  They require substantial research which will take account, in particular, of the practices and experience of modern democracies elsewhere. To give effect to the measures decided on, a detailed legislative framework will have to be established.</P>
    <P>My Department, as a matter of urgency, is preparing the heads of an electoral Bill to deal with these matters. It is my intention to submit specific proposals for consideration by the Government in the near future.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Government also proposes the establishment of an independent electoral commission to prepare proposals for the revision of Dáil constituencies and undertakes to provide a statutory basis for the Commission.  It also provides for the setting up a commission to prepare a revision of the Euro-constituencies.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that the commission to deal with the Euro-constituencies has already been established and has been asked to report within three months.  It is essential to have any changes in the Euro-constituencies in place in good time in anticipation of next year's elections. for this reason, it was appropriate to set up a commission now, on a non-statutory basis, rather that await legislation and the inevitable delay that this would involve.</P>
    <P>However, the Electoral Bill, to which I have already referred, will include provision for the establishment on a statutory basis of a commission to deal with the Dáil constituencies and any future reviews of Euro-constituencies.  I understand that the necessary census figures for a revision of the Dáil constituencies will be published over the next few months.  On that basis, we can expect to have a statute-based Dáil commission operating in the present year.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Government contains a commitment that the process of modernising and consolidating the various <Col N="649" /> electoral codes will be pursued vigorously. The enactment last year of the Electoral Act, 1992 brought together, for the first time ever, the entire law relating to Dail elections.  We were able to restore the dignity of voting procedures on the day of an election in a way which was widely accepted by the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>I intend to follow this up with a similar Bill in relation to Presidential elections. Substantial progress has already been made with the drafting of this Bill.  I hope to have a final text at an early date and it should be possible to have the measure dealt with by the Oireachtas in the present year.</P>
    <P>Once the Presidential Elections Bill is enacted, my intention is to follow up with a Bill to modernise and consolidate the referendum law.  The ultimate aim is to update all of the electoral codes and to bring the entire body of electoral law into the last decade of the 20th century.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Programme for Government indicated acceptance in principle that there should be constitutional change to give voting rights to emigrants. This is, of course, a complex question, with significant implications for our representative structures, and it has been debated on more than one occasion in this House.  The matter will now be examined in the specific context of constitutional change.</P>
    <P>I think it is both necessary and appropriate for the House to take note of these comprehensive proposals for electoral reform and to set the current proposals in relation to the Oireachtas firmly in this wider context.  The package of proposals contained in the section of the Government programme entitled &ldquo;Broadening our Democracy&rdquo; constitutes a significant and far-reaching blueprint for reform in the public life of this country.  This Government has already demonstrated its appreciation of the need for wideranging reform and we will continue to address this in a constructive, realistic and consultative way in the months ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to dwell, if I may, on the proposals in relation to the reform of this Chamber and, in particular, the proposals for committees to be established.  I appreciate the Minister, Deputy Smith, wishes to advertise the programme of his Department in relation to electoral reform, but we are discussing different matters.  We are discussing this place and why it is not working.  I was elected in 1987 and now, when I come back here, I find that all the same old faults, with a few slight alterations, still persist.</P>
      <P>In relation to the committees I want to deal, first, with the proposed foreign affairs committee.  I have a special interest in that as Foreign Affairs spokesman for my party.  The terms of reference for the committee provide that it cannot consider political and security issues relating to Northern Ireland.  I ask, why not?  In what way can Dáil Éireann consider such matters if it cannot do so in its own foreign affairs committee?  Why should not the Dáil establish a committee to consider a basic aspect of Government policy, namely, political issues relating to Northern Ireland?  I note it is proposed to give a right of audience to Members of the European Parliament North and South to attend this committee.  Those things amount to nothing, on closer consideration. They are a gimmick.  Why would John Hume, for instance, want to attend a committee meeing of this Chamber if it was expressly prohibited from considering the North.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is worse, this sham of a foreign affairs committee is also precluded, according to the proposed Standing Orders for the committee, from considering Ireland's negotiating position in EC or other international affairs.  That means that anything that is on the current agenda and relevant is taken away from the remit of this committee.  That is being done at the behest of the mandarins in Iveagh House who have tried to prevent this committee from being formed since it was first suggested a number of years ago.  They have set out to deliberately emasculate this committee, to make sure no discussion takes place on foreign <Col N="651" /> policy in this Chamber or in any subcommittee of this Chamber.  They have made every effort to ensure that this House will not have any say and that they will not be accountable for the conduct of Irish foreign policy to this Parliament.</P>
    <P>Under the Constitution Dáil Éireann is given a special role, as distinct from Seanad Éireann, in relation to our international agreements and their consideration and approval.  This House does not fulfil that function.  The Department of Foreign Affairs is intent on making sure that none of its officials, and certainly not its Minister, ever come before a committee of this House for the purpose of explaining Irish foreign policy to the Dáil, to which that Minister and that Department are ultimately accountable.</P>
    <P>It is shameful that we could contemplate, and that any Minister of State or Minister could present to this House, a constitution for a foreign affairs committee which excludes that committee from discussing Northern Ireland policy or security matters and which prevents the committee from thinking about, contemplating or considering any aspect of current foreign policy which is the subject matter of a negotiating position by the Irish Government either in the EC or in any other international forum.  How low can we get, to suggest a foreign affairs committee which cannot deal with any relevant international issue in which Ireland has an interest and which cannot deal with the most basic and most domestic foreign affairs issue, the policy matters relating to Northern Ireland?  What a sham we are dealing with here.  It is a sick joke.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, this committee is being given the same powers that were given to the former Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities.  What relevance has that to a foreign affairs committee? Why should the foreign affairs committee consider delegated legislation from the EC on brucellosis testing?  What possible function has it to do something like that? The reality is, it is not going to be a foreign affairs committee.  The purpose <Col N="652" /> is to dress up the former Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities as a foreign affairs committee but make sure it does not do anything useful in the field of foreign affairs.</P>
    <P>Why should a foreign affairs committee consider, for instance, the recent statutory regulations made under the 1972 European Communities Act on unit trust funds?  Why should any self respecting foreign affairs committee attempt to examine regulations of that kind?  This is inexcusable and it is a sham being perpetrated on this House in order to get across the idea that there is genuine Dáil reform.  There is no Dáil reform if this foreign affairs committee idea is a yardstick of what is proposed.</P>
    <P>If the foreign affairs committee proposed cannot consider any issue on which Ireland is at the time adopting an international position either at EC level or at international level, what can it possibly discuss &mdash; anodyne and harmless matters like Latin American politics or general benevolent thought about Third World assistance?</P>

      <P>Except, for we all know, we might have a position on that issue.  This is an elaborate sham and a phoney proposal coming from the Minister of State and it should be rejected as such.  There is no point in masquerading at establishing a foreign affairs committee if what you are doing is resuscitating a committee which is supposed to examine EC regulations made under the 1972 European Communities Act, which has nothing to do with foreign affairs.  The bulk of the material before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities has nothing to do with foreign affairs; it has all to do with agriculture, industry and other matters.  This is an elaborate joke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why has this House been presented with a sham proposal of this kind?  It is to make it appear that there is a foreign affairs committee where none is <Col N="653" /> intended.  It was well known in the two previous Dála that the Department of Foreign Affairs was adamantly opposed to this House having a genuine committee which would look to foreign affairs issues and now it has succeeded because it has persuaded the Government to bring before this House a proposal which is so ludicrous that it will make a laughing stock of any committee.  No Foreign Affairs spokesman for any party would waste his or her time going to a committee of this kind.</P>
    <P>Why should John Hume come to a committee of this House where the two issues he is prevented from talking about at that committee are Northern Ireland and any issue where Ireland has a stance on EC matters.  The only person who may turn up is Dr. Paisley and he may turn up just for a laugh.</P>
    <P>This is a ludicrous proposal and there is no point in dignifying it with very serious or lengthy consideration.  It is a sham.  It is the Department of Foreign Affairs' answer to a legitimate demand that the Parliament of this country should have some say in foreign policy and it is designed to make sure that the Parliament has no say on foreign policy.</P>
    <P>I note one of the Government speakers, Deputy O'Hanlon, has said that Northern Ireland should not be excluded from discussion, but what about the equally ludicrous and pathetic suggestion that international issues on which Ireland has a negotiating position should also be excluded from consideration?  That is like saying we should have a finance committee which never talks about the budget or a law reform committee which never talks about impending statutes.  It is quite absurd and should be withdrawn.</P>
    <P>The foreign affairs committee is one which I looked forward to participating in because I thought, for a change, there was going to be a genuine window for Irish parliamentarians to take an interest in Foreign Affairs.  Alas, I am disappointed. Unless this committee is substantially rejigged and reorganised and unless these miserable terms of reference are withdrawn, we will have nothing to do with it.  If this foreign affairs committee <Col N="654" /> is just given the function of scrutinising legislation made under the European Communities Act in relation to issues which have nothing to do with Foreign Affairs it will be a waste of time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keogh mentioned this morning something which everybody in this House would agree with, that all these committees will have no function at all if Ministers do not turn up to answer policy questions.  As she, so rightly, said this morning, Mr. Justice Hamilton had pointed out that if Ministers had actually answered questions and explained their policies to this House there would have been no beef tribunal, millions of pounds would not have been spent on it and the costly errors it was established to investigate would not have occurred.  I will leave the beef tribunal, having said that about it, but if Ministers really believe they can avoid responsibility to Dáil committees by resorting to the justification given to my party leader, Desmond O'Malley, of the Constitutional difficulty the Taoiseach thought existed in relation to Ministers attending, then we are all being led up the garden path.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As one of the new crew of Labour Party Members, having observed the procedures as they operated in this Chamber, my initial perception is that they <Col N="655" /> leave much to be desired.  We appear to be bedevilled by anachronistic procedures which quite clearly have left the public outside questioning the role of the public representatives in this Chamber. From that perspective, I welcome the proposed improvements which have been outlined here today by the Minister of State, the Government Chief Whip and which I hope will facilitate a vast improvement in the workings of this House.  That would be a clear signal to many people who have a jaundiced view of the operation of the House.</P>
    <P>The section of the Programme for a Partnership Government which deals with the broadening of democracy is to be wholeheartedly welcomed.  As far as I am concerned, I am elected to the Dáil and my principal role should be that of legislator.  Very often, the public perception and the one we have often created for ourselves, is that of a messenger mentality whereby we are very much engaged in parish pump-type politics instead of devoting our time to legislation and legislative reform.</P>
    <P>With respect to my colleague, Deputy M. McDowell, his party was in Government for over three and a half years and some of the reforms here today did not emanate from his party when they were in Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>These reforms constitute an important step forward for which we in the Labour Party can justifiably take a certain amount of credit.</P>
      <P>A number of matters outlined to the House today should be unreservedly welcomed. The voting procedures which have been used in this House are unbelievably cumbersome.  I was shocked at the manner in which people had to line up to troop through the lobbies.  The introduction of electronic voting will certainly get rid of that anomaly which makes the viewing public wonder what we are doing half of the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important also to state that often when Members are not present in the <Col N="656" /> House, they are doing other work.  Sometimes it is very easy for the public to suppose that, because one is not present in the Chamber, one is not present in the Dáil at all.  The committee system will prevent that false impression from gaining greater credibility.</P>
    <P>The committee system will also enhance the working of this Chamber.  It is important that each piece of legislation undertaken on behalf of the Government should be subject to critical analysis.  The committee system will facilitate all Members of the House in that regard.</P>
    <P>I look forward, as a possible member of the finance and general affairs committee, to examining the Committee Stage of the forthcoming Finance Bill. Worthwhile amendments proposed in a less confrontational environment than in the Chamber of this House, may well be taken on board.  We can then truly say that the legislation will reflect the working of the Dáil in total, not of a section of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>In deference to some colleagues on my left, I wish to say no discussions in relation to appointments of chairmen of committees from the back benches has ever taken place in Labour Party rooms. I am disappointed with the tone of the comments earlier, that those would be seen as pay-offs to disappointed Labour Party backbenchers.  That is not their role.</P>
    <P>If we are going to develop committees we should ensure that they have proper resources to facilitate the detailed examination of legislation.  Committees will fail if resources are not made available and if that entails putting in place chairmen and convenors, it is a small price to pay to ensure the committees will operate to the satisfaction of all concerned.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the proposed Electoral Bill.  State funding for political parties, the registration of donations and subscription to parties and candidates and the imposition of limits on election expenditure by parties and candidates will be welcomed through the country.  It will certainly ensure a level playing pitch so far as candidates and parties are concerned, and allow those who do not have <Col N="657" /> the financial resources or backing to contest elections.  It will act as an important means of strengthing democracy.  I welcome the Government's commitment to change the Constitution to give voting right to emigrants.  This is something I have long advocated should be done.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the setting up of a Register of Member's Interests which will be part of the forthcoming Ethics in Government Bill.  I have been a member of a local authority for some nine years and following each election I have had to declare my interests.  It is important that transparency and openness should be demonstrated to the public.  However, I do not see any merit in a proposal to have spouses' interests registered.</P>
    <P>I welcome the relaxation of the <i>sub judice</i> rule.  The guidelines set out in that connection are welcome because they ensure that the principle of the separation of powers, enshrined in the Constitution, will be strictly observed.</P>

      <P>The debate today on Dáil reform is necessary.  In my comparatively short experience in the Dáil, I am convinced that Dáil reform is urgently required but the Government move is a farce.  Several aspects of Dáil reform could be achieved if there was a willingness to do so on the part of the Government, without the need to introduce legislation.  If the Government was serious about co-operation in this regard, much could be achieved and the farce which takes place each morning on the Order of Business could be avoided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Ellis is as good as myself at it.  What has led to it is the frustration of Deputies because they do not have a legitimate opportunity to <Col N="658" /> have their questions answered or their grievances raised.  Therefore, they use the Order of Business to raise matters of concern to their constituents.</P>
      <P>Members' means of eliciting information from Ministers can be achieved only at Question Time, on the Adjournment or in Grievance Time.  If a Deputy puts down questions seeking information from a Minister he finds 95 per cent of those questions are now dealt with by written reply and the reply does not attempt to answer the Deputy's question but rather to evade it.</P>
      <P>Deputies have a legitimate right to ask questions.  If the Government was genuine about co-operation and reforming this House, a serious attempt would be made by Ministers to answer questions rather than evade them.  When a Deputy fails to get information at Question Time he may seek to raise the matter on the Adjournment or in Grievance Time and if his request is granted the same farce is repeated.  The Deputy will make the case and instead of the Minister engaging in real debate will read out a reply carefully prepared by his advisers or civil servants, but not relevant to the question.  It will be for the purpose of giving other information which the Minister wishes to put on the record of the House.  This frustrates Deputies and makes a farce of the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will give an example.  Last night, a matter in which I am interested was raised in the Adjournment.  A Deputy raised the fact that staff from farm development services were being sent to livestock offices throughout the country and, as a result, farm grants could not be paid.  This applies to Galway, Roscommon and to several other areas throughout the country.  Instead of answering the question, we got six and a half pages of a script from the Minister. He dealt with everything except the question asked by the Deputy.  He dealt with the amount of grants paid out and the number of applications for livestock grants which had nothing whatever to do with the question.  In the last few lines he emphasised that clerical staff in farm development services have been transferred <Col N="659" /> and other personnel in that area will continue working normally.  Further assignments of staff to other duties is a temporary measure.  Four lines at the end of a six page speech referred to the Deputy's question.  If this is the farce Ministers intend to continue to engage to in, it is no wonder we want Dáil reform.</P>
    <P>I welcome the attitude of speakers from the Labour Party regarding declaration of interests.  I have no objection to the declaration of Members' interests but this should also extend to civil servants or to people who are in more important positions than Deputies, for example, recently appointed advisers, including some members of families who have been appointed as advisers to Ministers, particularly on the Labour Party side.  Will those people be obliged to declare their interests?  Should the 600 people appointed to State boards since this Fianna Fáil-Labour Government came to power have to declare their interests?  The Government should look at this seriously because people in such important positions are often as influential as Deputies.  Perhaps when we discuss this further I will have more time at my disposal to deal with those matters.</P>

      <P>I welcome this debate, particularly as I understand that it is the first time such a debate has been held in quite a long time.  I welcome the thinking and spirit behind it despite some shortcomings in the recommendations.  It is, indeed, overdue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a newly elected Deputy, I was shocked at the level of cynicism and hopelessness during the general election campaign expressed by the general public and almost on a daily basis in the media. Never has the institution of the Dáil and the cynicism of the public been at such a serious level.  We should not underestimate the consequences of this type of cynicism and thinking.  Disraeli referring to the UK many years ago spoke of a divided nation and the gap between the rich and poor.  It is critical at this time of economic crisis, with over 300,000 people unemployed, that this institution be a <Col N="660" /> model of leadership and efficiency and that there are appropriate mechanisms to ensure speedy scrutiny and enactment of legislation.  Contrary to what the Minister, Deputy Smith, said earlier today, Fine Gael has a proud record of creating a climate of thinking and influencing public opinion to demand Dáil reform.</P>
    <P>This Parliament must be credible and Ministers must be seen to be held accountable within the structures of the Chamber.  By this we should not mean a sham accountability but a real and transparent accountability.  That is the only way to rescue the image of this parliament as a national institution.  An effective committee system, I stress &ldquo;effective&rdquo;, will go a long way towards creating these conditions.  Such a system must mean that the committees are well resourced, able to do their work and that Ministers should appear before them.</P>
    <P>I agree with my constituency colleague that the brief of the foreign affairs committee must be enlarged for it to be effective. I hope that the mechanism which allows MEPs to attend will be developed and used efficiently as I think the democratic deficit which became apparent during the Maastricht Treaty campaign needs to be addressed and this may well be one way of ensuring that happens.</P>
    <P>I very much regret the Government's intention to subsume the work of the committee on women's rights into the new committee system.  I am extremely concerned at this critical time when the Commission on the Status of Women has just reported that such a committee should cease to exist.  It would be a most useful, relevant and timely committee for the duration of this Dáil and I appeal for this decision to be reconsidered.  Its record in dealing with issues, highlighting initiatives and barriers and carrying out research was excellent and I have no indication that its work will be integrated elsewhere.  There is no room for complacency in the area of equality and I ask the Minister to reconsider this decision.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss reform of this House.  I have <Col N="661" /> been a Member of both Houses of the Oireachtas and have served for approximately 15 years.  In that time I have seen some reform, but not as much as I or other people would like.  The establishment of a committee system is long overdue.  Efforts to establish committees prior to this were sometimes thwarted by Opposition parties who felt that it would be more advantageous to have their daily batting session on the Order of Business with the Taoiseach of the day to see what would make the headlines the following day in the national newspapers.  When we take as much criticism as we have taken in recent weeks to the point of being accused of drawing our salaries under false pretences, the people of the press should be present all the time in the same way as they expect us to be present when the House is in session.  The simple fact is that we are here not to represent the press but the constituents who elected us to these Houses.  In doing so, it is important to look after constituency matters and people do not realise that many of us work until 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. on Tuesday and Wednesday nights to clear the backlog of constituency work from the previous weekend.  Many people who criticise us were at home with their feet at the fire while we had to plough the highways and byways of our constituencies to serve our constituents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the past three or four years I was a member of the EC committee and I was horrified to hear Deputy McDowell run that committee into the ground.  It is obvious he is not aware of how that committee performed for the past number of years.  It has done an enormous amount of work and it would be time well spent if he read the committee's reports.  I pay tribute to the chairman of the committee, Deputy Barry, for his help in reorganising that committee and giving it a meaningful role in this House.  If his efforts were fully recorded I believe that Deputy McDowell would not make accusations against that committee.  He probably read the terms of reference and realised that his party colleague, Deputy Cox &mdash; who is also an MEP &mdash; will have the right of audience there as an MEP <Col N="662" /> provided, of course, he has the time to attend having regard to his other duties.</P>
    <P>We cannot be holier than thou in this House because we are here to represent our constituents and if we can do that by means of a better committee system perhaps we will not be ballyragged around the country for non-attendance despite the fact that we are either in the House and working or paired and attending to constituency duties.  People do not want to see their politicians only at election time.  They want to see them if there is a crisis or a problem to be dealt with and if that means that some of us are paired on occasions, we are entitled to do so.  That should be the attitude of the Members of this House.</P>
    <P>We must give the committees resources and back-up to allow them to function efficiently.  I am sick and tired listening to people criticising the appointment of advisers.  Are we to be experts on every possible subject in our own right? Some of us might know a certain amount about agriculture, foreign affairs and so on but we are at least entitled to the same level of advice available to the top civil servants who make decisions on our behalf which, on many occasions, would not be made if they were debated rationally by committees of the House.  We are not here to apologise and I will not apologise.</P>
    <P>A proposed Register of Members' Interests is ridiculous because as far as registration of people's interest is concerned, everybody knows mine and I have suffered for them on occasions like other Members of this House.  We cannot tolerate being our brothers' or our families' keepers at all times.  I do not have a problem on a personal basis with regard to declaring my interests.  I declared them when I became a member of the local authority and I have no hesitation in declaring everything with regard to my membership of this House.  However, we must be careful not to create a situation where people are afraid to take seats in this House because they feel that their personal lives will be pried into on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>We take a lot of stick from the public <Col N="663" /> on a regular basis and it does not matter to what party one belongs.  It is time that this House decided to act efficiently.  We need somebody to project the image of this House because it has been run into the gutter over the past six or eight weeks by people making all sorts of unfounded accusations against Members.  We hear them on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; or on other programmes and 90 per cent of people believe them.  When we go back to our constituencies we are told we were not present in the House.  They do not see the voting records of this House or the pairing arrangements made with the Whips to facilitate Members.  It is time that the Oireachtas appointed a PR officer to protect our image.  I hope the committee debates, where possible, will be broadcast on television or radio.  We do not want the situation to continue where we are seen as 166 Members of an elite club with cosy little arrangements.</P>
    <P>We are all elected here by constituents who want us to represent them.  That does not mean we should put in every minute of the sitting day in this Chamber because, as I said earlier, we must look after the interests of our constituents.  We can only do that by being available to them on a regular basis and by making the necessary contacts via a Department or otherwise.  We all have to go back to our constituents and if we do not look after their interests, they will find somebody else who will.  They are not interested in the fact that we are in the House and unable to look after their medical card or social welfare problems. It is important to have an efficient committee system and we make no apology for putting it in place.</P>
    <P>Deputy Penrose mentioned the voting system.  It is so archaic that it does not deserve to be mentioned.  I believe there is a commitment to bring in electronic voting.  Having had the pleasure of using it in the Italian Parliament as a member of the EC committee, I know it is efficient and would stop people asking why we march like sheep through the lobbies to show what way we are voting.</P>

      <P>I am at a loss to know why the expression &ldquo;Dáil reform&rdquo; is being used in this debate.  I would have thought that &ldquo;Oireachtas reform&rdquo; would be more fitting.  I am sure that the committees which are to be set up will consist partially of Senators.  I would have thought the reform would have covered both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>I feel sorry for the 44 new Members in this Dáil because they are already being lambasted on the airwaves and the media without having a chance to prove themselves. They must be asking what they did to deserve this.  They have not had a chance to contribute and are being lumped in with the poorest of performers in the Dáil.  It is particularly unfair.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to open Government and the Taoiseach made a virtue of saying repeatedly that he will have open Government while he reigns as Taoiseach. That contradicts the facts.  Deputy Reynolds is anything but open in his manner in the House.  He is elusive and defensive rather than open.  If he were open, the business of this House would be conducted in a far better and more fruitful manner.</P>
      <P>My complaint in that regard arises mainly on the Order of Business and at Question Time.  In the Minister's speech there was a reference to a Taoiseach's Question Time.  The quality of Question Time in this House has sadly deteriorated over the years.  There was a time when one could get a straight answer to a straight question.  Unfortunately, that day is gone.  What one is likely to get nowadays if one asks a pertinent question is a lot of waffle and fudge.  One is likely to get a Second Stage speech rather than an answer to a question.  The whole purpose of Question Time is defeated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is probably improper to say unkind things about somebody in his absence but the Ceann Comhairle has a major duty to see that the business of this House is conducted in such a manner that the interests of the Members are best served and, in doing so, the interests of the public are best served.  Sadly, the Ceann Comhairle is not impartial and has not been impartial for a number of years.

      <P>I cannot see how we can discuss the question of Dáil reform without discussing the role of the person who chairs the business of the Dáil.  It does not make sense.  However, I have made my point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Question Time in general the new system whereby we have a Minister a day and take a limited number of questions has been a failure.  We might consider going back to the old system whereby the questions to a specific Minister are continued day by day until they have expired.  If the Minister for Social Welfare has to stay for four or six days then so be it.  At present if Ministers see a particular question is awkward and they would prefer not to answer it, they give long-winded replies to the preceding questions.  The objective of the system is defeated.  Ministers can just carry on with three or four-page answers to a simple question.  It would be better if each Minister <Col N="667" /> had to sit through his whole list of questions instead of being allowed to escape by prolonging the process.  One of the greatest reflections on this House and our system of Goverment occurred in the recent election where a certain Deputy was defeated.  It will frighten people who want to make an interesting contribution here every day.  Former Deputy Pat McCartan, a member of the Democratic Left, was probably the most frequent and pertinent contributor to debates, on the Order of Business and at Question Time. What happened?  He lost his seat.  People who never opened their mouths in this House were elected, some even topped the poll.  There is a sad lesson to be learned from this which will send Deputies back to their burrows doing constituency work instead of coming in here speaking their mind.</P>
    <P>I am not referring to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  He has a smile on his face. He contributes meaningfully when he speaks.  It is a stark reminder of what happens to people who do their duty. Maybe Gay Byrne, Pat Kenny and Gene Kerrigan and the boys who lambaste Deputies might take this type of result into account.  Hopefully, we will not be influenced by it but the people who do their job best of all can lose out and that individual did lose out.</P>
    <P>I do not have any objection to the proposed declaration of means.  My constituents will fall off their seats or crash their cars when they see my overdraft.  I would love them to know my true financial position and maybe they would leave me something in their wills or send me anonymous letters with thousands of pounds in them.  I very much doubt it. Why are other public servants not liable to the same scrutiny as Deputies and Senators?  What do Gay Byrne or Pat Kenny or Gene Kerrigan earn yearly?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulvihill</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to this important debate.  I welcome the Government's decision to make time available in the House to discuss Dáil reform.  I was elected to the Dáil about a <Col N="668" /> month ago and I cannot, therefore, speak with the voice of experience, nor can I claim to have studied the matter of Dáil procedures in any academic or professional manner.  However, I would like to give the House the benefit of my experience of working in the Dáil over the past four weeks.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to understand why such important matters as unemployment and poverty do not find a greater and more central place in the affairs of the Dáil. Surely unemployment is a curse in our community and should find an urgent place in the deliberations of this House? My Cork east constituents find it very difficult to understand why unemployment and their problems cannot be brought to the floor of this House in an effective way.  For example, Cork Dockyard was sold a number of years ago to a Dutch company for £1 million with a promise of 400 jobs.  To date not one job has been created by this company in the dockyard.  People are late for work because the train service from Cork City to Cobh to Youghal is unreliable. Students are late for examinations and for lectures in college.</P>
      <P>There is very high unemployment. The Chair might say that I should raise the matter on the Adjournment but five minutes is not adequate to discuss the unemployment problems of the east Cork region.  I thank the Chair for allowing me time to speak on this matter and I hope we will return to it in the near future.</P>

      <P>Today's debate is timely. I will not be churlish by questioning the motives of the Government in giving us time to debate this important issue or attempt to debunk those motives or question them in any way.  That would be a cynical response to this debate.  It is a much needed and long delayed debate. It was sought after by people like me who came to the House 12 years ago, saw the House working and had observations to make but found it difficult to do so.  I am grateful, as a humble backbencher, to have the opportunity to speak on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dáil has been largely unreformed <Col N="669" /> since it was first set up, 71 years ago. It was a model of the British House of Commons, lock, stock and barrel.  We have a lot to be grateful for from British democracy.  It was a good model to aspire to, as indeed the BBC broadcasting service was a good model for RTE.  However we slavishly followed the British example and did not attempt to bring any practical reforms to bear on the workings of this House in those 71 years.</P>
    <P>Deputies have tried to bring about reform.  They might have had good ideas coming in here when they saw how the House affected relevant matters outside and how it affected democracy in their own lives.  The best university of all is the university of life.  A colleague of mine, former Deputy Barry Desmond, tried to bring in some reforms and Deputy John Bruton &mdash; I have no hesitation in saying that &mdash; also had ideas about Dáil reform although he did not put them into operation when he was in Government.  That would have been the best example of all.</P>

      <P>The working group of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges has also brought in reform.  We need reform in this House and not just talk about good intentions.  The road to Hell is paved with good intentions.  The proposed formation of new committees is a good idea.  It is a step forward which I welcome.  However, the real achievements of this Dáil and the committee system can only be measured by bringing in good legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A good debate can be interesting and illuminating.  We can learn from it but the real purpose of the Dáil is not to be some kind of debating society or undergraduates' day out where one can make debating points; that is enjoyable and <Col N="670" /> interesting but it is not the purpose of this House, it is to put good legislation on the Statute Books and to have a good government.</P>
    <P>I am not impressed by the Fine Gael arguments.  I listened very carefully to them and am most disappointed by their cynical attitude to Dáil reform.  There was no constructive opposition here today only mealy-mouthed attitudes. They tried to belittle the people including my Labour colleagues who contributed to the debate.  They tried to undermine them by casting doubt on their good intentions.  We heard a lot in the past about constructive opposition.  Fianna Fáil were often attacked for being ruthless, opportunistic and cynical in their opposition.  Good Opposition is very important but we saw little of that today. Honest Opposition is very important.  We heard little honesty but many very bad arguments today.  I reject the point Fine Gael made about the Labour Party using this debate as a device to get jobs as chairmen of various committees, with the contempt it deserves.  I am not a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; man, I speak my mind inside and outside this House.  My speech was not turned out by a &ldquo;script factory&rdquo;.  It is my opinion. As chairman of the Labour Party I know that this is not an exercise in opportunism to get handy jobs for us as chairpersons of committees; nothing could be further from the truth.</P>
    <P>In setting up a Government with Fianna Fáil the Labour Party Leader had a difficult job appointing various people to permanent posts. One cannot appoint 33 people to 11 posts.  We are philosophical about that.  Let us hope that the chairpersons of these committees will be appointed on merit only and not because they are friendly with or know somebody in Government.  The media and the Opposition can speculate as much as they like but that is the attitude of the the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>In relation to Dáil reform, we must make the workings of the Dáil more relevant to the public.  My colleague, Deputy Mulvihill, highlighted how difficult it is to put matters like unemployment <Col N="671" /> and poverty on the Order Paper and I agree with him.  There should also be an induction course for new Deputies to show them how the Dáil and Seanad operate.  Deputies can be overawed by the panoply of procedures and precedents, which can be quite difficult to come to terms with.  In a famous book <i>In Place of Fear</i> Nye Bevan, a famous parliamentarian, wrote about what it was like for a miner to come to the House of Commons and how he could be over-awed by the appearance of the building, the stone arches and the magnificant portraits of parliamentarians of the past.</P>
    <P>We need practical reform of the Dáil and mature Dáil Members who will not make a &ldquo;Muppet Show&rdquo; of Question Time and the Order of Business.  That must cease.  We need a better response from the Oppostition in that respect. More time should be available for Ministers and Deputies to speak.  I approve of the changes in the voting procedures.</P>
    <P>I echo the sentiments expressed by Deputy Mulvihill that this debate should be the first in a series of debates on Dáil reform.  We will show the Opposition we are genuine in this regard and that it is not just a one night only like Duffy's Circus.  We will continue to have further debates in this House and will bring about real Dáil reform during the lifetime of this Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the debate on Dáil reform, which is long overdue.  My feeling coming into this House in 1989 was that it was almost like walking back in time to a university debating society where the smart remark was regarded both inside the House and, on some occasions by those covering the affairs of the House, as more important than any studied contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the comments made by Deputy Deasy.  I thank him on behalf of my party for the generosity of those comments in relation to former Deputy Pat McCartan.  I also thank the Minister. That was an example of somebody who took the business of this House seriously. <Col N="672" /> He may not have endeared himself to everybody in the House and some of the contributions he made from time to time may not have endeared him either, but he took the job of the House seriously. He also took his constituency seriously which I know from my friendship with him, yet the end result was that he lost his seat.  He was not alone in that.  The <i>Sunday Tribune</i> published a top ten list of contributors in the lifetime of the last Dáil before the general election, the majority of whom lost their seats.</P>
    <P>In my constituency my colleague, former Deputy Monica Barnes, a superb contributor to the work of this House, who chaired the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights, lost her seat. There is a fundamental question to be asked by those covering and commenting on the work of parliament in relation to Deputies who take the business of the House seriously and do the job they were elected to do, which is to address themselves to the legislative matters before the House, but then find themselves in electoral trouble.  I am not entirely convinced that it is due to a neglect of the nuts and bolts of constituency work because I know that many of the Deputies concerned did not neglect such work.</P>
    <P>It is to some extent due to the fact that the day to day work of this House, the boring, mundane work that goes on here day after day, the Committee Stage of Bills and so on is, by and large, ignored by those covering and commenting the proceedings in this House.  The Committee Stage of the Finance Bill last year dealing with taxation matters and matters which were relevant to every citizen in this State was virtually uncovered.</P>
    <P>It is important when dealing with the question of Dáil reform that a superficial approach is not taken to it.  I want to address myself specifically to the question of the committees which is what this part of the debate is dealing with.  I very much regret two absences from the list of committees. I regret that there is not a specific committee or a continuation of the committee dealing with women's rights.  It is a very serious omission.  I do not think it <Col N="673" /> can be adequately dealt with by encompassing the work of that committee in a broader remit of one of the standing committees.</P>
    <P>Similarly, I regret the omission of a specific committee dealing with European affairs.  I was a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities in the lifetime of the last Dáil.  I agree with Deputy Ellis that, given the resources available to that committee, it was highly productive.  It issued several reports and repeatedly sought time to debate them in the House.  I also agree with Deputy Ellis in relation to his remarks about Deputy Barry's efforts to advance the work of that committee and to reform it.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that, a few months after the passing of the Maastricht Treaty as we progress towards economic and monetary union and European political union as more and more of the work of this House is being driven by the requirements of the European Community, as the legislative work of this House is effectively being intiated in the European Commission and as the Estimates presented to us are clearly driven by the availability of European funds, we will not have a specific committee to deal with European affairs.  The only provision in the terms of reference is that European affairs are to be dealt with by a subcommittee of the Foregin Affairs Committee. The terms of reference are clear in that the matters which that sub-committee can deal with are the proposals for legislation.  It is effectively another secondary legislation committee.  The European committee of the last Dáil made recommendations to this House that the terms of reference of the committee should be widened to include an ability to address all matters arising from our membership of the European Community, and report directly to this House on it; to examine legislation and our role within the European Community in detail and to enable debates to take place in the House.  How will the sub-committee work?  Will it report directly to this House?  Will there be debates on its <Col N="674" /> work?  Will it have resources?  The last committee was seriously underresourced given the volume of work it was required to do.</P>
    <P>We cannot have it both ways.  We cannot, on the one hand, say that we are progressing towards European political union and, on the other, make no serious provision other than set up a sub-committee to deal with our membership of the European Community and all the issues arising from it.  There is no direct accountability, other than through perhaps an occasional question at Question Time, by Ministers for what they do and say or how they represent us at meetings of the European Council.  We need a committee to which there will be direct accountability by Ministers.</P>
    <P>The question of resources was raised in relation to the committees.  I do not want to incur the Chair's wrath by following the point made by Deputy Deasy in relation to the Ceann Comhairle, but the procedures of this House seem &mdash; and the resources for its work &mdash; to be very heavily weighted in favour of the Government. In addition to all the resources of the Civil Service available to the Government for the preparation of legislation and work that comes before this House, an additional £2.5 million is being spent on the provision of various forms of assistance to Government Ministers. Whatever resources are being made available to these committees appear to be purely in the form of chairpersons for and convenors of the committees.  What resources will be provided for those of us who will be expected to be members of these committees and address legislation or matters put before them?</P>
    <P>One suggestion which would not necessarily involve additional resources is that a system should be devised whereby the civil servants attending the committees from the various Departments would be in a position to answer questions directly and contribute to the discussion.  The existing system where a Minister may not be familiar with the details, for example, of a question or amendment and is passed slips of paper with the answers on them will have to <Col N="675" /> end.  There should be some kind of direct communication between Members of the House and the civil servants who are responsible for the legislation on the matter under discussion.</P>

      <P>The proposals for the Dáil reform are welcome.  There is agreement on all sides that it is necessary to make the Dáil relevant to the world outside and responsive to the problems experienced by our constituents.</P>
      <P>Many speakers referred to criticism of Dáil Deputies in newspapers and elsewhere. I used to be a great newspaper reader but, since my election, I very seldom get time to read them.  I certainly will not be influenced by what I have read.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>That paper would not normally be on my purchase list, but even other newspapers apparently have been critical.  I hope Members who have been here a long time will not be offended if new Members are critical of the procedures. For instance, yesterday I would have liked to have spoken on the Bill going through the Dáil.  It will almost certainly be the only Bill in the life of this Dáil, and perhaps the only one in the life of several Dála that will be relevant to life in my own parish, but, because of the procedures adopted, I did not have an opportunity to speak on Second Stage.</P>
      <P>There is general welcome for the promised Ethics in Government Bill.  We all agree that there must be provision for a sensible register of Members' interests and those of us who are members of local authorities are already familiar with such a procedure at that level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Order of Business and Question Time were referred to by a number of Deputies.  My impression is that they achieve virtually nothing except perhaps to confirm the view of many of us that they are used almost exclusively to make irrelevant points and to gain for the people involved a certain amount of notoriety and publicity.  Some of the <Col N="676" /> blame for the perception of politicians in the newspapers recently must be laid at the door of politicians themselves.</P>
    <P>One matter frequently highlighted is the small number of Deputies present in Chamber.  Yesterday, during Second Stage of the State Authorities (Development and Management) Bill a number of Opposition Deputies berated the Minister, Deputy Higgins, for not being present when they were well aware that he was attending a most important parliamentary party meeting.  They also-berated him for not making a contribution to the debate when they knew that their activities would ensure nobody on the Government side would have an opportunity to say anything on the Bill because of the time constraints.</P>

      <P>I might not agree with the Minister on everything but it was grossly unfair to single him out in that manner. In a sense we deserve the criticism we get when it is intiated in the Chamber and carried a little further in the press.</P>
      <P>I welcome the committee system particularly since I understand the previous experience has been that it provides an opportunity for backbenchers to have their ideas and amendments incorporated in legislation.  The greatest weakness of the Dáil is that its structures inevitably led to an executive system where all decisions are made at Government level and where, because of existing procedures, there is limited opportunity for backbenchers and others to have an input.  The system will only work if the Departments preparing legislation work in co-operation with the committees. That does not just mean briefing the committees. It will also have to allow for the members of the committee to have an input.  It will have to be a two way process and the committee's proposals and suggestions will have to be taken on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The foreign affairs committee will place Oireachtas Members closer to the decision-making process and will, in particular, <Col N="677" /> improve communications between the national parliament and the European Community legislative process. The consideration of Committee Stage of relevant Bills by this committee will be an improvement on the previous position.  This is one area which needs reform.  There is a strong perception, and I certainly hold the view, that many decisions that most affect people are taken outside the Chamber and outside the country.  There does not seem to be correlation between decision-making at European level and the proper role of decision-making at Oireachtas level.</P>
    <P>I hope that the establishment of the Enterprise and Economic Strategy Committee will allow individuals who have strongly held views on the key elements of national policy to make constructive comments on legislation, to influence its direction and provide the impetus to initiate legislation.  Politicians know the views of those whom they represent but they have very little opportunity to make their views known and ensure they are reflected in legislation and in policy generally.</P>
    <P>If the role of the new committee is confined merely to considering Estimates and to dealing with legislation on Committee Stage, then their potential will not be realised.  I urge the Government, in determining the terms of reference of the committees, to make provision for them to initiate business in the House and to put to Government proposals for the initiation of policy.  The value of the committee will depend to a huge extent on their being in a position to initiate such action rather than considering on Committee Stage whatever is proposed or examining Estimates which will, in effect, have been spent already.</P>
    <P>Regarding Dáil reform, it should be borne in mind that many Deputies live a long way from Dublin and can spend three or four hours travelling to and from the city.  On the other hand, many live within reach and travel home virtually every day.  It should not be beyond the ingenuity of the Dáil and Seanad to devise a system that would accommodate rural Deputies in making contributions <Col N="678" /> mid-week and accommodate relatively local Deputies who could do some of their business at night, make more frequent visits and contribute on Fridays. The present rostering system should be expanded further to allow Deputies to avail of the opportunities that time presents to make a better contribution in the House.</P>

    <P>Somebody should be responsible for public relations in this House to counteract the rubbish we hear regarding the workings of Dáil Eireann.  The public might not understand the system because <Col N="679" /> it has never been explained to them, but broadcasters, who probably earn the income of 20 Deputies put together, use this as a means of lambasting politicians.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that a time limit will be imposed on Second Stage speeches. There should be no need for Deputies to sit in the Dáil Chamber for most of the day waiting to take part in a Second Stage debate when it can be heard and seen in all the offices.  The people who broadcast to the nation should explain that aspect to the public.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kemmy spent much of his time criticising Fine Gael for their attitude in Opposition.  I wonder if the first reform of the Dáil is that the Labour Party seems to be so absorbed in Government that criticism from the Oppostition is no longer acceptable.  Just a few months ago he would have been using his mason's hammer to clobber Fianna Fáil Ministers who suggested this.  Without even going to Lourdes, Deputy Stagg was miraculously cured of his anti-Coalition feeling and is now a Minister.</P>

    <P>As regards housing, the Government is starting from a great base because a 100 per cent increase could mean few <Col N="680" /> houses, but it would be a marvellous increase on nothing.</P>
    <P>Reform should begin with questions and answers.  I miss the former Taoiseach, Charles J. Haughey.  At least he had an answer for everything although it would take perhaps half an hour to decide whether it had been satisfactory.  On 60 occasions during a short period the Taoiseach has answered thus: &ldquo;it is in the early course of preparation&rdquo;, &ldquo;shortly&rdquo;, &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo; or &ldquo;in the course of preparation&rdquo;.  This is another way of saying he does not have the remotest idea about what he is being asked.  That is why the Ceann Comhairle gets into such difficulties.  It is very hard for Deputies to accept such answers.  No matter what Ministers are asked questions, the Taoiseach answers.  It is as clear as daylight that he cannot even distinguish between men and women as proved yesterday in regard to his list of nominees.</P>

      <P>It is interesting that so many people wish to contribute to this debate.  It is understandable because Deputies who have served in this House for a number of years feel that their work, time and effort do not always bear fruit.  There is great public disquiet at the economic and social difficulties facing the country.  I suspect the public believe that Members of the Oireachtas are either unable or unwilling to address the issues properly. That is no surprise.</P>
      <P>Deputy Browne mentioned the failure of the Taoiseach and Ministers to give appropriate answers to questions posed, but on a daily basis, matters of public importance are raised which the Chair must rule out of order.  Until we reach a stage where the Dáil is seen as relevant and a body which can respond immediately to the problems of the day, the public will continue to believe that we are not doing the job for which we were elected.</P>
      <P>As a backbencher, I often feel that my role and that of my coleagues is quite irrelevant.  We are here simply to rubber stamp legislation.  I hope the new committee system will give us an opportunity to make an input into legislation and, for that reason, I welcome the committees.</P>
      <P>I support Deputies who expressed disappointment and concern at the reported decision not to have a committee on women's rights.  I am a former member of the outgoing committee on women's rights which was relevant and dealt with issues which might otherwise have gone unreported.  I hope the Minister concerned will reconsider this decision.  It is disappointing that, at a time when we are about to discuss the report on the Second Commission on the Status of Women, the forum within the Oireachtas to debate and decide such matters is to be taken from us.  I hope there will be a rethink on that matter.  Secretarial assistance and other facilities are not available to Deputies.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 4 and 40 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will, of course, co-operate with and take advice from groups like the new National Economic and Social Forum, when it is set up.  I have already met both the IBEC and ICTU and exchanged views on the main issues of concern to my Department.  However, I am concerned at the suggestion in one of the priority questions that it is more analysis, advisory inputs and consultation that we need now.  My priority will be to achieve implementation of sound and sensible strategies for development.  I regard the implementation of the Culliton report <Col N="683" /> and recommendations as a priority for Government action.  There are issues and actions within it for which I am responsible together with my Department and the agencies which report to my Department, and I intend to progress these rapidly over the next few months.  It is by selling more or by getting a better price for what they sell, that our firms can maintain and expand the numbers at work.  I intend to focus policy on helping to upgrade basic business capabilities in firms and in their workforce so that the ability of firms to compete, win and hold increased market share is enhanced.</P>
    <P>Not all issues and factors that impact on competitiveness are matters for which I am responsible within my Department. However, within a partnership Government I look forward to working jointly with my colleagues in Government to ensure that efficiency, effectiveness and competitiveness of business is a top priority consideration on the agenda of the partnership Government.  The Programme for a Partnership Government will be the basis of our approach.</P>
    <P>Broadly, I see increasing competitiveness, competitive advantage and capability levels as my primary focus both in my Department and jointly with colleagues in Government.  The advice of bodies like the National Economic and Social Forum as well as the Central Review Committee and NESC, will be helpful in that connection.</P>
    <P>Actions and programmes to enhance the skill levels of the workforce, including those who are unemployed, to increase their employability, versatility and range of ability and to provide opportunities for them to apply and develop their skills, go hand in hand with the programmes for raising levels of competitiveness in our economy.  I intend to see such actions and programmes developed to ensure that people have the skills required to increase their ability to gain and maintain employment.  I intend, in particular, to give priority to tapping local initiatives and, as a result, I will be giving special attention to the establishment of the county enterprise partnership boards.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="684" /> A major contribution to facing the challenge of increased competition has been made in recent years by employers, trade unions and farmers working together at national level with the Government towards common goals as set out in the Programme for National Recovery and the Programme for Economic and Social Progress.  I endorse this approach in our society of moving from conflict to consensus and I hope we can continue along this road in spite of a difficult external environment which has in turn caused considerable problems in our economy both economically and socially.  It is precisely in such difficult circumstances that we need to co-operate at both national and local level to ensure that sectoral interests do not endanger overall progress.  Both the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> were conceived in adverse circumstances but they have both proven to be useful to all the interests involved. Any future agreement has to achieve that objective but I would hope, in spite of the difficulties there will be in future negotiations, that we can continue on the path of consensus and co-operation in the interests in particular of those who are without employment in our society.</P>
    <P>I will, therefore, be supporting the continuation of the consensus approach when the present agreement ends at the end of this year.</P>

      <P>In systems of collective Cabinet Government and more <Col N="686" /> particularly in a partnership Government, there is a co-operative and mutually supportive effort by different Ministers to achieve, cohesively shared goals.  It is true that the Culliton report advocated a market-led industrial policy. Equally, it emphasised that competitiveness is influenced by many public policies and actions other than industrial policy.  It advocated a broader approach to attaining competitiveness which would make policies for industry, enterprise and jobs a priority for all Ministers and Departments.  That is the approach of this Government and the Minister for Tourism and Trade, as much as any other Minister, will be a partner in Government to achieve a competitive, market-led industry policy.  I am happy that we have such shared aims and endeavours.</P>
      <P>Far from weakening our employment creation effort, exports and trade are the life-blood of a country whose exports constitute a greater percentage of GNP than other countries in the European Community with the exception of Belgium and Luxembourg.  Our ability to maintain and create jobs here at home depends above all in being able to produce goods at competitive prices for export.  In view of that the trade, export and marketing elements are of critical importance and we downgrade it at our peril.  We are above all a trading nation and, in view of this, is it entirely logical that trade should be picked out and given a special emphasis?</P>

    <P>The Minister concurs with the thrust of my question when he recognises that nowhere in the Culliton report is there a mention of splitting up the functions to which I referred in my question; the opposite is the case.  Would the Minister, therefore, accept the integration on a more focused way of the functions of An Bord Tráchtála and the IDA in particular with regard to what they identify as the weaknesses in indigenous Irish industry, marketing, research and development functions?  The Minister has placed them under a separate Department thereby <Col N="687" /> further dissipating the whole thrust of what Culliton is about.  I am at a loss to know how this can directly contribute to the creation of jobs.  Would the Minister enlighten me further on that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This House broadly welcomed the Culliton report and shared the thrust of all its recommendations.  There are different ways those recommendations could and will be implemented. This administration formed the view that a separate focus on foreign trade was essential, having regard to the statistics to which I referred earlier.  To do that does not mean in any way that one Department will be in competition of a negative kind with another.  I am quite satisfied that my Department, and the Department of Tourism and Trade, will be able to combine the best elements, as set out in the Culliton recommendations, to ensure that there will not be any adverse or negative results such as are feared by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that he is now, in a convoluted way, gaining responsibility in these areas? Focused and collective responsibility will be spread so far that the clear thrust of what I am talking about &mdash; all our energies in a specifically focused way, particularly how we utilise our State agencies &mdash; will be further dissipated by what is happening.  Would he agree that this was attempted in 1982 by the British Government who abandoned it within two to three years?  Would he accept that the best way to proceed is through our embassies beefing up their commecial sectors which is the way the most successful countries operate in terms of foreign trade relationship?  The Minister has linked foreign trade to tourism which does not make any sense.</P>

      <P>There are many examples from which we could learn from the failures of the British Government.  I do not believe in this instance that what is proposed by us will lead to the sort of failure to which the Deputy refers.  On the contrary, given the scarce resources we have there is a great logic in promoting the image of Ireland from a tourism point of view and our foreign trade under the one Department.  There is an economy of resources that can be utilised there and it is a sensible division of tasks within the collective responsibility of a Government.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Enterprise and Employment</askee>
      <Quest>if he will raise the IDA grant aid for industries starting up in Dublin's Inner city to 60 per cent so that it is a level similar to other employment black spots.</Quest>
      <QRef>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the designation system, industrial projects in designated areas qualify for a maximum fixed asset grant rate of 60 per cent.  This contrasts with projects in non-designated areas which qualify for a maximum grant rate of 45 per cent.  In addition, industries in designated areas may get a two-thirds remission of rates for ten years at the discretion of the local authority. However, the fact of designation does not automatically guarantee support at the maximum rate nor does it guarantee rates remission.</P>
      <P>The importance and impact of designation in industrial policy has lessened in recent years and maximum rates of fixed asset grants are seldom given.  The grant level proposed for any project increasingly depends upon the economic benefits in individual projects.  There is also a major shift away from fixed asset grants to supporting other areas of perceived business weakness e.g. marketing, research and development and management development.  Support and grants in these areas are not differentiated on the basis of designation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Culliton report proposed, among <Col N="689" /> other matters, that there should be a decisive shift from grants towards equity and that most of the grant schemes for indigenous industry should be scaled-down. The group felt that the fact that most industrial expansion and involvement by the State agencies involved a grant resulted in an unhealthy dependency mentality on the part of many indutrialists. Furthermore, greater selectivity continues to be pursued by the agencies with a reducing cost per job figure.</P>
    <P>This in no way diminishes the primary role of our industrial policy which is to secure as many sustainable jobs as possible within the economy.  However, this has to be achieved in the context of securing the best value possible for the expenditure of scarce resources.  Designation as such does not automatically lead to this.  In the light of Culliton's comments, and the manner in which our industrial policy has evolved over recent years, further gains can be achieved through the optimum use of the existing range of industrial supports rather than seeking to extend this range to particular areas.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that projects suitable for grant aid locating in inner city Dublin tend to be small businesses rather than large capital intensive industries. The grant aid packages for small businesses tend to be concentrated on employment grants and other non-fixed asset forms of assistance, including grants for management development and feasibility studies.  Thus, the issue of designation is of little consquence because it is only capital related grants which are differentiated on the basis of designated status.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister explain why Dublin's inner city was designated between 1983 and 1988 for the maximum grant and then, for some obscure reason, that was dropped?</P>
      <P>Is it not the case that being designated does not guarantee the maximum 60 per cent grant?  The inner city is not designated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some large sites in the East Wall area designed for high-tech parks <Col N="690" /> which are not, as the Minister has been indicating, for small industries.  Surely in that instance the availability of a 60 per cent grant would be useful?  Does the Minister accept that since 1975 only 23 per cent of grant-aid to industry went to Dublin and productive employment in that time in Dublin was reduced from 37 per cent to 26 per cent?</P>

It is because of persistently high levels of unemployment. I am not sure why designation was not renewed five years after it commenced. I will certainly look at that.  I share the Deputy's concern about the continued failure of Dublin to receive the level of employment assistance to which it is clearly entitled.  The fact that I share a constituency on the other side of the river with the Deputy has nothing to do with that.</P>

      <P>Directive 87/102/EC was due to be implemented by EC member states by 1 January 1990. However, it was amended in a number of significant respects by Directive 90/88/EC which was to be implemented by 31 December 1992.  Its preparation has necessitated considerable research and widespread consultation with a large number of bodies, institutions and individuals. The option of implementing these measures by way of an Act of the Oireachtas rather than by way of regulations has unavoidably contributed to the delay.  The Consumer Credit Bill will constitute a major legislative measure.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to say that the Bill contains a series of provisions to tackle in particular the problems of excessive loan charges and unlicensed moneylending.</P>
      <P>The Bill will introduce a body of reforms which go beyond the strict requirements of the Directive, will consolidate existing consumer credit law in one unified Bill and will address in an innovative and effective way problems associated with moneylending.</P>
      <P>It is envisaged that the maximum penalties for unlicensed moneylending will be increased to £50,000 and/or five years imprisonment.</P>

      <P>I accept that the legislation we will implement &mdash; I know it will have the support of the House &mdash; will be of a punitive and prohibitive nature.

Will the legislation deal with this or will we continue to depend on the St. Vincent de Paul Society to bail out the Government when it fails to deal with the real issues?</P>

      <P>The legislation will be of a punitive and prohibitive nature in the main.  That is only one part of the answer.  I clearly admit the need for a range of measures across Departments so that the wider issues of poverty and the issues which I freely agree with the Deputy lead people to depend on unlicensed moneylenders can be addressed. One is the educative process &mdash; community education, adult education and <Col N="699" /> measures which will give people a knowledge of their rights, of the way to budget and address their problems.  We need to deal in a comprehensive way with the issues raised today.  The Deputy asked if the legislation would address that? Obviously, it cannot because it will address a specific issue and implement EC directives.  I have spoken to a number of Ministers and Ministers of State who freely agreed that there is a need for a cross-departmental review of these problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos, 8, 22, 36, 46 and 48 together.</P>
      <P>The Programme for a Partnership Government indicated that the Government would establish, under the aegis of Forfas, two separate and autonomous agencies, to be known as Forbairt and IDA-Ireland, each with its own board, managing director and grant-in-aid.</P>
      <P>Forbairt will be empowered to develop indigenous industry and will be organised sectorally with a strong regional base. IDA-Ireland will be empowered to attract international mobile investments to Ireland.  Forfas will have its own chief executive and will exercise certain co-ordinating functions.</P>
      <P>It is my intention that the legislation establishing these structures will be in place by the summer recess of the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The fundamental rationale behind the establishment of these structures was set out in the Culliton report.  It has now become axiomatic that there is a need to have a changed emphasis in the way we seek to develop indigenous industry. There is a consensus on the need to move away from the stright grant or project financing approach to one based on building the capabilities of companies in an integrated way encompassing management, technology, marketing, financial and other functions.  Forbairt is intended to facilitate this approach.</P>
      <P>It will address the much criticised feature of the present system, whereby small Irish companies with limited managerial resources are forced to go to three separate agencies with different information requirements when their development needs indicate an integrated package of all of those components.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard, Culliton recommended <Col N="705" /> that all grant-giving and advisory supports of a functional nature provided by IDA, ABT and Eolas be brought together within one agency.  I, therefore, am currently considering how best to achieve that objective in the context of the establishment of the Department of Tourism and Trade and the assignment of ABT to the Department.</P>
    <P>The proposed organisation is consistent with Culliton's reasoning that the present structures do not place the necessary emphasis on the core of industrial policy.  It will also ensure that State support for the development of businesses will be integrated, cost-effective and cohesive.</P>
    <P>As regards IDA-Ireland, this agency will be empowered to attract internationally mobile investment to Ireland. Its main focus will be on the broader development needs of the industrial base in Ireland coupled with the realities of trying to secure internationally mobile investment at an optimum cost.</P>
    <P>All the existing range of State assistance will remain available to both Forbairt and IDA-Ireland.  However, because of the specific functions allocated to each agency, it will be possible to have a clearer focus on the measures of assistance required and the optimum areas which need addressing in an integrated manner.  In this context, there will be a greater emphasis on those grants which will help build up the fundamentals of firms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>On reflection, does the Minister consider that the best approach to the endemic and horrible scale of unemployment now obtaining is that we engage in further bureaucracy?  We have a Department of Enterprise and Employment, the National Economic and Social Council, the National Economic and Social Forum, the IDA, Forfas, Forbairt and county enterprise boards.  What the people are really looking for is the jobs these institutions can help create.  Does the Minister acknowledge that given the horrifying levels of unemployment we have, people will soon expect more than a mere reiteration of the implementation <Col N="706" /> of Culliton which, in the first instance, was expected to do no more than contribute about 10,000 jobs annually?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the main thrusts of the Culliton report in respect of agencies was to eliminate bureaucratic overlap and to integrate them into what is known as the one stop shop approach.  This was particularly for indigenous Irish industry which has a low managerial base and does not have either the time or the resources to go from one agency to another and comply with a different set of criteria in order to obtain assistance.  To that extent, the thrust of the Culliton report will be implemented by this administration.  The legislation is in the course of preparation and it is my intention to have it enacted, with agreement of this House and the Seanad, before the summer recess.  In order to avoid the bureaucratic difficulties we experienced in the establishment of FÁS, it is also my intention as soon as possible and practicable to establish interim boards that would reflect the proposed structures so as to minimise any difficulties that might arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply is fine up to the point about Forbairt and the IDA with regard to mobile investment. Then he moved on to talk about a Department of foreign trade and that the link is breaking down in the relationship between the two and his ability to control what happens.  Culliton continually emphasised indigenous Irish industry and the weakness on the research, development and marketing sides.  How will these companies, working through different agencies and effectively through different Departments, have streamlined access to the market which can deliver jobs at the base level we are talking about?  It is not clear from his reply that bureaucracy is being removed.  It seems to be further compounded by involving a separate Department in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree there is any lack of clarity.  Basically, what An Bord Tráchtála has done in the past has been to help companies to sell at home and <Col N="707" /> abroad.  We are focusing, in the new structures on selling abroad because of the importance to trade.</P>
      <P>If we learned anything over the past few months, it is the absolute necessity to diversify that trade in a structured manner.</P>
      <P>My Department, and the agencies under it, will have primary responsibility to assist indigenous industry in a focused and clear one-stop-shop manner on how it can develop and trade at home.  There is logic in all of that if one has regard to the Porter Book which influenced the deliberations and considerations of the Culliton report.  It was to enhance and encourage clusters of competitive indigenous industry at home to the point where they were strong and big enough to trade abroad.  That kind of approach is actively mirrored in the approach we have structured in these two Departments. I do not see any conflict whatsoever.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be fair to say that the final role for these bodies has not yet been determined and I would welcome the assistance of this House in the processing of the legislation to so define.  I envisage that wherever a person is located in indigenous industrial terms, be it in the Gaeltacht or in the Limerick region there will be no ambiguity as to which agencies that person, he or she should call upon to seek all the necessary domestic assistance that is available.  It would be the intention of my Department to ensure that there is no ambiguity or confusion in the minds of any would-be entrepreneur or small industry seeking to expand as to which agency should be approached for comprehensive assistance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the commendable logic of the one-stop-shop, how does the Minister propose to integrate the county enterprise boards, which I understand are now his responsibility, into this structure since some will necessarily deal with small and medium sized enterprises?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The question is a pertinent one.  Having regard to the fact that it is now my Department which has responsibility for the county enterprise boards, we are in the process of designing a structure that will provide a continuous stream of assistance to established indigenous industries on the one hand down to the small community enterprise type of activity that would seek assistance.  We are attempting, against a very difficult unemployment background, to ensure that scarce taxpayers' resources are used to maximum effect. We are not in the business of establishing bureaucratic empires to complete against each other.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Why does the Minister see the need to have a supervisory agency as well as his Department which was charged by Culliton as having the essential policy thrust?  Why have this second part of the pyramid?  In relation to major projects, is there any danger that the internationally mobile investor will have access to more favourable terms than an Irish person who has to go through the alternative body?  Does the Minister envisage the regional base which is supposed to be knitted in with the sectoral breakdown having its own devolved decision-making powers or is it to be a branch office of this board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is need to ensure that the role and activities of IDA-Ireland and Forbairt are complementary, are not wasteful or in any way duplicating each other's activities.  That is the primary, if not sole function, of Forfás and it will become clearer when the legislation is brought to this House that the membership of the board of Forfás will reflect elements of the membership of <Col N="709" /> both the board of IDA-Ireland and the board of Forbairt.</P>
      <P>In respect of the sectoral and regional division of the activities of the indigenous side of Forbairt, we are trying to reflect the need to avoid travelling to Dublin to a Government Department or a Government agency, while at the same time getting the strength in cluster terms by dealing sector by sector with industrial manufacturing and general enterprise needs.  Given the geography of this country it could be argued that that might not be a heavy-handed way of doing things and I am conscious of that.  We will consider what is the best for each region and where as referred to by Deputy Noonan there are agencies <i>in situ</i> such as Údarás na Gaeltachta or SFADCo we will try to utilise the strength and market position of those bodies.</P>
      <P>As regards the Deputy's last question about a preferential rate of financial assistance between one body and the other, it is precisely to avoid such a conflict that the Forfás linkage holding company is being established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree to think again about breaking up the IDA; if it is not broken, why fix it? Will we not lose valuable time in the fight against unemployment by allowing a situation to develop where institutional rivalry will be inevitable?  If the question is one of refocusing the interest of the IDA on indigenous industry, surely that can be done without creating a multiplicity of new agencies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question would be valid if it were not for the resounding consensus of opinion contained in the Culliton report which effectively said the IDA could not do the two jobs simultaneously.  It also stated that the culture, ethos and energy required for IDA-Ireland to attract mobile investment into this country was virtually incompatible with helping Irish indigenous industry to prosper and grow.  For a variety of reasons, with which the Deputy is no doubt familiar, the mobile investment <Col N="710" /> that comes to this country already has research and development capabilities, an international market and an international distribution network &mdash; all the things Irish indigenous industry does not possess.  I am sure the IDA is not broken.</P>
      <P>The thrust of the Culliton report suggests it is not achieving the objectives for which it was established and hence the reason for dividing it.  I have been down this road before in relation to the White Paper on manpower services that led to the National Employment and Training Agency Bill which subsequently became the FÁS Bill and I assure the House that neither I nor my two colleagues will allow any territorial rivalries to grow up during the next couple of months in respect of the utilisation of taxpayers' resources for the development of industry. I want that message to go out loud and clear.</P>
      <P>The heads of the Bill are in the course of preparation at present.  The draft memorandum is currently before my colleagues at Cabinet.  It is my intention to introduce the Bill shortly and to put the personnel in place so that we will learn from the lessons of how FÁS was established and the delays which accompanied the filling of personnel positions over a period.</P>

      <P>How is it proposed to select the membership of the various boards?  Would the Minister agree that his options have been considerably reduced in view of the fact that the boards of Eólas, NET, Coras Tráchtála and various State agencies were unceremoniously filled in the run up to the negotiations to form a Government? Why did the Minister, as one of the architects of the new Coalition government, stand idly by while hospital boards, some of the main levers of State and economic boards were ruthlessly plundered on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party in order to put their own hatchet men, lackeys and party workers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 16, 25, 47, 51 and 71 together.</P>
      <P>Details of the establishment procedures, structure, staffing and funding of the county enterprise partnership boards, as then proposed, were set out in the previous Government's statement of 1 October 1992 and in the Taoiseach's replies to parliamentary questions on 7, 14 and 21 October, 1992 and 3 and 4 November 1992.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the boards was transferred to me at the end of January 1993.  Administrative tasks associated with the transfer of functions are in hands, as is a review of the proposals under the headings cited above.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the Programme for a Partnership Government the county enterprise boards will be empowered to seek funding to assist local development, the start up of small enterprises, the promotion of tourism, and to establish community employment schemes in consultation with community organisations, the social partners and the public sector at local level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the primary goals of the boards will be to assist enterprise creation leading to increased employment.  The new boards will also have a significant role to play in tourism promotion at country level.  In consultation with the relevant <Col N="713" /> interested parties, including the Minister for Tourism and Trade, especially as regards the co-operation of arrangements with the regional tourism organisations, I am considering the steps to be taken to achieve that goal.  To date one county enterprise board has been set up; that is in Galway.  I would expect that the boards will be established during the course of this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said the boards will be empowered to seek funding and do I take it from that that funding will not be provided by the State?  Is there provision in this year's Book of Estimates for funding for the county enterprise boards?  In Question No. 16, I asked the Minister if he will set up two boards in Waterford, one for the city and one for the county but he did not allude to that in his reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall reply to the second question first.  The original announcement did not provide for more than one board in County Waterford.  As I indicated, I will reconsider, in consulation with my partners in Government, the application and operation of all the county enterprise boards.  In that regard I am aware of the representations and the concerns that have been expressed by Waterford County Council and Waterford Corporation.  In regard to the Deputy's first question, the enterprise boards as envisaged will not only be empowered to apply for and seek funds in their own right from financial institutions but it is the intention of the Government to make capital and operational funds available for them.  The details will be made known in due course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>We are getting to the bottom of this so-called brainchild of the Taoiseach that I, for one, do not see operating.  Would the Minister accept that the difficulty with small industries is that they want decisions made as quickly as possible in order to gain access to funds to get on with their business?  What strangles most of them is that by the time they go through the bureaucratic system <Col N="714" /> the business has failed.  No money was provided in the Estimates specifically&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that there is a difficulty in that no money was provided in the Estimates?  He is suggesting that somehow, throught the IDA or some other mechanism&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to the point of the question.  Would the Minister accept that there is no funding available for county enterprise boards to do the job they were supposed to do in the first instance?  Would he further agree that the Culliton recommendations on the regional boards is where the answers are to be found?  Would he accept that the original premise on which the county enterprise boards were founded was totally unworkable?  Will he now look at an alternative that will be given power, authority to take decisions and funding? Would he accept that is not the case in respect of the proposed boards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's impatience with the crisis of unemployment and his desire to ensure minimal constraints and criteria associated with bureaucracy so as to facilitate instant development, if that is possible. There are lessons to be learned from the impatience of that approach.  One does not have to go much further than Tipperary to see that.  We have, therefore, to tread very carefully in respect of how we use taxpayers' money in this regard. I do not think anybody has a recipe that can be used instantly in every town, county or province.</P>

      <P>What might work for Waterford might not necessarily work in the larger urban areas.  What might work <Col N="715" /> for an area that has a coherent identity, like a SFADCo region, would not necessarily work in an inner city community such as Deputy Gregory referred to.</P>
      <P>I want, with the help of my colleagues in Government, to find an appropriate mechanism that safeguards taxpayers, interests on the one hand and facilitates as quickly as possible, the promotion of employment at local level.  The single dominant factor, and the repeated request to the committee of which we were both members over the past number of months, was access to reasonable amounts of equity capital without the onerous undertakings and personal guarantees which are sought currently. That obstacle has to be removed as quickly as possible but with legitimate safeguards.  That is why I have to give the replies I have given.  I hope the next time I am here for Question Time I can be more forthcoming.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister confirm that the three new county councils in Dublin could each have their own enterprise board and also that Dún Laoghaire/Rathdown County Council will have its own enterprise board in view of the fact that it will cover a population of approximately 190,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the enterprise trust, the body set up by the employers associations and organisations, has taken steps, if not already implemented, to establish a potential enterprise board in the Dún Laoghaire/ Rathdown area.  I would welcome such a proposal because there is undoubtedly a need for such an enterprise board.  I am not sure the Deputy was here on a previous occasion when his constituency colleague, <Col N="716" /> Deputy Gilmore, debated this matter with the then Minister of State, Deputy Treacy.  It is clear that in the Dublin area there is need for two kinds of board.  There is need for an integrated Dublin board that sells Dublin in the manner that SFADCo sells the mid-western region while, at the same time, there is obviously a need, given the scale and physical size of the Dublin region and local loyalties, to have a series of local boards operating within that framework. I would be more than happy to discuss with the relevant four local authorities in Dublin how best to achieve that objective.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is extreme scepticism between the councillors, local authorities and council officials in relation to these enterprise boards?  In the mid-west region SFADCo have a specific mandate for community development and small enterprise and cover a broad span of local authority regions.  Would the Minister, therefore, foresee unnecessary duplication and more confusion in relation to potential industries and employers? Would he not agree that the whole idea appears to be hare-brained and may not necessarily be desirable at present?</P>

      <P>It is a slightly different type of question time and it will be as flexible as possible from my side.  I hope we will have a good interchange of ideas.  I do not propose to make another Second Stage type speech. Members opposite made a number of points in relation to the committees and so on and if they would bear with me for no more than five minutes, I will try to address those points.  If there are other points or questions that Deputies want to raise I will be delighted to respond to them or take them on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="768" /> As regards the committee system, there is no way that the proposed system can be imposed on present structures.  It would be totally unworkable.  All Members have to think in terms of changed structures and changed procedures in the House.  As I go through this, points may emerge which Deputies would like me to address further.  It is important that this would not simply be the imposition of another layer or another system on top of the system we have.</P>
    <P>I outlined the aims of the committee system earlier.  They are to involve backbenchers in the consideration of legislation and to give them a greater role in the scrutiny of legislation and Estimates. The committee system will do that.  The point about Ministers attending commitees has been made and examples were cited from other jurisdictions.  We operate under the Irish Constitution, other Parliaments operate under their Constitutions. Our constitution provides for ministerial accountability to the Dáil. Two committee systems were quoted here: one is the committee system in the US.  That is not relevant because they have no mechanism for questioning Secretaries of State, as they are called, in the US.  Ministers in the UK are not summoned before committees as some Deputies said.  A request is made to the Government for a Minister to attend and it is up to the Government to decide whether he or she will.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>They are the two examples quoted.  Ministers will attend committees on legislation and on Estimates and the actions and policies of Ministers at that stage would be open to intense scrutiny.  I do not foresee a situation where a Minister would not be open to that intense scrutiny.  It will be a valuable exercise in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to those Deputies who adopted a very negative attitude to the committees and said they will not work although in the past they have been vocal in their support for the idea of a committee system, the best way to find out whether <Col N="769" /> they will work is have this debate.  I will listen to the points put across and will incorporate them if I feel they are worthwhile. I will be open to changes and a review of the system when it is in place. That is a sensible approach.  We could talk forever.  If the history of Oireachtas reform proves anything, it is that one can talk oneself into corners and get nothing done.  The history of Dáil reform is littered with examples of that.  Members opposite should give the committee system a try, a fair chance and if it does not work I will be the first to admit it.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of the foreign affairs committee and Deputy O'Hanlon suggested meetings between the British and Irish inter-parliamentary body and the foreign affairs committee.  There is nothing in the terms of reference that would prevent this.  It is a matter that the committee could certainly take up.  In addition, Deputies referred to the exclusion of policy discussions on Northern Ireland and it was suggested that private sessions could be considered for this.  That is a reasonable suggestion and I will ask the Minister to consider it.  All Members, and I accept the bona fides of every Member, are aware of the sensitive nature of Northern Ireland discussions and this is one way around the possibility of causing problems in that regard.</P>
    <P>On the suggestion that we have a separate EC committee, there is an argument for that.  I concede that but there is a greater argument for the view that separating a foreign affairs committee and an EC committee would be an artificial division and that the specialised task involved in the examination of EC secondary legislation would be more appropriate to a sub-committee.  That is one point of view.  There are contrary points of view but I do not think an artificial division would be helpful.  It would also mean separate backup and administrative&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The EC committee on secondary legislation and the foreign <Col N="770" /> affairs committee.  I was disappointed &mdash; I will not single out any other Deputy &mdash; with the contribution of Deputy O'Keeffe who talked about jackboots and so on.  He gave about the best performance of somebody trying to use a jackboot that I have seen in the House for some time.  I came to this House with these proposals with an open mind.  I am open to suggestions.  I want the debate to be constructive and, generally, it has been and I do not think people threatening this and that serves any useful purpose. I ask Members not to do that.</P>
      <P>In his contribution Deputy O'Keeffe criticised the Government for trying to push things down people's throats, not discussing things and so on.  He then made a point about having x-number of members on the committee.  The reason no number was included was we wanted to discuss this.  We would like suggestions from the Opposition, whether we should have 21 or 25 members or whether we should have 30 members made up of Dáil and Seanad Members.  Up to this we had set proportions and we need to discuss whether we should change that.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Committee on Women Affairs, I note that only two Deputies raised this.  I take the view that by having a special committee the whole area of women's equality is marginalised.  The Government takes the view that the way to get equality is to bring it centre stage. For this reason, included in the terms of reference of each committee &mdash; this question was raised by Deputy O'Keeffe also &mdash; is the stipulation that the committee must look at all legislation that is brought forward in relation to equality. That is a way of bringing this centre stage rather than compartmentalising it and marginalising it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ministers will appear before these committees and matters can be raised with them, particularly during the Estimates debate, in relation to policies not considered right in terms of equality.  I would like to hear the view of Deputies opposite on that.  We marginalise people when we put them into a special committee. I am prepared, if sufficiently <Col N="771" /> strong arguments are put forward, to reconsider that in relation to the women's committee but the point I made is valid.</P>
    <P>Deputies Rabbitte and Enda Kenny raised the question of plenary sessions. We must have plenary sessions of the House.  I accept fully the points raised by the Deputies that it is important to have people in the House and that Ministers are accountable to the House.  We will still have plenary sessions of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Every day.  We will have Questions, debates and Second Stage debates on Bills, Report and Final Stages and Adjournment debates.  This is a matter the Whips will have to discuss to see how best it fits in with a committee system.  If we have four committees up and running, it will be difficult to try to run plenary sessions all day every day. That has to be discussed.</P>
      <P>People have asked about interest groups and submissions to the committees. I am conscious of the need for that.  Within the terms of reference of the committees that is possible.  The interaction in relation to civil servants is provided for in the terms of reference of the committees, also civil servants will be able to have private briefing sessions with members of the committee prior to the legislation being brought forward and as the legislation is going through committee. It could eliminate much needless discussion on various sections of a Bill and the important sections could be discussed at length.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept the point made in relation to resources.  Members of this House do not have the resources necessary to do the job.  I say that openly and would say it whether I was in Opposition, in Government or on the backbenches.  The committees will have a clerk.  It is my desire that the clerk of each committee would be a member of the Oireachtas staff who are seen to be neutral and absolutely independent of all sides of the House. <Col N="772" /> That is important.  In addition, for legislation, officials in the Department concerned will be specifically assigned to the committees for the period that the legislation is being debated.  The terms of reference of each committee allow for engaging the services of persons with specialist or technical knowledge.  That is another means where information and specialist knowledge can be obtained from outside.  Members, particularly spokespersons, should have back-up and that will have to be addressed.  Anybody who comes into this House from private industry, trade unions and so on is appalled at the fact that a Deputy has no research back-up and is only given secretarial assistance.  I am committed to trying to ensure that is changed.</P>
    <P>The Order of Business was originally intended for the order of the House; Deputies were informed what was to happen in the House that day.  Deputies could raise questions on that and in relation to promised legislation and one or two other specific and defined areas. At the moment, there is an attempt being made to have a mini-Question Time on topical matters.  It does not do the dignity of the House any good to have a brouhaha every morning.  I would like Deputies to address that issue tomorrow. Perhaps a case could be made for having 15 or 20 minutes made available to raise topical matters each day rather than doing as on the Order of Business.  I would like to hear Deputies' views on that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of the Dáil reform working committee for the past number of years I welcome the reform package brought before us today. As a member of a number of special committees that sat both in this Chamber and the committee rooms I welcome the fact that we are establishing committees.</P>
      <P>I have some reasonable and practical questions about the committees.  The first relates to lack of space and the time that Deputies could devote to these committees. Previous committees, like the Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies and the women's committee, had difficulty meeting because there was not any proper accommodation within the confines of Leinster House or in Kildare House.  Before we start talking about committees meeting on a regular basis &mdash; it is envisaged that they would meet on a regular basis to deal with legislation &mdash; we must address the problem of accommodation. There will not be a problem in the summer months when the Dáil and Seanad are not sitting but when they are in session there will be difficulties.  The amount of time Deputies have available for committee meetings would be limited, particularly if they wanted to be here.  Members cannot be in two places at the one time.  Before we run away with ourselves in relation to committees we need to set that out very carefully.</P>
      <P>There is a proposal to introduce electronic voting.  Given the way the Chamber is set out would Deputies be in a position to vote electronically?  Considering the amount of money it would cost to put in place, will it save time?  I do not think it will because in any parliament where electronic voting works well there is an open plan Chamber.  If we are all required to sit in our seats in order to vote, the electronic system will not work because of the way the seats are set out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the foreign affairs committee, I am slightly disappointed &mdash; I would not like Northern Ireland to be an issue in the foreign affairs committee for particular ideological reasons &mdash; that political <Col N="774" /> and security matters are excluded from that committee.  Perhaps it is high time that we had a Northern Ireland affairs committee to deal with the thorny problem on this island.  I understand that they have one in the House of Commons and I do not see why we should not have one here.  Perhaps that could be looked at.</P>
    <P>I have often said that the best Dáil reform would be for Deputies to be less loquacious and to curtail their Second Stage contributions.  This is one of the reasons I suggested curtailing Second Stage debate speeches to about 20 minutes.  Deputies should be able to say what they want to say within a 20 minute time limit.  We have instances where Deputies spoke for two and a half hours which delays the procedures of the Dáil.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, the Whips agreed that this session would relate to questions.  The points Deputy Ahern is making are relevant.  There are Members here who wish to put questions to the Minister and it is an important occasion in the sense that the Minister will get a range of ideas from questions asked.</P>

      <P>I am trying to make a number of points and I am asking the Minister to reply.  I understand this was the objective.  If we want to get up and ask one question and let the Minister answer it and then ask another question, that is fine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the Order of Business every morning.  A couple of years ago there used to be a debacle here when on occasions, 40 different issues were raised by Deputies.  That is not what the Order of Business was designed for and, therefore, we brought in a changed Adjournment debate on topical matters at the end of each day's business.  That did not go down well, particularly with some of the smaller groups who did not like topical matters tagged on to the end <Col N="775" /> of business.  They may have had a point. We made an effort to do away with topical matters and to beef up the Adjournment debate so that more detailed responses could be given by Ministers and more detailed questions asked by Members on a daily basis.  Unfortunately, Fine Gael, in particular, objected to that and they wanted topical matters retained. I challenge Fine Gael to see how often topical matters have been raised over the past number of months.  Unfortunately the system is not used by Deputies and is not working well.  We should have a better Adjournment debate at the end of each day's business.  Perhaps the Minister will comment on that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that when a period for questions and answers is provided it should not be taken up by Government Deputies making speeches?  My second question relates to the terms of reference of the finance and general affairs committee.  It says that the Dáil may refer reports to the committee. Would it not be more appropriate to say that the Dáil &ldquo;shall&rdquo; refer those reports? It would be rather cumbersome if we must have a special motion each time a report is referred to the committee.  The committee should stand permanently referred with all reports relevant to the Department it covers on a standing order basis rather than having a specific motion each time a report is to be referred to the committee.</P>
      <P>My next question relates to Estimates. It is not stated clearly in the terms of reference that the Estimates for the Departments concerned will stand referred automatically to the committee. I understand that is the intention but it should be stated in the terms of reference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Four, if we allow committees to consider Estimates committee members should be allowed to introduce motions to amend Estimates.  In most parliaments a procedure exists where Members may introduce an amendment to an Estimate to reduce an item or transfer an item from one subhead to another but not <Col N="776" /> to increase the overall Estimate, which obviously is the Government's prerogative. Will the Minister of State agree that there should be a procedure within the committee style discussion of Estimates to allow motions to amend to be introduced in the same way as motions to amend are allowed to Bills?</P>
    <P>My fifth question relates to Ministers being summoned to appear before committees. I take the Minister's point that our Constitution is not the same as every other.  Will Ministers appear before these committees on a regular basis regardless of whether they are obliged to do so?</P>
    <P>My sixth question concerns publicity for the committees' work.  My understanding is that many Members are reluctant to serve on committees because they do not get any publicity for their work. Politicians live, to some extent at least, by publicity.  One of the obstacles to televised publicity is, I understand, the failure to introduce legislation to give the same privileges that apply in the House to the proceedings of the committees. That legislation has been promised for years but has not yet been introduced. When will it be introduced?  Can we have cast iron assurances on that point?</P>
    <P>My seventh question is in respect of the quorum.  I respectfully suggest to the Minister that the quorum of 11 may be too large.  Will he agree to a smaller quorum?  I believe that a quorum should always be present and, therefore, it should be a realistic quorum.</P>
    <P>My eight question relates to the terms of reference of the foreign affairs committee. A number of Members of this House are appointed as members of the Council of Europe.  The Council of Europe is increasing in importance in international affairs, particularly as it is now taking in the activities of the CSCE &mdash; the Conference for Security in Eastern Europe &mdash; which is very important from the point of view of the reorganisation of the former Soviet Union and the problems of the minority involved.  The Council of Europe is the only body on which Eastern Europe is currently represented. There are now more countries in Eastern and Central Europe than there are in <Col N="777" /> Western Europe in terms of numbers.  It should be part of the terms of reference of the committee.  Item 6 of the terms of reference states that &ldquo;the Joint Committee shall in particular consider...&rdquo; a range of matters about the European Community.  I suggest that there should be an additional subhead requiring the committee to consider reports from the members appointed by Dáil Eireann to attend at the Council of Europe on the activities of the Council and on their own activities in particular.</P>
    <P>In regard to the activities of committees, one of the most neglected parts of our work in this House is the function of delegated legislation in general.  I am not talking about EC delegated legislation but all delegated legislation.  Every day on the Order Paper numerous Orders are delegated, they are the law of the land in the same way as if they had been passed after a 20 day debate.  The only parliamentary control over those is that a Member may put down a motion to annual them.  If a Member puts down a motion to annul, it was originally the case that the Government automatically provided time for a debate on this. Approximately 20 years ago the Government of the day stopped doing that and no Government has done it since.  The only way that you can get a motion to annual a regulation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that it is not realistic for the Government to provide time for every motion to annul but that when we are setting up a committee system it is realistic to have these motions which are discussed in committee?  If so, would he agree that any Member of the House who wishes to put down a motion to annul a regulation should be entitled to an audience for his motion whether he is a member of the committee concerned or not?  That would provide a means for delegated legislation to be considered here.  I suggest that could be done on a time limit basis and the committee would allocate no more than ten or 15 minutes to such a motion.  The Member could make a statement on why the motion should be annulled, the Minister would say why it should not and the committee would vote.  At least the Member would get a hearing for ten or 15 minutes, something he does not get under the present system.  Given that in volume terms at least we actually pass more legislation by delegated orders than we do by principal Bills, there should be some means in the Oireachtas for discussing them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the first question asked by Deputy Bruton, the Chair decides who will speak or ask questions. I believe that, since Dáil reform is so important, it is a matter for every Deputy in the House and if they want to take up time I have no problem with that. In relation to the two points the Deputy raised about changing the wording to say that the Government shall refer, or the Dáil shall refer, Estimates and other business to the committees it is the clear understanding that Estimates will be referred; but the wording is there specifically because the supremacy of the Dáil must be recognised.  There may come a time when the Dáil may want an Estimate to be kept in the House and it would have the freedom to do that.  It is the clear understanding that Estimates etc., will be presented to these committees in line with what we attempted to do last year.  The Government decides on Estimates and budgetary policy.  I cannot give the Deputy a straight, definite and definitive answer on that, but I imagine that the Government would not want to give up its prerogative in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ministers will attend the committee meeting for the Estimates and legislation and Deputies will have sufficient opportunity to question the Ministers on both those occasions on general policy and on matters relating to their own ministries at that time.  Personally, I do not see any great problem at a later stage with Ministers attending for other reasons; but, if we are to do this right, the primary purpose of these committees is to consider the Estimates and legislation.  When they are up and running we should make sure that they work well and should not bog ourselves down with trying to bring in other roles for the committees.  I am prepared to review the role of each of <Col N="780" /> these committees within 12 months if Members feel that should be done.</P>
    <P>In relation to publicity for Members attending committees, it is to a certain extent outside our control, but it is a valid point.  If Deputies spend a lot of time dealing with legislation they should get publicity.  We are often criticised in the House for having only two or three Members present when legislation is being presented.  If one looks at the Press Gallery only one or two people are present there either.  I know as well as Deputies opposite that members of the Press Corps who cover the proceedings of the House are listening to it on monitors, so one does not have to be physically present in the House.</P>

      <P>We cannot continue ordering business the way we do in plenary sessions in the House.  It will be much easier to cover the House if it is in plenary session and &ldquo;in competition&rdquo; with committees.  Therefore, a system will have to be worked out to allow for full coverage of committees.</P>
      <P>I take the Deputy's point in relation to the quorum for committees.  That is a matter we can discuss and I would not have any great problem with it.  The Deputy's last three suggestions are worthy of consideration &mdash; the quorum, the Foreign Affairs Committee having reports from the Council of Europe members and the regulations.  In regard to the regulations, there may be a danger that committees would get bogged down trying to annul regulations.  When the Deputy suggests ten or 15 minutes, I think what he has in mind is something like the five minute rule in the House of Commons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to time and space, the question of plenary sittings of the House going on at the same time as committees had to be looked at.  I have asked, for inclusion in the Estimates, that two rooms fully equipped for television will be available to the committees on a permanent basis.  We can also use the Chamber at various times.  We may, with the consent of our friends in the Seanad, use their Chamber.  The House does not sit on a Monday so there are various times that committees can meet and have televised proceedings.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the other point the Deputy made in relation to being in two places at the one time and trying to co-ordinate the activities of the committees and ensuring there are no unavoidable clashes, that is one of the roles I envisage for the convenors, who would have to organise and liaise with each other and with the staff in the House.  It is a practical problem that has to be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no point in introducing a system of electronic voting to the House if we do not change the means by which we vote.  If we decide to introduce an electronic voting system and continue voting the way we do the only difference being that we sit on our seats or walk through the lobby and press in a card for every single vote, we will not save time. If it is the view of the Members of the House that we continue the present voting system except that we do something fancy like pressing buttons, that would be a waste of taxpayers' money. The time saving in electronic voting is achieved by bringing votes together and having them, not necessarily on one night <Col N="782" /> but at particular set times so one does not have the bell ring for four minutes plus four minutes, another four minutes in preparing for the vote, with maybe five or six votes.</P>

      <P>Deputies have indicated they would like to put questions to the Minister.  I am anxious to accommodate everybody.  I would ask for brevity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Brevity is the soul of wit. The biggest single frustration experienced by us is getting Ministers to come into the House and answer to us on any element of public policy or spending. Until that is remedied there will not be any real Dáil reform.  That is the essence of accountability and is something we have been seeking for a long time.  My fear is that the position will worsen under the proposed committee system and that Ministers will spend less time answering to us.  That would not constitute Dáil reform but would make a bad situation infinitely worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Question Time, Ministers now come in wheeling wheelbarrows of files with long tracts that have been written out for them by civil servants. In response to already tabled questions they stand up and read these long tracts, leaving as little time as possible for people who have tabled questions to ask supplementary questions or sometimes to get an answer to the question tabled.  It has become a kind of a game where the Minister, wittingly or otherwise, sets out to outwit the Deputy and at the end of the day no real information <Col N="783" /> is given in response to Deputies' questions. That has turned Question Time into a meaningless exercise.  Since this new Dáil convened it has become worse. Yesterday, Deputies who tabled Priority Questions had scarcely any time left to ask supplementaries.  That is a negation of what Question Time was set out to achieve.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister to concede that there will be no real Dáil reform until there is a reform of Question Time. If we want to pick a starting point, it is Question Time.  I suggest that what ought to happen is that the Minister of the day ought to come in here and stand up for 20 minutes and answer questions that are put to her or him on the floor of the House.  If that concession were given to Members there might be a real Question Time as opposed to the charade that has been developed here recently and now passes for Question Time.  It does not succeed in eliciting any kind of basic information.  I suggest that the Minister take that on board.  The Taoiseach and his Ministers should answer questions from the floor of the House and let the Ceann Comhairle decide whether the question is in order.  The temptation might be there to stand up and ask spurious questions but we have a Ceann Comhairle and let him decide on that issue.  That would make a major difference to Deputies and would be a beginning in Dáil reform.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister tell us if there are any proposals for the Houses of the Oireachtas to have their own Vote with their own accounting officer such as the Clerk of the Dáil, so that there is complete independence of this House? Would he assure us that the staffing of committees would be from the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas and that we will not be dictated to by officials from various Departments who want to keep things away from Members?  I would like confirmation from the Minister as to whether there are any proposals to deal with the practical problems of running committees.  Having served as Government <Col N="784" /> Whip, I am aware of the action of various Departments when it comes to dealing with committees.  If we are to have a real committee system I would like the Minister to confirm that the Houses of the Oireachtas would have real independence.</P>
      <P>How does the Minister propose to deal with the requirements of the Maastricht Treaty which obliges national parliaments to have their own committee to deal with the role of national parliaments in the context of European union?  If European affairs are to be a sub-committee of the foreign affairs committee I suggest that the role of national parliaments will become less and less important. I ask the Minister to ask the Department of Foreign Affairs to confirm to us how they propose to deal with the obligations imposed on national parliaments in relation to the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
      <P>I say this as an ex-chairman of the European affairs committee for a short time.  The frustrating part of being a committee chairperson is that one spends a lot of time dealing with reports and producing them but they gather dust in various corners of this House and in various Departments.  They are never debated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Are there proposals to have such reports debated with Ministers present?  This is vitally important in order to give support to those who spend a lot of time and effort producing reports. How will the Minister deal with the statutory right of any Member to attend any debate particularly in relation to Estimates? If these committees are to debate the Estimates, if one is not a member of the committee how can one exercise one's right of attendance to ask questions and take part in that committee?  That is a problem and was evident when the Finance Bill was debated last year.  Those who were not selected as members of that committee did not partake in the Committee Stage.  I ask the Minister to tell us how he intends overcoming that difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="785" /> As Government Chief Whip I investigated the possibility of raising grievance points &mdash; items that used to come up on the Order of Business.  Some Deputies say that the dignity of this House is disappearing because of what goes on at the Order of Business.  The one complaint that I get from the electorate is that every time they watch Dáil Report on television nobody is in the Chamber and there is no atmosphere.  They are always comparing it with the House of Commons.  What we are doing is reducing the opportunity for real debate across the floor.  Sometimes it might get heated but we are professional politicians and at the end of the day we know that there is nothing personal in what is said.  But at least there is debate whereas this charade of six or seven of us in the Chamber, with nobody in the press gallery, discussing Dáil reform is bad television.  This will happen to committees.</P>
    <P>Grievance time became too formalised and one forgot what Minister was involved on a particular evening.  I had in mind that for 20 minutes or half an hour every day, time would be set aside for Members to seek the permission of the Chair and raise a particular issue for a maximum of two or three minutes.  There would be no need for a Minister to be present but the issue would be conveyed to the relevant Department, and the following day the Minister would have the right to answer.  There should be less formality and it should be left to the Chair to decide who would be called.  This is done in other parliaments.  If I were called yesterday, I would not be called today if others in the Chamber wished to raise a point.  It would mean that Deputies could say they raised a particular matter in the Houses of Parliament.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quill mentioned Question Time.  We should not throw away the last opportunity for a new format of grievance time whereby Deputies can come into the House at a given time and say what they wish for a maximum of two minutes.  Up to 15 Members could be accommodated.  That is done very successfully in the Australian Parliament.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I see a slight possibility of Ministers appearing before committees? We might look more closely at the aspect of having more accountability from Ministers and having them come before committees.</P>
      <P>The Minister said the women's rights committee had only been mentioned by a couple of Members.  It was not an oversight on my part; I intended to bring it up at this stage.  I served on the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Women's Rights and I found it an excellent committee. It was very well regarded internationally. Because it was a cross-party committee, it was very well attended and there was a very good atmosphere and a spirit of co-operation.  I do not think that such a committee marginalises women. Even with 20 women Members of the Dáil, it is essential that such a committee remains in place.  It was very effective and it underscored the need for much of the legislation which is to come before us, for instance legislation on the ownership of the family home.  The Minister should look again at the various committees aside from the four new committees and the foreign affairs committee.</P>
      <P>The representation of Opposition parties on all committees should be considered. If strict proportionality is being taken into account, it may be a little unfair to include Ministers who are not available to serve on committees anyway. Where a committee would have more of a co-operative role than a contentious one we might have wider representation from Opposition parties.  Will there be a right of audience for MEPs at the foreign affairs committee?  There should be some reporting back mechanism between committees and the Dáil.</P>
      <P>We need to look more carefully at our voting procedure because I am very concerned about amendments.  An amendment may fall because it has been rejected at an earlier stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept the point made earlier by Deputy Barrett about genuine debate in the Chamber.  That is the point Deputy Quill was making also.  Can we devise a method of having a better flow of debate? <Col N="787" /> Even though there has been an attempt to have a flow of questions and answers, it is still stultified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the most memorable occasions in this House were when the Chamber was packed.  It is natural that a crowd attracts a crowd.  We are talking about a fundamental issue today with an empty press gallery, an empty public gallery and practically an empty House.  This must not make for riveting listenership.</P>
      <P>This morning I raised the question of Members with special interests being elected.  If one of these members is not appointed to a committee dealing with their special interest, will that Member have the right to attend at the committee and have the right to contribute on the Committee Stage of legislation relevant to his or her area?</P>
      <P>There are 166 Members in this House and we have spoken about four special committees with 30 Members on each. That is 120 Members.  There will be another eight or nine committees of the House.  This could turn out to be a Whip's nightmare unless there is a specific well-defined rota as to when, where and in what circumstances the committee will meet.  There will be situations where Members will attend a committee meeting. They will be present for two minutes when they will either be requested to attend at another committee meeting or a quorum bell will ring or a vote will take place.  Obviously that will stretch the resources of the House immensely.  I hope the Minister's remarks about resources and facilities mean something.</P>
      <P>My final point is in regard to printed records of the committee meetings.  With the resources we have at the moment, without forming any of these special committees, it is not possible to have a printed record of committee meetings ready for the next meeting.  Often they do not appear for many months.  That is not the fault of the staff &mdash; they have not been given adequate resources to do the work. I note that in the rulings of the Chair it states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="788" /> The Chair agrees that debates should be available for Members at the next meeting of a committee.</P>
    <P>If we are to have special committees it is very important that at the next meeting of that committee the Members attending should have the printed record of what happened at the previous committee meeting, so that they can refer back and raise relevant issues.  Can the Minister ensure that the ruling of the Chair is observed and is not broken as happens all the time and can he also ensure that at each committee meeting there will be a printed record of the previous meeting of the committee available to Members?</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to judge exactly how these reforms will change the way we operate.  As a new Member, my impression is of coming in fresh from the outside world into a system that is quite strange and bewildering, an experience many long serving Members may not remember.  The overriding impression one gets is of a rather hide-bound secretive operation and that there is an imbalance built into the system in favour of the Government and against the Opposition. Obviously, this time around there is probably more evidence of that because of the large number on the Government's side.  In relation to the chairman of these committees, is it the intention that they will be drawn from the Opposition as well as from the Government?  If it is the case that the chairman will simply be, let us say, non-runners in the contest for ministerial positions that would be damaging to Dáil reform.  Drawing a number of chairman from the Opposition would be a healthy development.</P>
      <P>In relation to how we are perceived by the media the question has not been asked where Members are when the Chamber is practically empty.  It might be an idea for the Minister to invite Gay Byrne and Joe Duffy to come into the Dáil and find out what we do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>That is something they <Col N="789" /> can discover for themselves.  We must invite people in, explain what we are doing and listen to their comments in that regard.</P>
      <P>I was rather taken aback when I read section 6 of the document relating to committees.  It referred to a private preliminary briefing.  I do not understand why any briefing should be in private and the reasons for any such private briefings should be clearly stated.  There is enough secrecy in relation to making decisions in Government at both local and national level without further secrecy.  The Minister stated that he does not favour the idea of a women's committee.  I disagree with him.  Does he not consider there is an onus on him now to create a gender balance in any new structures?  If the idea of women's rights and equality is to be perceived through the system, the system must be structured in such a way as to enable that to happen.  The Minister has added a certain onus on himself by disregarding the importance of having women's committees.</P>
      <P>I question how he will gender-proof the structure.  I would be interested to hear his reply to this.</P>
      <P>In relation to Deputy Quill's point regarding responsiveness, very often Question Time only becomes interesting when the Ceann Comhairle has to intervene to stop the debate.  Surely we can bypass the flimflam at the beginning and get down to the meat.  It would make life more interesting for Deputies and it would also mean that the information the public desire would be available.  They are paying for it and they should get good value.  I would be interested also to hear the Minister's reply in that regard.</P>

      <P>I am conscious that Deputy Fitzgerald wants to get information on a number of matters so I will reply to her questions as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the points raised by Deputies Quill and McManus when I came to this House, I remember hearing that one should never ask a question here unless one knew the answer in advance. The supplementary questions are the interesting part where Opposition <Col N="790" /> Deputies pursue Ministers for answers. There are two types.  On the one hand people criticise Ministers for not giving full answers and, on the other, when they give full answers they are criticised again for giving long answers thereby delaying the proceedings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>If a Deputy asks a question he or she should receive a straight answer; I have no difficulty with that.  If they ask a question about policy then a Minister should have a right to elucidate a particular policy.  I am not averse to reviewing Question Time again.  Deputy Barrett mentioned priority questions and asked about allocating more time for them.  I am not averse to that; it is something the Whips can discuss further. Some Members seek full replies and then accuse Ministers of not giving full answers if they are brief and this is something we should consider.  Deputy Barrett raised a number of interesting points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Oireachtas has its own Vote but that area is a matter for the Ceann Comhairle and it is under his direct control.  I understand the Deputy's point that there should be somebody at the Cabinet table who would take on the responsibility and speak for the Houses of the Oireachtas and that is something I would like to pursue.  In addition, I will pursue the question the Deputy raised with the Department of Foreign Affairs and I will ask it to communicate directly with the Deputy on how it proposes, under the current structure, to meet the requirements of the Maastricht Treaty.  I will ask the Department to communicate with the Deputy on that matter.  With regard to the reports the Deputy mentioned, the Whips have been trying to bring any reports received before the House on Fridays and that has worked reasonably well.  I understand the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women will be brought before the House next Friday.  On the following Friday we will have the report on juvenile justice in which Deputy Quill is interested.  We <Col N="791" /> have been trying to bring reports before the House on Fridays and that practice has worked reasonably well.</P>
    <P>In relation to the general question about special interest Deputies, I do not think there are any special interest Deputies.  If Deputies have a particular interest in a subject and they are not members of the committee dealing with it, there is provision under the terms of reference to nominate substitutes.  If a Deputy has a particular interest in a Bill and is not a member of the committee dealing with it they can substitute for other members on the committee.</P>
    <P>On the point made by Deputy Barrett and others about grievance time and my earlier point regarding the Order of Business, I do not think that is the time for a question and answer session.  I accept the point made by Opposition Deputies that there should be some time and that is something I will discuss with the other Whips.  We will try to bring something forward on that, perhaps a 15 or 20 minute session.  I would not go along with the idea that a Deputy could raise questions that would be answered the following day because that would give the Deputy an advantage.  He could raise all sorts of issues and the Minister would not have a right to reply until the following day.  The Opposition Deputy would have the chance to raise all sorts of hares and the Minister would not have an opportunity to respond but this a matter that is worth considering.</P>

      <P>I will look at the range of committees.  The Whips may discuss that again.  I would be interested in getting the views of the women Deputies and others in regard to the women's committee. I am open to suggestions.  There has been a suggestion that we should change the system by which people are appointed to committees.  When one moves away from the system of proportionality one gets into serious trouble because many people will have many <Col N="792" /> different ideas.  We must devise a system that will meet everybody's requirements. In relation to gender balance on committees, I regard all Deputies as equal.  I do not see them as female Deputies or male Deputies, they are all Deputies and I am sure they will serve the committees well.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt they will.  With regard to a rota, I am conscious that I am not going to be able to address the point fully because I want to allow Deputy Fitzgerald in.

      <P>I wish to raise a number of points.  On the attendance of MEPs, the Minister should investigate what other channels of communication or links could be built with our MEPs. There has been quite a deficit in relation to that issue, and it became evident during the Maastricht campaign.  Their attendance at the Foreign Affairs Committee will be helpful but this matter should be considered further.</P>
      <P>Second, I would like to refer to the reports from the Council of Europe.  It is an important area and I hope the Minister of State will be able to consider that. Would the Minister of State give further information in relation to Ministers attending and how that might happen? Would it be at the request of the committee, or when new legislation is being considered, or would there be any particular criteria that would determine the Minister's attendance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to make a final point in relation to mainstream equality issues. For example, in the European Parliament there is a Women's Rights Committee which operates effectively and efficiently.  While I agree with the Minister about mainstreaming &mdash; of course we have to mainstream equality issues &mdash; we <Col N="793" /> are still at a point in the development of equal rights where the alternative structure of positive action is needed.  I would argue strongly for the retention of the women's rights committee on that basis, at least in the interim.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Deputy's points in relation to the retention of the women's rights committee and the reports from the Council of Europe.  I did not address the question of MEPs.  They are entitled to attend the Foreign Affairs Committee.  People are asking us to consider involving them in other committees and more in the workings of the House. That is something we can discuss.  I want to make it clear that initially these committees will be legislative committees. The Minister will be in attendance for legislation and debates on Estimates.  I will be open to further discussions in regard to Ministers attending when I see how these committees will work. Initially, the role of the Minister will be in regard to those two areas.</P>

      <P>I will be brief.  If we have no daily plenary sessions of the Dáil, what happens to the daily Dáil questions which are supposed to be the great defence of democracy?  If we have no daily plenary sessions of the Dáil, what happens to the Order of Business?  Are we going to have a block Order of Business over two, three or four days or maybe a week?  What happens when urgent matters arise subsequently?  In regard to the Order of Business for the committees, there may be competing influences and who will do the ordering of business?  Are we going to lose control of the whole position here in the Dáil Chamber?  Why abolish grievance time? The Minister of State said it was not used. I did not count the number of times I used it, but <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> did.  I apparently used it 87 times during the last Dáil.  By abolishing it we will be simply <Col N="795" /> pandering to the Dáil Deputies who wish to say in ten minutes what could be said in two minutes.</P>
      <P>I would warn the Minister of State that if he thinks there will be television coverage of the committee sessions which will enhance the reputation of this House, he is making a big mistake.  A relatively small number of people sitting in a small room having a committee form of debate is not conducive to television and, therefore, the committees will not be televised.  The media are interested in entertainment and not in us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to thank the Minister of State for using his discretion.  That is commendable.  If there is to be Dáil reform, from time to time some discretion might be the better part of our valour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to make a speech so I will confine myself to questions.  I heard some points earlier in relation to electronic voting.  I have the experience of voting with such a system in the European Parliament and when Members of this House attended the Assizes between the European Parliament and the national Parliaments of members states in the Chamber of Deputies in Rome. On all occasions Deputies were given a small plastic card like a credit card which has some encoding on it to identify the named Deputies.  Even if the seating arrangements from time to time are flexible, your flexible friend is inflexible with regard to the identity of Deputies.  It allows Deputies to move around the Chamber and not necessarily have to sit in the one spot everyday and yet still be able to vote.  In general, however, one sat in the same place.  Electronic voting is not an insurmountable problem.  I am not sure whether we need to block all the votes together to have electronic voting, because it allows for a fairly instantaneous <Col N="796" /> replay of results and does not require counting.  I take the point that if Deputies are in their offices they still have to be given time to get to the Chamber.</P>
    <P>I am interested in the definition of the terms of reference of the Finance and Economics Committee.  I know it will deal with Committee Stage of Bills and Estimates and to that extent it is useful; but it seems to omit some vital elements. I talk now not of the Estimates cycle or Committee Stage of a Bill but the actual policy process itself.  I would instance the recent devaluation as an example, though one could pick many examples.  There is some use and merit in a specialist body of this House being able to question relevant agencies.  Those relevant agencies and persons should include the Minister. I note the point made earlier about Ministers attending in other jurisdictions at their own will.  There is a certain moral suasion when a committee summons a Minister and the Minister stays away.  It would be useful if one had that power at a minimum.  In regard to agencies such as the National Treasury Management Agency, one should be entitled in public policy terms to hear why it did certain things the way it did and to see if collectively we can share in the learning experience from the type of national crisis created through the monetary problems.</P>
    <P>While allowing that the Central Bank is in statutory terms independent, it seems a very relevant body to call in.  Many of the Central Banks of the European Community are independent of the political system.  Notwithstanding that, Karl Otto Pohl, while he was President of the Bundesbank, came before that specialist committee of Parliament.  Mr Tietmeyer also came before that parliamentary committee. Other people of substance in policy formation, people from defined independent areas, have made themselves available in camera to that committee. As a member of the Economic and Monetary Committee of the European Parliament, I always found that such people have been enormously helpful in elucidating ideas about public policy.  It would be a grave disservice to <Col N="797" /> set up committees without bringing in the policy focus as distinct from the purely political legislative process of committees and so on.  I would like the Minister's comments on that matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">

      <P>I remind the Deputy that Deputies Durkan, McDowell, Keogh and Ferris wish to speak and the Minister has to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I will limit myself to questions. Does the Minister have a view on open parliamentary questions that is, which the Minister has not received in writing in advance?  That system works well in other jurisdictions.  I recommend that an advance timetable be set for committees. Has the Minister been asked about the interruption of debate?  Deputy McManus talked about inviting media people in here.  In contemplating Dáil reform, we should consider this matter in terms of accountability as public representatives and not be cowed by prejudicial, biased and at times grossly ill-informed comment that caters to the lowest common denomination that should not be the driving force behind our efforts to bring about reform in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the things I felt has rendered this House and its proceedings boring in recent years is the growing tradition of reading speeches.  In this debate Deputies are speaking for themselves, not from scripts, thereby making the debate more interesting.  One thing that has made this House boring and resulted in disinterest by the media and the public is the practice where scriptwriters outside of this Chamber prepare speeches and Deputies simply read them. The Minister of State should seriously take into account this practice which is in breach of Standing Orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Question Time, the Minister said that the Members opposite complain when they get comprehensive answers.  We get replies; we do not get answers.  I am not lecturing anybody in this regard, but where there is a big <Col N="798" /> Government majority it is important that the Opposition does not become disenchanted or cynical &mdash; I ask the Minister opposite to pass this information to his colleagues.  Some of the replies to genuine questions are a disgrace, they do nothing for parliamentary procedure, for democracy or for the good name of this House.  I implore the Minister to use his influence to change that.  There was a time when a Deputy had to drag out supplementary information.  It was up to the Opposition spokesperson to get that information and they did so but they do not get a chance to ask supplementaries now.  They get long, woolly, hazy, replies that probably refer to world affairs, national affairs, parish pump affairs and so on, not answers to specific questions. That is very boring, disconcerting, annoying and frustrating to the Opposition and does not make for good parliamentary behaviour.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the procedure.  I agree with my colleague, Deputy Nealon, about the need for the plenary session to reign supreme at all times and to be a major feature on the political calendar.  I am concerned about voting at a specified time, electronically or otherwise.  Political life should not be predictable because it becomes boring, Members lose interest as do the public, the media and the critics and there is a grave danger that we will go down that road.  There should be a certain amount of unpredictability about parliamentary life.  There should always be the possibility that the Opposition can spring a vote.  That is the practice in all parliaments.  If you set a game plan and have the answer to every conceivable event the Opposition become bored.  When a Government has a big majority, as is the case at present, it would be in the interests of the parties in Government to ensure that the Opposition &mdash; and in turn the public &mdash; do not become bored, frustrated or annoyed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I echo what Deputy Durkan said about implementing Standing Orders.  One requirement that could be implemented is that a Member must move his question by referring to the <Col N="799" /> number on the Order Paper &mdash; Members are not entitled, in theory, to an answer unless they are here when the question is called.  That would cut down on the excessive number of questions appearing on the Order Paper.  If Deputies want a reply they would hear it in the Chamber. Spokesmen would refrain from putting down questions in various Deputies' names because they would be embarassed if the Deputies were not here.  That would be a first stage in reducing the number of questions the vast majority of which are never answered in the Chamber.</P>
      <P>There is a great deal of repetition in the House.  For example the Taoiseach reads the Order of Business and the Ceann Comhairle then repeats it.  That takes about ten minutes every day, and time is precious.  Similarly it takes the Ceann Comhairle ten minutes to recite all the items on the Adjournment &mdash; from the sublime to the less sublime.  We have to listen to all of them even though we know he is going to reject the majority of them.  These are minor matters which should be considered.</P>
      <P>I am very interested in the terms of reference of the foreign affairs committee. I understand the Minister of State has indicated that in relation to Northern Ireland, he is open to persuasion.  It is more important that he considers the restriction that prevents discussion by a foreign affairs committee of matters on which Ireland takes issue at EC level or internationally.  The restriction renders such a committee a farce.  If an issue on which Ireland takes a stance internationally cannot be discussed because the committee might embarrass Iveagh House, I despair of the whole process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remind the Minister of State in that context that the Government will have an overwhelming majority on the committee. It is not as if the committee will make a headstrong decision on any issue. The only thing being guarded against is somebody opening their mouth on the issue.  With respect, Iveagh House has it all its own way.  I suggest that the foreign affairs committee should be empowered <Col N="800" /> to discuss any matter on which Ireland takes a stand internationally.  If it cannot do that, it makes a mockery of this House.</P>

      <P>In relation to the question of ministerial accountability to committees, I said earlier that perhaps the Minister was opening a window of opportunity but he backed off a little.  I would ask him to consider that point for the future.  In relation to chairpersons of committees, I ask him to ensure that the various chairpersons of existing and new committees come from the Opposition and Government parties.  It would be unfair if committees were dominated by Members from the parties in Government. Was a reply given to the question of Members attending committee meetings?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek clarification on a number of matters.  I attended the Whips' meeting on this subject.  There seems to be confusion in Deputy Rabbitte's mind about ordering votes at a particular time. He said this would make a mockery of the legislation because one would not be aware if an amendment was passed or voted on.  As I understand it, the plenary session will deal with Second Stage legislation and votes will take place at the end of Second Stage.  Will the Minister confirm that?  Votes on Committee Stage will take place in the special legislative committees, on each section or amendment. Is that correct?  Will electronic voting be used in the committee or will the vote be simply recorded since there will be fewer Members in attendance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past when Bills, including Private Members' Bills, were referred to a Special Committee it was decided that the person in the Chair would be from the Government side because the Government has primary reponsibility for passing legislation.  I take it that <Col N="801" /> Government and the Dáil as the House of supremacy in the area of legislation has primary responsibility for passing legislation referred to it because only the Government can create funding to implement the provisions in a Bill.</P>
    <P>I would like clarification on the questions raised about quorums and voting.  I take it that Members on the legislative committees dealing with the Committee Stage of Bills will be paired for votes in the plenary session.  If not, Members will have to leave that work to come back to vote on the Second Stage of a Bill.  As I understand from the Whips' meetings agreement was reached in principle in that regard.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify that matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that almost all rulings of the Chair &mdash; and this applies to all occupants of the Chair &mdash; protect the Government of the day, whoever it may be, against the Opposition of the day?  Would he also agree that increasingly the House is being dominated by the concerns and needs of the Government?  Would he agree that that in some measures may have something to do with the fact that the Ceann Comhairle inevitably is elected, if not by total agreement, by a majority vote by the Government parties?  Would he agree that in order to enhance the independence of the Ceann Comhairle, thereby enhancing the independence of the House, it would be worth considering a change in the way the Ceann Comhairle is elected?</P>
      <P>In the British Parliament election of Speaker is a cross-party matter and the Government of the day usually does not get its way in such an election.  For example, a Labour Member, Betty Boothroyd, is the current Speaker because the Tory Members could not agree on the Government nominee. Would the Minister agree that in the next Dáil it might be worthwhile considering, for that one item of business, a secret ballot of all Members of the House?  In that way the Ceann Comhairle would be truly independent of any side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="802" /> Would the Minister agree that a problem arises in that even though the House has certain rights under the Constitution, it has no means of vindicating those rights because the legal guardian of the rights of the House and of the Constitution is the Attorney General who, in practice, is a servant of the Executive and not of the House?  Would the Minister agree that it would be useful for the House to have some means of taking legal action to protect its rights as a House?  Would he consider the possibility of giving that power to the House?</P>
    <P>I will give one example of where the interests of the House under the Constitution are not being protected.  The Constitution provides that the Government must present for consideration to the House the Estimates of expenditure as soon as possible after they are published. Is the Minister aware that successive Governments, including Governments of which I have been a member, have in practice presented the Estimates for consideration as late as is allowed under the Central Fund Act? This is the direct opposite of the intention of the Constitution in terms of presentation of the Estimates &mdash; they are presented not as soon, but as late as possible.  Would the Minister agree that the reason the House cannot compel the Government to abide by the Constitution is that the House has no means of vindicating its constitutional rights other than at the discretion of the Executive and that the House, therefore, should have some means of initiating legal action, if necessary, to get the Executive to abide by the Constitution, so far as privileges of the House are concerned?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to be discourteous to Deputy Nealon who raised a number of points &mdash; he is not present at the moment &mdash; but I think I covered these points earlier when referring to plenary sessions and so on.  The Deputy disagreed particularly with the abolition of the grievance procedures. This matter was agreed because Whips felt the Adjournment Debate is a better way of dealing with these questions. <Col N="803" /> Therefore instead of having three questions on the Adjournment it is proposed to increase that number to four and to get rid of the grievance procedures altogether because it is generally perceived that that system is not working.  We have talked about debates on topical matters at various stages and I think the grievance procedure/topical matters debate will have to be considered again.</P>
      <P>In relation to Deputy Cox's points about voting, it is proposed to introduce an electronic voting system.  However, there is not much point in introducing such a system without changing the method and means by which we vote.  If we continue the present procedure whereby the bells ring and Members come in here for every vote we will save only about three minutes per vote.  It would not be worth spending £100,000 on that.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ferris made the point very well that as the Second Stage of Bills will be dealt with in plenary sessions, votes could be taken on them directly after the vote on Private Members' Business.  Committee Stage of Bills and votes thereon will be dealt with in committees and it will be up to the committees to organise these votes.  We want to ensure that committees spend as much time as possible discussing legislation and amendments rather than voting.  Perhaps system akin to that operated for the finance committee last year could be put in place. That system seemed to work very well and I think all Members were satisfied with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cox mentioned open parliamentary questions, advance timetables for committees and provisions for interrupting debates.  I have no great difficulty with these matters.  We will have to discuss the mechanisms and difficulties which might arise for the Chair.  I agree with Deputy Cox about advance timetables for committees in particular.  That is something which will have to be addressed. In relation to inviting the media in, that is a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and I have no objection to it.  We spoke earlier today about the contributions of various <Col N="804" /> Deputies who were active in the last Dáil but were not returned, one of whom was former Deputy McCartan.  One Deputy present in the Chamber was very active in the last Dáil, namely Deputy Durkan, and he was returned, there is a lesson to be learned there.</P>
    <P>I will take up with Ministers, on an informal basis, the matter of questions and answers to see if a reasonable solution can be reached.  The instructions to Ministers &mdash; maybe I should not say this &mdash; are to provide as much information as possible.  Perhaps the mistake being made is that too much information is being provided and Deputies do not need to ask supplementary questions.</P>

When this matter was raised towards the end of last year by Deputy Kenny and others, including Deputy Quinn who was in Opposition at the time, extra staff was appointed to meet that need and I hope that will be satisfactory.  If not, the matter will have to be examined again because the records are important.</P>
      <P>Perhaps we should get away from tried and traditional ways of doing business. At the moment the live recording of Dáil sessions is regarded as a record of the House.  Perhaps we should move to the advanced stage of electronics and regard that as the legitimate record, particularly for committees.  This is a matter I would like to discuss further with the Whips.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McDowell made a number of points which I will take on board.  He <Col N="805" /> spoke about calling questions by number from the Order Paper.  This is covered by a Standing Order of which I was not aware, and it is worth considering.  In relation to the Order of Business, it is laid down that the Ceann Comhairle must put the Order of Business by way of motion to the House.  Whether it is necessary to repeat the Order of Business, I do not know, but if there is a better way of dealing with this matter it should be addressed.</P>
    <P>In relation to allowing discussion of the negotiating position adopted by the Government, in reality it would be difficult for anybody to prevent a member of a committee from raising matters that obviously impinge on a position the Government may or may not take on the EC or other matters.  The Deputy should realise that it would not be in the interests of this country for the Government to adopt a particular line if a committee of the House was perceived to take a different line.  Deputy O'Keeffe mentioned the system that operates in Denmark. In the circumstances, I do not think that was a very good example.</P>

On the question of Ministers attending committees, I have addressed that matter on a couple of occasions.  I do not want to get into an argument at this stage but in so far as there may have been &mdash; and I am choosing my words very carefully &mdash; an implied criticism of the Ceann Comhairle by Deputy Bruton, I do not propose to respond in view of earlier exchanges.

Such information, if available, could eliminate the need for tortuous long drawn out debates at a later stage, sometimes involving great cost to the nation.  It would be great if we were able to overcome the <i>sub judice</i> rule to get information in the House relative to <Col N="807" /> issues of national or local importance, and to get it quickly.  I emphasise that a lot depends on the answers we get.  One can raise an issue and end up in a maze, so the answers are important.</P>
      <P>This House affords Members certain privileges but they should not have the right to make groundless accusations whether in breach of the <i>sub judice</i> rule or otherwise, that may be damaging to a person inside or outside the House.  The body, person or agency concerned may not be able to redress the situation in the House and may have to seek redress outside it.</P>
      <P>I want to emphasise that Members of this House, Government or Opposition, should be responsible in what we do and say.  If we have a frivolous grievance we can be frivolous in dealing with it but if it is a serious issue obviously we must be serious in the we deal with it.  We must be objective and consistent.  If an accusation is made in the House, the Deputy should be able to substantiate it. If not we will bring ourselves and the House into disrepute.  Nobody in this House should make an accusation against another Member, an agency or organisation outside the House which is personally or materially damaging unless he is prepared to substantiate it and there are serious grounds for making such an accusation.  These are important issues. You cannot throw dirt and not expect mud to be thrown back at a later stage.</P>

      <P>I understand that Deputy Hughes and Deputy de Valera wish to contribute, therefore I will be brief.  I welcome the relaxation of the <i>sub judice</i> rule.  As the previous speaker said, it has caused a great deal of contention here, votes on the Order of Business, hassle during debates, etc.  Deputies from all parties endeavour to side step rules and issues and the one who suffers most is the Chair.  Valuable time is wasted in this way.  The Chair has to tread a very narrow line and in the public interest he allows Deputies an opportunity to raise as many issues as possible.  The Minister said that the guidelines endeavour to <Col N="808" /> strike a balance, but at the end of the day Deputies should adopt a responsible attitude in the matters they raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>As time is limited I shall restrict myself to a few words.  I support what Deputy Durkan said.  The <i>sub judice</i> rule has been established for approximately 70 years and has restricted the Ceann Comhairle and Members of this House when debating matters of public importance and policy.  People outside this House have effectively issued writs to stifle public debate, and criminal proceedings have been instituted to prevent Members from debating matters of utmost public importance.  Because of the way our legal system works it can take years to deal with criminal and civil proceedings and accordingly discussion of matters of concern to Members is inhibited and prohibited.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that the proposed <i>sub judice</i> amendment refers to proceedings in court but not the tribunal proceedings. I ask the Minister to clarify this position. Is the amendment of the <i>sub judice</i> rule as we now understand it applicable only to court proceedings or does it also apply to tribunals?  In the past two months the rulings of the Chair in this matter has been questioned.</P>
      <P>I commend the new system.  It is a welcome development and I support it.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I will be as brief as possible.  I do not wish to be at odds with my colleagues but I am concerned about doing away with the <i>sub judice</i> rule.  I have listened very carefully to what the Minister had to say in answer to questions on this issue.  When a case is <i>sub judice</i> any comment made in the course of or during the hearing of proceedings is bad because it can interfere with the due process of law and the exercise of justice. In our system, as indeed in the British system, there is a very definite separation of powers between the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary.  I am concerned that the changes in the <i>sub judice</i> rule this evening would result in an encroachment in the judicial process by <Col N="809" /> the Legislature, and I do not think that would be wise.</P>
      <P>I refer to the draft guidelines on the proposed Standing Order on the <i>sub judice</i> rule, drawn up by a working group established by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  It says that a Member should not be prevented from raising in the House any matter of general public importance, even where court proceedings have been initiated.  I ask the Minister to define a &ldquo;matter of general public importance&rdquo;.  Reference has been made to a bona fide matter of public interest, and I would like a definition of this phrase.</P>
      <P>I am also concerned about the restriction on matters relating to a case where notice has been served, that is a case to be heard before a jury.  The interesting reference here is that the purpose of this recommendation, which was made by the working group of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges is to minimise the risk of prejudicing a hearing on the presumption that in non-jury actions the risk would be minimal.  It would be very dangerous to accept a system which would allow for even minimal encroachment on the judicial process.</P>
      <P>The working group proposed that a matter should not be raised in such an overt manner that it appears to be an attempt by the Oireachtas to encroach on the functions of the courts or a judicial tribunal.  If Members were not to stick to the very strict rules and regulations, raising such a matter could be detrimental or prejudicial to a case.  What penalty would be imposed on Members who encroached on such a rule?  Once such a statement is made it cannot be undone.  What legal redress would a group or individual have in such a case? We are in danger of crossing the divide in terms of separation of powers between the Judiciary, the Executive and the Legislature.  This draft document states that the Constitution refers to this separation of powers and that this should be observed.  We have no choice but to observe it unless we are going to change the Constitution in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was appalled to read in this draft <Col N="810" /> document that when permission is given to raise a matter, whether by way of parliamentary question, Adjournment Debate or otherwise there would continue to be an onus on the Member to avoid, if possible, comment which might prejudice the outcome of proceedings.  In other words, we are saying if at all possible we are to prevent such encroachment; we are not saying that such encroachment should be prevented at all costs.  I can understand that people might feel frustrated and annoyed when they are prevented from discussing certain issues in the House, but it is beneficial to the public in the long term to maintain the very important separation of powers I outlined earlier.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to say a few words about this matter because I, perhaps more than most, have run into difficulties under this rule as it stands at present.  I saw the ridiculousness of the present state of Standing Orders in regard to the <i>sub judice</i> rule when I was precluded from saying in this House normal straightforward things about certain matters here but I could go upstairs to the RTE Studio and say normal acceptable things to which nobody could object.  It is selfevident that the House cannot continue with the present system.</P>
      <P>I was very pleased with the indication that it is now accepted that the present very restrictive rule will have to be changed.  I welcome that.  I recently got the draft guidelines and the new proposed draft Standing Order but on analysis I find we are back to square one.  The guidelines are so extraordinarily restrictive that in practice the system will be the same.  Much of what happens in this life and in this House are illusions in the sense that because you are told there is a change or an alleviation in the <i>sub judice</i> rule, it is changed for the better, but that is not the case.  The guidelines are incredibly restrictive and, in practice, I do not think there will be much difference between the present and the new systems if the changes made are on the lines set out here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="811" /> My party considered this matter a couple of years ago and came up with a proposal to modify the <i>sub judice</i> rule. Under our system a Deputy would be entitled to say within Dáil Éireann what he is entitled by law to say outside Dáil Éireann.  That is what the new Standing Order should state.  A Deputy within the House should be subject to the same constraints as a Deputy or any other citizen speaking outside the House.  It is unreal to continue to operate a system that allows a Deputy to say things outside this House which he cannot say in this Chamber.  It is ridiculous.</P>

      <P>It makes this House appear even more irrelevant and ineffective than it already is in the minds of a great many people.  I reiterate for the Government, the Minister and the Committee on Procedure and Privileges that the only effective and reasonable way to approach this difficulty is to draw up a simple Standing Order along the lines that I have suggested, so that Deputies speaking within the House are subject to the same constraints as are citizens outside the House.  Such a Standing Order would work.  It would give no additional power or privilege to people here <i>vis-á-vis</i> matters that are <i>sub judice</i> and it would not disadvantage them as is the case at present.</P>
      <P>We know the <i>sub judice</i> rule has been abused.  There are people outside the House who regularly issue writs for the purpose of preventing discussion of certain matters within this House.  The Chair will no doubt recall that, about ten years ago, a Member issued a writ for the purpose of preventing discussion in the House of certain actions of his, and he got away with it.  That is another example of how foolish this rule is.  If I had more time I would develop these points in detail.</P>

      <P>We have to remember the point made by Deputy de Valera that there are also some restrictions, so let us be careful.  The point I want to address was raised by Deputy Durkan and is fundamental to all of us.  As elected Members with privilege we have the right to raise matters that are brought to our attention if we are satisfied that our source is legitimate.  I would not like it to go out from this House that Members use their privileged position here in a frivolous way without checking and protecting the identity or the source of the information.  Sometimes information is <Col N="813" /> given on condition that confidentiality will be respected particularly as people whose names are published could lose their jobs.  We have a responsibility to ensure the legitimacy of the source of complaints, and there are means available to check the validity of such complaints.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think Members should concede their constitutional privilege to bring matters to public attention. I say that because Deputy Durkan felt we should not raise such matters unless we could substantiate them, otherwise people in positions of importance could lose their job.  If something untoward is happening about which Members are aware they should have the courage to raise that matter and they should not be stifled in this regard.</P>

      <P>What we are talking about here is central to the concept of making the House relevant to what is happening in modern society.  What we are talking about is a matter of public controversy, usually a matter of some import, otherwise we would not have this problem.  The House sometimes puts itself in a position where one imagines it is in <i>loco parentis</i> rather than a national parliament.  As Deputy Ferris said, Deputies do not always have the sense of duty and responsibility that goes with being elected to this House.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley gave a couple of examples.  I will cite the example confronted by my colleague, former Deputy Eric Byrne, in respect of the Cotter and McDermott case which had profound implications for equality in social welfare for a great many people.  The Deputy was not permitted to raise the matter in this House, or subsequently on the Social Welfare Bill, because aspects of it had to go back to the Supreme Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Matters of major public importance and public controversy can be discussed everywhere except in this House.  We are not in <i>loco parentis</i> with many of us <Col N="814" /> behaving as if we were in a créche.  Duties are imposed on membership of this House and committees of the House deal with breaches of that duty or responsibility. I agree that the proposals advanced here might represent an improvement, but they are restrictive. I have not thought about the formula advanced by Deputy O'Malley but if we are to be seen to be relevant and able to deal effectively with issues of the day, there is no need to impose chains on our ability to do our job.  We will have to look again at this question because I do not think the proposals advanced by the Minister are adequate, although I accept they represent an improvement.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleagues for sharing their time.  In relation to the difference between the Standing Order and the draft guidelines, there is a distinction between a matter of general public importance referred to in the Standing Order and the No. 1 guideline which states the matter should be of public policy.  That could lead to a problem in future as to whether a matter may or may not be raised.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy O'Malley's remarks about it not being possible for us to make statements here that can be made outside the House.  Nevertheless, we should be acutely aware of our privilege and not make statements in the House that we cannot stand over.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this issue. I am delighted the decentralisation programme has been extended to Dundalk, a town which has had a tortuous history. More than a year ago the Minister for Finance announced that 200 staff from the Revenue Commissioners and the Office of Public Works would be stationed in Dundalk.</P>
      <P>As a consequence of the completion of the Single European Market there was a surplus of approximately 100 customs and Excise staff in the greated Dundalk area and the Government decided to create roughly 90 jobs to accommodate them.  The Revenue Commissioners now say they have met their commitment to Dundalk under the decentralisation programme and in effect the town will get much fewer than the promised 200 jobs. That is not acceptable because even in the early eighties unemployment in Dundalk was above the national average.  I ask the Minister to coerce the Revenue Commissioners or some other Department, with the Office of Public Works, to decentralise to Dundalk so that the offices which will be built, pending planning permission and approval by the Office of Public Works, will be filled by the number of staff promised.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to denigrate the efforts of the Department, the Revenue Commissioners or the Office of Public Works in this regard.  We acknowledge that jobs were substituted, but the original commitment to provide 100 extra jobs in the area should be honoured.</P>

      <P>I acknowledge the points made by my colleague, Deputy Dermot Ahern.  I am aware of his keen interest in the decentralisation programme over the past number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Government announced in July 1991 that it had decided to decentralise sections of the office of the Revenue Commissioners to Dundalk, it was <Col N="816" /> agreed with the commissioners that the matter could be dealt with in the context of the surplus of Customs and Excise staff which would arise in the Dundalk area as a consequence of the completion of the Single European Market.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the Single Market and, in particular, the elimination of the fiscal frontier controls between member states had the implication of creating an overall surplus of approximately 600 customs and excise staff.  Within the Dundalk region 88 customs and excise staff were identified as surplus.</P>
    <P>In tackling the surplus situation the Revenue Commissioners set themselves the objective of providing alternative work for the staff affected in, or close to, their existing locations so as to minimise the disruption to the staff and their families. The Deputy will recall that was an issue where he and others lobbied to try to minimise the severity of the disruption of domestic arrangements of a great number of staff.</P>
    <P>Arising from the Single Market, including the surplus situation, the Government decided to give Revenue responsibility, <i>inter alia,</i> for the new work areas relating to the collection of Community intrastat statistics and VAT information exchange system.  It was further decided to locate these work areas in Dundalk.  Approximately 90 staff have been assigned to this new work in Dundalk and, as a result, the issue of compulsory retirement or redeployment of staff from the area has been avoided.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the situation I have outlined, I am satisfied that the Revenue Commissioners have met their commitment in relation to the decentralisation programme to Dundalk.  They have done so in a difficult situation by making the best possible arangements to protect the jobs of those staff based in Dundalk, and in such a way that they have been able to remain in the area and help the economy when it appeared that these jobs would be lost to Dundalk.</P>
    <P>The Government's decentralisation programme envisaged 125-150 posts for Dundalk; 90 of those posts have now been provided by the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="817" /> and about 60 staff from the Office of Public Works will also be transferred to Dundalk bringing the total to 150.  I will keep the Deputy informed and I thank him for asking the question.</P>

      <P>Thank you, Sir, for allowing me to raise this issue and I thank the Minister for coming here this evening.  It is appropriate that it is the Minister of State, Deputy Burton who will address this issue.  Among other women aspirants to public office, she was one of those who said that women will not wait.  I am making a case for a group of women who have already been asked to wait too long for money due to them under an EC directive, and those women will not wait any longer.  I speak for the thousands of women throughout the country who are due money retrospectively for the period December 1984 to December 1986.  I understand that approximately 110,000 women are due back payments, 75,000 of whom have alredy submitted applications.</P>
      <P>First, I ask the Minister to authorise payments in respect of those who have already submitted their applications; second, she is morally and legally obliged to inform those who have not already applied for their entitlements under the law and, third, she should take all steps to ensure that eligible applicants apply and, having applied, that payments will be issued as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The payments are substantial compared to the means of many of the applicants. For example, in the case of single women the approximate amount due is £342, for a married woman with an adult dependant it is approximately £900 and for women with two dependent children the amount due is £1,200.  That is a substantial amount of money the Government owes these women; I know many women who have borrowed from money lenders for less.  There is no justification in law for withholding those outstanding payments any longer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to tell those women when these payments will be made.  I also <Col N="818" /> ask her to ensure that women in receipt of health board payments, such as disabled person's allowance and allowances in respect of infectious diseases, are deemed eligible for this back payment.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would draw the Minister's attention to the fact that approximately 900 Cork women have already taken legal action in pursuit of their entitlements.  I ask the Minister to acknowledge that there is no justification for forcing women to take expensive legal action in pursuit of their entitlements.  The Minister is new to her office and, therefore, cannot be held responsible for what happened in the past, but I appeal to her to take immediate action to ensure that there is no further delay in making those payments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Ms. Burton) Joan Burton">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Ms. Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am replying on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods. First, I will outline the background to these cases.</P>
      <P>In accordance with an EC directive in 1978 equal treatment between men and women in social welfare matters was due to come into effect in December 1984. The implementation of the directive was delayed until May 1986 when the first part of equal treatment came into effect. Full implementation of equal treatment took place with effect from November 1986.</P>
      <P>The delay in implementing the directive meant that during the period December 1984 to May 1986 married women received a lower personal rate than other claimants in the case of unemployment benefit, disability benefit, invalidity pension and occupational injuries benefits. Also during that period married women received a maximum of 52 weeks unemployment benefit as against 65 weeks in the case of claimants generally.  During the period December 1984 to November 1986 married women were not entitled to claim household supplement for a dependent husband and/or dependent children except in exceptional circumstances and they were not entiled to claim unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="819" /> The provisions for paying equal treatment arrears to married women for the period December 1984 to November 1986 are contained in the European Communities (Social Welfare) Regulations, 1992 (S.I. No. 152 of 1992), which was introduced during the previous administration. The regulations provide for (a) the payment of a higher personal rate in the case of certain social welfare payments, (b) the extended duration of unemployment benefit, (c) payment of a household supplement in respect of a dependent husband and/or dependent children and (d) payment of unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure that married women affected by the equal treatment provisions were aware of their right to claim arrears, the Department carried out a mailshot of potential claimants in June and July 1992.  Some 111,000 married women were identified from the Department's records and issued with personalised claim forms.  There was also an extensive advertising campaign in the media and as a result a further 9,500 claim forms were issued, making a total of 120,500.  A separate section was set up within the Department to process the claims.</P>
    <P>Payment of arrears due is being made on a phased basis in 1992, 1993 and 1994 at a total cost of £57.5 million.  The regulations provide that arrears due in respect of the higher personal rates and extended duration of unemployment benefit be made within three months of the decision of the deciding officer.  They also provide for the payment of arrears in respect of household supplement and unemployment assistance entitlement to be made in two equal instalments &mdash; the first instalment to be paid not later than 31 December 1993 and the second to be paid not later than 1 July 1994 &mdash; with amounts of less than £100 to be paid in full in 1993.</P>
    <P>Payment of arrears due under phase 1, that is, the higher personal rates and extended duration of unemployment benefit, commenced in August 1992 and are expected to be completed by the end of March 1993 at a cost of £17.5 million.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="820" /> Payment of arrears under phase 2, that is, the payment of household supplement and unemployment assistance, will commence in a few weeks time.  Payments due will be made in equal instalments in 1993 and 1994 in accordance with the legislative provisions at an estimated total cost of £40 million.</P>
    <P>To answer some of the specific points raised by the Deputy, a total of 84,500 claims for arrears under the equal treatment provisions have been made.  Some 69,000 claims have been processed to date for phase 1 entitlement.  Of those processed 56,600 have been awarded payment and the remaining 12,400 were not entitled to arrears under phase 1.  A total of 55,109 claimants have received their phase 1 payments at a cost of £12.53 million &mdash; the average payment per claimant being £227.28.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy pointed out, there are different categories of women and varying levels of payment depending on the category involved.  The processing of almost 85,000 retrospective claims represents a significant administrative task for my Department.  Every effort is being made to ensure that all the claimants are paid their entitlements as quickly as possible in accordance with the provisions of the retrospective legislation. The staggered system of payment was designed partly to allow the payment of such a large number of claims to proceed in an orderly fashion.</P>
    <P>The Government has set out a clear timetable consistent both with the administrative capacity of the Department and the overall budgetary capacity of the Government to deal with the problem.  I have dealt with a substantial number of women who have had dealings with the Department and I know from experience that it is proceeding in an orderly fashion. I hope it will be concluded successfully.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate my constituency colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, on his new position and wish him every success.</P>
      <P>Since Monday last women in labour in Wexford General Hospital have been refused epidurals due to lack of insurance cover for the three consultant anaesthetists. Their malpractice insurers have insisted that under the present staffing arrangements it is unsafe for the anaesthetists to continue the 24-hour, seven day a week service they have been giving for some years at the hospital.</P>
      <P>The epidural service at Wexford General Hospital has been superb, epidurals were available to pregnant women on demand, seven days a week, 52 weeks of the year.  However, because of the lack of a resident anaesthetist and the necessity for more NCHDs under the guidelines of the Association of Anaesthetists, the Medical Defence Union and the present three consultants' malpractice insurers have asked them to cease this round-the-clock service because of the risks they perceive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from pregnant women who have been denied the service and have expressed their concern vociferously in Wexford.  The lack of this service will affect other areas of the hospital.  The extra NCHDs are required so that a complete cardiac arrest team is available around the clock in the cardiac unit at Wexford General Hospital.  An augmented service is also needed for patients on life support machines.  Effectively, an anaesthetist is contracted to such a patient once the patient is put on a life support machine, and without a round-the-clock service that support is not available.  Anaesthetists are required also to accompany a patient on a life support machine to another hospital or, to accompany any critically ill patient.  Therefore, although this issue is of concern to expectant <Col N="822" /> mothers in Wexford &mdash; particularly mothers expecting their first babies who have been comforted by the availability of this service &mdash; many other sections of the hospital are affected by the lack of sufficient staff in this area.</P>
    <P>I understand that a meeting was held yesterday between two consultant anaesthetists and health board personnel &mdash; one consultant was absent through ill health &mdash; and I hope the proposals put to the consultants resolve the problem. When that consultant has an opportunity to discuss the proposals with his two colleagues it is our hope that by Monday at the very latest a full official epidural service will be available 24 hours a day in Wexford General Hospital.  The position at present does not affect 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. elective surgery, caesarean operations &mdash; 95 per cent of which are done under epidural &mdash; because most of these operations can be scheduled between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. unless an emergency arises.</P>
    <P>Given the superb service provided by Wexford General Hospital and the consultants employed there over the last few years, I would ask the Minister to ensure that everything is done to meet their staffing requirements.  It was indicated that the anaesthetists would be unable to continue their 24 hour service from July if their staffing requirements, particularly the provision of a resident anaesthetist, were not met by the South-Eastern Health Board.  The hospital has requested four extra staff, but I imagine there has been a compromise in the interim.  However, we must bear in mind that the Medical Defence Union, under the Association of Anaesthetists, will be watching carefully to ensure that the staffing arrangements meet the necessary safety guidelines for patients and protect existing consultants from unnecessary claims.</P>

      <P>I thank my constituency colleague for her kind comments in regard to my appointment and for raising this matter in the House.  The availability of epidural services in Wexford General Hospital is an <Col N="823" /> important matter for our constituents and for the wider public.</P>
      <P>The South-Eastern Health Board is responsible for the provision of health services in Wexford General Hospital in the first instance.  On 13 January 1993, the consultant anaesthetists notified the South-Eastern Health Board of their intention to withdraw epidural services from 1 July 1993.  The board's management has been negotiating with the consultant anaesthetists in Wexford General Hospital since that time in relation to the level of staffing required for the anaesthetic department.  Comhairle na nOspidéal has approved three consultant anaesthetist posts for Wexford General Hospital, all of which are in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board's management met the anaesthetists on 21 January and 5 February 1993 to discuss staffing.  The board agreed to undertake a full review of the service and to consider appointing one additional consultant anaesthetist or, in the alternative, to appoint two junior anaesthetic staff.  The consultants agreed to continue the epidural service while the discussions were ongoing in relation to the issue.  As discussions were continuing, I am disappointed that the consultants <Col N="824" /> chose to withdraw the epidural service as and from last Monday.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Inspector's Interim Report was published on 31 July 1992. The Inspector has been continuing his investigation and in that regard has conducted inquiries not only at home but also abroad, with the permission and co-operation of the relevant authorities.  The Inspector is still not in a position to be definitive about when he can conclude his inquiries and finally report to me.  The House can be assured that no effort is being spared to bring matters to finality.</P>
      <P>With regard to the acquisition referred to by the Deputy, the Inspector, in his Interim Report, stated that he believed that the acquisition required examination to satisfy the Board of Telecom that it was a bona fide arm's length transaction. As the Deputy is probably aware, the Telecom Board privately commissioned a report of their own into the matter, which they published on 16 September 1992.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that I am not in a position to consider what further action might be taken on this matter until the Inspector has completed his current inquiries.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any evidence to support the view that the growing presence of large supermarket chains in rural areas are responsible for large scale closure of small businesses and consequent loss of jobs.  A recent press article which I have seen in this regard would suggest that any businesses which have closed in such circumstances are those which are operating inefficiently or with high borrowings.</P>
      <P>The expansion of large supermarket chains into rural areas of Ireland, while it must be welcomed in the overall interests of the consumer, will inevitably give rise to increased competition for small business already established in those areas.  Businesses which are inherently weak or inefficient will suffer most from such competition.  However, competition, as long as it remains within the law, must be welcomed.  The Competition Act, 1991 prohibits anti-competitive practices and the abuse of a dominant position in the market.  The Act applies to all sectors of the economy including the retail trade and leaves open to any person or business who is aggrieved by any anti-competitive activity prohibited under the Act, to have direct recourse to the Courts.</P>

      <P>The Programme for a Partnership Government has clearly identified Ireland's biggest challenge as the need to increase the number of sustainable <Col N="724" /> jobs in the economy and to reverse the rising trend of unemployment. Meeting this challenge will clearly require fundamental changes in attitude and behaviour in this country.</P>
      <P>The Government have established a number of new Departments as a clear indication of the type of change we want to bring about in our economy and our society generally.  The establishment of my own Department &mdash; the Department of Enterprise and Employment &mdash; provides a new focus on an old problem. In conjunction with the Department of Finance, which has overall responsibility for management of the economy, the new Department will have a central role to play in helping market-led enterprises to establish, develop, and grow in employment terms.</P>
      <P>Employment creation can be supported and encouraged by the State. However, the real work of finding and exploiting job creating opportunities comes down to the entrepreneur, whether in the private or public sectors. The importance of enterprise has been highlighted by placing it first in the name of the new Department of Enterprise and Employment.  The new Department will endeavour to set in place structures that will identify and nurture a spirit of enterprise in relation to job creation that will benefit all of our citizens in all areas of the country.</P>
      <P>As regards structural measures to increase employment opportunities, I will be focusing on two main areas: (i) implementations of the Culliton report; (ii) the County Enterprise Partnership Boards.</P>

    <P>In the more immediate term, I am very aware that the long term unemployed are in danger of becoming permanently excluded from the workforce if there is not active State intervention.  The Social Employment Scheme is the primary manpower intervention aimed at helping the long term unemployed aged 25 years or over re-enter the active workforce while assisting voluntary groups and public sector bodies to do worthwhile work which they would not otherwise have undertaken.  It is proposed to provide an <Col N="725" /> average of 13,500 places on the scheme in 1993.</P>
    <P>The Employment Incentive Scheme is also targeted at the long term unemployed as well as early school leavers and disadvantaged persons.  It is proposed to provide about 1,400 places on the scheme in 1993.</P>
    <P>FÁS offers a wide variety of training programmes which cater for all unemployed groups including the long term unemployed.  More especially, FÁS runs an Alternance Programme which is specifically targeted at the long term unemployed aged 25 years or over and those people wishing to return to the labour market after a prolonged absence. FÁS also operates a pilot Long Term Unemployed Initiative under which older long term unemployed persons in Tallaght, Dublin Inner City and Cork City North are placed in education, training and employment.  The assistance of the Co-operative Development Unit of FÁS is also available to unemployed persons with an interest in co-operative development. In total FÁS expects to provide some 14,000 training places in 1993.</P>
    <P>The Programme for a Partnership Government also provides for a number of responses to the problem of long term unemployment.  The Programme provides for an increase in the level of targeted wage subsidies for those on the Live Register for a year or more.  The aim will be the permanent re-integration of long term unemployed people back into the workforce.</P>
    <P>We are also seeking EC funding for the period 1994-1999 for a new Community Employment Development Programme which will represent a major initiative by this Government to assist the long term unemployed.  The programme, which will replace the Social Employment Scheme, will provide opportunities to long term unemployed people to undertake work of value to their local communities.  As well as ongoing work of social value, the programme will include work related to tourism and small infrastructure-type developments.  Participants will also engage in some training while working on the programme, further enhancing their <Col N="726" /> prospects of finding permanent employment. The aim will be to move towards a participation level of 30,000 each year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 19 together.</P>
      <P>As set out in the Programme for a Partnership Government I intend to stengthen Ireland's industrial, scientific and exporting base, in line with the recommendations of the Culliton report, to increase the level of directly productive activity and encourage a dynamic spirit of enterprise.  I envisage a broadening of industrial strategy to take in all the factors that affect output and productivity, including the fuller development of our human skills.  I intend to put a new emphasis on building up small industry and the productive use of indigenous resources, such as food processing and timber processing.</P>
      <P>My main priority as Minister will be to build a stronger industrial base which can make a bigger contribution to employment and provide a more secure basis for building increased national prosperity.</P>
      <P>As a result of these policies, I envisage that approximately 20,000 new jobs will be created this year in manufacturing and international services industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, as set out in the Programme for Government, a Community Development Programme for the long term unemployed will be put into operation by the County Enterprise Partnership <Col N="727" /> Boards across the country which will identify projects for improving their own areas.  European Community support will be sought for this programme and the aim will be to move towards a participation level of 30,000 each year.</P>

      <P>The Government gave a commitment in its Programme for Government to examine the possibility of introducing a national voluntary scheme of work sharing.  My Department is now preparing a discussion paper on the options which are available, as a basis for early discussions with the Social Partners. It is the Government's view that work sharing arrangements are best organised at enterprise level, facilitated where possible by institutional support. However, I will consider any proposals which emerge from the discussions.</P>
      <P>One of the possible ways in which available work can be shared better is through a reduction in overtime working. My Department has already held discussions with employers and workers representatives on this issue and is in the process of commissioning research into the subject.</P>
      <P>I should like to take this opportunity to say that any form of work sharing involves income sharing and that whatever strategies for work sharing may be decided upon, it is essential that there is no increase in costs leading to loss of competitiveness.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>A code of practice on dispute procedures, including procedures in essential services, was drawn up by the Labour <Col N="730" /> Relations Commission and was published in January 1992.  The aim of the code is to ensure that disputes are resolved without recourse to industrial action, by providing practical guidance on procedures for the resolution of such disputes. Particular emphasis is placed on the avoidance of disputes in essential services and the code sets out additional procedural safeguards for inclusion in agreements between employers and trade unions in such services.  The code has been widely circulated to the main interests concerned in the public and private sectors.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the voluntary nature of our industrial relations system, while the code of practice is not legally binding, it is set in a legal framework and can be taken into account by the industrial relations institutions such as the Labour Court or the civil courts when cases come before them.  It is intended to foster good practice and I am anxious that its provisions would be adopted in employer-trade union agreements, particularly in organisations providing essential services.  Progress in this regard has been disappointing and my Department, in consultation with the Labour Relations Commission, is following-up employers providing essential services. Their attention has been drawn to the need for the adoption of the provisions of the code and the Labour Relations Commission is pursuing with the companies how best implementation can be achieved.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that the statutory measures now in place provide substantial protection for part-time workers in supermarkets in relation to pay and conditions of employment.</P>
      <P>A Joint Labour Committee for the retail grocery and allied trades was established in 1991.  This led to the making of an Employment Regulation Order which came into force in May, 1992.  This Order sets out statutory minimum rates of pay and conditions of employment for workers covered by the Order in all retail grocery outlets, including supermarkets. The Order, which applies to both full-time and part-time workers, covers such matters as rates of pay, hours of work, overtime and holidays.</P>
      <P>The Order is enforced by the Labour Inspectorate of my Department.  The inspectorate is in the process of visiting each retail grocery outlet covered by the Order.  In addition, the inspectorate pursues reported breaches of the Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rates of pay of workers in areas of supermarket chains other than retail grocery are largely matters for collective bargaining.  However, a Registered Employment Agreement exists for the Footwear, Drapery and Allied Trades (Dublin and Dún Laoghaire).  This agreement <Col N="738" /> provides for legally enforceable pay rates for workers covered by the agreement, including those employed in clothing and footwear departments in supermarket chains in Dublin and Dún Laoghaire.  The agreement is also enforced by the Labour Inspectorate of my Department.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that, in 1991, the Worker Protection (Regular Part-Time Employees) Act, 1991 was brought into effect.  This Act extends to regular part-time employees, including those employed in supermarkets, the benefits of a wide range of labour legislation, such as legislation relating to unfair dismissals, minimum notice and terms of employment, holidays, redundancy payments, and maternity leave. Consequently, regular part-time workers are now entitled to essentially the same statutory entitlements as full-time workers under labour legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of equity for Irish industry is primarily a matter for the markets in the first instance.  The inflow of equity will be determined by the profitability of Irish industry which in turn is a function of the total environment within which Irish industry has to operate as set out in the Culliton report.  In this context I would like to reiterate the Government's commitment, as set out in the Programme for a Partnership Government, to strengthening Ireland's industrial scientific and exporting base in line with the recommendations of the Culliton report.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the need to increase the supply of equity to indigenous industry to aid its growth potential, and share the view of the Industrial Policy Review Group, the &ldquo;Culliton&rdquo; Group, as regards improving the supply of equity capital for Irish industry.  In this context the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-1997</i> sets out the Government's intention to extend the business expansion scheme for a further three years and to abolish the existing £75,000 lifetime cap on personal investment.  The Programme for Government also makes provision for the establishment of employee investment funds to act as a supplementary source of capital for small and medium sized enterprises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also mention other valuable initiatives to improve the supply of equity for industry such as the establishment in Ireland in 1991 of an EC backed Seed Capital Fund under the Industry Operational Programme and the recent establishment of the Special Investment Accounts, SIA's, which will be taxed at 10 per cent, and which will encourage a greater flow of investment into Irish equities.  The level of equity taken in industrial projects by the IDA and the number of companies in which they have invested have also increased significantly during the past few years.  It is an objective under the December 1990 Review of Industrial Performance to shift the form <Col N="741" /> of State aid to companies, such that up to 50 per cent of support for indigenous industry is in the form of equity or other remunerating forms of funding.</P>
    <P>Recently my Department completed a survey of the equity needs of Irish industry. The conclusions arising from this survey are under consideration at present with the aim of bringing forward a number of additional proposals for the provision of an increased supply of equity funding for Irish industry, in particular to manufacturing SME's.</P>
    <P>In addition, and whilst not strictly equity capital, the funding of the county enterprise partnership boards will include approximately £100 million from financial institutions in favourable loans to developing companies.  I am hopeful, therefore, that these initiatives will contribute to the improved availability of equity capital for Irish industry.</P>

      <P>High costs, whether insurance costs or any other costs, have an adverse impact on the traded sector of the economy in terms of output, employment and the ability of firms to compete in the market-place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of insurance is substantially determined by the frequency of claims and the cost of settling those claims. Effective risk management by businesses, including greater attention to safety by employers and employees in the workplace and on the roads, can yield <Col N="743" /> positive results in terms of lower insurance costs.</P>
    <P>The Government continues to play its role in attempting to improve the environment for insurance by encouraging greater safety in the workplace through the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health.  Similarly, following the work of the Inter-Ministerial Group on Motor Insurance, considerable Government attention is being given to road safety.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána, with the support of the Minister for Justice, continue to apply stricter enforcement of the road traffic laws and the Minister for the Environment will shortly be proposing substantial improvements to road traffic legislation.  Also, the Minister for Justice is preparing further changes to improve the operations of the Courts in resolving personal injury actions by means of a series of legislative changes aimed at bringing about a more effective and efficient system for dealing with liability insurance claims.</P>
    <P>The impact of all of these measures on the cost of insurance will ultimately depend on the timing and extent of their implementation and, most importantly, the attitude of the general public, including business and employees, and the legal and other professions.</P>
    <P>Let me add that the insurance industry itself also has a role to play especially in terms of controlling costs within its own ambit so that insurance policyholders do not incur avoidable costs.</P>

      <P>I am committed to providing <Col N="746" /> social welfare customers with improved services.  One of the service aspects receiving attention related to the methods used for making payments under the various schemes.  I want to provide a range of payment methods which will be more convenient for our customers and will ease the administration of cash payments.</P>
      <P>In order to create the necessary environment for improved service to clients I have decided that existing cash payment cases will be offered more modern and flexible payment arrangements on a phased basis.</P>
      <P>My Department has recently concluded an agreement with An Post to undertake the extra work arising for post offices.  This will ensure that social welfare customers can receive a truly modern service, with appropriate payment methods.  An Post is developing services which are broadly analogous to electronic funds transfer in addition to an already expanded range of methods used in post offices in the social welfare payment process.</P>
      <P>An Post is, and will continue to be, the main paying agency for social welfare customers.  Before the recent agreement, An Post was managing all pension payments, the majority of child benefit cases and about one third of unemployment payments.</P>
      <P>An Post now makes significantly more unemployment payments &mdash; currently close to 50 per cent of the total.  As circumstances permit, additional unemployment cases will continue to be transferred to An Post.  An Post also now manages 13,000 disability benefit weekly payments and ultimately that number is expected to increase to 30,000 cases.</P>
      <P>In parallel, we have been developing alternatives to An Post for those persons who, for one reason or another, find that payment via the commercial banks and certain other financial institutions would be more suitable for them.  One of the new methods being offered is electronic fund transfer or EFT.</P>

      <P>The person concerned has been employed on a part-time basis for some considerable time and claiming unemployment assistance for days of unemployment.</P>
      <P>In April 1991 social insurance cover was extended to all employees earning £25 per week or more.  As a result, over 26,000 part-time workers were brought into social insurance and can now be eligible for unemployment, disability, maternity and treatment benefits.</P>
      <P>Changes in the benefits system were required to accommodate this group. These changes came into force on 4 January, to coincide with the change in the benefit year.</P>
      <P>The entitlement of the person concerned was examined to see whether he could qualify for unemployment benefit from January 1993 on the basis of PRSI contributions paid in respect of his employment in the 1991-92 contribution year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a condition of entitlement to the extended unemployment benefit scheme that a person has suffered a substantial loss of employment.  It was established that the person concerned was continuing to work on the same part-time basis as <Col N="748" /> heretofore.  Accordingly, as he had not suffered a loss of employment he was not entitled to unemployment benefit from January 1993.</P>
    <P>The operation of this condition has been affecting some part-time workers who had established work patterns and were already entitled to unemployment benefit.  I am monitoring the effects of this new condition and the other changes which were made from January this year and I will be advising the Government of my findings.</P>
    <P>The person concerned continues to be entitled to receive unemployment assistance on each day that he is unemployed. His present rate of assistance, which takes account of his earnings from employment, is £2.82 per day.  If he is dissatisfied with the decision he can make an appeal to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office.</P>

      <P>A number of measures were introduced in 1992 with a view to making resources available for the improvements in social welfare services last year, which included a 4 per cent increase in weekly rates of payment and special increases in the lowest rates of payment.  The measures also sought to achieve better targeting of social welfare resources and, in some cases, remove certain anomalies that had existed for some ime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the changes involved the introduction of a new qualifying condition for treatment benefits which required claimants to have worked and paid PRSI contributions for at least 13 weeks in a recent tax year.  This measure was subsequently reviewed to ensure that persons unable to work because of a long term illness or <Col N="749" /> incapacity were not adversely affected. As a result, the regulations were amended last December to exempt persons in receipt of invalidity pension or long term disability benefit from this particular qualifying condition.</P>
    <P>A further measure taken in 1992 concerned the issue of guidelines to health boards regarding the making of certain payments under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  The purpose was to achieve a greater degree of consistency across all health boards.  In issuing the guidelines, it was not intended to remove or curtail the basic discretion which health boards have to make such payments and this matter was subseqently clarified to ensure that the needs of those who rely on such payments in time of exceptional need are met.</P>
    <P>I am at present reviewing the measures introduced last year and any changes considered necessary in the light of that review will be provided for in the context of the budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The surge in national milk output between September and December 1992 resulted in estimated national delivery figures increasing from 1.5 per cent below quota to 1 per cent over quota when calculated on a monthly basis.  The increase in milk production can be attributed to a number of factors including favourable autumn weather conditions, under-production during the earlier part of the year and the incentive provided by buoyant milk prices.  The fact that superlevy had not been incurred in the previous three years may also have caused producers to disregard the warnings issued in relation to their quota position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am well aware of the hardship caused to individual milk producers by the imposition of quotas and have taken <Col N="756" /> every action possible to limit the effect of this, particularly in relation to smaller producers.  While all producers who exceed their quota, following the allocation of whatever flexi-milk is available, are liable for levy, smaller scale producers have, and will continue to have, first call on flexi-milk.  Also, I have introduced, during 1992, for the first time in a single year, two separate temporary quota leasing schemes so that producers can lease quota without land to cover anticipated need at the end of the milk year.  The terms of the leasing arrangements were also improved by me in order to increase the availability of quota to those who require it by permitting producers to lease up to 99 per cent of their quota compared with 75 per cent previously.</P>
    <P>Under the quota system operated by Ireland, milk quota is allocated to milk purchasers.  While my Department monitors the national position on the basis of milk intake information received from purchasers, the purchaser is responsible for the day to day management of that quota and thus for the transmission to individual producers of information on an ongoing basis regarding his/her quota position.  In view of the arrangements for flexi milk allocation, both nationally and within purchasers, this exchange of information can take place only between an individual producer and his/her milk purchaser.</P>
    <P>The national milk intake position as at 31 January, when calculated on a monthly basis, was estimated at 1 per cent in excess of quota.</P>
    <P>In the Council negotiations on the new EC quota Regulations agreed last December, I was successful in ensuring that the provision enabling small producers to be given priority in the reallocation of unused quota should be maintained as a part of the overall system in the future.  The new regime, to apply from 1 April 1993, provides also for restructuring of quota and for greater flexibility in relation to land/quota link. I have already decided that restructuring and temporary leasing schemes will operate in Ireland at the beginning of the 1993/94 milk year.  It is my intention to pursue vigorously, in the coming prices negotiations, the issue of EC funding for <Col N="757" /> restructuring already raised by me at the Council of Ministers.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 79 and 80 together. The person named had 110 eligible ewes under the 1991 ewe premium scheme and according to my Department's records payment has been made in full.  He did not apply under the 1991 sheep headage scheme.</P>
      <P>The delay in making payment of the 1992 ewe premium has arisen due to the fact that the person named used a cancelled herd number on his application rather than the flock number which had replaced it.  I have now arranged for payment to be made as soon as possible. He did not apply under the 1992 sheep headage scheme.</P>

    <P>Ireland has been an active participant in the Europe Against Cancer Programme since 1988 when the Minister for Health established a National Committee to co-ordinate programme activities.  The Committee comprises representatives of the main statutory and voluntary organisations dealing with the information and education aspects of the programme.  The aim of the Europe Against Cancer Programme is to reduce deaths from cancer in Europe by 15 per cent by the year 2000.  Under the aegis of the programme the ten point Europe Against Cancer Code was widely distributed by the Health Promotion Unit of my Department. A range of initiatives has been undertaken, with the support of the programme, in relation to lifestyle factors considered to be implicated in the causation of a number of cancers e.g. smoking, alcohol and nutrition.  These initiatives include school and community based programmes.</P>
    <P>A National Cancer Registry has been established to collect comprehensive epidemiological information on the incidence of cancer in Ireland.</P>
    <P>It should also be noted that a cervical screening service is available to all women through their GPs, family planning <Col N="762" /> clinics, maternity hospitals and special clinics organised by the health boards.</P>

      <P>I would wish to encourage schools to facilitate local community groups wishing to use their premises in so far as that is compatible with their purpose and functioning as schools.</P>
      <P>During school hours, of course, primary schools must be used exclusively for the education of the pupils attending them.</P>
      <P>Normally the use of schools outside school hours is a matter for the Board of Management.  When allowing community groups to use a school, the Board must ensure that there is no disruption of school work, that adequate insurance cover applies and that any damage to school property be made good by those responsible for the activity.</P>

      <P>In the organisation of school transport services, Bus Éireann plan routes in such a way as to ensure that, as far as possible, every eligible pupil has a reasonable standard of service from the point of view of time-table, while, at the same time, ensuring that school transport vehicles are fully utilised in the most efficient manner.  In order to do this, individual vehicles are generally required to operate a number of services to schools and, consequently, extended time-tables often require some pupils to make an early start in the mornings and to wait for some time in the evenings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="765" /> Such an arrangement applies in this case and I am satisfied that the standard of service from the Carnacon area is on a par with that available in other areas.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a national school is determined by the enrolment in the school on 30 September of the previous year.</P>
      <P>In the case of St. Bernadette's junior national school there were 505 pupils enrolled on 30 September 1991.  This number warranted a staff of principal plus 16 assistants for the 1992-93 school year.  The school also has the services of a full-time remedial teacher and a concessionary teacher under the special scheme for schools serving disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>There were 462 pupils enrolled in the school on 30 September 1992, a drop of over 40 pupils compared with the preceding year.  While the staffing arrangements for the 1993-94 school year have not yet been finalised, an enrolment of 462 would warrant a staff of principal and 14 assistants.  My Department will be in touch with the school authorities regarding staffing as soon as the arrangements have been finalised.</P>
