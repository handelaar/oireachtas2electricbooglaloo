      <P>It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the proceedings on the Report and Final Stages of No. 7 if not previously concluded shall be brought to a conclusion at 6.45 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall in relation to amendments include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>On item No. 7, I would ask the Taoiseach if there is any point in resuming the debate on item No. 7, the Finance Bill, unless the Government can tell us the outcome of this morning's Cabinet meeting with regard to the legislation for the ill-fated tax amnesty?  Has the Government decided, and will it tell us what goodies are being given to the tax cheats from this country?  Is there any <Col N="1466" /> point in continuing the debate on the Finance Bill without knowing the terms of the legislation?</P>

      <P>I submitted a motion on the Order of Business this morning.  I understand it is being taken as an amendment to item No. 7.  Under Standing Order 102 I am seeking to have the Finance Bill recommitted.  The proposal is based on the fact that the announcement of the amnesty will have fairly serious implications for sections of the Bill which have already been dealt with on Second Stage and on Committee Stage.  Virtually all the sections dealing with PAYE tax relief, personal reliefs, the 1 per cent levy and a range of other matters were dealt with prior to the announcement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I clear up a matter?  The Deputy referred to a motion.  May I take it that the Deputy has an amendment in mind?</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I will read the text of the motion to you.  It is as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That, in view of the announcement <Col N="1467" /> by the Government of an amnesty for tax cheats subsequent to the completion of the Second Stage debate and a significant portion of the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill, 1993, and in the light of the implications of the amnesty for those sections of the Bill dealing with general tax policy approved prior to its announcement, and the principle that all taxpayers should receive equitable treatment, the Bill be recommitted to the commencement of Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I wish to move a motion under Standing Order 102 which provides for the recommital of a Bill once that Bill has not reached Report Stage.  The order this morning is that this Bill be taken on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but putting a motion of this kind is not in order at this stage.  The Deputy cannot move a motion at this time to recommit a Bill. Under the order of the House today the Report and Final Stage of the Bill are to be completed at 6.45 p.m.  I would point out to the Deputy that, under Standing Order 102 to which he referred, a motion to recommit may be moved only before <Col N="1468" /> the order for Fifth Stage has been made and this has been done.  I can entertain an amendment but not a motion of the kind the Deputy has indicated.</P>

      <P>I will not get into a dispute with the Chair about whether it is a motion or an amendment.  My reading of the Standing Order, however, is that the order has been proposed but has not yet been made.  If the Chair wants to take it as an amendment to No. 7&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <P>On the RTE news report of the proceedings of this House on this topic at 9 p.m. last evening, it was reported that various people had spoken but that the Minister for Finance was prevented by time constraints from entering into and participating in the debate. That, of course, is a misconception of the rules of the House.  Once Deputy Cox had moved his amendment at approximately 5.15 p.m. yesterday it was open to the Minister for Finance to speak at any time he chose.  I think I am the eight or ninth Deputy who has spoken on this amendment.  Let me make it clear that the Minister could have come in if he had wished.  I invite the House to consider why the Minister chose to take the very unusual step of not speaking on the debate on this amendement at a reasonably early stage and to let it go over into a second day before he would intervene. Perhaps the reason, as is quite widely speculated, is that he does not support this proposal at all and that very probably he is in full agreement with the amendment that is now before the House but felt precluded yesterday, pending the meeting of Cabinet this morning, from expressing his views.  I hope that when I have concluded we will hear the Minister speak.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, Sir, I will listen very attentively to what Deputy O'Malley has to say but the practice in this House during all the time Deputy O'Malley has been here is that on Finance Bills the Minister speaks second last on an amendment <Col N="1478" /> tabled by an Opposition Deputy and last on an amendment in the name of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not certain that there is a different practice for Finance Bills but I was a Minister for a great deal longer than the present Minister for Finance and as a Minister I intervened on Report Stage at various points in the debate.  I was frequently invited by the proposer of an amendment to speak immediately after him, because it made the debate more meaningful for subsequent speakers and for the proposer if they knew what view the Government was going to take in regard to the amendment. If ever there was a case of being anxious to hear the details of the Governments's view on this matter, it is on this amendment.</P>
      <P>We are very fortunate that we are able to debate this matter in the House at all because were it not for the astute drafting of Deputy Cox in getting the amendment tabled in the position where it is, we would have had no debate at all on the matter.  I think he had to stretch a point to ensure that we had a debate.  As the whole country is outraged by what the Government proposed last week, it seems remarkable that the House came within a hair's breadth of not debating the matter at all and would not have but for the skill of Deputy Cox.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before going into the detail of the matter it is worth recalling for the benefit of the House what Deputy Michael McDowell said in regard to the provisions of Article 40 of the Constitution.  He said it here yesterday and he said it in a newspaper article that was published over the weekend.  I have not heard anybody contradict him and that is very significant.  I believe the courts will not allow a situation where there is clearly an arbitrary distinction drawn between citizens, where one law binds the great majority and a special law arbitrarily legitimises others' non-compliance with the law. This is a very fundamental aspect of this affair and in many respects makes a great many other arguments about the detail <Col N="1479" /> of it somewhat academic and possibly even irrelevant.</P>
    <P>Social cohesion, community togetherness and respect for the law have all taken a battering in Ireland in the past few years.  In particular, the very concept of equality or egalitarianism, which should underpin a truly Republican constitution and form of government, has been seriously undermined by the spate of business scandals, the steady deterioration in law and order and by a growing feeling that there is one law for the great bulk of citizens and a much more selective, <i>á la carte</i> legal code that can be availed of by a wealthy elite in our society.</P>
    <P>This has led to an understandable sense of outrage and dismay on the part of ordinary people up and down the country &mdash; the people who, against all the odds of economic recession, get on with the task of making a living and rearing their families.  Many of these people are struggling against terrible odds, especially those who are out of work and trying to get by on the dole and other social welfare benefits.  That sense of outrage and dismay is shared by people in business who struggle against excessive State costs and against our geographical handicaps but who nevertheless manage to carve out export markets and thereby help to create and sustain jobs for hundreds of thousands of their fellow citizens. All these decent people, from every walk of life, have simply been outraged by the golden circles and privileged elites unmasked by such events as the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Beef Processing Industry, the Telecom Ballsbridge site scandal and the insider dealing in the former sugar company.</P>
    <P>These events came to light while the Progressive Democrats were in Government and I can certainly say that we sought to act decisively and effectively in investigating these various scandals.  The public was, I believe, reassured by the fact that these scandals were tackled and not swept under the carpet.  Understandably, they have to suspend judgment on the eventual resolution of <Col N="1480" /> these matters since the investigations are still not completed in many cases and in a sense the jury is still out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, Sir, I do not think I am.  The general mood of public anger and dismay was not fully assuaged by the establishment of these various inquires, and rightly so.  The public mood that sought redress for them was a key factor in last November's general election.  There was a widespread and justifiable level of public anger that politicians and political parties could not ignore, and no party in this House sought to capitalise more on it than the Labour Party.  Indeed, I have little doubt that their historic and remarkable electoral success was in large measure due to their apparent response to the public mood of outrage at scandals and golden circles. The very title of their manifesto in that election summed up their apparent stance.  It declared Labour's political objective to be to &ldquo;Put justice into economics and trust into politics&rdquo;.  It is described as a two part programme, which they highlight on the cover of their manifesto.  That was backed up by a lot of talk about restoring ethics to Government. Since this strange Government has come to office they have sought to persist with the idea of an Ethics in Government Bill.  Well, I am afraid that that highsounding rhetoric that was heard so much from Labour last November, and which reaped them such rich political dividends, sounds more than just a little tawdry and hypocritical today, especially when judged in the context of this proposed and so called tax amnesty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the tax cheats evaded tax liabilities of 60 per cent in the mid-eighties. Some of these illegally removed from this country £1 million on which £600,000 was legitimately owed to the tax man at that time.  The Government is saying to such a person now: &ldquo;We know you owe us £600,000&rdquo;&mdash; indeed a lot more, because <Col N="1481" /> they also owe tax on the interest that that money would have earned abroad since then &mdash;&ldquo;but if you give us just £150,000, we will let you retain all the rest of your illegal gains.&rdquo;  Imagine a bank robber taking £6 million in a raid and being told that if he gives back £1.5 million of the £6 million he has stolen we will be satisfied and we will give him immunity against prosecution.  That is the clear message which this extraordinary Government of Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party is now sending to wealthy tax cheats and evaders.</P>
    <P>I received today a letter from a man who was in recent times the President of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland and who was the tax partner in a large accountancy practice in Dublin and also the senior partner in that practice. He is a man of the highest standing in his profession and perhaps I would be permitted to read this letter addressed to me as follows:</P>
    <P>Dear Dessie,</P>
    <P>You have never previously had a letter of protest from me.</P>
    <P>The current proposal for a tax amnesty, with a tax rate of 15%, is so unconscionable that I must protest with all the strength at my command. Should it go through the State will have lost all moral authority in the tax and Social Welfare fields.  It is akin to giving the evaders a gift of anything from 50% to 75% of the tax which they should have paid.  Bear in mind that it applies to those who did not avail of either of the two previous amnesties.</P>
    <P>I have read the various reasons advanced in support of the proposal. They are less than unconvincing.</P>
    <P>To argue that by this means the Exchequer gets something where otherwise it would have got nothing carries no weight.  Should a bank which has been robbed offer to accept 25% or 50% of the loss from the robbers in return for immunity from prosecution? The answer is obvious.  The public would be outraged.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1482" /> To argue that the Exchequer is badly in need of the money is even more disturbing.  Are we all to be relieved of compliance with standards and with law whenever economic need presses?</P>
    <P>To argue that there will be a voluntary inflow of capital likely to be utilised in funding increased economic activity is nonsense as any economist will confirm.</P>
    <P>To argue that it brings new clients into the system is naive.  Those not already in the system are unlikely to accept the invitation to come into the open.  In any case, most of the pool of undisclosed savings is likely to be held by persons already in the system.</P>
    <P>I urge you to use your influence and vote to have the current proposal withdrawn. It is offensive, bad public policy and will have long-tailed adverse consequences.</P>
    <P>Yours sincerely,</P>
    <P>I agree with every line in that letter and I cannot imagine anyone in this country of greater standing or qualification to write it.  That is his view and he is dealing with tax all his life.  Not alone is he an expert on the letter of tax law in this country, he is also, I suggest, an expert on the spirit of tax law in this country.</P>
    <P>I received another letter this morning, Sir, addressed to Mr. Noel Dempsey, TD and Mr. B. Fitzgerald, TD, a copy of which was sent to Deputy J. Bruton and I.  That letter reads:</P>
    <P>Dear Sirs,</P>
    <P>I write in connection with the Government's proposed tax amnesty for residents of this State who are behaving in a criminal fashion.</P>
    <P>The proposal to award persons who have signed incorrect tax returns (a criminal offence), and thus condone the activities of those who engage in fraudulent actions and reward their dishonesty is grossly offensive to the regular taxpayer.</P>
    <P>I am a taxpayer who could have chosen to move money illegally out of the State, but because I am an honest <Col N="1483" /> law abiding citizen who believes in democracy it is my obligation and duty to do the patriotic thing.  No one likes paying taxes but if you live in a democracy you abide by the rules.</P>
    <P>I protest again that your proposal to reward those who have defrauded the system and fellow taxpayers is disgusting and grossly offensive, whilst those who are honest are penalised for being so.</P>
    <P>When one harks back to the election platitudes about ethics and high standards one is filled with a sense of being cheated and deceived by the Government elected to serve the people.</P>
    <P>I, and countless thousands of others, must wait four years to show our disgust.</P>
    <P>Those two letters&mdash;one from an ordinary compliant taxpayer and the other from an expert in tax, one of the leading people in the country &mdash; sum up the general attitude in this country to what is apparently now proposed by the Government.</P>
    <P>I remarked at the outset of my speech that the Minister for Finance had chosen, rather extraordinarily, not to intervene in this debate so far although we have had eight or nine speakers on this amendment up to now.  I sympathise with the Minister for Finance because I am well aware that he does not support this proposal and the advice he has got is clearly and obviously against it.  He is in a very difficult position, but it is not the first time a Minister, whether of Finance or otherwise, found himself in a position like this.  Ministers sometimes have to implement things with which they fundamentally disagree, but they are not particularly important. However, this is of grave importance because it will have repercussions for years to come.  If a Minister finds himself in that situation he has an honourable way out rather than acting against his better judgment and against the advice he knows is right.</P>
    <P>Press reports suggest that the Taoiseach is the principal author of this illadvised measure and that it is he who has sought to force it through the Government <Col N="1484" /> and has apparently succeeded.  The best professional advice to him on this proposal is clearly totally against it.  That advice was from the Department of Finance, the Revenue Commissioners and outside bodies like the Institute of Taxation and other people such as the man whose letter I have just read.  The Taoiseach sought to override that advice for reasons best known to himself.  This is a democracy and the Minister is answerable to this House and ultimately to the people.  He is entitled to override advice if he believes strongly enough in what he is doing and if he can justify it.  However, people should remember what the outcome was when a Taoiseach last ignored the best professional advice that was available to him in 1987 and 1988.  The consequences on that occasion were considerable. The consequences on this occasion will be far more wide-reaching. At least what happened on the last occasion was confined, broadly speaking, to one industry, even though it was a major one.  This effects everybody in the country.  This appals everybody in the country and it will undermine the very consensual fabric on which this or any other democracy is founded.</P>
    <P>I know, Sir, that this Government has the largest majority of any Government ever in Dáil Éireann since its establishment; but there comes a time when, if the Government of the day wants to do something which is so absolutely perverse and which undermines our very democratic fabric and the constitutional rights of the ordinary citizens, this House must assert itself.  This House is the only bulwark between the Government and the people who will suffer from their action. This is the time when this House should stand up as a House and say to the Government, irrespective of its majority, that we cannot have it, that we will not have it and that the Government will have to withdraw this proposal.  I invite this House to do that because this is an occasion when this House should assert the ultimate supremacy of the legislative arm and not enact into law something that is grotesquely unsuitable to be enacted into law.  In the last resort, of <Col N="1485" /> the three branches of Government, this House is the only one that can stop this happening.  I invite this House to support this amendment, which I think pretty well every one in this House privately agrees with, to support the supremacy of the Legislature and thereby the supremacy of the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to compliment Deputy Cox on putting down this amendment. When the amnesty was announced it was like a cloud hanging over the Finance Committee and we were precluded from discussing it.  Dealing with the Finance Bill in those circumstances was like discussing something in a vacuum because we do not know what variations there will be.  However, we know the likely form of this amnesty.</P>
      <P>In the last few years Irish politics, business etc. has been debased by a series of scandals.  The Irish people, 80 per cent of them, particularly PAYE earners, have become very critical of the system.  Given the climate out there it is unfortunate that it has been decided to introduce an amnesty now.  The idea of an amnesty has been hawked around for many years. It is interesting that during the term of office of the former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, this idea was floated but he, quite wisely, did not run with it.  This Taoiseach appears to be very supportive of the idea.  Particularly disappointing is the fact that it has leaked out that many of the Cabinet Ministers do not appear to be supportive of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people who participated in the Finance Committees in the last few years have seen the Revenue Commissioners get a lot of powers.  That has lead to a certain amount of criticism which comes back on politicians.  In the last few days three different businesses contacted me and were extremely critical of this amnesty.  In one case a small businessman had the sheriff screaming for £160 because his VAT returns were late.  The businessman in question told the sheriff in no certain terms where to get off, but obviously there will be a follow-up to that saga.  That businessman made that complaint in the context of this amnesty. <Col N="1486" /> Another case related to a businessman whose VAT payments were in arrears over the year and who got a penalty of £800.  One might say it is right that this should be so.  Maybe it is, because the powers have been given to the Revenue Commissioners.  However, many of those small business people are finding it difficult to sustain families and keep the show going and they feel that there is a punitive tax regime in operation.  To introduce an amnesty in that context surely flies in the face of logic.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that in recent times the media have been saying that the country is awash with money.  The devaluation, which many people feel should have taken place sooner, has impacted by improving the finances in this country. One wonders then whether it is wise to consider an amnesty at this point.  Maybe when we had inflated mortgages and interest rates and needed extra money in the economy it might have made sense, but it certainly does not now.  I am appalled at the whole idea.  Take the example of the PAYE worker.  He has to pay PAYE, PRSI, an employment levy, a health levy and, under the recent Finance Bill, a further 1 per cent levy.  These people are buffeted on all sides.  Can you imagine what they must think when they see tax evaders, people who have cheated the system, being rewarded, because that is what is happening?  If those people had any loyalty to the country they would not have taken their money out and put it into the tax havens, as they have done over the years.  We are talking about very wealthy people in many cases how have invested abroad.  If those people felt that way in the past, how can we be sure that they will bring the money back into the country?  I would imagine that if I were in that situation and had benefited in the past I would be very reluctant to do so on the basis that the Revenue Commissioners would then be aware who the tax evaders, the tax cheats were.  The companies involved may fear extra harrassment afterwards and may think twice about bringing their money back.</P>
    <P>People are comparing this with the amnesty that was introduce in 1988 but, <Col N="1487" /> as has been said by many speakers, it is much different.  It is worthwhile noting that Cathal MacDomhnaill, when addressing the Committee of Public Accounts last April, stated in relation to the sum of £547 million revenue received in 1988, that it would probably have been feasible at that stage for the Department of Finance to recover much of that money, given time, because they were aware of the tax evaders and there were only some cases about which they were unaware.</P>
    <P>This amnesty measure flies in the face of logic.  It is not right.  I respect what the Minister for Finance has been trying to achieve in this area in recent years.  This amnesty measure will make life more difficult for officials in his Department and in the Revenue in that they will be confronted by people who consider they have supported the system down the years. Those people will react and tell officials in the Department of Finance and in Revenue to stop screwing them.  When the cheats, the fat cats and those who have made a great deal of money out of the system can hide money abroad, bring it here and have to pay only 15 per cent tax on it.  It is illogical.  I was interested to hear the Taoiseach's comments on the radio yesterday on his return from Malaysia. He mentioned the word &ldquo;economy&rdquo; 12 times in a short space of time.  He stated that if this money is recovered it will stimulate investment and create more jobs.  I wonder is this realistic?  I do not see those people investing their money in this country, being latterday patriots and creating jobs.</P>
    <P>Like other speakers, I am surprised at the Labour Party's stand on this issue. We get elected on our policies, but in some cases we may get elected under false pretences.  The Labour Party have lectured us on ethics many times since the election.  What is happening is unethical. Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan said yesterday that he has had many meetings during the week about this issue.  There is a reaction from the electorate; they say this measure is wrong.  If it is wrong it can still be amended.  If it is unwise and foolish to <Col N="1488" /> proceed with it, we should take a logical decision and back away from it.  The move is ill-conceived, ill-timed, wrong, a hypocrisy and a mockery of the electorate who tried to do the right thing in the past.</P>
    <P>I have some faith in the Minister in relation to his taking commonsense decisions.  As previous speakers have said, if the Minister considers this measure to be wrong he should say so to the Taoiseach. Many more people would respect the Minister for doing that.  His constituents, the majority of whom come from the PAYE sector and of whom many are unemployed, would respect him for acting.  The Taoiseach is a successful businessman but he should realise he is running the country and has a responsibility to this House.  At Cabinet level he should not act like Rambo.  If members of the Cabinet consider such a measure to be wrong and if the professional advice given by the Revenue, the Department of Finance, the Institute of Taxation, chartered accountants and other groups say that it is wrong, surely it is illogical to proceed with it.  Should the Minister ignore the advice of those various groups and individuals, he will do so at his peril.</P>
    <P>This House has been debased because the electorate are inclined to tarnish all politicans with the same brush.  They consider that we let such measures go through.  They have been sickened by scandals that have persisted in the past. We are driving another wedge into the Irish body politic by introducing a measure of kind in question.  The electorate are sickened by what is happening. If we allow this measure go through, it will have long term implications for politicians. It will damage the system and halt the progress that appears to have been made by the Department of Finance and Revenue in the past to reduce tax evasion. It will have a corosive effect on the taxation system.  It is wrong and we should be logical enough to realise that. We should not proceed with this tax amnesty.  Economists and journalists writing in the weekend newspapers reported that this country is awash with cash.  That is welcome but they do not <Col N="1489" /> consider that the climate is conducive for the introduction of this amnesty.  I hope commonsense will prevail and that when this measure is rationally thought out the Minister will not proceed with introducing it.</P>

      <P>Having listened carefully to the debate on this section of the Bill I am even more convinced that we need a tax amnesty.  There have been many self-righteous and unconvincing arguments put forward to justify opposition to the measure.  The Opposition have behaved like a chorus of altar boys living in an unreal world.  Politicans live in the real world and are aware that there are those who support tax evasion.  In our society tax evasion is endemic, it is widespread. Politicans know the reality of life to a greater extent than many others.  The argument against this measure is a monument of bogus punditry, it is sound and fury signifying nothing.  It is hypocrisy.</P>

      <P>As I stated before I was interrupted by Deputy Cox, tax evasion in our society is endemic and widespread.  It affects politicians, journalists, trade union employees, etc.  There is a case in the media today in respect of this issue.  Many people evade taxes on their income.  That is the position.

      <P>I am not squeamish about being investigated.  I can stand in this House and take criticism from any Member.  My record is clear on any issue and that is why I have spoken on issues during the years and will take issue with anybody in our society.  I am not part of any golden circle.  I receive little income in respect of election campaigns.  My election <Col N="1491" /> campaign cost me £4,000, which I raised largely myself.  I fight campaigns on income I receive and I can speak in the House without fear or favour.  Journalists are not in a position to point the finger at anybody.  They are not paragons of virtue.  They have been known to doctor their expenses.  I have heard much hypocrisy during the last two days, but I will talk to any Member on any issue in this House.  I came here this morning to face down the Opposition.  Anything they have to say to me can be said now, I will face them head on.</P>
      <P>So far as I am concerned there are three ways of looking at this question. The first is to ignore the money invested abroad and adopt the attitude of the three monkeys, see nothing, hear nothing and do nothing, about it: leave it out there. It is nice to be on the side of the angels but there are no angels when it comes to tax evasion.  The second way is to condemn the practice and say that those people who invested the money abroad are unpatriotic, have behaved in an illegal and immoral way for taking the money from this country and investing it overseas to avoid paying taxes on it.  We must not forget also that many of our accountants have made tax evasion an art form here.  One celebrated accountant, now deceased, worked totally in the area of holding money for people, sometimes writers or celebrities, and enabling those people to avoid paying taxes on that money.  That is a very well known fact. It is well known that other accountants also make their living from tax evasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third aspect is a more realistic one and a more difficult one to confront, namely, to accept the fact that a large amount of money &mdash; it could be £2 billion or £3 billion &mdash; is invested abroad.  It should not be invested abroad, it would be much more beneficial if it was invested in Ireland.  We must accept that people who have money invested abroad did not pay their legal taxes originally and it would be difficult to get it back here in order to make these people pay their fair share of taxes.  Fine Gael cannot point the finger at anybody as their amendment <Col N="1492" /> proposed that 10 per cent tax should be paid on this amnesty.  Only last week in this House Fine Gael were in favour of a tax amnesty and charging a 10 per cent levy on the money being returned.  I do not say how the money should be taxed when it is returned.  We should try to recoup as much as possible, entice some of it into Government bonds and also into productive investment here.</P>
    <P>The question of a tax amnesty is not unknown in stronger economies than ours.  In more recent years Germany and France, to name two European countries, had to resort to tax amnesties to recoup money invested abroad.  Germany and France have two of the strongest economies in the European Community.  They had recourse to that action and we are now required either to do the same or ignore it.  We have no other way of tackling the matter.  I also hope that if the money is returned here a number of measures could be adopted. The hypocrisy that is evident on this side of the House is very manifest when it comes to Private Members' Motions and Private Members' Bills.  Every week we have a chorus requesting our Ministers to spend more money without telling us where that money should come from.</P>
    <P>Our Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, is one of the most capable and caring Ministers in this House.  However, he is besieged every week by people looking for money and, occasionally, I besiege him also in leading deputations to him concerning child abuse in our society and implementing the Child Care Act at a cost of £40 million.  In more recent times the friends and parents of the mentally handicapped have been lobbying Members looking for £16.5 million, including £6.5 million for my area in the mid-west.  Their case is a deserving one and they have carried out great work for the mentally handicapped.  Recently we had a deputation of physically handicapped people seeking money from the Government.  Throughout the country hospitals also require improvements and rebuilding, including my area of Ennis, Milford Hospice in Castletroy and many more.  Members support those claims for <Col N="1493" /> funding without indicating to the Minister where the money should come from.</P>
    <P>It is impossible for us to impose further taxes unless we put a tax on cigarettes. Apart from that, there is no other way we can levy taxes.  We in the Labour Party have no facility for printing our own money, unlike another party in this House in the past when it was alleged they had their own facility for printing money.  I often wished I could do that but we do not have such a facility.  In the absence of that, I can say that I do not condone people acting illegally or in an immoral way by not paying their taxes here but it is a problem that is widespread. It is not confined to those who invest their money abroad.  It is all around us and people who invest in political parties at election times are not asked by the political parties where the money is coming from.  When a barrister defends in court someone involved in paramilitary activity he does not ask where the money to pay him or her is coming from.  This issue is not black and white and there are very few &ldquo;Simon Pures&rdquo; in this House, or the other House, as far as I am concerned.</P>
    <P>We are enduring a year of crisis with 300,000 people unemployed and we must face the reality of this issue.  We must recoup as much of this money as possible. We should not have a series of amnesties, let this be the last one and let it be enforced strictly and correctly.  In future we must examine how these people were able to take the money out of the country in the first instance.  That is the more pertinent question, how they could do this with impunity.  That loophole must be closed and when the money is returned we must ensure those people are brought back into the tax net and that they pay their fair share of taxes like the rest of us.  That would be a far more positive and constructive attitude to adopt than to behave as the Opposition is behaving today by engaging in a chorus of cat-calls and abuse in the House.  They are burying their heads in the sand on this issue.  At the end of the day if we do not introduce this tax amnesty our economy and the PAYE sector will be no better off and we <Col N="1494" /> will gain nothing.  If this amnesty goes ahead, if it is successful and the money is returned and taxes are levied on the people involved, that money can be used in an intelligent way to achieve some of the aims I mentioned in relation to the problem of unemployment, eliminating the 1 per cent levy and promoting services for the mentally and physically handicapped.</P>
    <P>These are positive ways to deal with the problem and I am not impressed by the behaviour of the Opposition.  I found their tax proposals totally unconvincing, and totally personalised.  In private some have indicated different views to me. They have told me in private they support the amnesty but in public they are striking a posture.  They do not convince me.  On the contrary, the more I hear from them the more I am convinced that this amnesty is not only necessary but can be beneficial for our country.  I am not a masochist, I am not a Matt Talbot socialist, but I do not believe in people suffering. If we can get into our economy money that can be used to alleviate stress and unemployment that is a good measure and I am pragmatic in that respect.  Therefore, I am supporting the introduction of this amnesty and I will not change my mind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to the last contribution and even though it begged a reply and a few retorts I will refrain from that.  I commend the tabling of this amendment and, indeed, the mover of it for the ingenuity he applied to it and his obvious understanding of procedure within this House which has enabled a fairly elaborate debate to take place on the Government's tax amnesty proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel also, having listened to many of the contributions on this Finance Bill both on Committee Stage and on Report Stage, that the Minister for Finance is probably not the author of this proposal. As has been suggested by others, if he does not support this amnesty and if it is being jack-booted through by the Government, it really is a question of him considering his position in Cabinet for <Col N="1495" /> the sake of his integrity.  Either he is fully behind the decision as the Minister responsible in this area or he is not.  If it is being forced on him he owes it to the House to indicate his position and for is own sake he should take advice from colleagues on all sides and indicate where his position as Minister for Finance now lies.</P>
    <P>The Government proposal is an unjust attack on the compliant taxpayer, that is the vast majority of the body of taxpayers in this country.  They do not like paying tax, the rates of tax have been penal &mdash; our time this morning does not allow us to go into why that is so and how we have arrived at this position &mdash; but the vast majority of ordinary salary and wage earners, the business people involved in small or medium sized enterprises and most of the larger companies here, have paid their taxes, albeit at penal rates. They may have considered not doing so, they may have envied those who somehow managed to get away with it by salting money abroad.  It is our duty in this House not to stand by those who have thwarted the system but to stand by those who, through very difficult times, have upheld the system for the sake of democracy and have complied with legislation and the letter of the law even though at times they have seriously questioned legislation and tax rates here, and understandably so.</P>
    <P>The Government proposal is an unjust attack on the compliant taxpayer and on the fabric of society generally.  By this proposal, ironically, the Labour Party has been proved right that Deputy Albert Reynolds is unfit to govern.  That was Deputy Dick Spring's view last November. That view changed rapidly but I remind the Labour Party of its opinion then and ask whether it was not 100 per cent right.  The Labour Party should consider its position.  If it wants to retain moral credibility, it should leave Government or else come into the House &mdash; to my knowledge we have not heard from any Labour Minister in this debate &mdash; and state the reason it supports this amnesty and the details concerning it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1496" /> The Taoiseach told us yesterday that there will be no losers, implying he could not understand what all the fuss was about.  There will be losers because the terms of the amnesty will undermine good practice in the financial world generally. This follows on the difficulties in the business sector in the last year or two. The amnesty is a very bad signal to those watching, particularly in view of our efforts to establish a financial services centre, to attract financial services to Ireland and establish ourselves as leaders in this field.  Business will not invest in a corrupt culture.  Under the terms of this amnesty, not only will penalties and interest be waived but a 15 per cent tax rate is suggested for those who bring their money back.  The view is that there is a corrupt business culture in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Considering the excellent efforts made by many, including the Minister, to establish Ireland as a centre for financial services, I ask him to reconsider the terms of this proposal.  There is too much to be lost.  I am extremely disappointed, but not surprised, that the extent of the Taoiseach's understanding of the problem is that there will be no losers.  Need we say more?  If that is his understanding, we are on a loser with Deputy Albert Reynolds as Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>I will not go into the whole question of the demoralisation of the Revenue Commissioners.  That can be taken as stated and it needs little underlining by me.  There must be tremendous fury among the Revenue Commissioners, who have spent some time trying to increase compliance with all taxes, at this amnesty which is being foisted on them. There would be greater acceptance of the proposal if the tax rate for this returned money was set at the original rate that should have been paid.  In those circumstances, those benefiting from the amnesty would have to pay the same as was paid by those who stood by their guns and declared their money down the years.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Government will change its mind, at least on the terms of the amnesty.  I hope the Minister's silence and the fact that he has been prepared to <Col N="1497" /> sit here and listen patiently to so many contributions indicates that changes will be made.  Maybe he cannot intervene until he knows what the Cabinet wants to do on this matter.  I hope whatever change is introduced in the original proposal will at least ensure that the vast majority of taxpayers will not be undersold by this Labour-Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>Another interesting aspect of this proposal is that there are three Bills which I believe will be deferred not only until the amnesty is introduced but until it has been terminated and the money counted. I do not think this Government, with all the empty rhetoric about ethics in Government and standards in high places, would have the neck to introduce the money laundering convention terms while at the same time operating an amnesty to collect money from all over the country and from non-resident bank accounts.  Perhaps the Minister, when replying, will indicate where we stand in terms of compliance with the money laundering convention, when we are going to meet our international and EC obligations in this area and whether he is concerned that there might be a mad rush to launder money through this device before we comply with the terms of that convention.  Is the Minister not concerned about this matter?  If not, I suggest the whole matter is a dreadful waste of time and the Government's handling of it has brought politics and legislation into further disrepute.</P>
    <P>If the amnesty is not used by those whom the Government believes will bring the hot money home, what is the point of it?  This will have been an empty debate, there will be no money and the Government will end up with egg on its face.  I believe the amnesty may not be used because anyone who went to the trouble of salting money abroad or opening a dozen or so non-resident bank accounts will be very slow to declare that money, given the efforts to ensure compliance by the Revenue Commissioners in recent years.  Once this money is declared, the people involved will be at the butt of scrutiny by the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="1498" /> for the rest of their days of involvement in economic activity.  They may experience a short windfall by bringing the money home at 15 per cent but they would be very foolish to expose themselves to the scrutiny of the Revenue Commissioners who will be on their tail for days, weeks and years to come.</P>
    <P>The original proposal has resulted in a loss of moral authority, particularly among taxpayers who do their best to meet the terms of the legislation.  I can see this debate going nowhere, resulting in no money and a total loss of face. Fianna Fáil and Labour will get their answer next time round in the polling booths.  I am not sure how well this proposal was thought out, but I am sure the regulation for the money laundering convention will not be introduced in this House until this whole matter of the amnesty is out of the way.</P>
    <P>As regards the ethics in Government Bill, I doubt if even this Government would have the neck to debate ethics in Government in this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring in so far as I can to the issue.  How does this amnesty square with the whole concept of ethics in Government?  A Deputy who was appointed Minister on day one came into this House and implied that the rest of us who had been here for a longer period are getting fat on the profit from politics and that we are acting a little like the Marcos regime, salting all our money away somewhere &mdash; where I am not sure. We had to listen to that from a new Deputy in this House, the same Deputy who will vote for this amnesty proposal and lay this legislation alongside the ethics in Government legislation.  That <Col N="1499" /> makes this Government the laughing stock of the country.  So much for ethics in Government and high standards in high places.</P>
      <P>I will not refer to election platitudes because that matter has been well thrashed out, but what about the new Electoral Bill that will require declaration of contributions to political parties? That Bill is almost ready for publication by the Minister for the Environment. If there is unanimity among the Cabinet on this amnesty proposal there must be interest in a particular quarter in getting this hot money home.  I question whether certain parties in Government will benefit from jackbooting this legislation through these Houses.  Benefit will accrue to one or other of the Government parties &mdash; I suspect one of them &mdash; before the introduction of the Electoral Bill. That legislation will not be introduced until the amnesty is terminated because it would be embarrassing if certain members of this Government were rewarded and compensated by their pals for looking after them so benignly and kindly in relation to this amnesty.  Effectively, the amnesty proposals puts on the backburner the legislation in relation to our international obligations on the money laundering convention, the ethics in Government Bill and the electoral Bill dealing with contributions to political parties.  I suggest that the proposal for an amnesty on the terms offered could not square with those Bills.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy O'Malley about the State losing all moral authority. There will not be a huge inflow of money because the people concerned have enough ingenuity to work out that it will not be in their long time interest to expose their hand at this stage, but as contributors have pointed out any inflow of money to this country will not increase economic activity.  That lame justification does not stand up to any scrutiny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My only surprise in relation to this proposal is that the Labour Party is apparently supporting it wholeheartedly. I invite the electorate to analyse what <Col N="1500" /> that tells us about the Labour Party's commitment to integrity and standards in high places.  I am not surprised that Fianna Fáil in Government, or that a Fianna Fáil Taoiseach or that Deputy Albert Reynolds fully supports this proposal, nor are the vast majority of the thinking electorate, the electorate which actually cares about our Republic, our democracy, moral authority and about tax compliance.  This proposal institutionalises the culture of &ldquo;the fixer&rdquo;.  The culture of &ldquo;the fixer&rdquo; has been synonymous with Fianna Fáil for a long time. It institutionalises the culture of &ldquo;the fixer&rdquo; and the culture of the &ldquo;Cute Hoor&rdquo;.  Again, Fianna Fáil is identified very accurately by that description.  It formalises effectively the culture of Fianna Fáil in our society.  This amensty, and the terms of the proposal, is a prizegiving day for law-breakers.</P>

We are all sinners, apparently, except Deputy Kemmy who travels by train, who runs his election for £4,000 and to whom nobody wrote about the tax amnesty.  I am becoming sick and tired of the insufferable arrogance of Deputy Kemmy, who delivers to us regularly sermons from the chair of the parliamentary Labour Party every time there is a controversy facing the Government.  On this occasion he has come in to try to dress up an excuse for what is an essentially crude Fianna Fáil stroke.  I do not know whether my emotion should be one of anger or one of sadness, but the substance of the argument he gave us is a load of nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>His argument is that this tax amnesty will in some way provide a windfall for the health and the education services and that we will all benefit as a result.  The <Col N="1501" /> health and the education services here are in such a sorry state precisely because the people who are going to benefit from this tax amnesty salted away their money over the past decade or more and did not pay their fair share of tax to this country to help provide services.</P>
    <P>The argument has been advanced that these latter-day prodigal patriots will return and invest in job creation and so on.  The people who will bring home their money as a result of this tax amnesty want to do so and will have decided that it is more beneficial to them to bring their money back.  The people who have been lobbying for this amnesty, those for whom some Government backbenchers have been articulating the case over the past year or more, are unlikely to have suffered some kind of Pauline conversion in relation to their responsibilities to their fellow citizens or to invest their money in a way that will benefit the people.  They are much more likely to invest it in some speculative property purchase or whatever that is likely to benefit them at home.</P>
    <P>I was involved in organising the largest public demonstration this country ever saw about 13 years ago when the PAYE taxpayers took to the streets because of their discontent over the tax system.  That discontent was not because of an unwillingness to pay tax or anything of that kind.  It was because there were people who were not paying their fair share of tax and there was widespread tax evasion. Those of us who argued, for example, that there was widespread evasion and avoidance of tax were told repeatedly that there was no crock of gold, that there was no substantial sum of uncollected or evaded tax.  The last amnesty proved how wrong that was when it raised £500 million.  We were also told that there was no large scale evasion. Yes, there were people fiddling the dole, but we were told that people who drove big cars, lived in big houses and had big bank accounts would not do something as unpatriotic as evade taxes.  Now we are being told that there is anything between £1 billion and £2 billion of <Col N="1502" /> money salted away abroad in order to avoid paying taxes.</P>
    <P>The impression is being created that the salting away of that money was some kind of neutral act, that the money was simply sent abroad to wait for some more favourable time when it could be brought back home and put to work to the greater benefit and glory of the country.  That is far from the reality.  The reality is that those who salted away their money abroad, who evaded their taxes and who are now standing to benefit from this tax amnesty have betrayed the people of this country.  They have betrayed not only the PAYE taxpayer who had to bear virtually single-handedly the burden of paying the cost of runing this country over the past decade or more, but they have also betrayed the victims of tax evasion and tax cheating.</P>
    <P>Tax cheating is a crime that has victims. Tax cheaters are the very people we now hear are going to benefit from the tax amnesty.  The victims of tax cheating are the 30,000 people and their families who are on housing waiting lists because the house building programme was effectively suspended in 1987 due to financial stringencies and the need to reduce public expenditure and so on which was argued for at that time.  The victims are those who have had to wait for up to two years on a hospital waiting list for an operation because we were told there was not enough money to put into the health services.  Unfortunately &mdash; this is something that is not often acknowledged &mdash; some of those on long waiting lists never had their operations because they were dead before their turn came around.</P>
    <P>The victims also are those young emigrants who are now working in bars and on building sites in New York, London and Munich.  They were unable to either get an education or a job here because the finances were not available to put into those sectors.  The victims are also, incidentially, the employees of Aer Lingus who this morning are protesting outside Dublin Airport because they are worried about their jobs.  They are victims in two ways.  They were among the PAYE taxpayers who paid the high rates <Col N="1503" /> of tax while the tax cheats were benefiting from their gains as a result of salting away their money, and they are victims now because the equity was not available to put into Aer Lingus over the years resulting in the current problems of the company.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Kemmy said, tax cheating and tax evasion is not something over which we should bury our heads in the sand and forget about.  We need to address them but there are ways to do so.  The Revenue Commissioners, their staff and the trade unions who represent them have argued over the years for the resources and the powers to go after tax evaders.  Why is it that a task force cannot be established with powers to look at bank accounts and investigate the extent of tax evasion, to go after not only those who may decide voluntarily now to bring home their money but also those who will not?  I expect that some people, particularly those who have argued for this tax evasion, believe that somehow that would be an invasion of privacy.  Have they not heard of the type of invasion of privacy that somebody on the lowest rung of the social ladder here must face when they apply for a means-tested social welfare benefit or payment, when they have to be subjected to the most humiliating investigation not only of their financial affairs but, in some cases, their personal lives? It appears invasion of privacy is all right for the poor but is not all right in the case of somebody who decides to take money abroad in order to evade paying their fair share for the general upkeep of this country.</P>
    <P>It saddens me greatly that the two parties in Government, who would be the first to claim the high ground of patriotism, are now putting through a proposal which is clearly unpatriotic which will validate and benefit those who have done the most unpatriotic thing that one could do over the past ten to 20 years, which is to shirk their responsibilities to help pay for the cost of running the country and provide for the people.</P>

      <P>(<i>Carlow-Kilkenny</i>): I join <Col N="1504" /> in the objections to this proposed amnesty for tax evaders.  I do not wish to delay the House by repeating many of the comments already made.</P>
      <P>I was present last evening when a person I regard as the &ldquo;Stonewall Jackson&rdquo; of the Labour Party, Deputy Ferris, came in to bat and defend the hospital charges in the usual blustering fashion, to tell us exactly what we should be doing about this proposed amnesty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Carlow-Kilkenny</i>): I heard Deputy Kemmy talk about tax evasion being endemic here.  I would have thought that if anything would get Deputy Kemmy's blood to boil, it would have been the fact that evasion was endemic and that he would be falling down the steps in order to get at tax evaders.  It is an amazing turnabout that the Labour Party seems to defend tax evasion at present.  I turned on the radio by chance this morning and heard a banker say on the &ldquo;Gay Byrne Show&rdquo; that reaction to the proposed amnesty was a form of begrudgery.  He omitted to say legitimate begrudgery on the part of taxpayers.  Why should a person who pays tax not object to somebody else who has large sums of money put away and who has got away with paying no tax?  If that participant this morning on the radio was not a banker I apologise to the other sensible bankers here.  I am told he was a banker.  Therefore, I do not have to apologise because, obviously, he spoke on behalf of cothrom na Féinne, a phrase very acceptable to Irish people.  It means that everybody gets fair play, which is what is involved in this objection to people who could afford to pay tax and did not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It pains me to hear people support this proposed amnesty, saying that we could use the money for hospital services, schools and so on.  If the remainder of us had not been paying our taxes over the years, the country and its services would have come to a halt while those people with plenty of money enjoyed the facilities <Col N="1505" /> we provided by paying our taxes. Rather than be rewarded those people should be jailed when they return with their money.  Yet they are being held up to us as heroes who will rescue this country although they avoided paying their share of taxation over the years.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> They may indeed.  The fact that we have been criticised by others for objecting to this implies that we did not pay our taxes willingly.  I must admit that since 1957 I paid tax most unwillingly because in those years I appeared to be one of the few teachers paying tax.  However, gradually more and more were brought into the net.  I must also admit that I never went to the dentist nor underwent an operation willingly.  Nonetheless I had no objection to paying my fair share of tax like everybody else.  I do not want to hear people who shirked their duty, disappeared with their money, now crib that objection on my part is a form of begrudgery or small mindedness.</P>
      <P>If the money is repatriated and is put to good use some people will say: were we not marvellous to have got it back?  I will feel very annoyed regardless of how the money is expended because the people who avoided paying taxes had no qualms about using the services provided from our taxes while they did not pay any.</P>
      <P>I object to this proposed amnesty for those who did not pull their weight here but took the soft option.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be very difficult for the Minister to listen to us highlighting the sense of outrage that undoubtedly the Minister knows is felt by the people.  I was amazed to hear Deputy Kemmy say he had not received as much as a telephone call or letter about this proposed amnesty.  I wonder whether he lives in the same country &mdash; I know he lives in a different part of the country &mdash; but I can assure him that, in Dublin the dogs in <Col N="1506" /> the street are talking about this amnesty; everybody is outraged about it.  It is amazing that Deputy Kemmy should be willing to live off the immoral earnings of others and to allow our economy to be run on the immoral earnings of others.</P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;outrage&rdquo; has been used if not over-used in relation to the tax amnesty proposals.  On the one hand, we are told about the compliant taxpayer and how outraged are the PAYE sector, those who have no option but to pay their taxes on time which, in turn, provide the services so badly needed.  On the other hand, I have heard a great sense of outrage on the part of the business community &mdash; not people who have any desire to be within any golden circles &mdash; at the assumption that, if one is in business one must be a member of some golden circle. Ordinary decent business people find there is a parallel being drawn between this proposed amnesty and that of 1988. Indeed, Deputy Power drew such a parallel in this Chamber only yesterday.  It is untrue and unfair to castigate those who availed of that amnesty in the same way as those who may avail of this proposed amnesty deserve to be castigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1988 we were in the teeth of a filthy recession.  Many genuine business people were put to the pin of their collar to survive, tried to trade their way out of a recession and just about keep ahead of the posse.  These ordinary decent people did not want any trouble with the Revenue Commissioners, they wanted to pay their taxes but, because they had allowed themselves to fall behind, found they had to pay very punitive penalties in addition to their lawful taxes.  Many people had to borrow money to avail of the amnesty at that time.  The Revenue Commissioners knew who those people were; these were not faceless people about whom we knew nothing.  They were on the books, and they wanted to go legitimate.  Those people were not salting their money overseas. They were a genuine component of our economy, were contributing to it and were providing employment here.  They were not cheats who were sending their money overseas.  The money does not come from ordinary decent business <Col N="1507" /> people.  Rather it comes from people who are prepared to cheat other Irish taxpayers and business people.  I share the sense of outrage felt by the business community about this amnesty.  To whom is it being offered?  Who are the people who are to be seized by a massive dose of patriotism and come home?  I find it hard to believe that people who, for a number of years, have been cheating the system will be compliant, come home and give 15 per cent of their ill-gotten gains to the State.</P>
    <P>A number of figures have been bandied about.  For instance, the figures of £1 billion and £2 billion have been mentioned. We all know that it is nonsense to suggest that this money is ready to be collected.  These figures were plucked out of the air.  The money will not help to solve our interest rate problem.  It has nothing to do with it.  It would not be used to provide the services that Deputy Kemmy spoke about.  It should not be used to fund once-off projects.  If anything it should be used to reduce our national debt and interest repayments.</P>
    <P>It is beyond belief that people, who by their very nature are unpatriotic, will repatriate this money.  Who are these people and why are they being enticed back?  Deputy Doyle offered one answer to that question and I am tempted to believe the suggestion she made.</P>
    <P>I have often made the remark that the people who are held in low regard, because of recent scandals, are politicians and business people.  As someone who comes from a business background, that hurts.  If I said I was a businesswoman, people would say I was a tax dodger.</P>

      <P>The reason so few Members are present is obvious.  The Minister himself does not want to be here.  I do not envy him the task he has been given of having to defend this amnesty.  Everyone knows it is not his idea.  The Taoiseach had a rush of blood to the head.  I do not see how the Minister can defend it; I would go so far as to say that he should resign rather than take it on board. Everybody knows that this is a ridiculous notion that should never have been put forward.  It is outrageous to suggest that we should entice tax cheats home and ask them for a paltry 15 per cent of the tax due on their ill-gotten gains.  I know the Minister is an honourable man and would not live off their immoral earnings.  He is realistic and does not think that this is a valid proposal.  It has been put forward by the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>I am delighted that Deputy Cox has managed to get around all the obstacles to discussing this tax amnesty.  It is appropriate that it is the first matter to be discussed in the debate on the Finance Bill.  A sense of outrage is felt by people, perhaps not in Limerick but certainly in Dublin and the rest of the country.  Perhaps the people know that the Labour Party will not listen to their complaints about this amnesty.  It is not listening because it knows that the people are right and because of this it is not open to communication about this tax amnesty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cox has taken the right action and his amendment gives us the opportunity to voice the concerns of people.  If Deputy Kemmy thinks that people have nothing to say about this amnesty all he has to do is answer the telephone.  He <Col N="1509" /> will find out that they do.  If the Minister cannot dump it, he should change it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sympathetic to the Minister who, almost in isolation, has to listen to the representations inspired by people who have telephoned Members on this side of the House.  It is obvious they do not telephone Members on the opposite side.  The Minister must be annoyed.  He must feel that the partnership Government is slightly one-sided in the sense that he and his colleague are the only Members on the Government benches.</P>
      <P>A number of speakers have questioned the morality of this proposal.  The people who are about to benefit from this amnesty are a powerful lobby.  They are more powerful than the PAYE sector, small firms, the self-employed, old age pensioners and all those in need of community care and assistance through the health boards.  Figures have been trotted out to market the proposal.  At a time when so much emphasis is being placed on ethics in Government why should such a proposal be made?  How does it stand with the proposal to introduce legislation dealing with ethics in Government?  Is it ethical, for instance, that those who, for one reason or another, decided to siphon their ill-gotten gains out of the country, not by legal means, should be extended a warm welcome and the hand of friendship on their return and given a special concession which has not been offered to anybody else?  Why is the same concession not made available to people with small businesses or to the PAYE sector for even one year?  What have this group done right that entitles them to benefit while all others do not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it very difficult to understand how either party in this partnership or Coalition Government &mdash; whichever name one wishes to call it; it depends on who happens to be describing it &mdash; has not had objections from constituents. The vast majority of people are asking the very salient question of why they should have to abide by the rules and regulations if a group which has circumvented the regulations can benefit. <Col N="1510" /> There is no incentive for people to proceed through the normal channels in future.  Is this not encouragement also for people in the know or who have means to siphon money out of the country and locate it in bank accounts elsewhere?  Is it not an incentive for them to continue to do so or to encourage others to do so? Is it not an incentive for people with access to funds to take their money out of the country happy in the knowledge that in three, four or five years time they will benefit from another amnesty?  Why should they go through the normal channels when that option is available to them?  That is the message that is coming across.  Once that message gets to the community, public confidence in the institutions of State will breakdown, in fact that is happening.</P>
    <P>Some Members said they had no telephone calls on this issue from constituents. I respectfully suggest that the reason no one has called is that people are now scared to use the telephones because of the increase in charges the Government has imposed.  The people are furious that there is no benefit in making phone calls to members of either party in the partnership Government. They know the Government has such a majority at present that it is capable of forcing any legislation through this House at any time.  In fact 36 Members from either of the two parties can stay at home any week or month or year and the Government can win every vote called here.  The general public know that making telephone calls to members of either party in Government will be of little benefit.  I respectfully suggest that Members should not place too much credence in the fact that they have not been receiving a continuous stream of phone calls because that is the reason.</P>
    <P>The small business sector also think badly of this amnesty.  When speaking on another issue in this House last week I said that people with small businesses see themselves as being the most vulnerable in the business sector simply because they are so small as not to be able to take on board the consultants and other administrative assistance that big <Col N="1511" /> business is able to pay for and is forced to pay for in any event.  At the end of the line, they have to employ accountants and others which puts a huge administrative expense on them.  If they do not employ these people, and many do not because of the cost, they receive letters from the sheriff because of their difficulties with meeting deadlines.</P>
    <P>This week I spoke to people who received letters from sheriffs requesting payment of a certain sum of money. When the sheriff comes to collect there is also a penalty by virtue of the late payment.  Those people read of the proposal from Government &mdash; to which I referred &mdash; to make a special sweetheart deal with a group who have not abided by the rules or regulations.  Those people seem to think it is their preserve to do that as often as they wish.  Yet the person with a small business has to face the music and is expected to toe the line every time. Surely there must be somebody in the Government parties who is prepared to speak for those people.  Likewise, for the elderly who are in receipt of pensions and so on and the general taxpayers who are, this year, penalised further by the 1 per cent levy.</P>
    <P>Many reasons were trotted out as to why the 1 per cent levy should be paid but, of course, the main reason is that the Government needs to get more money.  The odd thing is that at the time the general public, the PAYE sector and the self-employed, big and small businesses everywhere are being penalised by an extra 1 per cent levy, the Government decides to offer a concession to our tax exiles if they haul home their ill gotten gains.  We should remember that if they were able to move money from the country once there is no reason they would not be prepared or capable of moving the money out again.</P>
    <P>Where is the Government's sense of fair play?  The Government was supposed to be so open to suggestions, to be righteous and so open to fair play.  We heard much about this earlier in the year.  It must be possible for the Tánaiste and he Taoiseach to hold discussions so that <Col N="1512" /> even at this late stage, some modicum of fair play might be introduced into the system and stop this proposal.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Government is aware that we, on this side of the House, are most concerned lest they damage their credibility even more.  However, this will damage also the credibility of the institutions of the State, particularly those responsible for running the country and ensuring that taxes are collected within a specified and reasonable period.  How does the Government expect those institutions to carry on in future?  How does it expect them to operate if they have to give their imprimatur to a proposal which has been hatched and thatched on the far side of the House over the past month to six weeks?  I am amazed that a certain group of people, who must be influential, have been able to get a proposal through Cabinet when more deserving groups have failed.</P>
    <P>What about the people who feel aggrieved at the additional hospital service charges and so on?  Obviously they are not part of the same lobby because if they were there would have been some concession from the Government.  We heard much about the &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; social welfare cuts that were to be repealed last year and various attempts have been made to manicure and patch them up in the recent past.</P>
    <P>It was suggested by some people that as these were readily identifiable, repealing them would be an attainable goal within a specified period.  How is it that nothing could be done in that regard in the Finance Bill?</P>
    <P>What are the reasons for this proposal and why is it being introduced?  One of my colleagues suggested that small benefits are promised &mdash; I do not know for what purpose or to what organisations &mdash; and that may be true; it is a possibility. For example, there are worthy causes to which a proposal of this nature can be attached for marketing purposes.  Of course, we can say it could be used to defray hospital or other health charges or to supplement employment proposals and so on, all of which are very worthy. It could be used to increase social welfare <Col N="1513" /> payments to old age pensioners, the long term unemployed and so on but, of course, these have only been spoken about vaguely and the reason for that is because they are vague.  There is no proposal to put the money to any particular use because nobody can readily determine how much is involved.</P>
    <P>The Government parties can talk as long as they like, putting forward many reasons to justify their actions, but in the final analysis, whether they receive telephone calls and letters or not, there is a large group in society watching balefully. When the time is right they will extract their revenge on the Government if they proceed with this proposal.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Much reference was made earlier to the role of the Labour Party in this matter.  I was very disappointed with the intervention of Deputy Kemmy.  By way of innuendo, he changed the tone of the debate.  Somebody suggested we should keep it clean.  Deputy Kemmy himself began by saying that.  He then went on to talk about people fiddling their expenses, events in another party many years ago <Col N="1514" /> and so on.  That shows that Deputy Kemmy is somewhat touchy.  When this Government took office a few months ago Deputy Kemmy, almost before the ink was dry on the Government agreement, was out like a shot sending messages and instructing the Cabinet what they were to do if they were to get the support of the Labour Party.  I do not know if it was because he was confused with Deputy Michael McDowell in his role in the Progressive Democrat Party in recent years that he suddenly retreated. Not only is he not sending messages as to what they should do to be compliant, to use the tax jargon, with the Labour Party philosophy but he seems to have capitulated totally.  I have never seen anything like the transformation I have seen in Deputy Kemmy in recent times.  I know why he is not getting any phone calls or any letters and if I were him I would be worried about that.  Sometimes as politicians we exaggerate the amount of public opposition to something.  If we get three of our letters that is often considered a fairly good indicator that there is a lot of concern.  I can tell Deputy Kemmy &mdash; and I do not think I am too bad a political judge &mdash; I have never come across such opposition to any measure as I have encountered in relation to this amnesty.  The opposition is not just from PAYE workers or social welfare recipients but from some of the most powerful business people.  At the weekend I spoke with some bankers, people who are very practical and very realistic &mdash; if there is ever a way of raising money they are the first to suggest it &mdash; and they were outraged at this proposal.  They told me how impractical it was.  We will all have egg on our faces because we will have an amnesty that will not work because people will not avail of it, for a whole host of reasons.</P>
    <P>I can do no better, in relation to this amnesty and my view on it, than to quote Barry Desmond, MEP.  He was the Labour Party spokesperson on Finance in 1988 when we introduced the last amnesty.  This was an amnesty whereby people would have to pay their full taxes; all they were allowed to forego was <Col N="1515" /> interest and the possibility of being prosecuted. This is what the former Deputy Desmond had to say in the Official Report of Wednesday, 20 April 1988, columns 1495 to 1497:</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to the so-called major incentive provided by the budgetary tax amnesty.  I am opposed to the relevant section of the Bill.  In respect of those who pay their taxes on time, who have consistently paid their due and lawful taxes, indeed those who for one reason or another have not paid their taxes, who have been rightly caught for the payment of interest, caught by sheriff seizures &mdash; whatever transient sympathy we may have of them &mdash; who have been caught because they have not paid their taxes, who have been legitimately brought before the sheriff, the courts, caught for late payment of taxes, it is outrageous that overnight the Government should decide to issue a universal, general, amnesty of an extraordinary kind.</P>
    <P>He goes on to say:</P>
    <P>That is an extraordinary Government decision which is totally unacceptable on grounds of fundamental equity.  In other words, those who have failed to pay their taxes, deliberately in many cases delayed paying them, who have an income which they deliberately concealed from the Revenue Commissioners, are now given an open-ended amnesty of extraordinary generosity.</P>
    <P>... this handout to people who basically have not paid their taxes and who have undisclosed resources must certainly make tens of thousands of taxpayers feel irate...</P>
    <P>... it is fundamentally wrong because in three years time people will be baying for another tax amnesty and perhaps a future Minister for Finance will reintroduce it.  Once you go down that road, it is hard to stop in terms of administering an effective system ...</P>
    <P>the subsequent Committee Stage of <Col N="1516" /> the Finance Bill the Labour Party put down an amendment to oppose that amnesty.  However, section 72 of that Bill was never reached and it was never put to the House.</P>
    <P>I find the comments of Deputy Kemmy this morning totally hypocritical.  He used the word &ldquo;hypocrisy&rdquo; and I do not like to accuse people of hypocrisy.  When the general election was over I was one of the first people to predict that it would be a Labour/Fianna Fáil Government.  It was obvious.  One only had to look at the body language of the Labour Party.  I read in my newspaper last Saturday that apparently there was a show of hands in the Berkeley Court Hotel by ten of Mr. Spring's male advisers.  They were split five all and he had to make up his mind whether to go with Fianna Fáil or with the Rainbow.  Once the Labour Party went into the Government I could predict that, come hell or high water, they would be there for the four or four-and-a-half years.  Let nobody be foolish enough to think that the Labour Party will pull out of Government.  They will keep their heads down when it suits, as on this issue. They will keep their mouths shut and throw abuse at the Opposition.  They will question people's motives but they will stay in Government because when they got their hands on power they are the last people to give it up.  We only have to look at the appointment of programme managers and advisers in the first four months to see that.  I understand, if newspaper reports are correct, that one of the strongest advocates of this amnesty is the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor.  I find it extraordinary that the Minister, who represents the most marginalised constituency in our community, should be one of the people to push this at Cabinet level.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach is so Rambo-like that he can get his way regardless.  I would assume he decided the amnesty was a good idea and, without any consideration, made it be known in the media that he was for it.  He probably felt then he had no alternative but to push it through.  I predict that if there is substantial opposition within the Government <Col N="1517" /> to this measure, if there is a breakdown of the consensus that is normally necessary for Government to function &mdash; and I saw the breakdown of that consensus and cohesion in the last Government &mdash; that is the beginning of the end of the cohesion and consensus needed for effective Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cox's amendment is seeking a tax system that does not discriminate against particular classes and types of compliant taxpayers.  If this were an amnesty whereby those retiring at the age of 55 would only have to pay 15 per cent on their pensionable income, I would support it.  I would see it as a good idea to encourage people to leave jobs, thus providing them for other people and allowing greater mobility, particularly in the public service.  This amnesty is designed to look after those who do not give a damn about this country and who have hoarded their money away.  Some are concerned because they cannot bring it back to spend it.  They are trapped. They bought their houses in the south of Spain or their apartments in Portugal. They pay for their holidays from their foreign bank accounts and so on.  After that they are restricted because, thankfully, we have very efficient Revenue Commissioners.  The Revenue sheriffs, in particular, have been extremely effective in getting money in.  It is about time that we had an effective way of collecting tax. For too long many people did not pay their fair share.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that the Minister has taken up 13 pages of this Finance Bill, sections 25 to 27, to lay down a whole host of conditions in relation to his investment incentive schemes for people in business, yet when it comes to the amnesty there are to be no conditions at all.  My colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, referred to it as the 50-50 cash back. As a spokesperson with responsibility for justice, it worries me that there is a possibility that this country could be used to launder the proceeds of crime, committed not just in other jurisdictions but in this jurisdiction.  It is a fact that crime pays.  The assets of criminals are not seized.  Many of them may have their <Col N="1518" /> accounts overseas, particularly drug pushers and those involved in racketeering and so on.  Are they now to be allowed to bring that money back, to be free from any prosecution and to have to pay only 15 per cent on it?  I find that an appalling suggestion.  Would it be possible, for example, that the mafiosi referred to yesterday could bring in their money from Italy and Sicily, launder it through persons domiciled in the Republic and then take it back and spend it as they wish?</P>
    <P>I would like to hear the Minister say that those people who avail of the amnesty will have to show that they earned this money by legitimate means. There is a lot of organised crime in this city.  It is not an offence to pay protection money.  People have paid protection money because their business might be burnt down or they might be kneecapped. I am appalled to think that money could now be brought in here and all that would have to be paid would be 15 per cent.</P>
    <P>Many people have said that if we can get money let us get it at any cost.  I do not subscribe to that view.  That is akin to saying we should get the IRA to rob as many banks in the USA as they can and we will allow them to bring the money in here and pay only a small amount of tax on it.  It would be extremely dangerous to go down that road.  It would jeopardise our tax system and further alienate many people.  It would bring the country into disrepute internationally.  We all know how disturbing are the host of business scandals, the perception that there is a golden circle and that business is not straight in this country.  We know how much attention it gets in foreign newspapers, particularly in papers like the <i>Financial Times.</i>  It is extremely damaging to the reputation of Ireland.  Rather than trying to change that, we are aiding it and abetting it by suggesting an amnesty of this kind.</P>
    <P>I have often dealt with people in my own constituency, social welfare recipients who begin working one, two or three days a week as handymen, carpenters, or plumbers.  They suddenly have enough <Col N="1519" /> work and would like to be honourable and declare themselves, and maybe pay back any illegitimate social welfare money on a phased basis, but they will not do so because they are afraid of being persecuted by the social welfare fraud squad.  We have made great strides in the area of social welfare fraud.  The Minister for Social Welfare brought in a number of measures a few years ago which I welcomed.</P>
    <P>There has never been a suggestion that we should have an amnesty for people at that end of the scale who have defrauded the Department of Social Welfare of small amounts of money and who want to get out of the black economy and become legitimate.  I do not think we have even explored it.  Why not?  It is because these people are not influential and have no clout.  They would not be able to have a word in the Taoiseach's ear because he would probably never meet them and if he did he probably would not understand them.  That is why I find this whole idea so appalling.</P>
    <P>In our society there are many who believe that a two-tier system operates, whether it is before the courts, under the taxation code, or in business.  There is one law for a small golden circle of people and another for the rest of the community. If some people can afford the expertise to fight their case, these can get a just reward.  To a large extent justice depends on the amount of money one can put up to get it.  The perception is that this is an unfair society.  I know it because I hear it from so many of my constituents.  If somebody in my constituency steals ten jumpers from Dunnes Stores, there is every chance they will be prosecuted and brought before the courts.</P>
    <P>Recently we saw the Stokes, Kennedy, Crowley report on white collar fraud. Forty per cent of companies experience white collar fraud.  Two per cent of the fraud is in relation to sums of over £1 million, and yet prosecutions have been taken in only 28 per cent of cases and there is a much lower level of successful convictions.  Are we saying to those white <Col N="1520" /> collar criminals who may have taken £1 million plus from their company, who have put it in a foreign bank account in the Isle of Man, Jersey, Cyprus or whatever, that they can bring that money back and when they pay the Government 15 per cent they will be totally free of any prosecution?  I find the idea absolutely revolting, as do so many people.</P>
    <P>We have a tax system that requires the single person on two-thirds of the average industrial wage to pay the top rate of tax at 48 per cent.  We are now going to give an amnesty to people who have millions. My prediction is that the only people who might bring back money are those who may have £50,000 to £80,000 and they will use it to buy a house or to give to their children.  The guys with the big bucks who are involved in particular sectors of activity in this economy are not going to bring their money back, but they are worried about how they can get their hands on it to spend because they know now how effective the Revenue sheriffs are.  If we still had inefficiency in revenue collection they would not have to worry about getting an amnesty because they would be well able to bring in sufficient quantities of money and nobody would ask any questions.</P>
    <P>I have always had a lot of time for our public service.  We have a very loyal and honourable public service and that is a good thing.  It is particularly good at maintaining stability even when Governments change.  The system does them a grave injustice because it does not encourage hard-working and enthusiastic public servants.  I saw that clearly when I was at the Department of the Environment. The system is suited to mediocrity and that is a pity, but it is a different issue.  It must be galling for decent, honourable public servants who are PAYE taxpayers to have to sit down and begin to draft offensive legislation of this kind, having sat up burning the midnight oil preparing for the Finance Bill.  It must make them wonder why they should bother.  It must make them question the kind of society, the kind of Government and the kind of system that they so loyally serve.  They are often attacked and that <Col N="1521" /> is regrettable because they cannot answer for themselves.  I can imagine the thoughts that must go through their minds when they have to do tasks of this kind.</P>
    <P>The attitude adopted not just by the Labour Party but by many of the Fianna Fáil Members, although few of them have chosen to speak on this debate, seems to be that if we can get the money in it is a good thing.  They are all presuming we are going to get the money in.  I am no financial genius, and I want to compliment Deputy Cox on framing a very clever amendment to allow us to discuss this matter, but if somebody brings money back into the country under this amnesty, the Revenue Commissiones are going to know that he has this stream of income or certainly had it in the past. Although they may not hound him when the amnesty comes in because 15 per cent only has to be paid, what will happen next year and the year after?  These are not innocent beings who do not know what is going on and do not know how the system works.  These are, in the main, very well placed individuals who have plenty of advice at their disposal.</P>
    <P>If the accountants that I have been talking to and the bankers I met only last Saturday are representative of the professions they come from, then the advice they will be giving their clients with large deposits in overseas accounts is to leave it where it is, that they would be mad to bring it in.  That will leave many of the Labour Party and Fianna Fáil members who seem keen to defend this in a very difficult position.  Will they still justify the legislation?  Will they still say it was a good idea to have brought our tax system into disrepute, to have further alienated decent honourable people who are compliant? Let us be fair and admit that most people try to do their best.  It is one thing to employ an accountant to see how one can minimise what one pays in income tax.  That is very different from putting one's money offshore and avoiding payment of any tax at all or even acknowledging that the money exists in the first place.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1522" /> There are loopholes in the present system.  A new feature seems to be that many single people covenant money to their nieces and nephews and then get their AIM card and take it out of niece Mary's account and use it as their spending money.  I know there is only £6 million in tax foregone.  It is a small amount of money in comparison with other areas.  I am told it is quite common for well-paid single people to enter into covenants of £4,000, £6,000 or £8,000.  The amount of the covenant cannot exceed 15 per cent of their income.  These covenants are intended to benefit their nieces, nephews and friends.  It is in order for people to enter into a covenant with children under 18 other than their own children.  Parents can enter into covenants with their children who are 18 or over.  Well paid single people have decided to go down this road.  Maybe the Minister should examine this area because if a covenant is entered into to help with education and genuine expenses the money should be left in the account.  Nobody seems to check if the money is left in the account or how it can be withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kemmy seems to think that nobody in the Labour Party really cares about this issue that members have not contacted him.  About two weeks ago I was travelling down the country to attend a wedding.  I stopped to get petrol in Newbridge and I bought a copy of the <i>Leinster Leader.</i>  An article on the front page of the paper stated that three officers of the Labour Party, the chairman, secretary, PRO of the Newbridge branch and several other ordinary members had resigned.  The members were quoted in the article as saying that they resigned because they were fed up with the behaviour of the Labour Party in Government.  That was about three or four days before we heard any word of the amnesty.  If the Newbridge branch was fed up with what had happened prior to the amnesty, I am sure there will be many people who will be resigning from the Labour Party when they have time to digest the effect of the amnesty.</P>
    <P>We have had a very long debate on this matter and I do not know when the <Col N="1523" /> Minister intends to speak.  It would seem that the Opposition can continue this debate all day if they choose.  I am not sure that is a good idea because we would like to hear the Minister acknowledge that he might not be enthusiastic about this but is part of a collective Cabinet Government system and he will have to bat with it as best he can.  Members of the House look forward to hearing the Minister.  Perhaps he would indicate when he would like to speak.  People would be prepared not to continue the debate if they thought the Minister was eager to speak and offer his opinion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cox's amendment, contrary to what Deputy Kemmy seemed to think, introduces into the Finance Bill a provision that will ensure there is no discrimination against various classes and kinds of taxpayers and that, in particular, those who do not pay their fair share of tax or do not declare their income are not given what is, in effect, almost the equivalent of a golden handshake.  The Government by introducing this tax amnesty is doing a great disservice to this community, not just to PAYE taxpayers but to business people.  Many business people have told me that when one starts one's own business one quickly comes in contact with officals of the Revenue Commissioners who wish to discover if you have complied with the laws.  Rather than State agencies contacting business people and helping them set up businesses and employ others, State agencies almost hound people out of business before they get off the ground.  Many fine people in business who try hard in difficult circumstances to be good citzens, to be as compliant as possible, who used the amnesty introduced by the 1988 Act to clear up their tax affairs would probably now put amounts of £20,000, £30,000 or £50,000 offshore because in five or six years time there will be another amnesty and they will be able to avail of that.  They will adopt the attitude that they will take the chance, like those people who have £2 billion offshore at present.  They will consider themselves part of a circle of people and will consider <Col N="1524" /> if those people have not been caught they will not be caught either.  If those people have been rewarded they will perhaps be rewarded too.</P>
    <P>The Minister should use his influence to convince the Taoiseach, who seems to be the main author of this unfortunate proposal, to see the error of his ways before it is too late and before this Bill is published next week or two, before the ethics Bill.  Governments can and often do retract decisions they have made. Rather than lose face the Taoiseach would go up in people's estimation if, having examined the proposal more fully and having seen the reaction, he withdrew this proposal.  If we are a democracy and if that means anything, then surely we should have regard to the views of citizens right across the social classes, the different professional groups, the self-employed, PAYE people and so on.  The Taoiseach should rethink and withdraw this crazy proposal before further damage is done to this country's reputation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a key issue.  It is regrettable there is such a short space of time to debate it.  I was not in the House <Col N="1525" /> when Deputy Kemmy said that nobody had contacted him about the matter but it is not my experience that this amnesty is being treated lightly by the public.  Maybe people did not contact Deputy Kemmy because they were so stunned by his approach and thought he had lost his wits totally in regard to the arguments he made.  No sound economic arguments have been presented by the Government to defend or explain the tax amnesty.  The Minister for Finance, in an uncharacteristic way, has maintained the stoney silence.  That, in itself, speaks volumes. The Taoiseach, in his usual insensitive way, could not understand what all the fuss was about and seemed to be puzzled when it was pointed out to him that there was considerable anger in the country and people were very cross at the arrogance and injustice of this proposal.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kemmy put forward the &ldquo;if&rdquo; argument, that &ldquo;if&rdquo; we get this money back it would be beneficial to the economy. There is no evidence that we will get large sums of money back.  The only benefit would be the paltry 15 per cent that would be levied on it.  There is no guarantee that any of the money, not a whit of it, would be invested in any productive purposes.  Depending on the same treacherous people who starved this country of funds in the first instance is a poor way to plan an economic recovery. When we needed money it was invested abroad to make a good profit.  There was no question then of ensuring that people did their bit for Ireland.  While listening to the debate I was reminded of a short story by Frank O'Connor entitled <i>The Cornet Player who Betrayed Ireland&rdquo;.</i> The story we have today could be entitled &ldquo;The Tax Fiddler who Betrayed Ireland&rdquo; because we have been betrayed by those people.  The people who have suffered the effects of cutbacks have been betrayed by those tax fiddlers and we should never forget that.  Emigrants, the true exiles, are abroad trying to make a living with an inadequate education. They experience difficulties because they do not have the resources of family networks and the familiarity of dealing with their own territory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1526" /> In recent times the homeless have been forgotten about.  We had a recent experience in the Eastern Health Board region where strike action was taken because the issue of homelessness had shifted and slipped off the agenda and the necessary resources were simply not there.  The Government, when it finally formed, made commitments to the homeless, the people who literally do not have a roof over their heads, but that commitment has fallen far short of the reality.  The reality is that the people who paid the price were those who found themselves homeless, living in over crowded and substandard conditions, who suffered in all sorts of ways by reason of Government cutbacks over the years, cutbacks which, it was argued, were necessary to prevent taxes increasing further but which were imposed not because of people not paying their taxes but because the fiddlers were able to send their money abroad in suit cases.  The price was paid by the unemployed, those who could not get work here, who were wasting their talents, their potential and their youth because the jobs did not exist to enable them fulfil their rightful potential.</P>
    <P>Entrepreneurs, also, have suffered. Many young or new entrepreneurs do not have large resources behind them but have good ideas and goodwill and want to bring those ideas to fruition.  They have been hampered over the years and unable to create the jobs to provide the kind of social commitment they were willing to make.  That was because they could not comply with the rigid conditions laid down by the banks for borrowing money, and because the whole exercise was too expensive.  We should not forget those people now that those who, it might be said, betrayed them, who betrayed Ireland, are to have presented to them on a plate an amnesty we can ill afford.</P>
    <P>The most likely effect of a tax amnesty of this type is that if money is brought back into the country it will be used for speculation on the property market.  It would be ludicrous to expect that people who invested in order to obtain a good return on their money would somehow change their spots and suddenly put their <Col N="1527" /> money in sound, productive investments. I participated in a television programme the other evening with the Minister for Social Welfare who put forward the notion that somehow this would happen. There is no evidence whatsoever that it would happen.  In fact, all the evidence would indicate that the likely investment would be in the Mespil Estate type deal, the quick buck type investment that we seem to encourage and enable people to avail of so easily.  Those who have taken their money out of the country, who have never invested in Ireland, in the people of Ireland or in the future of Ireland, who have done everything to prevent the kind of investment that is so vital to our future, should not be rewarded as is the intention so far as this amnesty is concerned.</P>
    <P>The argument that an amnesty would reduce taxes is also a nonsense.  The reason the PAYE sector has been effectively screwed over the years &mdash; and the screw has been tightened as time goes on &mdash; is because people like these tax dodgers were not paying their way.  That is why the PAYE sector has been carrying an increasing burden when you take into account both PAYE and PRSI.  It is a massive burden that has been borne by a specific group of people who were trapped in a manner in which the super rich have never been trapped.</P>
    <P>The Joint General President of SIPTU referred to this tax amnesty as a tax break for tax dodgers.  It is adding insult to injury that the amnesty is being proposed at a time when those people who are paying their taxes have had imposed on them an additional 1 per cent so called &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; levy.  The public do not believe it is a temporary measure, they do not believe it is right and they certainly do not believe it is justified when, with the other hand, the Government is presenting a gift to the very wealthy tax dodger.  There is clearly one law for the tax compliant citizen and a more flexible, more lax and more favourable law for the super rich.  The law abiding citizen must pay his or her taxes but the super rich can move their money around in order to avoid paying any tax whatsoever.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1528" /> I wonder if those who voted for the Labour Party in the last election would have done so if they had been told that they were voting for a 1 per cent increase in their income tax and a tax amnesty that will present the rich with an opportunity to benefit enormously from the most preferential tax rate in the system. One must ask, too, whether members of trade unions, the workers who are paying taxes but who also, through their levies, pay for Labour Party candidates at election time &mdash; we know that a considerable amount of money was diverted from the trade unions to Labour Party funds to ensure there were Labor Party Deputies elected &mdash; feel they obtained good value for that investment?</P>
    <P>There was a SIPTU conference recently and so far as I am aware not one Labour Party Deputy was in attendance.</P>

      <P>This amnesty must be set in the larger context of the atmosphere that has built up over a number of years in Ireland.  We have been breathing the scandal ridden air for so long there is a danger that we have become used to it, used to the contamination that still lingers despite the fact that at the last general election people clearly wanted change.  The Labour Party said they would clean up Fianna Fáil.  Many people wanted the system cleaned up, wanted a fresh start but the background of scandals is, unfortunately, a part of what is taking place at the moment, it is meshed in with the compliance that exists in relation to non payment of tax by those who can afford to pay it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had a series of amnesties in the past which enabled the rich to benefit while the PAYE sector, who were never afforded an amnesty, continued to shell out week by week.  I must say this particular tax amnesty has a whole new quality and edge to it that the previous amnesties did not have.  It is wide open and is extraordinary in its beneficence. When one adds this particular amnesty to the general litany of scandals in the <Col N="1529" /> business sector it is helping to create a sense of disillusion, cynicism and frustration among the general public.  If one reflects on the various scandals of the past few years they amount to quite a few including the ICI-AIB scandal in 1985 where there was a collapse and the State had to pick up the tabs to the tune of hundreds of millions of pounds.  We had the Irish Life-Mespil Flats scandal where vulnerable elderly people were put in fear of their life by a consortium of individuals who were given special concessions and arrangements simply because they had money.</P>
    <P>There is also the Irish Permament Building Society scandal, the First National Building Society scandal and Greencore, where senior executives bought out a subsidiary company and then sold it at a hugely inflated price. Again the people on the street who were struggling to survive and to make a go of life were, in effect, being marginalised and abused.  There is a problem relating to insider trading within the Irish Stock Exchange, yet we do not have the mechanisms in place to deal with scams and illegal activities in relation to the stock market.  Even at local authority level, Dublin County Council has become a joke because of the planning scandals. Recent experiences have shown that councillors felt they could somehow operate on the basis of their personal needs and attitudes rather than reflecting any larger social good or any attempt at proper planning.  It was a great credit to the individual people and communities of County Dublin, who exerted such an enormous amount of pressure, that this matter was brought to a head.  The steamroller that has been operating in Dublin County Council for so long is beginning to look rusty and is creaking at the joints.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>The tax amnesty is the most recent in the litany.  Comparison was made with other amnesties, for example, a social welfare amnesty was <Col N="1530" /> introduced some time ago whereby people who were outside the system were able to make reparation.  They were punished in that they had to make up for what they had done.  The idea of making reparation now seems to be lost.  Maybe it is an old-fashioned idea but certainly the super rich are outside that whole concept. If we are going to give the rich a chance to come back into the system, to bring their money back and we will forgive and forget, let us treat everybody in the same way.  Let us show the same generosity to those living on social welfare who because payments are so low and restrictive cannot afford to rear their family and provide for all their needs and therefore have to work in the black economy.  These people feel trapped and are unable to escape the black economy. Will an amnesty be introduced for such individuals who may feel bad about what they are doing but who see no way out of it?</P>
      <P>We should consider putting in place other amnesties if we are going to be so generous.  I wonder whether the country will be able to continue functioning if we adopt the same approach to other groups as we are adopting to the super rich.  In all fairness, the Minister should look at ways to encourage people in the black economy to come back into the system without making reparation or having any penalty imposed on them.  Maybe we should encourage them by providing sweeteners for them as we are providing for the super rich.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners are against this amnesty, as are tax collectors' unions and the main trade union body, but the Government that has the largest majority in the history of the State supports it.  That is an indication of a serious deficiency at the heart of this Government. It is a lack of political vision that has led to this proposal.  I have been only six months in this House and I have had to learn a lot, but the one thing that shocks me is the vacuum which exists at the heart of Government.  It lacks the vision so desperately sought at the last election.  There is no understanding of what it is like to be unemployed, to look <Col N="1531" /> forward with no hope.  Many people hoped that after the general election there might be some change or surge forward, some break with the past so that a fresh start could be made.  However, that has not happened, rather a tax amnesty has been proposed.</P>
    <P>The recent budget was an abject failure in terms of introducing a fairer tax system.  I do not think people expect miracles overnight.  The general public is very sophisticated.  They understand that as a nation we face difficult problems that are to an extent effected by the fact that we have a very young population and a high dependency rate.  People do not expect the Government to work miracles but I do not think they expected it would come forward with a proposal that would benefit the rich and penalise the poor. That in effect has been Government policy since the budget, with the introduction of the dirty dozen cuts and now this proposed tax amnesty.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kemmy said this morning that he did not receive phone calls on this matter.  I do not think that is how a Deputy relates to his or her constituents. The way to relate to constituents is by being with them, listening to and understanding what is said, although not always directly.  There may not be a clear-cut demand to get rid of the tax amnesty; it may relate to people's fears about their children or indeed their elderly parents, how they view the way Irish society has changed.  Many people are fearful of change, which is understandable &mdash; the older you get the more fearful you become.  Genuine disillusionment must be distinguished from natural conservatism that grows with age.  I am not talking about natural conservatism; I am talking about genuine personal fears.</P>
    <P>We live in a society where the basic decent principles are being continually eroded.  That is the nub of this tax amnesty.  It will erode basic human values that people want to see sustained and enriched by Government rather than distorted, eroded and sneered at.  The same attitude is taken to this proposal as that taken by Ms. Hemsley in America, that <Col N="1532" />&ldquo;only little people pay taxes&rdquo;.  However in America, the great land of the free and the home of the brave, that woman is back behind bars.  In Ireland nobody is behind bars for tax evasion.  Little people pay taxes here, that is what the Government is telling the people.  It is not saying that everybody should pay their fair share, make a commitment and understand that we all need each other to make progress which will benefit rich and poor alike.</P>
    <P>This amnesty is separating the rich from the poor.  It will benefit the rich, not the poor.  It is an extension of the cute hoorism, the golden circle, the nods and winks politics with which people have associated Fianna Fáil.  One thing we have learned from this tax amnesty is that this attitude is no longer associated only with Fianna Fáil; it is now associated with the Labour Party.  That party is arguing the case for a tax amnesty that undermines human values.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of my contribution I said that no sound economic arguments have been presented by the Government in relation to this amnesty.  It is interesting that the Deputies who I thought would be in this Chamber arguing the case are cowering in their offices.  There is no press conference, no good news and no occasion to feel good in relation to this matter.  There are no photo opportunities. Why are people cowering away from this Chamber when they should be in here defending the Government and the Minister and arguing the case?  A pathetic excuse was put forward by Deputy Kemmy.  That is an insult to all the good decent people who put their trust in him and in the Labour Party to represent them.  They are being sneared at as the little people.</P>
    <P>Last night I attended a meeting of the urban district council in my area, at which this question of the tax amnesty was raised.  The item on the agenda for discussion was homelessness in the town of Bray where 329 families are homeless or looking for housing.  These people live in substandard inadequate accomodation, with overcrowded conditions, yet the vast majority of them have no chance of getting <Col N="1533" /> a house this year.  The income of most of the people on our housing list is less than £5,000 per year.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

I am delighted that at long last he has responded to the problem by setting up a group to deal with it.  I would make it clear that in this case we are not talking about travellers in the accepted sense but about people who come from permanent <Col N="1534" /> residences, who descend on towns and communities and cause problems, particularly during the summer.

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I made a four-day official visit to Malaysia from 27 to 30 May, on the invitation of the Prime Minister, Dr. Mahathir.  I was accompanied by the Minister for Tourism and Trade <Col N="1535" /> and a delegation that included representatives of 19 Irish companies drawn from the healthcare, education/training, software, engineering, food and aviationrelated sectors.</P>
      <P>The visit was a follow-up to the visit to Ireland last September by the Prime Minister, a number of his Ministers and a trade delegation from Malaysia.</P>
      <P>The most significant events of the visit to Malaysia were: meeting the Prime Minister and a number of his Ministers to discuss issues of mutual concern to our two countries, especially co-operation in the economic and business field: the signing of six memoranda of understanding between Irish companies and their Malaysian counterparts for contracts with a potential value of £40 million to the Irish companies; briefings on Malaysian development plans, in particular on the major project to build a new international airport due for completion in 1997 with an initial capacity of 25 million passengers at a cost of US $650 million for the first phase; addressing some 300 members of the National Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Malaysia on the advantages of investing in Ireland as a base for doing business in Europe; welcoming the lauch of an Irish-Malaysian Business Council; the signing of a Co-operation Agreement between the National Chamber in Malaysia and the Dublin Chamber of Commerce; and meeting members of the Irish community who have been making a greatly appreciated contribution to Malaysian life.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that my visit to Malaysia was successful in meeting its objectives. The contracts being finalised by the Irish companies who participated in the trade delegation and the business development flowing from the visit will lead to the maintenance and creation of much needed jobs in this country.</P>

      <P>I did not expect this type of question to come from Fine Gael for a second time.  I remember a similar question being asked on my return from a visit to the US.  There has been ample evidence since then that the projections made then have been fully complied with. I have no intention of getting into this area.  I regret Deputy Shatter's attitude to a fuller involvement by the Irish business sector in the development of the Malaysian economy, which is the most dynamic economy in the world.  It has averaged 8 per cent growth over the last 30 years.  It has a 30 year plan to average 8 per cent growth between now and 2020.  There is an opportunity here for Ireland to get its share of the increasing business in that region.  I hope Deputy Shatter accepts that.</P>

Is the Taoiseach aware that this question has now allowed him to give details of his visit to Malaysia which he was apparently so distressed that he was unable to give the other evening when he walked out of the press conference?  I have no objection to this visit.  It was a good idea.  I would suggest that rather than this being a single visit by the Taoiseach, we should maintain ongoing contacts with that country having regard to the strength of their economy and the manner in which it is growing.  Could the Taoiseach indicate to the House in the context of the Irish community in Malaysia whom he met other than P.J. Mara&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is typical of the man. It is typical of the Deputy.  It is typical of the attitude of the people sitting on the far bench.  Long may they remain there for the benefit of the Irish community.  I will be glad to circulate to all Deputies in this House a full and detailed memorandum on every aspect of the Malaysian trip.  Deputy Shatter's question shows his lack of knowledge in relation to the institutions in Malaysia.  Deputy Shatter made a jocose remark about the most important institutional organisation in Malaysia which is called Mara.  That is the organisation which drives the development of the economy.  I would not like to think that that type of remark would get back to the people in Malaysia, who deeply appreciate the involvement of Ireland in the development of their economy over the years.  We sent missionaries there 50 and 60 years ago, people like the De La Salle Brothers and Irish nuns, who laid an education base there.  The College of Surgeons have been taking in medical students from there, some of them now prominent surgeons in Malaysia.  We took in students when others were not prepared to do so.</P>
      <P>There is an opportunity for our educational infrastructure to benefit quite significantly from the development of the Malaysian economy.  If I might give the House just one example, the requirement of the Malaysian economy between now and the year 2020 is for 60,000 accountants. Our business institutions, the accountancy profession and the educational infrastructure can benefit enormously, apart from Aer Lingus, who have been doing business with Air Malaysia for quite some time, and Aer Rianta, who are involved in the building of a new airport.  I am confident an Irish company will be joint participants in that project.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The positions in both those countries were discussed.  There is very serious concern felt by the Prime Minister and people of Malaysia at the position obtaining in Bosnia and the lack of progress being made by the international community in endeavouring to find a solution to the enormous problems there.  He informed me that Malaysia stands ready to participate in sending troops there to seal off the border or become participants in whatever the international community decide to do. He shares our concern in that regard.  As the House will know, it is a multi-racial society in Malaysia, comprised of 35 per cent Chinese, 54 per cent Muslim and approximately 11 per cent Indians and others.  They are a very settled society who simply cannot understand and are disappointed and frustrated at the lack of progress being made by the international community on Bosnia.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach say what type of exports we send to Malaysia? In what areas does he envisage the possibility of growth in exports?  Does he foresee a role for other commercial State companies, such as the ESB or Telecom Éireann, expanding into these areas, thereby affording us an opportunity to promote these companies as multinationals in terms of growth and employment opportunities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Barrett in relation to the opportunities that are available, not alone to the private <Col N="1540" /> sector but to the overall semi-State commercial sector.  Quite a number of those companies were represented on the trade delegation which consisted of 19 company representatives.  There are opportunities for the ESB, Aer Rianta and Telecom Éireann since an infrastructure that expects to multiply its GDP eightfold over the next 20 years has an obvious demand for such services.  There are tremendous opportunities in the area of educational and training expertise.  I would agree with some Members who said that we have ignored these types of developing areas for far too long.  We have a good service to sell and a good track record in many other countries that have availed of that service.  One might mention the marketing of dairy products such as Kerrygold butter and so on.</P>

      <P>Yes, and I discovered that they were pleasantly surprised by the election results there.  Their people were involved, side by side with ours, in Cambodia in supervising the recent elections there and were quite pleased with the results.  Those are the types of areas in which we stand and work together internationally with the Malaysians.  A great camaraderie is being built up between our people serving abroad and the Malaysians.</P>

In the interests of the community concerned, would the Minister agree that what is now needed is an approach that brings together the Office of Public Works, Clare County Council and other environmental groups in a serious endeavour to resolve the issues and find a consensus so that those groups do not find themselves in an escalating cycle of legal activity?</P>

      <P>Section 31 (2) of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, provides that I may direct the Authority to allocate broadcasting time for any announcements by or on behalf of any Minister of State in connection with the functions of that Minister of State and the Authority shall comply with the direction.

What steps does he intend to take to prevent a recurrence? While I agree that we should be wary about further legislation and regulations, would the Minister agree that a more subtle approach should have been adopted and that the matter should have been teased out more before it was raised in the public arena?</P>

      <P>I am trying to understand the motivation of those who had difficulty with what I would emphasise were announcements.  It should be remembered that there is a distinction between announcements on public policy and advertisements.  They are handled in a different way in relation to the procedures followed so far as broadcasting is concerned.  Sensibilities were expressed which on examination proved to be resolvable.  While I have said I am happy that on this occasion I did not have to use the powers available under section 31 (2) and the matter was resolved between the Department of Health and RTE, I would not be reluctant, to use such powers in the public interest, in respect of an announcement on public policy by any of my collegues in the Cabinet or by any Minister of State.</P>

    <P>Within the framework of the existing legislation and in accordance with the Programme for a Partnership Government I will be requesting the council to submit a three-year plan for funding of the arts when I have appointed a new council, which I expect to be able to do by September.  Receipt of this plan will enable me to place it in the context of my own overall policy and to comment upon and seek adjustments, where appropriate, so as to ensure that the activities of An Chomhairle Ealaíon form part of an integrated and coherent funding <Col N="1546" /> policy across the arts, culture and heritage areas and maximise the return on the State's investment in these important areas.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister accept, after 42 years of Arts Council activity, that there are still glaring gaps in the provision of arts infrastructure and funding for the arts throughout the country? While I am not permitted to quote, it is stated in the report of the Arts Council published in January 1993 that &mdash; I am paraphrasing &mdash; by contrast to our nearest neighbours in Northern Ireland and Britain the provision of arts buildings in the Republic is poor; that, when looked at in the wider European context, arts buildings provision in the Republic is unacceptable&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I acknowledge the Deputy's interest in this matter and would like to take this opportunity to thank those Deputies who have spoken about the arts, made positive proposals and expressed encouraging views in the House.  While I do not intend to delay the House it is specifically stated in the Programme for Government, on page 56, that, in order to ensure the fullest development of our cultural life and to tap the potential that exists in abundance throughout Ireland, the Arts Council will be asked to operate on a co-ordinated three yearly plan for funding of the arts and that as part of that plan there will be a requirement for improved co-ordination between capital expenditure, which includes national lottery funding, and arrangements for the current funding of arts projects.  I agree that there are areas where there is capital underprovision and that it is necessary to look at the areas where there is an absence of infrastructure. I can assure the Deputy that I had these considerations in mind in preparing proposals for the Department of Finance in relation to the future capital needs of the arts.  On the issue of the Arts Council, when I heard it being described it sounded like a confraternity.  While I would like to include everybody, I will appoint the best possible Arts Council. As I have said, the greater ratio will be observed and I will try to ensure that it is the most representative and effective that I can appoint.</P>

      <P>The issue of regional balance in the Arts includes the question of representation as well as other matters. As I strengthen the infrastructure of the Arts in the capital &mdash; later questions also deal with this &mdash; I will at the same time be filling the gaps that exist in the regions, for example in the Deputy's own <Col N="1548" /> city I am very anxious to see the further development of classical music because Cork has a fine tradition in that field.  I will seek to achieve a regional balance not only on the question of representation but on capital allocation.</P>

    <P>Faoi mar a cuireadh in iúl don Teach cheana maidir le scéim na mbóithre aise de chuid mo Roinne-se, is gnách go mbíonn bóthar ag freastal ar dhá theach cónaithe ar a laghad, nó ar dheich líon tí i gcás bóthair phortaigh nó talún, chun deontas a thuilleamh.

Is mé féin a shocraigh go gcaithfí foirmeacha a líonadh agus tá na foirmeacha sin le fáil san oifig in mBaile Átha Cliath agus sna hoifigí sa Ghaeltacht. Is éigean na foirmeacha sin a líonadh <Col N="1552" /> isteach agus, ina dhiaidh sin, is ceist é do na hoifigigh sna Gaeltachtaí éagsúla maidir le coinníollacha a chomhlíonadh.</P>

      <P>Faoi Ordú Rialtais den 20 Eanáir 1993 athraíodh ainm Roinn na Gaeltachta go dtí an Roinn Ealaíon, Cultúir agus Gaeltachta.</P>
      <P>Tá an Roinn nua freagrach as:&mdash;polasaí náisiúnta i ndáil leis na healaíona agus leis an gcultúr a cheapadh &mdash; tagann An Chomhairle Ealaíon faoina scáth; leas cultúrtha, sóisialach agus eacnamaíoch na Gaeltachta a chur chun cinn agus caomhnú agus leathnú na Gaeilge mar ghnáthurlabhra; an Músaem Náisiúnta, an Leabharlann Náisiúnta, Gailearaí Náisiúnta na hÉireann, an Chartlann Náisiúnta, an Ceoláras Náisiúnta, an Chomhairle Oidhreachta Náisiúnta agus Músaem na Nua-Ealaíne; polasaí náisiúnta i ndáil le cúrsaí craolacháin agus an tionscal closamhairc a cheapadh; agus polasaí náisiúnta i ndáil le Cúrsaí Oidhreachta a cheapadh, ar a n-áirítear Uiscebhealaí Intíre, Páirceanna Náisiúnta agus Fiadhúlra mar aon le Séadchomharthaí Náisiúnta agus Maoine Stairiúla.</P>

      <P>An cheist atá agamsa i ndáiríre ná an bhfuil trí chuid ins an Roinn anois toisc go bhfuil trí chuid sa teideal.  Tá mise buartha faoi seo.  An bhfuil brú á chur ar dhaoine atá fostaithe ag an Roinn, sna Forbacha cuir i gcás, agus a bhíonn ag plé le cúrsaí na Roinne trí Ghaeilge de ghnáth, Béarla a úsáid <Col N="1553" /> toisc go bhfuil téarmaí na Roinne leathnaithe amach chomh mór sin?  Taímid ag plé cúrsaí na Gaeltachta anseo ach níl ach dha cheist ar an leathanach seo i nGaeilge as 13 ar fad &mdash; tá na cinn eile i mBéarla. Measaim féin go bhfuil dímheas as an nGaeilge taobh amuigh den Teach chomh maith.</P>
      <P>Conas atá ag éirí le húsáid na Gaeilge ins an Roinn?  Sin í an cheist bhunúsach. An bhfuil Béarlóirí anois ag plé le cúrsaí na Gaeltachta?  Cén seans atá ag lucht labhartha an Bhéarla Gaeilge a fhoghlaim ins an Roinn agus in áiteanna eile?</P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm a chur in iúl don Teachta go bhfuil úsáid na Gaeilge ag dul i méid.  Mar adúirt an Teachta, tá trí ranna oifigiúla faoi mo chúram &mdash; Ealaíon, Cultúir agus Gaeltacht. Ba mhaith liom úsáid a bhaint as an ócáid seo chun iarraidh ar an lucht poiblíochta an teideal iomlán a thabhairt dom mar cuireann sé as do dhaoine áirithe nuair nach luaitear an Ghaeltacht sa teideal.  Chomh maith leis sin tá cúrsaí oidhreachta agus craolacháin faoi mo chúram.</P>
      <P>Níl brú ar éinne sna Forbacha Béarla a úsáid.  Chomh maith leis sin tá fuinneamh nua sa Roinn toisc go bhfuil lucht na Gaeilge agus lucht na Gaeltachta ag labhairt le daoine sa Roinn atá ar bheagán Gaeilge agus le daoine atá ag iarraidh teacht isteach ar an nGaeilge.  Tá fáilte i measc an phobail roimh an Roinn leathan nua agus tá seans taobh istigh den gcomhthéacs cultúir go mbainfear úsáid as an nGaeilge ar bhealaí nua.  Ní chabhraíonn sé leo siúd atá ag déanamh iarracht maidir leis an teanga easaontas a chothú eatarthu nó a bheith ag iarraidh ormsa freastal orthu ar bhealach an-chúng.</P>

An gciallaíonn sé sin go bhfuil ranganna agus áiseanna leis ar fáil do na daoine atá fostaithe sa Roinn nó sna trí rannóg aige chun níos mó Gaeilge a fhoghlaim?  An féidir le daoine plé a dhéanamh le gach Roinn ansin tré mheán na Gaeilge?  An féidir linn glacadh leis go bhfuil an Ghaeilge mar chuid lárnach de gach rannóg sa Roinn?</P>

Tá daoine eile ann agus taithí speisialta acu ar chúrsaí scannánaíochta.  Tá siadsan úsáideach agus riachtanach domsa.  Tá siad ag freastal ar chúrsaí Gaeilge go deonach agus ag déanamh iarrachta agus is iontach an rud é go bhfuilim in ann a chinntiú nach gearrfar aon choinníoll caolaigeantach orthu.  Feidhmíonn siad mar státseirbhísigh agus ní bheidh mé ag cur brú orthu. Oibreoidh baill na foirne le chéile.  Caithfimid deireadh a chur leis an gcaolaigeantas agus an sean-aimsireachas agus ráflaí nach bhfuil bunús leo agus mar sin de.</P>

Is féidir liom a rá os na céadta litreach atá faighte agam go bhfuil comhluadar na Gaeilge agus comhluadar na Gaeltachta sásta leis <Col N="1555" /> an Roinn nua.  Beidh an Ghaeilge in úsáid; sin í m'aidhm.  Tá sí in úsáid láthair agus sin mar a bheidh.

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that under this Government, funding of An Chomhairle Ealaíon has increased by 13 per cent in 1993 &mdash; a remarkable achievement in these difficult times.  In addition, under the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-1997</i>, I am committed to achieving the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> funding target of £12-£13 million in 1994 and to at least maintaining that level of funding in subsequent years. This trend will clearly lead to incremental increases in the <i>per capita</i> grant-in-aid of An Chomhairle Ealaíon.  I am convinced that this is the way to proceed rather than engage in comparisons with trends elsewhere which serve no useful purpose in the absence of precise comparative data regarding structures and functions of the organisations in question.</P>
      <P>What I mean by this is that the range of activities within the different bodies are not exactly similar, that one would need a better base upon which to make comparisons.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister accept that we have to use some yardstick <Col N="1556" /> because in the area of art development, as in all other areas of artistic and economic development, we are competing with our nearest neighbours?  I will accept that there has been an improvement in funding for the arts in this financial year, and I welcome that.  Using the base line of 1992, because that is the last year for which we have figures, we are at the bottom of the league in terms of grant-in-aid <i>per capita, vis-á-vis</i> our nearest neighbours.</P>

      <P>I have every intention of improving the ratio in regard to the figures the Deputy refers to.  Certainly the gap has been narrowing.  This latest allocation between 1992-93 will change matters considerably.  I am committed to ensuring greater provision, not as much on the basis of comparison as on my belief that arts expenditure is part of the intellectual infrastructure of our people. For that reason, as I have said in answer to other questions, one may anticipate that there will be better provision in structural programmes with related benefits for the people.  I will, if the Deputy wishes, seek a mechanism for giving comparative information to her.</P>

I would ask the Minister also to accept that it is a very important part of our economic development.  I would ask the Minister to acknowledge that for every £1 expended by the Arts Council £1.80 has been generated in the economy.</P>

Sna pleananna a leag sé amach don Chomhairle Ealaíon, an bhfuil sé ar intinn aige go mbeadh an Chomhairle in ann cur leis an gcuidiú do chomhairlí contae maidir le poist d'oifigigh ealaíon a chur ar fáil? Níl ach 14 dhuine ann, ar feadh m'eolais, ach tá a lán comhairlí ag iarraidh feabhas a chur ar an staid seo.

      <P>Ar an gcéad dul síos, bhí an Teachta Quill ag tagairt don tuarascáil Myerscough.  Glacaim leis go <Col N="1558" /> bhfuil buntáistí eacnamaíochta ag baint le caiteachas ar na healaíona.  Ach is é a bhunús ná pearsantacht an duine a fhorbairt mar ba cheart.</P>
      <P>Le freagra a thabhairt ar an cheist a chur an Teachta Gallagher orm, aontaím leis nach bhfuil sé sásúil nach mbeadh ach 14 oifigeach sna hudaráis áitiúla ag plé le cúrsaí ealaíon.  Tá sé ráite ag cheana féin go bhfuil mé ag tabhairt caoi ar bhonn deonach do na húdaráis áitiúla an bealach a réiteach maidir leis na poist ealaíon seo.  Tá sé d'oibleagáid ar na comhairlí de réir an Chlár Rialtais plean forbartha do na healaíona a chur le chéile faoi mhí na Samhna seo chugainn.  Mura mbíonn aon dul chun cinn ann faoin sprioc-am sin caithfidh mé féachaint ar cad atá riachtanach maidir le ceapadh na n-oifigeach sin.</P>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom a rá, áfach, go bhfuil údaráis áitiula ann a thugann dea-shampla uathu.  Bhí mé i gCill Mhántáin an tseachtain seo caite, áit a bhfuil ionad ann d'ealaíontóirí óga le taispeántais a chur ar siúl, agus imeachtaí ar an dul sin, agus is é sin an sórt dea-shampla atá uainn.

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that when I became Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht through a process that evolved from 12 January last, when functions were transferred to me by statutory instrument, a great deal of preparation had been made for the structural programmes of last year.  However, my new Department with very dedicated work by my staff, some of whom had come with me and <Col N="1559" /> most of whom are with the Department of the Gaeltacht, in co-operation with each other and with my own advisers and programme manager worked very hard to submit a new comprehensive proposal to the Department of Finance.  What we have proposed for Roinn na Gaeltachta is very observable.  In other areas, too, what is for the arts, culture and heritage will be clearly identifiable in the National Development Plan when it is published.</P>

Conas a chuireann sé sin i gcomhthéacs na fógraíochta a dhéantar dá réir agus an bhfuil aon rud le rá aige faoin tionchar atá aigesean ar chúrsaí ealaíon? Mar shampla amháin den fhadhb ganntanas airgid, ar chuala sé faoin chailín, 11 bhliain d'aois, ar ceoltóir an-éirimiúil í, go bhfuil uirthi dul go Corcaigh gach seachtain i gcomhair ranganna?  Faigheann sí deontas ón gComhairle Ealaíon ach bíonn uirthi dul ina haonair os rud é nach bhfuil cúnamh airgid ann chuige sin.  Nach dona an scéal é ó thaobh sábháilteachta de?

      <P>Ba mhaith liom a chur i gcuimhne don Teachta arís go raibh cruinniú agam féin le baill Cothú, cruinniú a bhí beagáinín neamhfhoirmeálta mar go raibh mé ag oscail comórtais a bhí acu.  Ar chúpla ócáid eile bhuail mé leis na baill ag fiontar príobháideach chun cabhrú le himeachtaí ealaíon.  Fáiltím go mór roimh na daoine nua ach go háirithe agus moláim na daoine a bhunaigh eagraíochtaí ar nós Cothú.  Thar aon rud eile, bhí daoine ann, d'ainneoin na dtosca eacnamaíochta agus an ghanntanas airgid a lean leis an obair a bhí ar siúl acu agus tá mise iontach buíoch díobh as sin.  Rinne siad an-íobairt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maidir leis an chás a luaigh an Teachta, níl mise sásta go mbeadh iallach ar thuismitheoirí ligean do dhaoine óga imeacht as réigiún ar bith de dheasca gan na háiseanna cuí bheith ar fáil acu ann chun an <Col N="1560" /> ceol a shaothrú.  Luaigh an Teachta cailín óg a raibh uirthi taisteal go Corcaigh agus tá cailíní eile agus buachaillí ag plé leis an cheol san iarthar agus nuair a bhaineann siad staid áirithe amach níl aon áit ann dóibh.  Tá mé ag smaoineamh ar áiseanna réigúnacha agus tá mé ag déanamh iarrachta na bunstruchtúir a shocrú.  Má éiríonn liom maidir leis na Cistí Struchtúrtha beidh seans ann freastal ar na riachtanais sin ionas nach mbeidh ar dhaoine óga taisteal.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an phointe eile, faoi dhuine fhásta dul in éineacht léi, cuirfidh mé an cheist seo faoi bhráid na Comhairle Ealaíon; b'fhéidir go dtabharfaidh an Teachta na sonraí dom.  Ar bhealach is rud sealadach é sin.  Tá bearnaí atá níos práinní fós a chaithfear a líonadh.</P>

      <P>We have talked a great deal about allocations for various bodies and increasing expenditure in respect of those bodies.  Would the Minister agree that what is most needed is a statement from him in regard to his cultural policy?  I do not mean a press statement or a short statement in the Dáil but a considered long term statement about the development of culture, the arts and broadcasting which would enable us address the issue on which we are seeking to obtain information in the context of the Minister's overall policy in respect of that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the philosophical correctness and practicality of the Deputy's suggestion.  Since I became Minister on January 12 much has happened in those five areas.  They have absorbed nearly all my time.  I am happy with the progress that has been made.  I agree with the Deputy's suggestion and I intend to prepare a document on the lines he referred to.  I have gone a great deal of the way towards that in preparing the heritage initiative for submission to the Department of Finance for Structural Funds.  I do not wish to delay the House but the Deputy's suggestion is a good one.  It has been my practice to leave the Department at night and visit different groups, for example, the film community, <Col N="1561" /> broadcasters, community arts people and others and explain to them what I am doing.  I will prepare a paper and I can tell the Deputy what its departure point is.  It is towards a democratic theory of culture emphasising participation that will immediately reject theories of elitism and within this democratic theory of culture I will give expression to strategies for achieving participation across the five areas.  For example, I have said in debates on broadcasting that I have favoured the democratic right of people within the communicative order to be the arrow in communication rather than to be its target.  Having regard to that commitment I will be developing these values and it will assist if I put it together in a comprehensive statement.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply given by the Minister for Education to a similar question on 27 April 1993.  In her reply the Minister pointed out that the making available of school facilities to the general public is primarily a matter for the school management authorities but that she is keen to encourage greater public access to their facilities.  Her Department has circulated all schools urging a positive approach on this issue.</P>
      <P>I would fully support the Minister for Education's approach to this issue and I will be asking the Minister to bear in mind the potential of these facilities for arts and culture purposes.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's positive response to this question. We have good resources in school buildings and facilities that should be more accessible, and available, for example to <Col N="1562" /> arts and cultural groups.  Would the Minister in his discussions with the Minister for Education consider the practical issue of insurance?  I understand this is a barrier to groups using schools.  It is time we addressed this issue and opened up those resources.  We should not have buildings which are not used at certain hours of the day.  The Minister in a previous discussion referred to the army of parents who bring young children to a variety of arts, music and drama lessons around the country and the demands this creates as this area is not adequately addressed within our education system. It would be a welcome development by many people here if this area could also form part of the Minister's discussions with the Minister for Education.</P>

      <P>Question Time is a positive exercise.  I would like to see take place without undue delay the type of activities Deputy Fitzgerald describes. I have spoken about what I call &ldquo;purchased child improvement sessions&rdquo; operated by an army of mostly women outside the school day.  Surely we must aim to ensure that those creative activities take place within the school day. In my discussions with the Minister for Education in preparation for the White Paper I have made that point.  It is a view I have made public.  I wish to see creative activities within a democratic theory of culture located within the curriculum and take place during the school day.  I wish to take up the issue of insurance.  I sometimes wonder at the number of times I have heard the excuse of insurance being used to defeat worthy projects that have come forward.  I take the Deputy's point and I will discuss it further with the Minister for Education.  It may need to be discussed too, with the Minister for Finance. We should never forget our school buildings, they are paid for out of taxation and they are supported and often initiated by local communities.  There is sometimes a great fog, and I wonder if it is accidental, as to who operates them. They should be used for community benefit.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister accept that a good deal of art activity as described by the Minister and Deputy Fitzgerald could and should take place in school buildings and that much of it could happen if school managers and school principals had school caretakers to take care of the practical needs of keeping school buildings open after school hours?

      <P>My colleague, the Minister for Education, is addressing issues of disadvantage as one of her <Col N="1564" /> priorities.  She is giving the emphasis to her decisions in relation to putting the children first.  She will be examining the issue of caretakers on which she will have the final decision.  I agree that the use of these buildings will be of great benefit to local communities.  All Members should have the courage to agree that these places we call schools are, in fact, public buildings paid for by the public and they should be available for use by the public. Any influence I have in this matter will follow that philosophy which is a democratic one.</P>

      <P>B'fhéidir go bhfuil an tAire ag cuimhneamh siar ar an tráth nuair a bhíomar go léir sa Seanad &mdash; agus an Teachta Connor chomh maith. Bhí díospóireacht íontach againn ar rún a leag an tAire é féin ar son Pháirtí an Lucht Oibre os comhair an tSeanaid ar an Benson report.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister can recall a time when he, Deputy Connor and myself debated a Labour Party motion in the Seanad on the state of the arts in Irish education in song and dance.  That excellent debate was totally depoliticised and we faced up to the fact that the state of the arts in Irish education was quite abysmal.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that in the intervening period there has not been any substantial improvement in the state of the arts in Irish education?  Also, from the point of view of his welcome commitment to 24-hour vitality to school buildings, will the Minister indicate a finite date by which this basically logistical problem of school insurance can be overcome?  As the Minister said, it is wrong that billions of pounds worth of resources are tied up for four and half months of the year, and virtually 16 hours of every day, and not used for the benefit of the community.</P>

      <P>I wish to make it perfectly clear that I am not here today to make financial commitments.  I cannot make them in relation to insurance for <Col N="1565" /> school buildings; that is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Education and I agree it may go beyond her remit. I indicated clearly my thinking on the matter and what I will seek to resolve.</P>
      <P>I was asked a straightforward question about the 1979 Benson report.  This was followed by &ldquo;Dances and Dance&rdquo; and other reports included &ldquo;Deaf Ears&rdquo;. They all dealt with various areas of the arts.  If ever there was a justification for my Department it would be to seek to implement those reports because there is a great distinction between having a cultural and an arts policy and operating on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  It is a distinction that a former Member of this House, Dr. Conor Cruise O'Brien, described on one occasion as the distinction between being a patron for the arts and patronising the arts.  I am strongly in favour of a policydriven approach.  I am aware of this report which included the suggestion of a college of music in the region to which I referred.  It is one of the reasons I am anxious to fill this gap if I am successful. That is all one can do.  A difficulty that I, as Minister, face constantly is whether I should try to do only that which I am certain to achieving and thereby avoid criticism or should I try to make all the provisions and fail in some areas?  I have no hesitation in following the second path.</P>

      <P>The Minister has touched on a number of key problems that relate to the use of school buildings. In my constituency a number of school buildings are well used for cultural, educational and community purposes.  Of course, the difficulty is that they are made available through the good will of the school management.  That matter needs to be addressed.  When the Minister is discussing the question of the arts in schools and calling for the development of a cultural aspect to our curriculum will he discuss also with the Minister for Education the question of adequate insurance for after school hours use of <Col N="1566" /> buildings and the question of after school hours heating, lighting and maintenance of these schools.  Most schools, particularly primary schools in disadvantaged areas, cannot maintain schools even during school hours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Many consultations will be necessary to achieve this but I am certainly of one mind with the Deputy. Buildings such as these which are built from the public purse should be used to maximum benefit to achieve the maximum community impact.  I feel for those people who became involved in the endless driving of children to and from schools for various activities.  It is ridiculous if people who have motivated themselves to do something good for the community, managed to get access to the key of a building are then required to find out how to use the heating system, or how to turn on the lights or change a bulb and so on.  I will bear the Deputy's views, which I share, in mind during the consultations I propose to have.</P>

      <P>I am preparing a fundamental review of broadcasting and will examine this issue in that context.  Due to the RTE Authority's unique role as custodian, on behalf of the Irish people, of the national broadcasting services, I consider that the current situation, where all members of the Authority are appointed by Government, to be the most appropriate formal arrangement. However, I will examine in my review procedures which might assist, through the nomination of names for consideration.</P>

    <P>I should add that it has been a long standing practice that the Government has appointed a member of RTE staff <Col N="1567" /> to the Authority, although serving in a personal capacity.</P>

      <P>Did the Minister say he is prepared to consider the appointment of representatives of staff to the RTE Authority but not the election of staff?  My question asked if he would agree to provide for elected representatives of RTE employees to be appointed.  Approximately 11 State companies and 24 State enterprises currently have directors elected from staff.  People working in bodies such as RTE, Eolas, Teagasc and so on should have equal rights in this regard.  I urge the Minister to consider, before appointing the new Authority in September, introducing an appropriate amendment in the legislation before the House.  This should provide for the election of representatives of staff.</P>

      <P>The Independent Radio and Television Commission comes up for review in November.  I am anxious to listen to the view of the Authority and I hope, within a short period, to deal with proposals, which I believe are agreed across the House, on gender equality in these bodies.  However, the Authority is an authority as opposed to a semi-State company.  I wish to explain briefly that part of my reply which might have confused the Deputy.  I was indicating that in the review I will seek a mechanism. <Col N="1568" /> One possibility for consideration was that people, for example, hold an election and put forward a name for nomination. However, I will review this matter.  The point is well taken that if there is to be dynamism and creativity in a large organisation such as RTE, its workers should be represented.  While distinguished people have been chosen to serve on the Authority, I am not sure that that is the only way of selecting people.  I intend to consider the matter further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Before lunch I referred to an issue which is prevalent in my constituency, that is, homelessness.  As recently as last night, the tax amnesty was presented as a solution to the problem of homelessness.  It struck me as warped thinking that one matter could be seen as a solution to the other; rather, one is the cause of the other.  On reading a letter in today's <i>Irish Times</i> this question was reinforced in my mind.  The writer asked: &ldquo;what sort of primeval mercantilist mentality induces a Cabinet to put out a story that `if only we could attract the money back home, it would create jobs'?&rdquo;.  That is a good question which needs to be answered.</P>
      <P>The Government issued a statement in the last couple of hours in relation to the tax amnesty, from which I will quote because it is of relevance to this debate. It states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1609" /> The Government at its meeting this morning confirmed the decision taken on 25 May to provide for an incentive scheme in respect of certain categories of undisclosed tax liabilities.</P>
    <P>This scheme, which will offer partial relief of the tax due as well as remission of interest and penalties, is intended to: provide those who failed to meet their obligations in the past with a final opportunity to regularise their tax affairs, in advance of the introduction of more stringent penalties for tax fraud; facilitate the use for purposes of general economic benefit of funds arising from tax evasion, whether held dormant in Ireland or abroad; secure the highest possible proportion of undisclosed liabilities from the period prior to April 1991, bearing in mind that such evasion is difficult to detect at this remove.</P>
    <P>In considering the detailed provisions, which will be the subject of early legislation, the Government will endeavour to strike an appropriate balance between these immediate aims and wider considerations, notably maintaining the integrity of the tax system and protecting ongoing revenue-collection. To that end, it is the Government's intention to introduce stringent penalties, including imprisonment, directed at those who abuse or ignore the opportunity to become compliant for the future and at enhancing the effectiveness of tax-enforcement generally.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the issuing of this statement was an attempt by the Minister to hold back the tide of public anger &mdash; King Canute adopted a similar approach.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the delicacy of his language and the sensitivity of his prose.  I might even recommend that his statement be referred to <i>Roget's Thesaurus.</i>  That delicacy is maintained throughout the statement is a tribute to the Minister's use of language.  There is no mention of amnesty in the statement; rather the Minister uses the term &ldquo;incentive scheme&rdquo;.  If that term were included <Col N="1610" /> in a thesaurus, written after it probably would be: amnesty, gift, reward, present, licence.  Another term used in the statement is &ldquo;undisclosed tax liabilities&rdquo;. Beside that term would be: tax cheating, tax dodging, daylight robbery, white collar crime.  Also used is the term &ldquo;general economic benefit&rdquo;, beside which might be; land speculation, inflated property prices as in Mespil Road, golden circle and so on.</P>
    <P>The Government will endeavour to strike an appropriate balance, maintaining the integrity of the tax system, but only after it has ripped apart the tax system.  It intends to protect ongoing revenue collection.  However instilled into every law-abiding tax paying citizen will be a deep-seated burning resentment at the injustice of the amnesty.  As a result of that justifiable anger and resentment there will be further loss of integrity in terms of our tax collection system.  People in the community expected and hoped after all the controversy for a tiger of a statement, but what they got is a kitten, gentle, soft and tame.</P>

      <P>I accept that amendment &mdash; gentle, soft, tame and sly.  It has teeth, but they are the baby teeth of a household pet, not the full sized canines the public was waiting for.  The whimper in the tail of the statement is the mention of imprisonment for tax fraud.  I understand that there were already penalties of imprisonment for tax fraud, although I am open to correction on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If people defraud the State, fill in forms misleadingly or lie, the framework is already there to put them in prison.  Awareness that people are cheating the system is not new.  It is a matter that comes up in debate on every Finance Bill. Penalties have been put in place to deal with people who are ripping off the State. The fact that nobody is behind bars does not mean that we do not have the power to put them there.  The matter has come up year after year since the great tax marches when thousands of PAYE <Col N="1611" /> workers took to the streets and demanded justice and equality.</P>
    <P>This threat about imprisonment has been used as an indication of the Government's resolve.  The threat has been made but it has never been followed up.  The little boy who cried wolf did something similar.  This time, even if the Government is serious about doing something nobody believes it because the evidence belies its words.  The political will is missing to deal with this problem once and for all on the information already in the Government's hands.  The thirst for justice is missing.  If somebody robs £60,000 from a labour exchange, as happened in my home town of Bray recently, and if somebody defrauds the State of £60,000 in tax, the net result is the same but the result for that individual is markedly different.</P>

      <P>It is interesting that no one sees the blindness on the part of the Government to the crime we are talking about.  Why is crime tolerated when it is committed by men in three-piece suits with the proverbial red braces in air conditioned offices?  Why is that crime tolerated by this Government while crime committed by young lads in denim jackets who are half starved in body and in spirit out in the street, is punished with jail?  There is no problem, and no questions are asked.  We just get those lads in as quick as we can.  That is the double standard that the Government is responsible for, the double standard that only sees the poor person committing a crime but never sees the big fish who is ripping us all off.  It is blind in the way my colleague here is blind to that form of crime. The people out there are not as blind. They are well aware that they are being ripped off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1612" /> I was considering today the whole question of putting people in jail.  Being put in jail is not the end of the world.  In Britain if one is caught for tax evasion one is put away.  We have the most famous example of all in Lester Piggot who was imprisoned for a year for tax evasion. When he came out, he so impressed the trainer Vincent O'Brien that Lester Piggot returned to the saddle and has done very well.  He won the Breeders Cup in New York and went on to win the English and Irish 2,000 guineas.</P>

      <P>The Minister must suffer a little more.  I can only say that he asked for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One question the Minister might consider as he sits there impaled in his seat, is why he does not act now with the penalties he has as his disposal.  What is holding him back?  There was a question as to whether there was any information or assessment as to the amount of money that is out there.  The Minister at the recent Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs said that there is no doubt that the moneys exist, that he had access to substantial information from both inside and outside the country about where the money is and that we must do something with it, but that that is a matter for another day.  Why is it a matter for another day?  If all the criminals and crooks in the land were advised that the State knew about the crimes they were committing, knew where they had the loot stashed and that doing something about it is a matter for another day, there <Col N="1613" /> would be an awful lot of happy criminals about.  Rather than proceeding with this tax amnesty the Minister might set up a task force to go after the money he knows is there.  I have no doubt that when he starts to probe around, more information will come to light.  If he gives the resources to the Revenue Commissioners and ensures that they have access to the accounts of public institutions, the Minister will be in a very good position, in a fairly short space of time, to take credit for achieving what has never been achieved &mdash; the first step towards tax equity.  People would be willing to operate within a tax system that was fair, and when people cheated they would be punished rather than rewarded.  A lot of kudos would attach to the Minister if he adopted that approach rather than buckling under to the tax cheat and to the super rich.  If he did battle rather than buckle we might make some progress.  If the Minister defended the public interest, and the principles of justice and equity, he would have the support of the Opposition. I would support a Minister who went along that track or indeed a cabinet made up of Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party if they adopted an approach leading towards tax equity.  None of us expects miracles, but we expect a certain integrity, a certain fighting spirit, in protecting those law abiding people who pay their taxes and who are increasingly wondering why they bother.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather surprised at the attitude adopted by the Opposition on Report Stage of the Finance Bill.  They have let this taxation issue take up all the time.  They have been so concerned about taxation and the problem it poses for the people that they have found a way to disrupt the whole Report Stage of the Bill.  I have never heard more exaggeration than I have heard today from the Opposition, mainly made up of the Progressive Democrats grouping and Fine Gael.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Listening to Deputy McManus, one would think we lived in the wild west. She can look across at Europe and see what is happening in France, England <Col N="1614" /> and all the economies, where they are having to change their outlook, and where capital is more important to them. She also referred to the homeless in Bray. All I would say is &ldquo;God help the homeless in Bray&rdquo;.  If her party got into power they would never see a house built.  The way she wants to run this economy, houses for the people who most deserve them would not be built.  Her claim is that she would fill the prisons and would return us to an eastern bloc style Government system that has been much criticised.  She wants to get back into that whole area again.</P>
    <P>Were it not for Deputy Davern, my colleague and good friend, who was a Minister for a short time and who definitely left his mark in the Department of Education, we would not be here this afternoon discussing the very important topic of an amnesty.  It is necessary to recognise that there are funds in excess of £2 billion abroad.  This proposed amnesty is a recognition of that problem. We should stop the moaning and groaning and have this money repatriated and invested here.</P>
    <P>Many of our people work abroad.  They may have made small investments abroad which may have accumulated real wealth but they are nervous about repatriating that money, there being no mechanism whereby they can do so.  There was reference to little people.  These are the little people about whom I am concerned. They are capital-oriented and they like to make investments which, in many cases, may be substantial.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that this debate has been turned into what I might describe as street politics, endeavouring to criticise the Labour Party.  Everybody knows my views on the formation of this Government.  It is grossly unfair to single out the Labour Party for the kind of criticism meted out throughout this debate.  By and large the Labour Party is progressive in its thinking.  They are not blinkered, as are the Opposition on this issue.</P>
    <P>On Monday Deputy Yates was looking for a levy of 10 per cent, whereas his Leader was seeking 15 per cent on Tuesday. What are they thinking of?  If they <Col N="1615" /> cannot make up their minds and adapt some coherent approach to policy in Opposition it is a very sad day for our people, in particular those they represent. We have had Deputy Yates here the entire afternoon and his Leader jumping out of his skin trying to criticise the amnesty and gain some political kudos.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cullen stated on 3 February 1988:</P>
    <P>I particularly commend the Minister on the introduction of the amnesty. It has been the most far seeing and imaginative amnesty introduced for many years.  I sincerely hope it is what the Minister wishes and that it will benefit the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I wonder why the change of heart.  What encouraged the Progressive Democrats to change?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cullen continued:</P>
      <P>By getting this amnesty, if it works, out of the way, and with real selfassessment being rolled in following on that, we could bring the taxation system, particularly in the areas which cause concern, up to date.  This could mean an effective return to the Exchequer.  We would not be pretending every year that there are £600 million, £700 million or £800 million owed to taxes when most of it is assessed and notional, and does not have any real relevance.</P>
      <P>They are the facts, so why has there been a change?  Why are they seeking the high moral ground, looking for the cheap publicity? They want to woo the misfortunate taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Michael McDowell has been writing in the papers.  He should remember that he is a legislator elected by the people. He had the hard luck once to lose his seat but he is back again.  He talks about the Supreme Court.  Has he disowned this House?  Is that precisely what he is <Col N="1616" /> endeavouring to do, encouraging people to go to the courts?  It would be very serious for somebody of his background and academic ability to contend that the proposed amnesty is contrary to the Constitution. We are the people who make laws, who should protect the law.  We should not encourage people to go to the courts.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners' attitude to taxation has frightened people.  People who accumulate wealth are those who must pay tax or will experience difficulty with the Revenue Commissioners.  Many people are nervous of approaching them. If a query arose they would prefer to ignore it rather than face up to it.  More recently the Revenue Commissioners appear to have adopted a more businesslike approach, which is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I am aware that passports of constituents of mine have been taken from them.  That is very extreme, since the Special Branch or Garda rarely, if ever, take one's passport.  That is something that would frighten me.  A change in attitude on the part of the Revenue Commissioners is to be welcomed.  I believe that we will see a different taxation scene henceforth.</P>
    <P>This suggested amnesty is welcomed by the community in general.  By and large amnesties are based on compassion, on a desire to help.  This amnesty will bring much-needed money into our economy. It is vital to our economy that business be developed.  If we can generate more wealth there will be greater liquidity within our economy which will help further in reducing our interest rates, there being more money available for productive purposes.  Yet there are people in this House who are trying to knock this proposal.  Not one single constituent has phoned or written complaining about the proposed amnesty.  Rather I have met people who have said that it is the intelligent and right thing to do.  I fail to understand the attitude of the Opposition.</P>
    <P>We have heard talk about scandals that took place here.  Much of this talk was in public houses.  These matters will cost this country many millions.  An inquiry <Col N="1617" /> into one such scandal will cost us in excess of £50 million.  The suppliers of stock to the company concerned and the purchasers of their finished product experienced little or no difficulty but somebody in between experienced many problems. With that kind of attitude in our society it will be difficult for our economy to grow.</P>
    <P>On the repatriation of this money, whether it be £2 billion, £4 billion, or £1 billion, I fear that the Revenue Commissioners will have a list of names available to them and that those people will be subjected to greater audit and scrutiny than others.  There will have to be some safeguards incorporated in the Bill that will come before this House to protect those people.</P>
    <P>If we get these £2 billion, that will be a pittance <i>vis-á-vis</i> what we require for development.  Our county roads need development and we have a housing programme we want to complete.  There is a real shortage of capital.  That was highlighted in the House recently when the Greencore shares were for sale and there were no Irish takers.  It proved that we are a very small, limited economy, that we need money.  We go to Europe, to Brussels and Strasbourg, begging continually. We are told we will receive £8 billion in Structural and Cohesion Funds. We have £2 billion of our own so what is the problem?  Why are people so annoyed, so worried about this proposal? Why are they trying to make criminals of people who invest abroad or who earned that money abroad and invested it there? It is regrettable that such should be the case.  I would encourage the Government in this far seeing proposal.  I am glad that their Labour partners have identified themselves with it, knowing that it will improve our economy.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for Finance on his patience in recent weeks in the course of the Committee and Report Stages of this Finance Bill, which will be concluded at 6.45 p.m. this evening.  The task of the Minister for Finance is difficult. I admire his patience, endurance and the way he has listened to us today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the last speakers' contribution may I say to the hapless Minister sitting over there that, with friends like him who needs enemies? Having said that, I would have to give credit to Deputy Ned O'Keeffe who, unlike most other members of his party, had the guts to come into the House, speak his mind and say what he had to say.  That must count for something.</P>
      <P>To paraphase Shakespeare's <i>Hamlet</i>, something is rotten in the State of Ireland.  There is an old Chinese proverb that says &ldquo;a decaying fish rots from the head down&rdquo;.  The majority of decent people know where the rot starts.  That is why when given the opportunity last November they voted for change.  They genuinely wanted to move away from the politics of the nod and the stroke and from a position where a small number of people were on the inside track, the golden circle.  The ordinary people wanted to see this country run in accordance with the best principles of a modern democracy and public funds raised and disbursed in accordance with the principles set down democratically in this House.  They wanted to turn their backs and walk away from something they did not want to be part of.  They wanted change, but look at what has happened.</P>
      <P>It is ironic that the Labour Party, which preached long and hard against the politics of the stroke, can consent to the amnesty that is being proposed.  Indeed it has consented to many other proposals since the Government was formed.  As I look across the floor of the House, as I do every morning on the Order of Business, I can only conclude that the Captain's Lady and Judy O'Grady are sisters under the skin.  I listened to what members of the Labour Party had to say in this House this morning and read their comments in their local newspapers about this amnesty.  They made the case, particularly on the local radio and through their local newspapers, that this money could be used to make proper provision for the mentally and physically handicapped.  I hold that comment in contempt; it is a spurious and spacious argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1619" /> For the mentally handicapped, their families and those who care for them it adds insult to injury, because they have been neglected for years.  How are we going to make it up to them in this shoddy, shabby way?  While other public services can be financed using funds raised through legitimate channels and in the proper manner, the mentally and physically handicapped will be given this &ldquo;dirty money&rdquo;.  Having regard to the manner in which it was made, stashed away and will be brought back, it would be nothing more and nothing less than &ldquo;dirty money&rdquo;.  If this tax had been collected from the people to whom this magnificent concession is being given in the same manner as tax is collected from PAYE taxpayers and if proper provision had been made for the Revenue Commissioners to collect this tax in the first instance, services for the physically and mentally handicapped would not be funded in the manner in which they are now funded.</P>
    <P>The physically and mentally handicapped are not the only victims of our failure to reform the taxation system. This is what the Progressive Democrats have been trying to do since their inception and tried to do consistently when in Government.  If our taxation system had been reformed and if proper resources had been provided for the Revenue Commissioners, this money would not have been taken out of the country in the first instance.  It could have been used to make proper provision not alone for the mentally and physically handicapped but also for the many others who have been victimised.</P>
    <P>When I speak of victims I am thinking of small children in the most overcrowded classrooms in the European Community and of overstressed teachers who are trying to educate these children in such conditions.  I am also thinking of the elderly who are growing old, fragile, whose health is failing, who know that proper provision has not been made for them so that they can be cared for in the community.  I further think of the thousands of people, many of whom are <Col N="1620" /> to be found in my own constituency, who are living in the most appalling conditions while awaiting the provision of local authority housing.</P>
    <P>These are some of the victims of the practice which has been allowed to develop whereby tax dodgers can do what they wish and run rings around the tax collection system.  Yet, these are the people for whom this amnesty has been designed.  They are being granted special privileges, offered special conditions and given special concessions.  Is that not a scandal?  It was one thing to allow them take this money out of the country in the first instance, but it is a scandal that this amnesty is being extended to them.  I am filled with rage.  I have been a PAYE tax payer since I was 20.  One of these days I am going to find out how much tax I have been required to pay since I first started work as a single woman &mdash; I am only one of thousands &mdash; and what benefits I am now entitled to.</P>
    <P>Even as I speak parents in the PAYE sector are looking at their bright children who will start their leaving certificate examinations in four or five days time. They will bid for points in the hope that they will get a place in one of our third level colleges but in the knowledge that, if they do not, their job prospects will be seriously diminished.  Parents are asking themselves the question: if their children get enough points, where will they get the money to pay their fees.  Thousands of people in the PAYE sector have had to take out a second mortgage and large loans from the banks to meet educational expenses so that they could give their children the best start in life.</P>
    <P>I am talking here about ordinary people; nurses, gardaí, teachers, civil servants, local authority workers, those who work in factories, on trains and buses up and down the country.  These are the people who are the backbone of this country.  They have paid their taxes in the belief that they would enable better provision of public services for people who are not in a position to pay their taxes.  I am certain that these caring and patriotic people would gladly pay their tax if everybody else was required to pay in the same <Col N="1621" /> manner and at the same rate.  At the end of the day all they want is justice and equity within the tax system.</P>
    <P>The proposed amnesty is the greatest travesty of justice I remember since I started to pay tax as a PAYE worker. Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, whether deliberately or otherwise &mdash; I suspect otherwise because he is no fool &mdash; argues that this amnesty is the same as those previously granted, but nothing is further from the truth and Deputy O'Keeffe knows that.  The fact that we have to offer an amnesty points to the failure of our system.  The terms of the previous amnesty were based on some principle of justice, and the persons who availed of it were already on the books of the Revenue Commissioners.  The concessions offered were very small compared with the write-off that is being offered under the terms of this proposed amnesty. There is no comparison and to attempt to make comparison is a savage attack on the truth, and that will not wash.</P>
    <P>I feel sorry for Members who seem to believe that their utterances in this House during this debate will be believed by the general public.  That is to under-estimate the intelligence of the public and their capacity to understand what is happening under the terms of this proposed amnesty.  Deputy O'Keeffe would want to bear that in mind.  It pains me particularly since he happens to represent a part of the country that I represent.  He is very foolish to try to under-estimate the intelligence of the people that live in that county and city.  I would not try to do that.  When the Deputy goes home to his constituency at the weekend &mdash; if he has not had phone calls to date &mdash; he will have phone calls because to be doing what is proposed is one thing but to be trying to justify it in his terms is another. That message will go out from the people of Cork.</P>
    <P>I have spoken of the huge requirement that has been put on PAYE taxpayers since the foundation of the State.  Does that requirement finish when the active working life is over?  Not at all.  We are hounded while we are working and when the time comes for us to retire we are <Col N="1622" /> hounded on the double.  If you happen to believe in a philosophy that you save for the rainy day, make provision to be reasonably well looked after in your old age, or even to leave something to your children, the tax man comes after you, relentless to the end.  The only day you get an exemption is when you are put in the box.  It is a scandal that pensioners who have made huge contributions to the growth and development of the public services in this country through their PAYE tax contributions are hounded for tax in their declining years.  Yet we try to justify an amnesty for people who could not care less about this country.  We are now making concessions and making it all right to repatriate the money that will benefit them better by having it here.  We are talking here of a puny 15 per cent.</P>
    <P>This amnesty is a disgrace and if this is the road this Government is taking, we are going in one direction only down the road to a jungle of corruption.  To give him credit, I do not think the Minister's heart is in this measure.  It is not his style. I know it has neither the blessing of the Department of Finance nor of the Revenue Commissioners, the people who have been trying to keep the ship of State afloat for very long time.  I appeal to the Minister to let his better judgment prevail, to follow his own good instincts, withdraw the amnesty and support the amendment that is being put here so clearly and so eloquently by Deputy Cox. I am asking the Minister to do that in the interests of preserving the integrity of the tax system and the democratic principles of this country.  People like my father went out to fight for this country in the belief that people of my generation would be fit to govern themselves and keep in place proper democratic principles where every citizen in the State would be treated equally before the law.  That was my understanding of what it means to be a Republic and that was his understanding of what it meant to be a Republic.  That is not the understanding of the present partnership in Government because we are now officially creating a two-tier State with one law for those who are law abiding and another for those who flout the <Col N="1623" /> law, who could not care about the standard of public services, who do not worry as to whether we can meet our bills at the end of the financial year.  I beg the Minister not to give the legitimacy of this House to such people.  There is an old saying in Irish: &ldquo;Is fada siar a théann iarsma an drochbhirt&rdquo;.  Roughly translated that means: the bad deed, the wrong deed may cast long shadows after it.  This deed will cast long shadows after it.  Let us confront people who are not paying their taxes in the normal manner and within the normal rules and regulations of the Revenue Commissioners and throw out this amnesty.  The Minister will not live to regret it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Lest the Minister does not understand me, rather than having him read it afterwards, I am questioning him on what has <Col N="1624" /> happened in the past 12 months to bring about such a change of attitude, a change of mind, a change of philosophy on his part when both he and my party rejected a suggestion of this kind only 12 months ago when the 1992 budget was being prepared. I wonder what has changed on the other side?  We have seen a change of Government, with the Labour Party going into Government with Fianna Fáil. I would be surprised if that was the reason this proposal is being brought forward.  I do not imagine that it emanated from the Labour side of the Government and I am amazed and disgusted that the Labour Party are supporting it.  I have not yet understood the logic of the Labour Party position on this issue.  I am amazed at the sea change that has taken place in the Fianna Fáil approach to this matter.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is aware, a proposal of this kind was rejected out of hand by the Minister and his officials when the 1992 budget was being prepared.  It was also rejected by the former Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey.  The only changes that have taken place are that the Progressive Democrats are no longer in Government and that the leadership of the Fianna Fáil Party has changed.  That is the factor I would identify as the reason for this change.  I have heard my colleagues say here on a number of occasions that they do not believe the Minister could have been the author of this proposal or that he personally could be very happy with it.  From the previous stands adopted in preparing budgets in the past, we are aware this is not the Minister's personal position and that the very strong arguments always brought forward by the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance officials against proposals of this kind are still valid today. Nothing has happened to make them valid in 1993 and invalid in 1992.  The only thing we can identify as having changed is the leadership which has brought about a major change in the philosophy of the Fianna Fáil Party, much to that party's shame.  That party is going down the slippery slope much faster than I had thought.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil philosophy always <Col N="1625" /> showed concern for ordinary, decent, hard working citizens who down through the years supported this State and tried as best they could to live within the laws and financial impositions of the State in order to maintain the structures and the services of the State.  They have suffered the highest level of income tax in the Community.  They have made these sacrifices and willingly handed over to the State a high percentage of their income. They now must look aghast and in astonishment at the Government's proposal. Those smarter people &mdash; generally wealthier people &mdash; who had the money to buy the brains could find ways in which to avoid paying their legal dues under our taxation code and to shift their money out of the country through devious illegal means.  Those people are now to receive the blessing of the Government and are invited to bring their money back in here on the understanding that it is welcome.</P>
    <P>The aura accompanying announcements from Fianna Fáil gave one the impression that they would all be at the airport, clapping, applauding and cheering these wonderful citizens who were going to bring their illegal funds back into this country and that they were to be thanked and praised for it.  What about the poor pensioners who had to pay tax on their measly incomes?  What about the people working on the factory floor? What about civil servants at every level throughout the country who have had no opportunity to dodge their tax obligations and who have it deducted at source?  Are they to stand aside and applaud this move?  The Civil Service is totally opposed to this proposal. Department of Finance and Revenue officials are opposed to this proposal and could not possibly have changed their minds since the Progressive Democrats left office.  We do not need the advice of Finance or Revenue officials or any other moral authority in the country to tell us that this is wrong.  We know it is wrong. It is leading this country into a very dangerous era where the integrity of the taxation system will be undermined for the future.</P>
    <P>If the Minister introduces an amnesty <Col N="1626" /> in this fashion now he is encouraging people from here on in to find every possible means to avoid paying their tax and to shift their money out of the country and just wait until the next amnesty is introduced when they can safely bring their money back into the country.  The Minister is proposing to go down that road for the spurious reasons given by his party and by the spokespersons who have come in here, mostly from the backbench. Where are the Government spokespersons?  Where are the more senior, more mature, more experienced members of the Fianna Fáil Party?  Backbenchers have been brought in to try to give the impression that this measure is acceptable to the Fianna Fáil organisation throughout the country.  It certainly is not.  The greatest dismay is being expressed by people who have given loyal support to the Fianna Fáil Party and Labour Party supporters are astonished at this debate.  The introduction of the amnesty will bring about a major change in the attitude of the public to the whole Government structure and the integrity of the taxation system as we know it.  It is not too late to withdraw this proposal, and it is essential that it be withdrawn.</P>
    <P>I understand the Minister is allowed to speak only once on Report Stage and he has chosen to wait until everybody has made their contribution.  I do not know if that is satisfactory.  It is not necessary for him to wait to be the last speaker.  He could come in at any stage during the debate and make his own contribution which we would see as being the Government contribution.  In view of the fact that he is holding back until all others have spoken in the debate, it appears the Government are still intent on proceeding with this ill-conceived proposal. If that is so, it is an alarming development.</P>
    <P>It is astonishing that, despite the opportunity that has been presented, by the action of my own party, to re-think this issue, the Government has not yet seen the folly of its ways nor had the courage to come forward and admit that it was making a serious mistake and was <Col N="1627" /> prepared to make a change in regard to what it was proposing.</P>
    <P>I heard the ridiculous remarks of the Taoiseach at the airport yesterday morning. They are astonishing and they defy logic.  As somebody who has spent 27 or 28 years here as an elected Member, I find it depressing that standards in public life and the standards of leadership in this country have deteriorated to such an extent that the leader of the country is promoting a proposal of this kind and seeking to justify it with simplistic arguments, saying it is better to have the money here rather than out there and that therefore we should do this thing.  It is absolutely ridiculous and indicates a very shortsighted approach on the part of the Government.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Government understands the level of anger that exists among the ordinary people who have been crushed by the taxation system? The reform of that system was one of the objectives of the Progressive Democrats. In despair people pulled out of other parties and established a new party in this country.  One of the objectives of the new political movement that was founded by Deputy Desmond O'Malley, which I and other people joined and that people voted for, was to take a stand against this kind of thing, to take a stand against the crippling levels of taxation that Governments were piling onto the backs of hard working people in this country and to try to create a better Ireland by easing that burden and creating an opportunity for investment and for the entrepreneurial initiative of the Irish people to be used to develop our own economy instead of forcing our brightest and our best to emigrate and build economies abroad, as they have so successfully done.  It has been proven time and again that whenever Irish people with an education have gone abroad they have done exceptionally well.  In the main they have been denied the opportunity to succeed at home because of the structures we have put in place and the crippling system we have established.  Part of that system is the overburdening weight of taxation, <Col N="1628" /> which gives nobody a chance to invest, to develop, to expand and to use his own individual expertise in creating something in Ireland which one would be proud of and which would create work for others.  We will continue to struggle and limp along if some major change does not take place.  That was the motivation for people like myself who left Fianna Fáil, people who left Fine Gael and left Labour.  We have people who left The Workers' Party and supported our party.  That happened because of despair at anything ever changing in this country.  We are a small party and we may be looked down upon by the larger parties, so long as they are larger than us, but those parties should not under-estimate the anger and feelings of a huge number of people.  Their loyalty will not always remain unbroken and many of the loyal supporters who have traditionally given their votes to the bigger parties have been having second thoughts about the way in which they cast their votes.  As time goes on people will look to how they might exercise their vote.  The party opposite need not assume that it will always command that huge percentage of the support of the Irish people it traditionally got in the past.  This kind of action will change Ireland.  The people do not have the opportunity to bring about change except at election time, but if one or two parties with 100 Deputies in this House can be in Government for five years an enormous amount of damage can be done to the economy and the future can look very bleak.</P>
    <P>We have a duty and responsibility to take a strong stand on issues we consider important.  We are determined that this item will be highlighted in this House and will not be allowed to slip through, as everything has been slipping through here in the past, with cosy arrangements, with, unfortunately, Fine Gael sometimes agreeing with Fianna Fáil and letting things slip through, and with excessive use of the guillotine.  When I was first elected it was the exception to see a guillotine motion and there was always an outcry if a Government attempted to bring in such a motion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1629" /> Nowadays the guillotine is regularly used to push through important legislation which is never teased out or discussed. That is not a praiseworthy development. It leads to general malaise.</P>
    <P>It is not easy for a party our size to continually raise these issues because of the strain one comes under if nobody else is prepared to take a stand on behalf of the general public in regard to the various misdemeanours and scandals that have come to light in our society.  However, somebody has to do it.  Time will show that the people abhor this kind of action. This measure being proposed here is another instance of the kind of deterioration in standards that is taking place.  If we now seek to condone and applaud those who have cheated the system in the past at the expense of those who have paid, it will undermine the whole taxation system and have long term effects.  It will damage the whole Government system in the future.  It will undermine people's confidence in the system and encourage those who up to now have struggled to meet the State's requirements to throw in the towel.</P>
    <P>What we have achieved here and the sacrifices made in the past by the founders of this State, as outlined by Deputy Quill, will go for naught if we allow crooks and gangsters to come to the top and to be the norm in this country.  The Minister can seek to doctor it up, but let him be under no illusion; that is exactly what the Minister is encouraging.  It is pathetic to hear Deputies from the Labour Party talking about the need for money to provide services for all the various areas of activity, such as the health services and the social welfare services. Of course, there is a need and there is a shortage of funds but if we sink to the level of funding those essential services for our people through this means, it will damage the whole fabric of society and will have reverberations that will go on for many years and have a terrible effect.</P>
    <P>We are opposed to the proposal in principle.  We are opposed to the philosophy behind it.  We believe the vast majority of the decent people in this country are totally opposed to this and <Col N="1630" /> that it will cause untold havoc in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>It was sad this morning to listen to the chairman of the Labour Parliamentary Party who felt obliged, for some reason or other, to come here and seek to justify the stand that his party, in Government, had taken, a stand foisted on him because of the decision made by the few of his colleagues who were around the Cabinet table with the Fianna Fáil Ministers. Deputy Kemmy felt it incumbent on him to say that everybody was dodging tax anyway and that it really did not matter.  He said that, of all people, politicians, who live in the real world, knew that this was so and that tax evaders were endemic in our society.  I quote from what he said this morning.  He said:</P>
    <P>Politicians have their ears close to the ground.  They live in the real world, they meet people on the streets and they know the reality of life more than many others.</P>
    <P>He went on to say that those who are opposing this measure were offering bogus arguments.  He said many people evade tax and that tax evasion in our society was widespread &ldquo;from top to bottom&rdquo;.  This is the philosophy of the Labour Party as expounded by Deputy Kemmy this morning.  He went on:</P>
    <P>It affects politicians, journalists, trade union employees and there is an unfortunate case in the media today in respect of this issue.  Many people evade taxes in respect of their incomes. That is the position.  Politicians are aware of this and they try to maximise their expenses in respect of travel and that is also well known.</P>
    <P>That is an astonishing allegation made by a Member of this House as a justification of the Minister's proposal to grant an amnesty to tax dodgers.  The chairman of the Labour Parliamentary Party is coming in here justifying this measure on the grounds that politicians &mdash; and if he is referring to politicans I assume he is referring to Members of this House &mdash; are <Col N="1631" /> trying to maximise their expenses in respect of their travel.</P>
    <P>This is an allegation which points the finger at every Member of this House.  I am one such Member.  I was disturbed to hear him make that accusation in that fashion this morning and that the Chair &mdash; a Deputy of the House was Acting Chairman &mdash; did not ask him to withdraw the remark.  If the Ceann Comhairle will permit me now, I would ask Deputy Kemmy, on reflection, to come back to this House at some date in the near future and withdraw that scandalous allegation he made against every Member of this House.  I speak for myself, as Deputy Kemmy said he was speaking for himself. I want that remark withdrawn if it is pointing the finger at me as a Member of this House.  I ask Deputy Kemmy to withdraw his remark in regard to all the Members of this House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kemmy went on to say that he would stand over and take any criticism from many Member because his own record was clear, that he is able to speak out on issues and is not part of a golden circle.  He went on to say that journalists &ldquo;are not in a position to point the finger at anybody.&rdquo;  He said that journalists &ldquo;are not paragons of virtue&rdquo; and that they have been known to doctor their expenses.&rdquo;  Deputy Kemmy's remarks regarding journalists are in the same vein as his remarks regarding politicans.  The chairman of the Labour Parliamentary Party has suggested that politicians and journalists are making false claims for expenses to which they are not entitled and because that is condoned we should condone those who dodge payment of their tax.  He asked that we should support this marvellous proposal from the Government and grant an amnesty to those who have cheated by taking money out of this country instead of paying tax on it here.</P>
    <P>This is an extraordinary allegation made by a Member of this House against other Members.  I have always admired Deputy Kemmy for his courage and I do not know what abberration came over him today in relation to these matters.  I <Col N="1632" /> have no doubt of his personal integrity, but he is pointing the finger at everybody else.  He is doing so as a justification for this proposal.  I find that grossly offensive. I ask Deputy Kemmy to come to this House and withdraw that allegation at an early opportunity.  I ask the Leader of his party, I ask the Minister and Taoiseach to stand up in this House and disassociate themselves from the statement made by Deputy Kemmy today.  He said he has heard much hypocrisy during the last two days.  Deputy Kemmy, the man who made this allegation against everybody in this House, says that the arguments being made by those opposing this amendment are hypocritical.  In other words, he suggests that because we are all fiddling our travelling expenses we are hypocrites to argue against the Minister granting an amnesty to people who have fiddled tax payments and liabilities in the past.  That is an absolutely disgraceful allegation.  I hope the Ceann Comhairle, who has a special duty in regard to the integrity of the membership of this House, will reflect on the words of Deputy Kemmy and consider whether it is appropriate that the matter be brought before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to have it examined.  Things have been said in the past with less serious implications in respect of the personal integrity of Members and they were brought before it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not lecturing.  I am merely pointing out that the Members of this House need to be defended on matters of this kind and that it is a serious matter.</P>
      <P>If this amnesty is to go through I believe there is another aspect of it which may not have been mentioned.  There would be a danger that it will have a long term effect on revenue collection.  The Revenue Commissioners preparing estimates and preparatory work for budgets would not be able to give the Minister for Finance and the Government of the day any kind of accurate estimate as to what the Revenue take might be in any one year because of the official encouragement this amnesty will give to everybody to dodge and refuse to pay their tax.  The people who do not have that opportunity are those who have their tax deducted at source, the PAYE sector. That is where the anger is coming from. That is why the Minister should reflect before he proceeds any further to push this issue to a vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The clear indication of what the Minister is proposing is that there will be one law for the bulk of citizens and a much more selective <i>a la carte</i> legal code for the wealthy elite in our society.  There is no point in telling a PAYE worker that he too can avail of evasion in the future and that he too can look forward to the next amnesty with great optimism.  How will he avail of this new opportunity of tax evasion?  He does not have that opportunity because his tax is deducted at source.  That is what has led to the very understandable sense of outrage and dismay on the part of ordinary people throughout the country, people who against all the odds of economic recession get on with the task of making a living and rearing families.  Costs are high enough. People have enough to struggle against to put food on the table without us seeming to introduce this new code of ethics which undermines the whole integrity of <Col N="1634" /> the way public life has operated in this country up to now.</P>
    <P>What is extraordinary about this proposal is that one of the parties in Government, the Labour Party, fought the election on the slogan &ldquo;Vote for us we will put justice into economics and trust into politics&rdquo;.  If this is the kind of justice that the Labour Party sees as being necessary to put into economics, it is very warped thinking.  There is no logic to it. It is not equitable.  It is not fair and it certainly is not just.  It is unjust.  It is very unjust to proceed with a proposal of this kind.  As for putting trust into politics, that must have become the greatest laugh of the decade in view of what we are now witnessing.  I do not know what resources the State want to give to the Revenue Commissioners.  We know they have continuously sought extra resources in order to deal with the tax evasion that they become aware of through the general operation of their duties.  There have been stories of people hiring private planes with suitcases full of notes and flying to Jersey Island, the Caymen Islands, Switzerland, Cyprus and other havens where they can stow away their cash.  They slip away in the dark of the night in privately hired planes and take off from some airport where the customs will not open every case.  These matters have been reported and it is only those in authority who are in a position to establish whether these facts are true.  We heard about these stories in the past but it seems that very little action was taken in regard to them because I am not aware of any prosecutions that ensured of people who absconded illegally with funds from here in this fashion.  Despite the fact that no prosecutions were taken and that no reports of success in this area or even an attempt to catch up with these people has been recorded, we have assurances from Minister after Minister and from Government backbenchers that millions &mdash; and perhaps billions &mdash; of pounds would be recouped.  If all that money is to be recouped I would pose the question, how did it leave here in the first instance?  That whole area has to be examined.</P>
    <P>How can the Minister say with such <Col N="1635" /> confidence that huge sums of money have been taken illegally out of this country? If he knew that officially what action did he take in regard to it?  If Customs and Excise knew that officially, what action were they taking in this regard?  If the Revenue Commissioners knew about this what action were they taking?  What was the public prosecutor doing?  What were the Garda authorities doing?  What were the law enforcement authorities of this State doing in this regard?  We are now being told that stories concerning the people who took off with this money are not just hearsay, that they are true.  A few hundred or a few thousand pounds become hundreds of thousands and tens of thousands become millions of pounds. We are being assured now by Ministers that the amounts of money are vast.  That means that something is rotten in the State of Denmark and in the State of Ireland.  It is something that would cause one to seriously worry about where we are going and what we are doing.</P>
    <P>There is an obligation on the State to give an assurance to taxpayers that the burden of tax will be shared equitably by all sections here and that Finance Bills, when they are introduced, will adhere to that principle and Governments will not seek to breach that principle in any proposal they bring forward.  My colleague, Deputy Michael McDowell, dealt earlier with the whole constitutional aspect of what is proposed, the equity in the tax system and whether that is being maintained in regard to these proposals.</P>
    <P>It is not too late for the Minister to change this proposal.  As somebody who has held him in high respect and worked closely with him over the past three and a half years we were in office, and previously in this House, I ask the Minister to seriously consider whether he should proceed with this proposal.  My opinion is that the Minister's heart is not in this measure.  He does not believe in the philosophy behind it.  This is &ldquo;funny money&rdquo; and it obviously was a factor that was unfortunately taken into account when the final figures were being prepared for the budget this year.  There were pressures <Col N="1636" /> due to the upset in the international currency market.  Much doubt existed at the time the Minister had to finalise the figures.  This proposal may have seemed to be an easy source of extra revenue to get over the hump where additional money would be required.</P>
    <P>The Minister has already made a commitment in regard to resources to the Exchequer coming from the sale of State assets.  That was an interesting proposal, a round figure of approximately £150 million has been put on it by the Government. That is interesting from my point of view and the point of view of my party when one considers the stand that the Minister's partners in Government took in regard to the sale of State assets during the election campaign and how quickly they have cast aside their philosophy and their ideology in that regard.  It adds to the general confusion among the public in regard to what is happening in politics today.  Who can they believe or trust?  Do politicans ever mean what they say or do they make statements to suit the moment and do not really care whether those statements are true?  That attitude adds to the malaise that is affecting this country and which is bringing people in public life more and more into dispute and will bring the whole country into disrepute.</P>
    <P>As somebody who has spent the last week or ten days in a country which has suffered grieviously from this type of philosophy as seen in the extreme under a dictatorship and the genocidal activities of the Khmer Rouge under Pol Pot, I have seen the extreme of extremism.  I am concerned that we will not continue to maintain our high levels of integrity and apply the highest standards to the decision making process in Government and to public life in this country.  I would abhor any attempt to reduce those standards. That is where I see this measure leading.  It does not take much time to be on the slippery slope before one finds that one is hurtling down a very dangerous route which will affect much of what people have worked to build up in this country.</P>
    <P>My party spokesperson has put our case in great detail.  My party in general <Col N="1637" /> has outlined our sincerely held fears regarding this matter and from my own knowledge of Government, I know that there cannot be wholehearted support for this proposal at a high level in the Civil Service because of the serious objections that were raised to these kind of suggestions in the past concerning their detrimental effect and in view of the Minister's previous stand in regard to suggestions of this kind and the stand of the former leader of the Fianna Fáil Party.  But the philosophy and the ideology has changed under Albert Reynolds' leadership and the backbench sheep in the Fianna Fáil Party are prepared to march in and support whatever is put in front of them by their Front Bench who decide these issues behind closed doors.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1638" /> Yesterday a debate on amendment I started at about 4.45 p.m. and I waited for about 20 minutes to hear the Minister's response.  However, after half an hour I realised the debate would go on at length.  The Ceann Comhairle was a little harsh on the first two speakers &mdash; Deputies Cox and Rabbitte &mdash; telling them to keep to the point, but he seems to have become tired because a few speakers whom I heard on the monitor today wandered all over the place, as perhaps I am doing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quill earlier used the word &ldquo;scandal&rdquo;.  As a newcomer, I believe the scandal is that the last two days have been wasted.  I was very impressed last week with the work of the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs when dealing with the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill, particularly that of the main spokesman.  Like other Members, I nipped in and out, attending the odd session.  Yesterday and today was to be a continuation of that debate, dealing with amendments that were not dealt with last week.  I am rather amazed at the way time is being spent here because there are 178 amendments listed and we are still on No. 1.  Perhaps I am learning.  I am not necessarily the judge of these matters.</P>
    <P>I do not know who will gain from this amnesty and I cannot relate to these people in any way.  I certainly cannot relate to the stories one hears and the examples given from the other side.  I have always been on PAYE so I never had the chance to fiddle the system.  I would like to think that if the opportunity arose I would resist it, but we are all potential fallers.  However, the opportunity never arose for me so I cannot hold myself up as a shining light.</P>
    <P>Earlier today Deputies Harney and McDowell said they had spoken to people last weekend who would gain from the amnesty or perhaps they were referring to advisers of these people.  The Progressive Democrats represent people who might gain from this amnesty more so than do I or the party I represent.  That party should go easy on these people because they might be stepping on the <Col N="1639" /> toes of their own supporters.  We are all prisoners of our past.  Much of what I heard since yesterday evening I disregard. Deputy Molloy spoke about pensioners, and one person's opinion is as good as that of another, but certainly before I became a Member of this House I would not have regarded the Progressive Democrats as the party that represents the needs of pensioners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit I have a lot to learn and I could be wrong, but we all have our perceptions and images, and I am not wrong all the time.  I am interested in finding out who all these people are who will benefit from the amnesty &mdash; we will find out in the weeks and months to come.  I have a simple philosophy, that we have no dealings with tax evaders, but people who have money stacked away abroad should be encouraged to bring it back.  If a reasonable deal is made with them perhaps we can all benefit in future. Once the money is declared and these people are sucked into the system they will not be able to quickly opt out again.</P>
      <P>I have been amazed at the tactics adopted here.  If the debate had been wound up 22 hours ago and we heard the Minister's reply, other amendments could have been dealt with.  Having been so impressed with last week's Committee, I am somewhat depressed at what has gone on since yesterday evening.  It seems a scandalous waste of time, with many speakers trying to drag out the debate. Last week the Committee was really to the point and was impressive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like everyone else I am waiting to hear what the Minister has to say and what will be said over the next couple of weeks when the detail of this proposal is published. There is anger outside, but the extent of that anger has been hyped up. I do not think it will last as long as some people believe.  For the last week the argument has been all one way, with <Col N="1640" /> nobody putting forward the good points whatever they may be.  I hope that after the amnesty the Revenue Commissioners will be given extra resources to carry out their work.  It has been said that if Revenue had been given extra resources over the years they would have caught many of these people anyway.  In last year's Finance Bill the Revenue Commissioners were given extra powers but the Minister was criticised by vested groups outside and political parties inside the House who felt it was a disgrace that powers were being given to hassle people.  Deputies are today contradicting many of the things they said 12 months ago.  I hope that extra resources and powers will be given to the Revenue Commissioners so that they will follow the people who, as acknowledged earlier by the Progressive Democrats, may not choose to take it up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the point made by Deputy Ahern in relation to the very long contributions being made on this amendment, in view of the fact that there are so many other amendments to be dealt with.  I do not intend to make a prolonged contribution on this subject except to say that I am very concerned about it.  I do not think the Government has teased out all the implications of the amnesty or understands what tangible benefit is to be achieved by it.  I would like the Minister to tell us exactly what is the objective of the Government in proposing this amnesty.  Why is it proposing that people who have cheated the system are to be rewarded by a rate of tax which is as little as one-third of the rate paid by taxpayers who have always paid their taxes?  What is the <i>rationale</i> for that? Will there be some quantifiable, longlasting benefit to the economy from such generosity on the part of the Government towards people who, by definition, are tax evaders?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suspect that there are two explanations for this proposal, neither of which relates to sound economics.  The first explanation is a propensity within the Fianna Fáil Party, particularly since the sixties, to associate with the tax evader <Col N="1641" /> One of the major problems of the Fianna Fáil Party in the past 30 years is that it has identified with the person who wants to rig the planning permission, who wants to evade taxes, the law breaker and the wrongdoer.  Fianna Fáil and such people are soulmates.  That is what the electorate has identified in Fianna Fáil and it is why Fianna Fáil has successively failed to achieve an overall majority in the past six years.  Here is another expresson of that affinity in this proposal to reward tax evaders, the soulmates of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>An explanation, and the only possible explanation for the Labour Party agreeing to support this proposal, is a tendency in that party to believe that there are easy ways of getting our economy right, getting rid of our budget deficit and reducing our debt burden.  There are no easy options.  This proposal is yet another form of escapism, an effort to try to escape the realities of the arithmetic.  The Government parties, not being able to realistically face up to issues, have sought some imaginary or fanciful basket of money.  This is what we have here.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party in Government &mdash; I can testify to this because I served in Government with it over a six year period &mdash; always fails to face up to the issue. They are afraid to take a stand on the hard issue.  They are a &ldquo;softly, softly&rdquo; party.  That policy has had disastrous long term consequences for our economy, our budget deficit, our national debt and, indeed, for employment.  The Labour Party consists of weaklings when it comes to economic issues.  Here is more evidence of Labour seeking out illusory soft options.  There is not any other possible explanation for Labour supporting a proposal to compensate people who have broken the law by evading tax by the imposition of a very low rate of tax compared to the amount paid by compulsion each week by the PAYE sector.  There is no other possible explanation for the Labour Party's position, and this is the sort of gombeenism with which Fianna Fáil naturally and instinctively identifies.</P>
    <P>Because the pros and cons of this matter have not been seriously gone into <Col N="1642" /> by the Government, and it does not have the significant support of either the Revenue Commissioners or the Department of Finance, the Minister should delete this proposal from the Bill, even if it means having to introduce a second Finance Bill later in the year after the matter has been teased out in greater detail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>What strikes me is the political opportunism involved in using this amendment, when all the other provisions in the Bill should be discussed on Report Stage.  This proposal will be discussed at a later stage after the Bill is enacted.</P>
      <P>Every person agrees that Irish people have money invested outside the country. Not one Member who contributed to the debate denied that this money is invested abroad.  What Members are objecting to is the money coming back into the country. In 1974 when the introduction of a wealth tax was mooted a great deal of money was deposited outside the country. The amount of money invested outside the country is, to some extent, a matter of speculation, but if that is the case we must consider how to encourage people to invest it here so that it can be used for the benefit of our people, particularly the unemployed.  There are 300,000 people unemployed and if that money comes back into the country, it has to do some good for our economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I criticise some Members, and <i>The Irish Times</i>, who said there is no cash flow problem in our economy.  I have heard Opposition Deputies, including Deputy O'Malley last night, say there is no cash flow problem.  We have the lowest consumer spending in the European Community because nothing is moving.  Property is not being bought because people have not got the money. This proposal relates to money invested outside the country pre-1974 by people who worked on five, six and seven month contracts in foreign, unattractive countries and did not bring the money back with them because of our tax system.  We must consider also the position of people who inherited money from abroad. Those are the three main cases I have <Col N="1643" /> come across over recent years.  People who inherited money would pay an enormous amount of tax under this system.</P>
    <P>It is the hypocrisy among some of the political parties today that is sickening me.  Last night Deputy O'Malley referred to both Deputy Kemmy and me in racing parlance, that between us we had fathered a jennet.  His knowledge of racing is not good, and certainly his knowledge of horse breeding is not expert.  It is hypocritical of him to condemn people in that most self-righteous manner that has become the altar mat of the Progressive Democrats, when he yesterday was castigated by the chairman of Arramara Teoranta, for asking that person to deal with a company that had been struck off the register.  There was silence at that committee meeting yesterday when the chairman felt he had to reply in that fashion.  This level of hypocrisy in this House gives me a pain. I have been a Member for almost 25 years and I listened to some of the contributions with aggravated pain.  The Members I am complaining about are so self-righteous in their own position.  They wanted more cuts in social welfare than any previous Government.  This is hypocrisy.</P>
    <P>I do not hear any demands by the Opposition for an inquiry into why a judge was not prosecuted after a member of the Garda Síochána had to be called when he tried to enter a bar illegally after hours.  If a Member of this House was involved I suspect he would have been prosecuted, and the case given wide publicity.</P>
    <P>Huge penalties will be imposed on people who ignore the once-off amnesty. I would advocate that they get jail sentences. One of the things we could do with the tax is use it as capital for buildings for the less well off people in our society and particularly for the mentally handicapped.  I am involved in that area. I would love to see the money used in those areas as a once-off so that the PAYE taxpayer &mdash; I have been one since I was 17 years of age &mdash; would not have to pay for it in future years.  If this money <Col N="1644" /> comes in it should be invested in the economy, because at present we are leaving it outside the economy so that other people and other economies can gain from it.</P>
    <P>Some of the speakers on the Opposition benches are far removed from reality to think that the banks have been cute over the years and that they have foreign accounts registered under foreign addresses for Irish people living here now.  Every politician knows that is happening. The high minded morality issues they are raising here are not an issue, because what we need in this country is capital investment.  There are people who presume that this does not happen.  Of course we need urgently to tighten up our tax system and improve it.  Thousands of pounds are being spent through the IDA to create jobs.  If we get this money in it should be used not only for the benefit of the economy but in particular for investment.</P>
    <P>I have been persuaded, pushed and bullied by people on certain social issues. They say that this is the reality nowadays, the accepted thing, you have to vote for it whether you like it or not.  But here reality leaves some of these people.  I hope Deputy Cox is not getting hot under the collar on any issue.</P>

      <P>This is not a case of trying to reward those who have failed to pay their taxes or skimmed money off, but concerns particularly those who have earned or inherited money outside this country.  That money is benefiting other economies, not our economy.  There is a need for a cash flow and for investment in this country.  Let us get that money in. In that way we can help the ordinary taxpayer by not having to look to them for capital moneys next year.  This amnesty will mean that nobody ever again can have an account outside this <Col N="1646" /> country without the fear of stringent jail terms being imposed on them if they do not avail of this once-off opportunity to benefit not only those whom they have offended in the past but those from whom they will secure less taxation in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I was interested in the last speaker's contribution.  If he is saying that it is self-righteous and high-minded to want to protect the integrity of our taxation system, then I am happy to be high-minded and self-righteous.</P>
      <P>One of the things that has become evident over the last 24 hours debate on this issue is that there is a certain truth in Irish life, and it is this.  If you are a PAYE taxpayer, you will never be a wealthy person.  With an ever-increasing population dependent on the taxpayer, it is all the more important for this State to put in place an equitable tax system.  Part of the pedigree, of the political DNA, of my party, the Progressive Democrats, is that we have from the beginning sought to introduce tax reform to improve and make more equitable the tax system.  We had some achievement in Government. Unfortunately, that has been rolled back since the formation of this Government, particularly with the imposition of the new 1 per cent income levy and the probate tax.  Those taxes are not welcomed by a sector of the population who must pay for everything through the nose and who are gradually becoming discontented. That will be the pattern of politics over the next ten years.  PAYE taxpayers will be so sick and tired of paying for everything and getting nothing in return that the nature of Irish politics will change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard already from Deputy Ahern that he found it extraordinary that the Progressive Democrats should be speaking out for the old age pensioner.  I do not find anything extraordinary about that.  My parents are old age pensioners. The parents of many of our Deputies are old age pensioners.  I cannot see why we should have this reputation for being the hard-edged, hard-nosed party of fiscal <Col N="1647" /> rectitude with no human face at all.  We hope to change that.</P>
    <P>In supporting this amendment the Opposition parties have been given the opportunity in this House to debate this issue.  The reason this parliamentary device has been quite legitimately used is because there was no other opportunity. This proposed tax amnesty was not contained in a manifesto; it was not in the budget; it was not in the Finance Bill.  It was going to be wheeled through.  That was unacceptable and it was legitimate to raise the issue in this way by positively putting it in as an amendment.  I congratulate Deputy Cox on that.</P>
    <P>One of the issues that has arisen in the course of this debate concerns the overall cynicism about politics.  It is at a worryingly high level and has to be stemmed, because it goes to the root of democracy and of belief in the system of democracy. It has been said by other speakers that democracy is a very fragile thing.  Deputy Molloy was one who mentioned it.  If we undermine that sense of fair play, particularly in our taxation system, we are undermining the core of democracy which gives people a reason for going out to work in the mornings.  The people who through their taxation bear the brunt of meeting the cost of public services must be encouraged to continue to pay their taxes.  They have no choice.  Most of us pay our taxes through direct debit. Undoubtedly taxpayers will feel an element of fatigue if they see that those who have dodged the tax system will now be given an amnesty and will have to pay only 15 per cent flat rate on the amount of money by which they have defrauded the State.</P>
    <P>In the past I expressed concern in this House that sooner or later low to middle income families would find that they were a disadvantaged group in society.  This point was highlighted recently in a debate I had with the Minister for Education when a policy decision to build a post-primary school in Knocklyon in my constituency was reversed.  The reason given for this reversal was that capital for projects was to be diverted towards schools <Col N="1648" /> in disadvantaged areas.  While that is worthy a balance has to be struck.  The fact is that Knocklyon, which has the largest primary school in the country, has no post-primary school.  Because that community is deemed to be comprised of middle income families by the present Minister for Education, it is not going to get a school.  In other words, schools are going to be means-tested.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party has to strike a balance. I have said before that during the general election campaign the Labour Party tried to broaden their appeal and successfully wooed middle-income families. They managed to do this by adopting a soft focus election manifesto. Indeed, if I recall correctly, it was not even called a manifesto because they felt this word conjured up images of socialism. They spoke about the need to bring justice back into politics and economics and about ethics.  These words have been debased by the Labour Party before and since the election.</P>
    <P>As has been mentioned, people are incensed by this particular issue.  I have received letters written on Basildon Bond notepaper from unsophisticated people who work in kitchens and dining rooms and so on, and who possibly have never been in touch with their TDs before. They are writing to say:</P>
    <P>I must object strongly to this tax amnesty.  I have never written to my TD before.  I paid my tax all my life and here these people are going to get away scot free.  In the early seventies I purchased a small plot of land in County Sligo for £350.  The Revenue Commissioners asked me to explain where I got the £350 and I was obliged, quite rightly, to show them my savings account.  The same law should apply to all of us.</P>
    <P>These are fair-minded people; they are not begrudgers.  They pay their taxes; get up in the morning and go to work; pay their rent; subsidise their children's education in the hope that they will do well. All they want is equity and a sense of fair play in this democracy.  They are not arguing for anything more than that.  If <Col N="1649" /> that is high-mindedness and selfrighteousness, I am delighted to be self-righteous on this issue.</P>
    <P>Pensioners caught in the tax net are paying high taxes on their pensions and will be paying the 1 per cent levy while single mothers get no tax relief for rent or for child minding services with the result that they would be better off if they stayed home and drew the single parent's allowance.  This eats into their confidence in complying with the tax system.  The central issue is that people who comply with the tax code and do everything they are obliged to do under the law should not be penalised under our tax system. They have a right to be angry when they see people who have dodged the tax system being facilitated.  We are now going to discriminate in favour of those who have broken the law.  This is not right and it is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I am not an economist but I am not sure that this amnesty, even if it was morally acceptable, will work.  The thinking behind it is morally bankrupt and points to a poverty of thought in Irish politics.  This low level thought process which goes into running our economy has kept many people who would normally have an interest in politics out of politics. The amnesty has not been thought through, was hastily conceived and badly presented to this House.  I welcome the opportunity to express my opposition to it based on the representations I have received from ordinary members of the public who live in the Dubin South constituency. They are outraged at this proposed amnesty.</P>
    <P>I am not playing party politics.  I was accused earlier of wasting time but I am here to express the views of the little man and woman.  Deputy McManus mentioned earlier that it is only little people who pay tax.  That is true; but they are not small in number.  However, the number is getting smaller all the time by virtue of the fact that they are being driven into the ground by a penal tax system.  They believe that what they have to say does not count.  I am perfectly happy, therefore, to be self-righteous and high-minded on this issue.</P>

      <Col N="1650" /> As we speak, the book about Deputy Spring and the Labour Party is being launched in a house near here.  It is entitled <i>Spring and the Labour Party</i> by Stephen Collins.  However, there is a paragraph missing which relates to the concept of the Labour Party supporting and endorsing a tax amnesty for tax cheats.  Perhaps Tim Ryan in his forth coming book will deal with that sad scen ario in <i>The Tale of the Labour Party.</i></P>

      <P>I should say at the outset that I thought Deputy O'Donnell's contribution was well structured and no so high-minded.  Like an after dinner speech, I would like to say &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; to a number of Deputies.  This side of the House is grateful to Deputy Yates for his contribution.  It was much appreciated. However, it was unfair not to inform John, but, unfortunately, nobody loves Johnny any more and, certainly, nobody tells him anything any more.</P>

      <P>I also thank Deputy Quill who, unfortunately, is not present and who, in her apoplectic state, indicated that I should contribute to this debate for getting me out of my seat.  I actually thought she had seen a vision.  If she is chasing that vision over the River Lee I certainly want to be part of it.</P>
      <P>One could adopt one of two approaches to this debate.  One could take the pragmatic view or adopt the high moral tone adopted by many speakers on the Progressive Democrats benches and duplicated on the Fine Gael benches or be opportunistic like the speakers on the Democratic Left benches.  I am sensible enough to realise that there are people who have qualms about this amnesty.  It is fair to say that people in the PAYE sector, who have been paying taxes all their lives not by choice but because they have been forced to do so, will ask if it is fair that people who have laundered money should be charged 15 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would take the pragmatic view because this money is available.  We are <Col N="1651" /> talking here about sums in the region of £2 to £3 billion.  The question that each and every Member of this House must ask himself is what should we do?  Should we allow people to stash this money away in another country which will reap the benefits?  It is fair to say that realism suggests that it is incumbent on any Government to look at ways in which money can be attracted back into the country and having done so, and having given people the opportunity to repatriate it on a once off basis say, &ldquo;Halt.  The door is now closed, this is the end of it and should it happen again the penalties will be extremely severe&rdquo;.  The Government has put together a programme of action for the economy and it is incumbent on it to look at every avenue whereby it can obtain resources which are necessary to implement the programme.</P>
    <P>I listened with great interest to the debate today, particularly to Deputy Gilmore, whom I thought made an excellent case for the amnesty.  He recited a litany of all the things we should be doing in this economy, had we the resources. Who is to say what can be done with the money from a successful amnesty?  There are 300,000 people unemployed and it behoves the Government to come up with bold and adventurous measures. The Government is quite right to take this opportunity if it sees it as being in the best interests of the 300,000 people who are unemployed.</P>
    <P>If even £1 billion out of the £3 billion that is talked about is repatriated we are then talking about £150 million becoming available to the Exchequer.  During the Debate on the Finance Bill Members said that the 1 per cent levy was anti-jobs. The levy will net something like £120 million.  The amnesty offers the possibility that that levy could be wiped out at one fell swoop.  This anti-jobs measure that the Opposition have been telling us about could be eradicated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is quite right in bringing in this legislation. At the time of the last amnesty quite a number of people raised their voices against it but when it was successful the number of people who wanted to be associated with such a good idea was extraordinary.  The amnesty gives rise to fundamental quesions.  How did money leave the jurisdiction?  Who was involved?  Why were the regulations that are in place inadequate?  Why could this not be nipped in the bud?  Therefore, a total overview must be taken of the regulations that are in place.</P>
      <P>At the end of the day the Minister has one chance to make sure that the people who will be given the opportunity to repatriate this money have only one opportunity to do so and should they decide to leave it outside the jurisdiction that they will be caught, and will suffer severe penalties.  I would agree with Deputy Davern on this &mdash; jail is certainly a worthy sentence in that case.</P>
      <P>I understand the misgivings about the amnesty but if this amnesty brings in the amount of money we are hoping it will bring in, it affords us the opportunity to generate additional activity in this economy, for which the unemployed will certainly thank the Government and the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief because I know everybody is anxious to hear the wisdom that emanated from the Cabinet meeting today and to know how real the bellicose noises on the various news bulletins in relation to prison sentences are.  One thing I notice in relation to deterrents stitched into law, is that the penalty is a fine or a prison sentence.  It will be very interesting to learn when the Minister shortly spells out the actual revised terms of the new amnesty, whether this will be an either or situation, that the Government is really serious, either collectively or individually as political parties, in finally deterring the outflow of finance and ill-gotten goods and gains from this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle of an amnesty is bad. The principle of too many amnesties is <Col N="1653" /> damaging.  It undermines the credibility of the tax system.  Frequent amnesties allow people to budget in the expectation that there will be another amnesty and that if they hold out long enough again, because of financial pressures, and the need to satisfy the spending Department, there will be another amnesty in order to claw back some badly needed revenue into the economy as an interim measure. It is quite obvious that at the eleventh hour the Government has now seen the light in terms of the degree of public odium to one law for the golden circle and another law for ordinary John citizen who is trying his best to pay his taxes, educate his children, have enough money to pay the doctor and meet the day-to-day running costs of the family.  Therefore the whole principle is bad and I have pleasure in supporting the Progressive Democrats amendment.</P>
    <P>From where did the pressure for this amnesty come?  It did not figure in the Programme for Government.  There is a section in the Programme for Government on taxation measures, the need for taxation of money abroad and so on.  Yet there was absolutely no intimation of it five months ago when the Minister was one of the key plenipotentiaries in negotiating the Programme for Government. This proposal did not figure either in the broader landscape or in the much more narrowly focused landscape.  It is quite obvious that something happened in the meantime and that the pressure came from some quarter.</P>
    <P>One of the features of our culture is that an incestuous business community has developed.  I am not tarring the entire business community.  An elite business culture has grown up which is dominated by a select number of people, known as the &ldquo;golden circle&rdquo;.  These people, in many cases, are before the courts and tribunals now.  It is ironic that the heads of building societies, the heads of stockbroking firms, the heads of some of the top 20 companies, are the subject of various tribunals and inquiries in relation to their business practices.  In some cases these are the people who have been asked to relinquish their positions as nominated <Col N="1654" /> executives on semi-State bodies.  It is ironic that a system operating at top level in business is that one can buy something for £6 million and sell it, within a matter of days for £9 million, without a single penny ever changing hands.  There is something fundamentally wrong when that can happen.  That is happening on an ongoing basis.  There is also something fundamentally wrong when some of the top business people can be described as being nothing other than dressed up three card trick men.  The people who involve themselves in these kinds of shady deals can buy their way out by employing expertise.</P>
    <P>We have grown up in this country with a new coinage and phraseology that is very much epitomised by the phrase &ldquo;working the system&rdquo;, in other words, it is legitimate.  You find the loophole, you hire a lawyer, an accountant, an adviser, a manager and then you go for it.  That is called &ldquo;working the system&rdquo;.  Then on the other hand there are ordinary hard grafting business people.  For example somebody came to me about seven or eight weeks ago and said:</P>
    <P>I'm pulling down the blinds.  I'm turning off the lights and I'm calling it a day because I cannot survive.  The reason I cannot survive is because my rates have trebled from £7 to £21 because I bought a little freezer, I put in fluorescent lights and I moved the shelving around.  My rates have gone from £269 to over £800.</P>
    <P>The other reason was that she was penalised and policed out of business.  She said there are 14 State inspectors who can call to police her little shop.  These are the rate collector, the revenue collector, the fire officer, the VAT inspector, the income tax inspector, the environmental health officer, the safety and welfare officer, the wages inspector, the fish inspector, a potato inspector, a vegetable inspector and an egg inspector, all of whom would earn, I suppose, between £20,000 and £25,000.  That woman is now out of business.  The State is no longer getting the revenue and she is being paid a widow's pension of £65 per week.  Those <Col N="1655" /> are the kinds of crazy, punitive measures we have against somebody who is trying to eke out a living and keep the social fabric of life together in towns and villages.</P>
    <P>I came across another case recently of somebody who happened to be away for a two-month period and missed paying his VAT.  He has been penalised for £280 VAT.  He was visited almost immediately by the revenue sheriff who told him that if he did not pay up immediately he would clear the shelf.  I do not blame that individual for his reflex reaction when he defied the revenue sheriff's agent and said, &ldquo;If you put a foot across that threshold I will take the head off your shoulders&rdquo;. On the one hand he sees shady dealing at top level and then the covert defence of those people by handing them the kind of lifeline that this amnesty represents. This is the kind of enterprise culture that the former Minister for Education, Deputy Séamus Brennan, has integrated as a fundamental part of the Green Paper on Education and which we are supposed to inculcate into school children, both at secondary and primary level.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quill used a very colourful phrase &mdash; `the fish rotting from the head down' &mdash; when she described the stand of the Labour Party.  I read a letter recently in the <i>Irish Independent</i> from a disenchanted Labour supporter, one of the Dublin 4 people, who thought he had at last discovered the great crusading saviour of Irish society in the person of the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring.  It is said that wilted lilies smell more foul than weeds &mdash; that is very much the case in relation to the Labour Party.  Their performance has been abysmal.  Deputy Kemmy and the other hod carrier on the Labour side, Deputy Ferris, who defending the posture of the Labour Party on various matters that go to the very core of what the Labour Party is about, test the very nerve of even the most resilient traditional Labour supporter, let alone the Johnny-come-latelies and the hitch <Col N="1656" /> hikers who jumped on the Labour bandwagon on the last occasion.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to support this amendment. I appeal to the Minister to support this measure which goes to the heart of what Irish society is about.</P>
    <P>One of the ironies of the Irish economy is the great mystery as to why, having got the nuts and bolts together, we are still not performing.  We were told that we would find the promised land if we got our interest rates down.  It was the Labour/Fine Gael Coalition of 1983-87 that began the slow grind of getting interest rates down and reducing our inflation rate from 21 per cent to 3 per cent.  We have had a surplus in our balance of trade every year since 1984.  Yet the economy is not performing.  The reason is that the leaders in this country are controlled and manipulated by a group of wealthy people &mdash; the power brokers who are being allowed to abuse their position.  Every type of loophole open to them has been exploited and the amnesty is being advocated because of closed eyes on the part of officialdom, to white collar crime over a period.  If we are not careful, with 300,000 people out of work, at some stage the national nerve will snap and these people will take to the streets.  They now have leadership, other than trade union leadership which they feel has reneged on them and betrayed them.  I am convinced that that first march will put in the ha'penny place the initial civil rights march in the North. If one adds to that the PAYE sector who are carrying the can by paying 88 per cent of the tax burden, then we have the chemistry for social upheaval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>The positive aspects of the Finance Bill have obviously been shunted into a siding in a debate which has been dominated by the tax amnesty.  Probably, consecutive Ministers for Finance during the past 20 years have foreseen the possibility that such an amnesty can take back, if the facilities are put in place, funds that went abroad for a whole variety of reasons.  We should stop the political posturing and the hypocrisy of the past number of days.  All I can think of in this <Col N="1657" /> respect is the number of urgent capital projects I want to see in my constituency. The only way they can be undertaken is by approval from various Government Departments.</P>
      <P>If extra revenue is to be made available to the Exchequer as a result of the amnesty, we have to look objectively at the incompetent system that has allowed taxes to be avoided over a lengthy period. The justification &mdash; if there is such a thing &mdash; is the major transfer of resources into Exchequer funds from the previous amnesty.  In that case a projected £30 million grew to close on £500 million. A substantial part of that amount was collectable in any case.  Those who have avoided paying tax through legal or illegal tax schemes over a lengthy period now have funds off shore.  When they come back they will have to pay a minimum of 15 per cent.  DIRT tax will be payable on deposits and the funds will be available within the system.  The wrongdoing in the avoidance of tax in the first place cannot be redressed other than by this mechanism.  Many people have put funds in off shore accounts to try to regularise them.  If the tax regime of previous years which allowed transfer of resources and tax avoidance is to be closed forever, there is justifiable merit in considering the proposal.</P>
      <P>When Deputy Ivan Yates was asked to write his article in the <i>Irish Press</i> it was very clear that he thought there was some merit in considering this matter.  If we get 50 per cent more than his projected 10 per cent I do not see how his attitude is other than political hypocrisy.</P>
      <P>Deputy Michael McDowell called for all types of tax changes in an effort to gain a few political points when the Progressive Democrats shared Government with my party.  Whatever was in the budget was thanks to the great foresight of Deputy Michael McDowell as chairman of the Progressive Democrats who was not a Member of the House at the time.  The reality falls short of the hype. The competence of accountants and the legal framework allowed people to avoid paying tax, particularly capital gains tax, and to transfer funds offshore.</P>

      <Col N="1658" /> If that money were kept here and the total percentages due to the State paid, there would have been a higher take for the Exchequer, but the system has allowed this situation to develop.  We could go the mediocre road and do nothing.  We could decide not to go forward with the tax amnesty, but surely the Exchequer will benefit from this.  The figures suggested are an estimate.  I do not know how people arrive at conclusions as to the amount; we were so wide of the mark on the last occasion.</P>
    <P>It may be a good, clever political formula to highlight the plight of those in the PAYE sector who are crippled by tax.  Every Member is in the PAYE sector and that is often forgotten in discussions and interviews.  The political system, it is now being said, appears to be providing some sort of safe haven for people who are not in the PAYE sector.  All Members agree that everybody should pay the same.  When ordinary tax payers had to make half-yearly returns a great deal of form filling was involved and information sought about dependants and so forth. The licensing trade was up in arms twelve months ago about the tightening up of the collection of taxes.  Good, progressive and fair tax systems were gradually brought in to cover various other sectors such as the electrical goods sector and areas of the black economy associated with the building industry.  If in efforts to bring about equity in the tax code, we can get some additional funds into the Exchequer, then this amnesty will stand the test.</P>

      <P>From the point of view of the Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, the tax amnesty is not a good idea.  It indicates a bankruptcy of ideas from the Government side on economic questions. It indicates desperation more than policy and the people with money deposited abroad will probably be ridiculed for bringing it home and trying to come clean after years of cheating.  I do not think it will be very attractive to them to bring the money home when they are earning good interest on it overseas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe it will create jobs <Col N="1659" /> either.  There is certainly a great deal of money in savings and financial institutions are trying to give money away by way of loans.  I cannot see what difference there will be in terms of job creation if this money is brought back.  It is more evocative of special flights coming into Dublin Airport at Christmas time with bags of money instead of emigrants or Walter Raleigh, like a pirate from overseas, coming back with the hoards from colonial countries, than of any kind of economic sense.</P>
    <P>Why call this a final amnesty?  Does that mean that the Government will resign if the scheme does not work out? The word &ldquo;final&rdquo; is quite meaningful there.</P>
    <P>We need to do something, as Deputy Lawlor said and, rather than putting all our eggs into this particular bankrupt basket, we should be encouraging much more work-sharing.  Many Members hold down two jobs or more and we should be setting an example in regard to creating more employment.  The bus strike seems to indicate that public transport does not have the support of the Government but if it did, there is much employment potential in that area.  Agriculture is becoming less labour intensive daily and we are losing jobs there.  It is no solution to look outside the country for employment creation when many of the solutions can be found here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will endeavour, in the time available to me, to cover a fraction of the issues that have been raised over the past 26 hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, I would like to make a point I made yesterday to your office, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  Since the establishment of this House it has been the tradition for the Minister to speak only once on the Finance Bill.  The order of the day is that the Opposition Finance spokespeople, who are usually the only people present, speak and then the Minister replies, as the proposer of the motion.  That is the system that has operated since the twenties.  Deputy O'Malley was correct on this point in relation to <Col N="1660" /> other Bills, but in relation to the Finance Bill the Minister has only one opportunity to speak.  It would be meaningless if it were dealt with in any other way.</P>
    <P>This amendment has been debated for 26 hours and it would be a waste of time that I do not have to argue about the fact that the debate went ahead.  However, in so far as this amendment prohibits the Revenue Commissioners from remitting income tax, it is not relevant.  At present the Revenue Commissioners have no such powers and they do not remit established income tax liabilities.  Therefore what we have been talking about here for the last 26 hours is irrelevant to the present position.  I patiently listened to all that was said.  Under the present arrangements where compromise settlements are involved and where the tax liability is established, the powers to remit relate only to penalties on interest. The proposed amendment is not relevant in the context of the present Bill and it would have no effect whatsoever in relation to the current laws and practice. What the Deputy concerned obviously wanted &mdash; and succeeded in getting &mdash; was a debate on something that is proposed and in the context of our present position that was out of order.  I would make the point &mdash; because it is important &mdash; that there is no provision in the Bill for an amnesty.  Deputy Cox's amendment is totally new; it was not discussed on Second Stage&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Yates tabled an amendment on Committee Stage which he did not move.  He indicated that he did not intend to do so and that amendment was not discussed, nor was it referred to or permission asked to refer to it.  Deputy Cox's amendment could not be said to relate to Deputy Yates' amendment because it is the direct opposite.  Deputy Cox did not give any indication on Committee Stage <Col N="1661" /> of his intention to submit an amendment on an amnesty.  I checked this the night before last with people who have been involved in dealing with Bills for many decades, and was told that if Deputies are allowed to introduce new amendments on Report Stage it will merely turn Report Stage into a Second Stage debate. The Chair successfully did that for the past 26 hours.  We are not aware of any previous examples where Opposition amendments were accepted unannounced on Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had no decision from the Chair on that matter. I will leave it at that but I would like the position clarified because it is a new ruling in the context of rulings of the Chair in the past 30 or 40 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of proposals for what has been colloqually called a &ldquo;hot money&rdquo; amnesty have featured in media speculation for some years now.  They have all been based on the premise that there is a large amount of money in evaded taxes and undeclared income salted away in accounts and assets abroad.  I must stress that there are no reliable estimates available of the amount involved, despite those who say that it could be of the order <Col N="1662" /> of £1 billion or £2 billion.  Those figures have been mentioned by the commentators and by some people who may have knowledge, but it is difficult to know.  It is the nature of such funds that any figures must be speculative and we should be clear on that in this debate.</P>
    <P>The main argument in favour of a new amnesty has been that, given appropriate incentives, a proportion of this money would be attracted back home.  A variety of beneficial effects have been suggested and many of those have been debated at length in this debate.  For example, the revenue take for the Exchequer, the improvement of external reserves, the release of moribund funds for productive use an improved flow of funds to the economy which could be used to assist PAYE taxpayers through many of the schemes in health, education and welfare and generally developing capital expenditure schemes.  The last four speakers referred to capital expenditure schemes and how we could use the money from those schemes for hospitals, homes for the mentally handicapped and for many projects where the funding would be required on a once-off basis.</P>
    <P>I will state the Government's objectives. The first is to secure some tax on funds which are not declared and whose evasion is likely to be difficult to detect at this stage.  Second, to make possible the use of undeclared funds abroad or dormant at home &mdash; it is not possible to distinguish between those funds &mdash; for the general economic benefit and for assisting the PAYE compliant taxpayer generally.  Third, to give a final chance to those who have failed to meet their obligations in the past to regularise their tax affairs.  I refer to people who would have had an opportunity in 1988 to clear up their tax affairs but who did not avail of the option.  Tax advisers and accountants have told us that in 1988 the last few weeks were hectic, that they spent all their time advising people to pay up the reduced rate of taxes, that we were not interested in chasing the undisclosed amounts.  The Government will over the next week or so be considering a range of <Col N="1663" /> possible restrictions and exclusions from the scope of the incentive schemes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am a strong arguer. People quoted me today in regard to what I have said in and out of Government. They have heard me argue about matters in Government and others have heard me argue outside of Government.  I strongly support compliant taxpayers.  I believe we must do all we can to improve, develop and expand the tax system. However, I find it hard to listen to Deputies who berated me in this House last year when I tried to give the Revenue Commissioners additional powers.  I was called a stark raving socialist by a Member who came in here in the last two days and that Member last year spoke against granting additional powers to the Revenue Commissioners.  When we are talking about hypocrisy, that speaker, whom I will not mention, was the worst during the two days.  It is not possible to have it both ways.  You cannot be against giving the Revenue Commissioners powers, and also against public service pay bills.  The same Member also moaned about public service pay costs.  Pay costs relate to staff and staff are required to detect defaulters.  There are 3.5 million people here, about one million are under 15, another sizeable proportion, perhaps 0.5 million or more, have very little money.  That leaves somewhere around two million who would be taxable.  There are approximately 15 million bank accounts here and that figure does not relate to offshore accounts.  We should not delude ourselves that there are not <Col N="1664" /> great resources here and that we do not all know about them.  I know from good sources within the Central Bank and elsewhere that in some towns and perhaps cities here the foreign accounts are greater than the domestic accounts. Members who have debated this matter for 26 hours and asked where is all this money and what this is all about, should think again.</P>

      <P>We now have a chance once and for all to stop deluding ourselves. I believe in a compliant system and a compliant society, but I doubt if many Members in this House believe in that.  If they believe in providing the necessary resources to stop tax defaulters, non-compliance and illegality, then let us consider two things. Let us consider a tax amnesty for the so-called rich, though I must say that most of the letters I get are from small publicans. Members of the House a year ago said that small publicans were losing money, that they could not survive, that they would all be broke, even though they get 38 per cent gross tax, but we will not go into that now.  The Leas-Cheann Chomhairle would know more about that than I do.  Small shopkeepers, bookmakers, people who operate in back garages, people who were caught when the rates of tax were 65 per cent &mdash; none of these people is a multi-millionaire; I have not received a letter supporting this measure from any multi-millionaire.  They are all small business people because they have&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>They would get legal and tax advice from individuals and would transfer the money out.  Then they would invest it and get back to back loans from the State.  I know how the system works and so does the Deputy.  I do not believe there is an amount of £2 billion in accounts in offshore islands.  I have attempted over the last 12 months to find out the amount in so far as it is possible to do so, but it is difficult to get people to agree on figures.  We have somewhere in the region of 15 million bank accounts and that is the issue.</P>
      <P>Another point has been made here relating to a social welfare amnesty.  I would be prepared to work on a scheme to consider around the same time a social welfare amnesty for people who are either fraudulently drawing on the system or people who have not paid their contributions. There is a case for those people.  They are also operating outside the system.  Social Welfare recipients or business people with big or small businesses, and who may have invested money inside or outside the country in undisclosed or hidden accounts, are involved.  People have put forward various examples here.  But those examples are only a fraction of what people on both sides invested in this have written to me about in recent weeks.</P>
      <P>This amnesty will have to be introduced with stringent penalties.  The position will be that people in our society who defrauded will go to jail.  You cannot stand over a position where a young lad in town will get six months for some minor offence while other people can either get tax written off or in some other way get away with evading tax.  The tax system must be cleaned up.  We have never cleaned up the tax system.  Most of the money we are talking about has gone out from 1974 to 1978 under successive Governments.  It is not money that has gone out in the last 12 months or the last two years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There are about 800,000 taxpayers with a tax liability.  There are about 110,000 self-employed.  Therefore, 88 per cent is irrelevant because it is on a totally different base and there is no point in discussing that.</P>
      <P>There is another point I would like to answer.  It was raised here before and I heard it answered here by Ray Mac-Sharry when he was in this House.  The 1988 amnesty did not detect many people outside the system.  In fact, I asked for the figure last night and 379 taxpayers were detected who had not been in the system.  They were way behind in their payments but thousands of people on PAYE or PRSI were not detected.  The amount of money collected from that measure was quite small in relation to the overall £500 million.  Therefore, we should not say that most of the people detected in 1988 were outside the system. In fact, I do not think we detected any of them, the system was not designed for that purpose and it had no effect whatsoever.</P>
      <P>Deputy Yates made the point that a system is designed for a particular purpose. The criterion is whether the system is good or bad.  The 1988 scheme was designed for a particular purpose and it was successful.  We have had schemes relating to stamp duties.  They were designed for a particular system.  We had an amnesty in 1932, 1963 and also in 1986. Richie Ryan introduced an amnesty in 1974.  There have been five amnesties to date.  We had the 1988 amnesty and others which were introduced for smaller taxes.  There were five amnesties of the kind we have been debating here for the last 24 hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has examined carefully all the complex arguments &mdash; and they are complex &mdash; and has decided there will be an incentive scheme directed at those with previously undisclosed tax liabilities.  It will offer partial relief in respect of certain categories of undisclosed tax liabilities which arose prior to 6 April 1991.  The scheme is intended as <Col N="1667" /> a final opportunity to those concerned to regularise their affairs and will have to be accompanied by the introduction of the penalties that I mentioned.  These penalties will include jail sentences because as far as I know only two people reached that stage, one of whom perhaps wanted to serve some time because of constant arguments with the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>In this scheme the Government will be concerned to minimise the possible adverse implications of any new amnesty for the Revenue Commissioners' ongoing enforcement and collection programme which has improved significantly since 1988.  The idea is to get people into the scheme with their true rate of earnings and obtain the appropriate taxes from them while in the scheme.  That is something we have never applied to all of those people who have a large proportion of these millions of pounds in bank accounts.  The Government is also conscious of the need to protect against the danger that the introduction of a further major amnesty at this stage would lead to the disimprovement in compliance by normal scrupulous taxpayers.  We must be careful that the scheme we devise does not make it attractive for compliant taxpayers to become non-compliant.  We must examine that carefully.  We have to reduce the scope for diverting current income to an amnesty.  It is clearly essential to exclude tax relating to more recent years from the ambit of an amnesty and also liabilities which are being actively pursued by the Revenue Commissioners. They would have to be excluded and there could be many other exclusions also but that is an issue the Government is examining at present.  The exclusions and the arguments put forward here are issues that we will consider.</P>
    <P>The funds which are expected to flow from this scheme &mdash; and I hope we will get this money because otherwise it will continue to lie there for non-compliant taxpayers &mdash; will be used for many worthwhile schemes, approximately 20 or 30 of which have been indicated here, but the argument&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Before proceeding, I understand that the Minister for Finance in his opening remarks in respect of his contribution on Amendment No. 1 adverted to the fact that in his opinion the Chair had allowed a new practice to develop by allowing a new amendment on Report Stage which had not been discussed on Committee Stage and that he and his officials could not find any relevant ruling which would allow such an amendment.</P>
      <P>While I would not normally comment on my rulings in the House, and certainly in respect of this matter, I feel I have to put on the record the following: When an allocation of time motion is in operation on amendment not reached, that is not discussed, can be retabled for Report Stage.  In that regard, for an amendment to be in order for Report Stage, the point of substance or principle has to be before the Committee.  In this case the tax amnesty was before the Committee and not reached because of an allocation of time motion.  Therefore, the amendment by Deputy Cox related to the same subject matter and was in order.</P>

      <P>I have not changed identity.  I am sharing the remainder of Deputy Browne's time.</P>
      <P>This Bill introduced by Deputy Deenihan in the House last night sets out to deal with one problem and one problem only, or I should perhaps say more accurately, only one aspect of this problem. We are concerned with the position, the rights, and at the moment the obligations and penalties being imposed on landowners. There are other aspects of this problem which have been adverted to during the course of this debate, which we do not set out to resolve because we are not in a position to do that at the moment.  We are in a position to make the proposals set out in this Bill to resolve the very clear and well defined problem that exists for landowners in regard to their obligations to people entering their lands.  That is the reason the Bill was introduced by Deputy Deenihan.  That is the reason for the action we have taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are concerned with the obligations that have been put on landowners who <Col N="1673" /> in all the cases covered by this Bill are innocent parties who may find that they are put in a position where they have to pay, where they have to insure, where a burden is being imposed upon them. Looking at that and looking on the other hand at all the other considerations which Deputy Deenihan developed last night and to which, indeed, the Minister, Deputy Taylor, referred last night in relation to the development of tourism and tourism related activities, this measure is needed so that we can have the development that people wish to see, but so that we can ensure that that development does not take place in a real sense on the backs of innocent landowners. That is the only aspect of the problem with which this Bill sets out to deal.  Criticism of this Bill on the grounds that it is not comprehensive or that it does not cover these other aspects is totally unfounded.  There is a problem here which we can grasp, which we can delineate and which we can resolve in the way that is set out in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I want to respond to the Minister's comment last night on the Bill.  I am very disappointed by what I have heard from the Minister.  Almost his very first words were to say that the Government is committed to the reform of the law relating to the liability of occupiers, for injury resulting to persons on land or other property.  For the rest of his speech he set out to tell us why the Government intends to do nothing about it now, why the Government intends to ignore the problem, to wait for somebody else to come along with a report.  That is a totally unacceptable approach.</P>
    <P>I am worried also by the way the Minister illustrates his approach.  Speaking on a change in the law last night, the Minister said that the issue is what form the change should take so that the right balance can be struck between the interests of the occupiers of land and those of other persons who enter the land.  That worries me.  I do not want to see some change in balance, if we are talking about a matter of degree.  What we want, as set out in this Bill very clearly, is that the occupier of land has no liability to persons <Col N="1674" /> entering upon his land without authorisation from the occupier.  Unless and until that position is clearly established, occupiers will feel at risk and as long as they feel at risk we will not be in a position to feel that people like myself or any other Member of this House can enter on lands even for innocent purposes without there being a danger to the occupier. That is what we set out to redress.  We are not talking about modifying a balance. We are talking about establishing very clearly circumstances in which there will not be a risk to the occupier of land. It is as well to put a tooth in it from the very beginning because any other approach is simply a variation on a theme that we find discordant and that owners of land find is not in their interests.</P>
    <P>There are other things that worry me about what the Minister has said.  He talked about court decisions that have been referred to.  It seems rather disingenuous of the Minister to have spoken as though no public debate on this issue had taken place.  This issue has been a matter of debate, worry and some contention for a good many years.  It is not as though we are coming to the issue fresh or without a very clear idea of the problems.  For the Minister to pretend that there is need for further discussion is disingenuous.  We can have a debate on the finer details of the Bill and what he might like to do to change it on Committee Stage.  Speaking of previous court decisions, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The bulk of those decisions have dealt with the position of trespasser and, for the present at least, may suggest that trespassers could be entitled to a higher duty of care than other more lawful entrants onto land.</P>
    <P>That is an accurate statement of the present position and shows the kernel of the worry.  For the law to contemplate circumstances in which there is a higher duty of care to a trespasser than to other, more lawful entrants onto land must surely be a legal nonsense.  To have a position where a land owner has to exert greater care and take more stringent measures to protect unlawful rather than <Col N="1675" /> lawful entrants onto his land is a legal nonsense, one that must be reversed and set aright at the earliest possible opportunity. That is what we will do.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the case of two gun club members on an occupier's land, one insured the other not insured and the case that arose between them.  It is irrelevant to quote that untypical case. It is one of the many kinds of cases that would be dealt with satisfactorily by the provisions of the Bill.  For the Minister to cite that case as a reason for not taking action is nonsensical.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggested that there is a choice of models in dealing with this problem.  He mentioned the model which exists in England.  Deputy Deenihan dealt with that issue at some length and in some detail.  It is idle for the Minister to say that is something we should consider. It is being considered and it is the proper function of this debate to come to a conclusion on it.  The Minister mentioned the Occupier's Liability Act of 1984 in the United Kingdom.  Deputy Deenihan dealt with the issue too.</P>
    <P>The later parts of the Minister's speech seem to be highly questionable as a contribution to this debate.  The Minister was talking about looking at the position of various groups.  He criticises this Bill on the grounds that it is not comprehensive, that there are other issues to be dealt with.  He asks questions about whether the provisions of this Bill would sit happily with common law.  He says the scope of the Bill is confined to land but does not deal with other issues.  I find, in all those reflections on the Minister's part, the classic arguments for delay.  The Minister is using the old tactic of setting up an Aunt Sally, knocking it down and saying he has disposed of the argument. He has not.</P>
    <P>We have made it very clear that the focus of this Bill is very specific.  We want to deal with the problem being experienced by owners and occupiers of land because that is where the problem arises, causing difficulties in the development of a great many tourism activities nationwide. I will give one example.  Like every <Col N="1676" /> other Member, I received today the annual report and accounts of Coillte Teoranta.  There is not one reference in that interesting document to the role of State forests in the recreation industry. There is a problem there.  I know operators in the tourism industry who cannot gain access to State forests, or forests owned by Coillte Teoranta because they are worried about the liability they would incur in the event of people having an accident.  More and more of the sports and activities we are trying to develop to increase the length of the tourism season are outdoor activities on all kinds of lands, including forests.  A problem in the development of those activities is the way an unfair law stands at present.  As a matter of priority, we should turn our attention to that problem with the specific focus incorporated in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I would invite the Government to reflect again on this.  We are not pretending to solve all the problems but we want to solve the most urgent one.  I invite the Government to allow this Bill to proceed to Committee Stage so that we can do something worthwhile in the interests of our community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Gaeltacht, Mr. Gallagher (Donegal South-West) Minister of State at the Department of the Gaeltacht, Mr. Gallagher (Donegal South-West)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Gaeltacht, Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Donegal South-West):</i> The area of the law known as occupier's liability which this Bill seeks to address is concerned with the duty of care that is owned by occupiers of land, or premises, toward entrants onto the property who suffer personal injury or damage to property during the course of their visits.</P>
      <P>It is concerned also with the safety standards which those in control of lands or building should observe to safeguard those who come onto such property. While this Bill appears to be concerned mainly with farmers, the scope of the law on occupier's liability is much wider than that.  For example, there is the position of tenants, householders and companies to be considered also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming as I do from a rural constituency, I am very much aware of the difficulties facing the farming community as they try to second guess what their <Col N="1677" /> liability might be for any accidents suffered by people while on their property. Nonetheless, I cannot support Deputy Deenihan's Bill at this time.  It is my belief that the Bill is premature, and does not address the wider issues which are related to the law of occupier's liability.  Furthermore, I have no doubts about this Government's commitment to change in this area.  The Programme for a Partnership Government makes it quite clear that the law on occupier's liability will be reviewed and updated in line with commitments given in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  The House can be assured that this undertaking will be honoured.</P>
    <P>We should not lose sight of the fact that the matter under consideration is far more wide-ranging than the text of the Bill before us would suggest.  While the farming community may be particularly vulnerable in this area, this is not just a problem for them alone.  I am only too well aware that farmers in Donegal are genuinely concerned about this problem. I am well aware too that organisations representing farmers nationally, such as the IFA and the ICMSA, are genuinely concerned.  They would like to ensure that farm land continues to be available to the widest possible extent for a variety of sporting and recreational pursuits.</P>
    <P>However, quite apart from the legitimate concerns of the farming community, we should bear in mind that the law on occupier's liability is concerned with the care owed by all occupiers of premises, whether land or not, towards visitors.  The law in this area is concerned with striking a balance between a wide range of competing interests and it should be seen, in my view, in the context of the reasonable expectations of occupiers and entrants in a variety of domestic, social and commercial settings.</P>
    <P>Because there is a recognition by Government of the complexity of this issue, a decision was taken to invite the Law Reform Commission to examine the law on occupier's liability and to make recommendations as to possible future courses of action.  I am firmly of the view that it would be wasting the expertise of <Col N="1678" /> the Law Reform Commission and diminishing the value of the commission's work if we were to put legislation on occupier's liability on the Statute Book before the commission's report is available to us.  This is why Deputy Deenihan's Bill is both premature and somewhat narrow in its focus.  A body such as the Law Reform Commission is best suited, in my opinion, to the exploration and scrutiny of the various intricacies of this subject.  The commission has access to a considerable amount of expertise and it also has the capacity to undertake the kind of studies of the relevant law in other countries, something I think is vital if our legislation is to be as effective as it should be.</P>
    <P>It is, I understand, only a matter of weeks before a consultation paper is to be published by the Law Reform Commission. The sensible course of action would seem to be to use that report to consult with interested parties and then to proceed without undue delay to the introduction of comprehensive legislation in this matter.  I believe many Deputies in the House will agree that it would be both impolitic and premature to legislate on the issue of occupiers liability at this time without being in a position to take the benefit of the advice of the Law Reform Commission into account.</P>
    <P>I believe my colleague, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, is already on record as having said that he would welcome views on this question from all interested parties as it is his intention that the legislation which ultimately is passed in relation to this matter should reflect the concerns of all those who are immediately affected by the present situation.</P>
    <P>The present position with regard to persons who enter onto property is that such people have traditionally been classified into three categories &mdash; invitees, licencees and trespassers.  In general terms, the person is an invitee where his presence on a property is likely to be of benefit to the occupier, for example, a person who enters a shop in order to buy goods.  In such cases the duty of the occupier is to use resonable care to <Col N="1679" /> prevent damage from unusual dangers of which he is aware.</P>
    <P>The licencee, on the other hand, is someone who is permitted to be on other's land but it does not materially benefit the occupier.  This could be, for example, a person who makes use of a public park or playground.  In such cases the occupier's duty is to warn of concealed dangers of which he or she may be aware.  The third category is that of trespasser &mdash; a person who goes into a property without an invitation of any sort.</P>
    <P>This is probably the category which is of most concern to landowners, in so far as their worries about action for damages are concerned.  At least, it is this category which has been mentioned to me most frequently in my discussions on this matter with people in Dongeal SouthWest. One of the problems about trespassing is that there is often an assumption that the trespasser is a person who is on property without permission and who is up to no good.  It does not often take into account that in many instances trespassing can be an innocent activity which is wholly devoid of malice &mdash; for example, a situation where children stray onto land attracted perhaps by some natural feature such as a tree or water or who merely want to play.  As I understand it at the moment, the courts have made it plain in a number of decisions that the occupier of land owes a duty to trespassers whom he can reasonably foresee and that the duty in such a case is to take reasonable care as circumstances demand.</P>
    <P>While in recent years there may have been some move away from the traditional categories and a greater emphasis on the general duty of care depending on the particular circumstances, nonetheless the old stratification has not been entirely abandoned.  Aside from the fact that the law in this area is in a state of transition, there is an additional complicating factor arising from the fact that there is so little statute law touching on the issue.</P>
    <P>We, therefore, have a situation where the law has evolved as a result of various <Col N="1680" /> court decisions in the last few decades. Many of these decisions have dealt with the position of trespassers and appeared to suggest that in many ways trespassers may require a higher duty of care than other more lawful entrants onto land. Inevitably this does introduce some uncertainty for landowners, an uncertainty I can well understand.  Land owners may fear that they will become the focus of subsantial damage claims.</P>
    <P>While I am aware of the worries of many property owners on this point, it is important to remember that not every action for damages which comes before a court will necessarily be successful.  We should also remember that in applying the current law to the facts of an individual case the courts will not inevitably come down in favour of the plaintiff. Landowners and property owners should bear in mind that in such circumstances, cases may be as easily lost as won.</P>
    <P>While I may have been critical of the quality and the timing of Deputy Deenihan's Bill, there can be very few Deputies who are happy about the current state of the law on occupier's liability.  The real issue, however, is how to address this problem effectively.  The law currently is governed by decades of common law tradition.  It is quite clear that this tradition is no longer serving us as well as it might.</P>
    <P>In the area of occupier's liability in particular, it is obvious that a new law on this matter would help to resolve much of the uncertainty which is at the heart of so much of the unease and disquiet which informs the debate on this topic. I would agree with Deputy Deenihan, therefore, that there is a need for legislation in this area.  However, I do not believe that this Bill addresses this need as effectively as it might and therefore I feel more comprehensive and wide ranging legislation is required if we are to do the job properly.</P>
    <P>I note that Deputy Deenihan's Bill recognises that the State has an interest in this matter as a property owner itself. In one sense that interest is very direct and specific in that the State must seek to safeguard its own position in relation <Col N="1681" /> to liability for accidents occurring in State forests, in national parks, national monuments or in other amenity areas.</P>
    <P>The State must also have an overriding concern to ensure that the valuable amenities of our countryside can be used to the maximum extent possible both for pleasure and for profit.  These amenities inevitably have an attraction for visitors. Therefore, it is in the wider interest of our national economy that these attractions should continue to be available to those who seek them out.  There is considerable untapped tourism potential in our national heritage, particularly in the area of outdoor leisure pursuits.  Regrettably as more people participate in outdoor leisure pursuits there is an increasing risk that they will suffer injury as a consequence. The problem, therefore, is one that is likely to grow more acute as time goes on.</P>
    <P>The law in this area is slightly more complex than it would appear from a perusal of Deputy Deenihan's Bill.  That Bill largely preserves the traditional distinction between trespassers and licences.  It is, if I may say so, a blunt instrument which does not, for example, distinguish between the position of a child who wanders onto property to rescue a ball and a burglar who comes with the intention of stealing.  There are a few other small points which could be made about the Bill but the main criticism is probably that because of its brevity it fails to consider fully the ramifications of the occupier-entrant relationship.</P>
    <P>The Government is willing to do its part by bringing forward the necessary comprehensive legislation on this matter without undue delay.  I appreciate that there has been a growing impatience with the perceived lack of progress on the issue, nevertheless, I would hope that interested groups will await the legislation which the Government has pledged itself to introduce.</P>
    <P>The commitment to reform the law on occupiers liability was first given in the context of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  It was directed specifically towards the farming community. The Programme for a Partnership <Col N="1682" /> Government reaffirms the commitment to reform and update the law on this matter.  This Bill, has a very narrow focus and, essentially, seems to ensure that the courts adhere strictly to the old common law guidelines on entrants.  This runs counter to the trend in a number of common law countries where the emphasis has switched to the general duty of care which an occupier owes to his visitors.  This does not prevent proper distinctions being drawn between lawful entrants and trespassers.  The court, generally speaking, will not be quick to allow the protection of legislation to be availed of by those who do not deserve its shelter.</P>
    <P>While we cannot support this Bill I can promise the House that a Bill will be introduced which I know will allay many of the concerns which I recognise as being legitimate and fully justified.  Last night my colleague, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, gave an undertaking in this House to act as quickly as possible in this matter.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to introducing the necessary legislation on occupiers liability without undue delay. By allowing time for further consideration of all of the issues, not just those which relate to farmers, a good and well balanced Bill can be put forward which will attempt to allay the fears of all concerned to the maximum possible extent.</P>
    <P>I trust the House will give the Minister the opportunity to do just that and to ensure that we have legislation which will satisfy all, both inside and outside this House and that will serve us all well for many years to come.</P>

      <P>Ó thaobh an Chomhaontais Glas beidh mé ag tacú leis an mBille seo um Chosaint Áititheoirí Talún 1993, ach feictear dúinn go bhfuil go leor leasuithe ag teastáil agus is chuige sin <Col N="1683" /> atáimid ag tacú leis ag an bpointe seo chun ligean dúinn dul ar aghaidh leis na leasuithe.</P>
      <P>This is certainly a timely response to what could be called changes in society in general. The claim mentality is fairly well established in all walks of life.  It is particularly rampant in the United States and it has crept in and is now very prevalent here.  When I was growing up in the sixties I can recall people falling in school or when on other people's land, and one never considered making a claim involving solicitors or seeking compensation.  It seemed to be one of the hazards of growing up; you accepted the knocks and got on with it.  It is very different now.</P>
      <P>As a primary teacher, when I take people out on trips it is quite likely that somebody will mention, even as a joke, that we could sue or there could be a claim involved.  With that in mind this Bill is particularly urgent.  It has the support not only of the Green Party but of many people outside this House.  It is peculiar sometimes the bed fellows that support legislation.  It is a good indication of its merit that it has the support of such a wide range of interests.  Those most obviously associated, and in the mind of Deputy Deenihan, would be the farmers and landowners who will be looking very anxiously at this debate.  Perhaps claims by trespassers on lands is an indication that farms are getting bigger as farmers with smaller holdings could keep watch on them.  That is an argument for another day but it reflects the times we live in.</P>
      <P>There are also those who cross land innocently such as hill walkers, ornithologists and even sports clubs.  Considering the number of sports injuries that occur they probably feel inclined at times to wonder if they could be compensated. I played a GAA game on Monday and I wrenched my back and while the club is well insured I am not going to press any claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are those whom I would find it difficult to agree with in many cases, who support this Bill, such as the fox, the stag and the mink hunters.  Farmers need to be protected from the type of activities <Col N="1684" /> which others engaged in.  I do not support the fox hunters.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill because it seeks to protect the farmers who are subjected to the activities of the hunters that may cause suffering to wildlife.  Let us consider some of the uses that land is put to, for example, by coursing clubs.  If some of the unfortunate hares could claim for the injuries they incur the land owners would be even more concerned at the prospect of claims.  Many people supporting the Bill do not agree on anything else but they are united in their support of this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is a general fear among landowners which needs to be addressed and I do not detect the sense of Government urgency I would like to see in their response to this Bill.  The fear is that any rights of way or traditional uses to which land was put, quite innocently, many years ago may be the subject of speculation about somebody tripping and bringing a claim.  Throughout the country we have a number of rights of way and places where people traditionally felt comfortable and at ease.  Landowners share that feeling but now such rights of way are being closed off, there are legal challenges &mdash; of which I could name a number &mdash; and there is the ultimate prospect of communities being divided over what is perceived as, on the one hand, the landowner being overly cautious and even possessive and, on the other hand, the community's interests which have been in the locality for generations.  This matter needs to be addressed because of the implications for the welfare of communities in general, not just landowners.</P>
    <P>In my constituency of Dublin North, Portmarnock may not be considered a typical farming area but it has public and private lands.  For generations rights of way have been observed and respected by the community.  With new owners moving in there is a feeling of sweeping clean all that has gone before, including rights of way which have been established and enjoyed and probably taken for granted by the community.  This is causing huge divisions in the community there.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1685" /> Yesterday I received a letter asking what action I am taking to preserve the rights of way in Portmarnock &mdash; an area where golf courses are prevalent and another is being developed.  The writer said: &ldquo;I have recently felt intimidated by security guards for using a right of way which I have consistently used here for the past 21 years.&rdquo;  That is an indication of a huge problem and one that is being addressed, in part, in this Bill which will be amended to take into account the more wide ranging issues around Ireland. From that point of view it is very important to support it.  If we do not support it we will give rise to even more business for the legal profession because disputes of this nature tend to go through the legal system in some form or other.  It has been recommended to the people in Portmarnock to go to the High Court.</P>
    <P>The people who will reap the best harvest out of not dealing with this crisis are the solicitors.  The legal profession will certainly gain from any dispute that arises in relation to claims or access.  Unless we are in the business of putting more money and more business in the way of the legal profession we should allow ordinary people to know their rights and ensure that landowners feel at ease and not at loggerheads with the rest of the community.</P>
    <P>The one part of this Bill which concerns me could be amended.  It has what I would call a touch of the John B. Keane feeling.</P>

      <P>It comes to light in section 3 (2) which states:</P>
      <P>The occupier of land owes no duty of care to a trespasser but he is not entitled intentionally to harm a trespasser except in necessary self defence of himself or another or in the defence of property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This reminds me of the play <i>The Field.</i>  I presume it is not intended as a licence but as a safeguard but it could be misinterpreted. An amendment would <Col N="1686" /> ensure that people who go on to property and trip over something are not liable to be set upon by a landowner.</P>
    <P>The Bill is sound in so far as it addresses a huge problem.  From that point of view I ask that it be supported. Let us deal with the amendments as they arise.  Many of us in this House would have direct experience to bring to bear which could help this Bill become the kind of comprehensive legislation required.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill because it raises an issue that has implications for many people, not just landowners and farmers but whole communities who have been prevented from enjoying and developing local resources because of the crazy system that applies in relation to liability.  The failure of successive Governments to tackle this problem has diminished and impoverished many aspects of Irish life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The immediate issue that the Bill tackles relates to land and landowners. Quite clearly the current system places landowners in an impossible position in that they cannot protect themselves against insurance claims, particularly if, for example, they have a national monument on their land.  This matter has been raised many times by the IFA and local landowner groups but has never been resolved.  Nine or ten years ago the Law Reform Commission was given the task of examining the whole question of public liability and, despite many promises, nothing ever materialised.  I can remember my local county council being promised quite often that something was imminent, that decisions were being taken and that proposals were forthcoming. The Minister said the Commission paper would be ready in a matter of weeks.  If that is the case and if the Bill does nothing else but put the skids under the Law Reform Commission and the Minister to tackle the problem it will <Col N="1687" /> have been well worthwhile and will have served a vital purpose.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a welcome start to facing up to the larger question of liability.  In County Wicklow there is considerable pressure on landowners and farmers.  We have a national park which encompasses public and private land.  We are close to the largest city in the country and that has its own spin-off effects in that there are many people visiting the county, day trippers, hill walkers, people involved in recreational pursuits.  Glendalough, in the heart of the national park, has the highest number of visitors to any site in Ireland.  We are already experiencing the difficulties caused by many people walking on private lands.  It certainly has not been helped by the insensitive placing of an interpretative centre in our mountains, but that is a separate issue.  There are other sites of equal importance to Glendalough that we are only beginning to appreciate and which are being badly affected by the failure of the Government to deal with this whole question of landowners and their liability.</P>
    <P>I can just cite one example, an important historic site just outside Baltinglass, Brusselstown Fort, which is considered to be one of the largest urban prehistoric settlements in Europe.  It is an enormous area spaning about 38 acres.  There is evidence of a very sophisticated urban settlement from prehistoric times.  It is an area that has already achieved certain fame because of the interest shown in it by historians and archaeologists.  It is also placed in an area that is rich in archaeological remains.  It is a very rich part of County Wicklow as far as archaeology is concerned.  Baltinglass is an area rich in history.  However, its modern history is as an area which has a high level of unemployment. It has not seen the type of tourist related development that one would wish to see although it is an ideal location for encouraging visitors and tourists, people interested in heritage tourism, to come in and explore the archaeology of the place.</P>
    <P>There is an increase in heritage tourism and an interest in European history and <Col N="1688" /> pre-history that we should be able to develop and exploit as a county.  At the moment if one climbs up to visit Brusseltown Fort one can see the remains of the ring around the fort but outside that ring there is another ring of defences not made of stone but signs saying &ldquo;Keep out&rdquo;, &ldquo;Private&rdquo;, &ldquo;No Trespassing&rdquo;, &ldquo;Do not Enter&rdquo;.  This is a modern defence that has been set up by local landowners. Brusselstown Fort is on private land. Access to it is across private land.  People who come to visit it are, inevitably, dependent on private landlords to gain access.</P>
    <P>Visitors cannot gain access to this important national monument because of a natural caution on the part of the farmers.  I can understand the farmers' fears.  I can appreciate how difficult it is for them to reconcile their natural hospitality and openness towards visitors with the dangers those visitors bring if they come onto their land.  There is an inherent contradiction there.  At present, Wicklow Tourism is encouraging, developing and promoting archaeology and encouraging visitors to come in.  The visitors come but when they arrive at the site they are told to go away, to keep out.  It is an understandable problem but unfortunately it seems that the Government do not understand the urgency of the case in relation to landowners.  We are a highly litigious country.  The failure of the Government to act has made us more so.  One cannot move nowadays without somebody thinking in terms of insurance claims and landowners are left hanging out to dry as a result.</P>
    <P>This matter has to be tackled.  I am particularly conscious of this in my own county because we are very open to visitors. We want to welcome visitors but we are not able to do that at present. We are experiencing the bad effects on visitors and tourism and not getting any benefit.  This is an opportunity, if we are serious, to deal with the problem once and for all.</P>
    <P>I too, like Deputy Sargent, would add a <i>caveat</i> to section 3 (2).  There is no way I would support the principle that a person can intentionally harm somebody <Col N="1689" /> else in defence of property.  No matter what the circumstances, property is not as important as human beings.  However, that is a minor element to the Bill and obviously can be dealt with by way of amendment.  I do not think we have hit the Texas style form of retribution just yet.</P>
    <P>The essence of this Bill is good, it is facing up to the facts of life that farmers and landowners have to face every day of the week.  I am very concerned that the Government is simply, yet again, fobbing us off and saying, we can have jam yesterday, jam tomorrow but never jam today. This matter needs to be dealt with quickly, not just for the private landowner but for the public owner, in particular, Coillte, who are also badly affected by this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank the Technical Group for sharing their time with me.  I would also like to thank them for their very clear support for the Bill put forward by my colleague, Deputy Deenihan.  I congratulate him for introducing it.</P>
      <P>Farmers and landowners are in a state of shock at the fact that this Government has not only failed to introduce legislation to defend the rights of landowners but now, when the Fine Gael Party has made a genuine effort with this Bill, all they can do is reject it.  The Minister's approach is to await the Law Reform Commission's consultation paper which, he says, will only take a few more weeks. That of course means that this Dáil session will be over, the summer will be gone, the tourist season will be over.  As far as the Minister is concerned, he hopes the media will forget about it, the farmers will give up and he will not have to do anything about it.  I say landowners will not give up.  There is no point in the Minister putting his head in the sand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, in his refusal to accept the Bill, seems to suggest that children should be treated differently from adults. Farmers and farm families &mdash; and the Minister would recognise this being from a rural constituency &mdash; do not have to be told of the dangers to young people on <Col N="1690" /> farms.  Their own children are too often the victims of farm accidents.  Farm organisations, especially the one with which I was involved in, the IFA, have carried out major educational programmes to prevent this happening. However, landowners cannot be expected to lie awake at night worrying in case children enter their lands when they see a tree or a pool of water.  The Minister spoke about this also.  We all know children are inquisitive people, but there must be some degree of parental control.  Farmers like to see children enjoying their trees, enjoying the water, but they cannot be held responsible for other people's children.  We cannot expect farmers to watch every pool of water, every tree.  I hope the Minister's attitude is a joke.  Does it mean we have to cut them down, fill all the water holes and spoil the scenery of the country, a scenery that attracts tourists?  Farming opportunities are closing down as a result of the Minister's total failure in Europe to allow farming to continue as we know it.  The fact that the Minister has to go to court in relation to the beef situation is proof of how he has failed.</P>
    <P>Tourism is the only real alternative. We have heard Deputy McManus and others speaking about its importance. Outdoor pursuits, horse riding, walking are all very important aspects of tourism and landowners want to co-operate in all this.  For the most part, they do not want to have to close their farms, but one can see how difficult it is for farmers to get insurance, it is not difficult to believe that landowners may soon not be able to get insurance at all.  Insurance alone is not the answer.  If claims go up, so will the cost of insurance.  Insurance companies will soon rule out certain historic areas. I believe they are already doing that. Why should landowners have to carry this extra cost?  Many of them cannot afford it.  All of this is simply because of the failure of successive Governments to introduce proper legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that amenities in our countryside should be used to the fullest extent possible, both for pleasure and <Col N="1691" /> profit.  I quote from the Minister's speech:</P>
    <P>These amenities have an attraction for visitors.  Therefore, it is in the wider interest of our national economy that these attractions should continue to be available to those who seek them out. There is considerable untapped tourism potential in our national heritage, particularly in the area of outdoor leisure pursuits.  Properly utilised this potential could be a source of considerable revenue to local economies and should underpin in a vital way the social and economic cohesion of these communities.</P>
    <P>How can he expect landowners and farmers to allow people to come on to their land if they are being held completely responsible for any branch, rabbit hole or anything over which people may fall?  I talked to a person involved in the tourist industry today.  He wants to be involved in horseriding and so on.  There is a pool inside his gate and there are trees.  Can he allow families with young children to come in and enjoy those facilities in the future?  By failing to adopt this legislation the Minister is making the position impossible.  He is closing the door to many people living in rural areas to increase their income from tourism. He is ignoring the position on the ground.</P>
    <P>I am extremely worried that any Deputies who spoke openly in local areas of their support for this type of Bill seem to be slow to speak here in this Chamber. I wonder what will they do next Wednesday night.  Will they show the commitment to change the law they have given so freely at county council level and so on?  We have seen the law changed at the drop of a hat in respect of Mullaghmore and other matters.  Yet all that can be done with this Bill introduced by Deputy Deenihan is not to amend it or to improve it but simply to say that better things will happen sometime.  When will it happen?  As I said in my opening comments, the tourist season is now well underway.  It is ovbious that nothing will <Col N="1692" /> happen this year.  Can farmers, landowners and people involved in the tourist indusry hope that even next year such a Bill will make it possible for them to allow people onto their land?  I suggest the Minister reconsiders his position.  The House should accept the Bill introduced by Deputy Deenihan and if amendments are necessary, they should be made.</P>
    <P>As I stated earlier, the adoption of this legislation will allow families to sleep at night.  Recently, a landowner's wife rang me at 2.30 a.m. after hearing there was a possibility that a case would be taken against her in regard to an incident on land some ten miles away from her home. I do not think the Minister has any idea of the anxiety that is suffered by farmers and property owners in respect of this matter.  We want to deal with it in a positive way.  We have not introduced this Bill as a political gimmick.  We have put it forward to deal realistically with a problem that is causing enormous anxiety.  I would like to hear the Government's commitment and guarantee that if they do not accept this Bill, they will put an absolute time limit on when they will introduce their own Bill.  Otherwise farms will close up and tourists will go elsewhere.  That is something this country in its present position especially in the west, cannot afford.  I know that to be the case from people in my county and those involved in the tourist industry. They were looking forward to a positive result from the introduction of this Bill. They will be extremely dejected at the Minister's statement last might &mdash; and I gather the Minister of State will say much the same tonight &mdash; that he is not prepared to accept this Bill or even put down amendments to it which may be necessary. We are not saying the Bill is perfect, but then the Finance Bill was not perfect either.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputies de Valera, E. O'Keeffe and Ferris.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Firstly, I compliment Deputy Deenihan on bringing forward this Bill for consideration tonight.  Our discussion of this issue in the House reflects the concern <Col N="1693" /> throughout the country on the need to update the law on occupiers' liability.</P>
    <P>The Minister in a well argued and detailed speech last night outlined the history and development of the existing law on occupiers' liability.  From his arguments it is quite obvious that there are major omissions from the legislation we are discussing this evening.  Regardless of the shortcomings of this Bill, any Deputy who drafts legislation must be complimented. It is a formidable task to do this considering the lack of resources any back bench Government Deputy or Opposition Deputy has at his or her disposal as a Member of this House.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech emphasises the multi-faceted aspects of this matter and it is quite obvious that it is not possible to have the law updated or amended without very thorough and detailed examination being given to all matters pertaining to it.  We cannot narrow the focus of this issue to the farming community alone.  It is an issue that concerns all occupiers' liability regarding the duty of care that is owed by all occupiers of land or premises towards all entrants onto their property.  Obviously, most of us are concerned with this area of the law, as tenants or as householders, and it is not jsut confined to private householders or landowners, but it also concerns the business community and State authorities &mdash; for example, educational institutions and Coillte.</P>
    <P>The English Occupiers' Liability Act, 1957, is often quoted as the remedy to our ills.  However, the Minister's speech last night clearly emphasises that this Bill would not be sufficient for our position and I am glad to note that other state models may be examined in this context. At times we have slavishly followed the English example with regard to law and I welcome the Minister's mention that a trawl of our European partners legislation in this area might assist us.</P>
    <P>While I accept that this whole area is complex and needs very detailed and careful consideration, I believe that sufficient time has elapsed since the Law Reform Commission was requested to draw up a detailed report and that we <Col N="1694" /> should have that report at this stage.  I understand that report was requested in early 1992 and I hope that this consultation paper will be available to the Government and the Minister without further delay.  Naturally, the Minister will have to have consultations with the various interested parties and I hope he will ensure that all groups having an input into this legislation will be made keenly aware of the urgent need to come to a final set of recommendations and that consultation in this instance does not necessary imply delay.</P>
    <P>Early in April, Deputy de Valera and myself raised this issue on the Adjournment because of our desire to reflect the views and worries of our constituents on this matter.  From the public's point of view enough commitments have been given about addressing the issue.  I understand that the first commitment was given in the context of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and a specific commitment was given in the Programme for a Partnership Government that the incoming Government would urgently reform the law relating to the liability of occupiers for injury resulting to persons on land or other property.  The necessary legislation must be put in place at an early date and I cannot stress to the Minister the need to ensure that there are no further delays in rectifying this matter.  I hope that the Minister would consider setting a target date because the phrases &ldquo;at an early date&rdquo; or &ldquo;in the near future&rdquo; do not catch the imagination or confidence of the public.</P>
    <P>This issue has been left unaddressed for far too long and, unfortunately, it has landed many landowners in serious financial problems.  Practically everybody is affected by the present unsatisfactory system.  I need only instance landowners, the State and sporting organisations.</P>
    <P>I come from a county and, indeed, a constituency which has always given a warm welcome to visitors.  I am particularly concerned about our tourist angling industry which has been built up over the years by the diligence and great attention of the people in the industry <Col N="1695" /> with the full co-operation of landowners. Those landowners on whose land access is gained to waterways have outlined to me in detail on a number of occasions their concern about possible litigation. They are anxious that the necessary legislation should be placed on the Statute Book without further delay.</P>
    <P>Recently this issue came home to me very forcibly when I learned that a number of angling projects for which substantial financial provision had been made were not proceeding at the speed we would wish because of the concern of landowners on whose properties the developments would be sited.  It is unfortunate that my colleague, Deputy Crawford, has left because there were a number of projects for which we had secured funding.  I have been speaking to some of the State agencies who would be involved in putting the schemes in place and on a number of occasions exhorted them to speed up the process.  A senior Government official replied to me as follows, and I quote:</P>
    <P>With regard to the projected expenditure for this year I would emphasise that the successful completion of these projects is dependent on the co-operation of the landowners on whose land the developments are to be sited.  As I mentioned to you during our recent telephone conversation the question of public liability is raised by most landowners. There is concern on their part that any development on their lands to facilitate angling will expose them to increased risk.  This had led to a number of refusals to allow development to proceed.  I am aware that the legal position with regard to landowners' liability is under review by the Law Reform Commission.  It is in all our interests that the matter receives urgent attention.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, spoke earlier about the valuable amenities of our countryside and the need to make maximum use of those amenities both from a recreational and an economic point of view.  He is correct to state that <Col N="1696" /> our outdoor leisure facilities are becoming increasingly important both from a recreational and job creation point of view and the wealth creation that can accrue from them.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by stating that the issue must be addressed fully and properly.  I hope that it will be possible to bring forward the necessary legislation at an early date, comprehensive legislation that will address every single item involved in this issue.  I have every confidence that our Minister for Equality and Law Reform will bring forward that legislation without delay.</P>

      <P>First, I wish to thank Deputy Smith for allowing me to share his time.  I am also very pleased to take this opportunity once again to raise this matter here as it is a matter which affects every section of society.  It would be a grave mistake to suggest that this is a subject which only affects those living in rural areas.  It also affects the householder and, of course, tenants, companies and bodies such as health boards and local and national government alike. The law pertaining to occupiers liability is, however, more visible and graphic in the rural setting.  When I last raised this matter with Deputy Smith in the Dáil on 6 April 1993, I highlighted the difficulties that faced farmers in particular with regard to occupiers' liability.  The law is archaic.  There is no legislation in this area.  It is based on common law and so is subject to change on a case by case basis.  At present, we have what is defined as invitees, licensees and trespassers.  The law as it stands would seem to come down on the side of the trespasser at the expense of the landowner.  This balance needs to be redressed immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it any wonder that farmers have become so anxious about their legal position and the fear of litigation that they have erected signs to attempt to prevent people coming on their land?  I am sure the Minister will agree that this goes against the traditional welcome that <Col N="1697" /> farmers have always given to the community. Such action has only been taken in desperation and from frustration with the present legal position.</P>
    <P>On the question of fines, I would like to refer to the position in England which is interesting because the duty owed can be discharged in an appropriate case by placing warning notices on the land.  I have been told by a number of lawyers that no lawyer, however eminent, could give, under our present law, any such guarantee to Irish farmers or, indeed, to landholders in this regard.  It is well worth examining both the English case and, indeed, the law in our other European partners to see how best to approach this issue.</P>
    <P>On 6 April, I underlined the need for updating and reforming the law immediately so as to allay the many genuine fears abounding in the rural community facing the 1993 tourist season.  I know already of bookings for activity holidays in Clare for 1993 which have been cancelled due to the present legal limbo which exists concerning occupiers' liability.  I would like again to appeal to the Minister to take such action as is open to him to try to deal with the immediate problem for the tourist season which has already begun.  In this way the Minister could, as I pointed out before, show the Government's appreciation and recognition of the farmers' valuable role in tourism.  I appreciate that the subject of occupiers' liability is an extremely complex one and I am aware that the Minister is anxious to introduce changes in the law as soon as possible.  However, like Deputy Smith, when I hear the phrase &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo; I find it a little worrying because I am sure Members in this House on all sides realise that this problem must be addressed immediately.  The Government's wish to introduce legislation in the area of occupiers' liability has been stated in the Programme for Government which is in line with the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> on the matter.</P>
    <P>In passing, I would also like the Minister responsible for the Office of Public Works, Deputy Dempsey, to do what he can to address the matter of access to <Col N="1698" /> archaeological sites for which he has responsibility in order to ease the present situation and enhance our tourism potential. Deputy Deenihan last night rightly pointed out the increase in activity holidays and the fact that there is also an increase in specialist interests such as botany, geology and archaeology. However, we must not forget the sporting and recreational activities which take place on farmers' land which also poses legal questions for all concerned.</P>
    <P>To those who think that the problem of occupiers' liability has been exaggerated, I would like to point to our growing compensation culture here. Sadly, we must admit that this is a fact. Only the other day I saw a car with a sticker on the back window which read, &ldquo;Hit me.  I need the money&rdquo;.  Whereas no doubt the driver of that car meant the remark to be nothing more than amusing it did indicate to me a changing attitude in Irish society which is leaning towards what is known as &ldquo;compensation neurosis&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The need for change in the law concerning occupiers' liability has been evident for a long time yet we are still waiting for legislative action.  I understand that the Law Reform Commission report and recommendation has been completed and it should have gone to print some weeks ago.  I would like clarification from the Minister on this point because if that is so I would urge the Minister to expedite the printing of this report so that the proposals can be examined in full and legislation drawn up without further delay.</P>
    <P>While I appreciate and share Deputy Deenihan's anxiety with regard to this matter, it would be more prudent if, rather than voting on this Bill, we base our stance on the legal position which will be presented to us by the Law Reform Commission who, after all, are the legal experts in this field.  We should not pre-empt the findings of the Law Reform Commission.  However, I would impress upon the Minister the need to expedite the report, there may be an opportunity then to incorporate some of the suggestions put forward in this Bill by Deputy <Col N="1699" /> Deenihan.  This would give the wider focus which is suggested and is necessary for any forthcoming legislation.</P>
    <P>I believe, as do others, particularly in our rural communities that this is an ongoing problem that needs to be addressed and I hope there are no further delays in doing so.  Quite some time has passed since the Law Reform Commission was given the task of looking at this problem of occupiers' liability.  I am aware it is not an easy problem to solve.  We need to ensure that legislation is in place that will work and will allay the fears of many people, particularly landowners.  I impress upon the Minister the need for urgent action and I hope this Bill will spur on such action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on this important Bill and respond to Deputy Deenihan's initiative in this area.  The whole question of owner-occupier liability is a pressing concern of late, particularly among the farming community.  It is an issue in which considerable interest has been expressed in my constituency and I commend Deputy Deenihan for bringing it to the attention of this House.  This is a topic that merits serious attention and debate. I am aware of the concerns of the Irish Farmers' Association and farming organisations generally in this regard &mdash; they have every right to be concerned.  I compliment Deputy Deenihan on bringing this practical Bill before the House, a Bill that is non-contentious and that does not involve cost.  He is one of the great people of vision on the Fine Gael Front Bench at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I congratulate Deputy Deenihan on his foresignt in bringing this matter before the House, I cannot support it for the obvious reason of the party Whip. We are still awaiting the results of the Law Reform Commission report in this area and it is only when this report becomes available that considered deliberation can be given to the form new legislation in this area should take.  The most effective way to draft legislation is by first having all the facts and analyses <Col N="1700" /> at one's disposal.  I call on the Minister, when considering legislation in this area, to take into account the many good ideas contained in this Bill which has much to offer.</P>
    <P>There is real fear and concern among the farming community and property owners generally regarding the whole issue of owner-occupier liability.  At present farmers can be held liable for injuries caused to people walking or trespassing on their land.  Farmers cannot afford to have such punitive liabilities hanging over their heads.  The law in this regard is antiquated and is in need of reform.  In addition to being out of date current legislation is also wholly inequitable in that it places entire responsibility on the shoulders of the farming community and property owners.  This is patently unfair and I can well understand the concerns of the farming community. Farmers are not kill-joys.  They are aware of the beauty and splendour of our countryside and have no wish to deliberately deprive their fellow citizens of the various pleasures the countryside has to offer.</P>
    <P>Perhaps more than any other group in society, farmers work closely with nature.  Their work is conditioned by the rhythms of nature and by the seasons. When people from towns drive to the country to show their children the splendour and beauty of the Irish countryside, the cows in the fields, the rabbits and the hares, it is very difficult for a farmer to prevent them from entering his land, even though they are probably illegally tresspassing.  Farmers do not wish to jealously retain the pleasures of country living for themselves but they have every right to protect themselves from punitive damages that may arise.</P>
    <P>We live in a litigation conscious age where no opportunity is lost to obtain money as a result of a perceived injury. I have no doubt that many claims for compensation are legitimate.  However, as many Members of this House know, many fraudulent claims are made and what is commonly known as &ldquo;compo&rdquo;<Col N="1701" /> has become a mini-industry.  The level of awards is such that farming families could be ruined and left without a roof over their head.  The farming community needs to be protected from this unscrupulous behaviour.  Real fear exists in this regard and that is why many farmers today prevent people from going onto their lands.  Very often it is difficult to prevent people from trespassing onto lands through which flow rivers and streams.  As one who comes from an agricultural background I would find it heartbreaking to prevent someone from going onto my holding.  It would be unfair to do so because there are many things on the land that would be of interest to others.</P>
    <P>In recent times gun clubs, fishing clubs and coursing clubs have taken out insurance in order to protect themselves and indemnify property owners from accident claims.  The real problem does not arise in this area because these clubs receive permission from landowners to go onto their land and they have protection. Many property owners have public liability insurance which indemnifies them against a claim to the value of £2 million.  However, such cover is beyond the reach of the average property owner or farmer because the premium is prohibitive.  It is well-nigh impossible for the agricultural community to get insurance cover at this level unless they are prepared to pay exorbitant premiums. As a rule, farmers do not prevent people who are interested in exploring the countryside from entering their land. Very often boats and other buildings attract people from afar who come to explore, examine and identify with the heritage.  Farming colleagues of mine find it very difficult to stop people from going onto their land.</P>
    <P>The current position with owner-occupier liability is such that farmers must actively discourage people from going onto their lands, given the potential financial risks this might entail.  Modern technology and machinery on farms, such <Col N="1702" /> as combine harvesters, tractors and other pieces of modern equipment attract adults and children and injuries may occur.  Farmers and property owners are compassionate and understanding people.  I know that Deputy Deenihan, in bringing forward this Bill, took into account the needs of rural communities.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that farmers must discourage people from entering their lands. Financial risks to farm families are selfevident, but there is another dimension. Many urban dwellers like to enjoy the pleasures of the countryside.  However, when farmers, of necessity, have to refuse access to their land it perpertuates an unnecessary urban-rural divide, which was witnessed in the past.  Every effort has been made to build up urban-rural relations.  When urban families who go on an outing on a sunny Sunday afternoon and are prevented by a farmer from going onto his land difficulties may arise. This Bill is designed to deal with such problems.  I urge the Minister to act as soon as possible in this area.  I call on him to indemnify property owners against any liability for persons who go onto their property without the express permission of the owner.  This is the only way the current problem can be solved.</P>
    <P>Farms are potentially dangerous places because of the many activities carried out and products used with which I can identify, such as slurry pits, silage pits and acid for the preservation of silage. Because of the inclement weather during the last few weeks, many of those hazardous products have seeped onto the land.  People can experiment.  They might roll the barrels around the field, and they can inadvertently get burned or damaged, even with the best will in the world.</P>
    <P>For all those reasons, the Law Reform Commission should be asked to bring forward their report as quickly as possible, so that we will see this type of Bill come before the Dáil.  I am quite sure it will have the support of all sides of the House.  I have no doubt about Deputy <Col N="1703" /> Deenihan's support for such a Bill.  I am delighted to have had the opportunity to highlight the problems and I look forward to a Government Bill being in place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for this opportunity.  I am concerned about the allocation for roads and forestry in counties Cavan and Monaghan.  I have no doubt that the Minister will come up with figures to show that the operational programme has been very successful, as it has been in some areas.  It is like the curates egg, good in parts.  In some areas which I will outline there were defects. The five counties of Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan and Monaghan have a heavily funded programme but out of 4,100 hectares planted, only .5 per cent is in County Monaghan and about 5 per cent in County Cavan, despite the fact that those areas are supposed to have the best quality land for fast growing softwood timber.  This land has a 40 per cent better growth rate than other parts of the country.  The growth rate is two to three times faster than in any other EC country.</P>
      <P>When the figures came out I was disturbed and wrote to Coillte Teoranta. They replied pointing out that, nationally, only 7 per cent of our land is afforested and the area that I mentioned comprised only 3 per cent.  It cannot be related to the outturn on this occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is one of the areas designated for alternative farm enterprises.  The regional structure was set up to identify the areas for development and to provide the infrastructure so that the development could be carried out.  It very clearly identified this area for forestry development. What concerns me is that the 1994-1997 submission refers to land which is <Col N="1704" /> unsuitable for traditional farming but may be suitable for afforestation at a potential profit.  It states that the development of the forestry industry will contribute to a number of overall sub-regional objectives, particularly job creation.</P>
    <P>In that area there has been a substantial reduction in the number of people employed in afforestation.  While those five countries which I mentioned are part of the north-west sub-regional, Coillte Teoranta have other regions. They have a Sligo region which covers Sligo, Leitrim, Donegal and a Mullingar region which covers Cavan and Monaghan. The Department which is responsible for afforestation, has split the area into two regions, which is not at all satisfactory. There is land available for afforestation. The soil is excellent for timber, and this development is disgracefully small in an area where there are very few alternative farm enterprises.  This seems to be the ideal alternative farm enterprise.</P>
    <P>I also mentioned the allocation for roads.  Because they were highly afforested, Counties Louth, Donegal and Leitrim got £452,000 under a previous programme from the second phase of the Border fund, while the other counties that I mentioned got about £31,000 or £32,000.  Those counties lost out in both ways.</P>
    <P>Another very important point relate to pollution control with regard to waste mushroom compost.</P>
    <P>Coillte Teoranta have 12 parks.  Ten years ago we made a submission to Coillte Teoranta for a £20,000 development in one park, for a children's amenity play area.  Up to now we have not heard from Coillte Teoranta.  There is a serious imbalance.  I would ask the Minister to rectify this in the present submission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Ms E. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, planning the optimum use of Structural Fund spending <Col N="1705" /> for the period post-1993 has to be done in advance of the completion of the 1989-93 plan.  It is evident however that the north-west region benefited greatly from the 1989-93 Community Support Framework, particularly in areas of greater relevance to it.  For example, expenditure on Continuation of Regulation 1820/80, both actual and projected was 28.2 per cent of the national figure, and expenditure on objective 5 (a) measures, tourism (public works), environmentally friendly farming, forestry, and sanitary services, were 26.2 per cent, 22.4 per cent, 21.6 per cent, 16.9 per cent, 15.0 per cent respectively.  In fact, the expenditure per head in the north-west region has been the highest of all regions of the country in the last round of Structural Funds.</P>
      <P>As part of the process of preparing the National Development Plan to cover the post-1993 period at sub-regional level, consultants were engaged to carry out an evaluation of the implementation of the present Community Support Framework in terms of its effectiveness in contributing to Ireland's economic development, and in the light of this evaluation to make recommendations for the elements and the balance of these elements in a community support framework for the period 1993 to 1999 which would make the greatest contribution to Ireland's growth and employment objectives and to productive investment in Ireland.  The consultants report has been received and is being considered along with the various other submissions made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance asked the sub-regional review committees for their views on the post-1993 situation.  The north-west committee submitted a detailed report in October 1992, which, among other things, set out its views on priorities for expenditure under the 1994-99 Community Support Framework and the Cohesion Fund.  The priorities set out in the report have been valuable in assisting in the preparation of the <Col N="1706" /> national plan.  I met with the North-West Regional Review Committee.</P>
    <P>The detailed points made by Deputy Leonard in relation to Coillte Teoranta are ones I am not in a position to answer, but I will take them up on his behalf with the Department of Agriculture and Forestry.</P>
    <P>In relation to expenditure on roads, we can expect in the next round of the plan a greater emphasis on local roads than we saw in the last round.  I hope that County Monaghan and County Cavan will benefit from that as well as other counties with particular needs.</P>
    <P>Work on the plan is well advanced and decisions will be made shortly on the allocation of resources under it.  The demands for resources far exceed what is available and difficult choices will have to be made by the Government.  It is important to bring a sense of realism into this process.  Demands on my table total £28 billion and we cannot satisfy everybody in terms of those kinds of demands. In advance of finer decisions being made, the Deputy will appreciate I cannot go into any more detail in relation to how the plan is shaping up.</P>
    <P>In addition to the Community Support Framework, a number of Community initiatives have been of benefit to the north-west region, in particular INTERREG specifically addressed to the problems of Border regions.</P>
    <P>While the Commission has yet to announce what Community initiatives will be proposed in the next round it seems certain that there will be a further INTERREG programme.  The Department of Finance in Dublin and the Department of Finance and Personnel in Belfast in Northern Ireland have engaged consultants to carry out an evaluation of the present INTERREG programme and to make recommendations on a successor programme.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may be assured that the particular problems of the north-west region will continue to receive due attention under the 1994-99 CSF.  I have noted <Col N="1707" /> in particular the points he made in relation to forestry and county roads.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Public Service Threatened Industrial Action.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Sir, for having given me the opportunity to raise this important issue.  Earlier this week, the two major public service unions issued strike notice on the Government to expire later this month.  Everybody will be aware that Dublin is suffering from a lengthy transport dispute.  Now this new and greater threat to our public services is gathering momentum.  The CPSU and IMPACT will begin their joint industrial action with a one-day strike on 28 June which they propose to escalate over the following weeks into full-scale strike action, if necessary.  Almost every public service, including Government Departments, employment exchanges, the courts, the Dáil, health services and air traffic control would be affected.</P>
      <P>This is an appalling prospect.  The reason I raise it is to ask the Minister of State to say what is being done to avert this strike.  Clearly it would be a disaster if it were allowed to come to that.  It occurs at a time when relations with the public service unions have been very badly soured by the imposition of the 1 per cent employment levy and the welfare cuts which have not been reversed in full, as the unions had been led to expect by the incoming Government, particularly by the Labour Party element in that Government.  That souring of the atmosphere is a critical element in this dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the developments to which I have referred there seem to be two major issues to be negotiated.  One is the failure to appoint an arbitrator.  I am aware that all Governments, for quite some time past, have experienced difficulty with the arbitration system, its knock-on effects and the relativity awards arising therefrom.  Running away <Col N="1708" /> from a problem will not solve it.  Failure to fill such an important position leaves an industrial relations gap.  It should be dealt with head-on, in discussion, if the Government has a difficulty about this appointment.  The unions have a difficulty in relation to the honouring of what they see as commitments in the programme in relation to pay.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to inform the House what efforts are being made to resolve these issues.  Not only will industrial peace for the foreseeable weeks and months be put in question, but the whole process of national agreements, of which I am an enthusiastic supporter, will come into question.  In addition to disappointments in relation to the budget, if the last months of this agreement are marked by industrial relations problems of this kind it bodes ill for the prospect of any new agreement.  It is my belief that the next will be one of the most critical agreements for this country within the context of achieving a serious national effort on employment, which will require the active co-operation of the unions, and some sacrifices.  It may be an agreement such as we have never seen before, with fewer conceessions in the pay area, more reforms in social welfare and perhaps more concentration on the creation of extra employment in the public service. It will be crticial to the future of this country to have such an agreement in place.</P>
    <P>In addition to the likely disastrous impact of an industrial dispute in terms of loss of public services it will be extremely difficult to retrieve relations with the unions to such an extent that they would be enthusiastic about or willing to enter into a further agreement.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State will be able to reassure us that serious efforts are being made to resolve issues which have such threatening consequences for our people by the total withdrawal of many of the public services on which so many people depend.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms. E. Fitzgerald Ms. E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms. E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware &mdash; from newspaper reports &mdash; that two major trade unions in the public service are in the process of arranging a campaign of industrial action at the end of this month. If, or when, formal notice of strike action is received, together with the precise reasons therefor, I will be in a better position to deal with the issues raised by Deputy Flaherty.</P>
      <P>I understand &mdash; from newspaper reports again &mdash; that the two unions concerned have voiced public doubts and apprehension about the intentions of the Government in relation to commitments to public servants under the pay agreement associated with the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  Their planned action purports to be in defence of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  If that is the case, I am sure the House will agree that these doubts are unfounded.  Let me explain. On 17 January last year, the Minister for Finance set out clearly &mdash; on behalf of the Government &mdash; a package of measures in relation to outstanding commitments to pay increases due to public servants under the Programme for National Recovery and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  Acceptance of that package had the desired effect of restoring normal relations with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in the spirit of consensus which has served the country so well for the past five years or so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State referring to 1992?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date, all pay commitments which have matured under the package have been honoured in full.  The first and second phase increases of 4 per cent and 3 per cent under the pay agreement which forms part of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> have been included in the rates of pay of all public servants.  In addition, the third phase increase of 3.75 per cent has been paid <Col N="1710" /> subject to a minimum payment of £5.75 per week and, as announced on 17 January last year, a maximum payment of £6.50 per week.  All outstanding phases of special pay increases due to public servants under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> have been paid in full.</P>
    <P>Meeting all these increases in full, together with the implementation of highly-important programme improvements in the health and education sectors has not been achieved without considerable cost.  The effect over the past two years was to increase the total cost of public service pay and pensions by 19 per cent to £4,038 million &mdash; as set out in the Revised Estimates Volume.  In 1994, the cost of increments and full implementation of the commitments to restore the 3.75 per cent increase next December and to payment of arrears due to capping of the round increases in 1992 and 1993 would add a total of £216 million, or 5 per cent, to next year's pay bill.</P>
    <P>As announced by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement, the scale of this expenditure and its increase continue to be matters of considerable concern to the Government.  Having provided in full for all pay increases due, the Government was convinced it could not ask taxpayers to carry any further additional pay costs in 1993 or to live with a situation in which liabilities to further increases would be allowed to build up for 1994, pre-empting decisions on resources next year.</P>
    <P>Recognising that this position has implications for the operation of industrial relations across the public service, the Minister for Finance invited the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to discussions on these issues.  If the consensus approach to managing our affairs means anything, it must mean that the parties can sit down and discuss any problems frankly and try to find solutions, in the true spirit of consensus, which will be fair and equitable to all the parties concerned, including taxpayers.</P>
    <P>The Government is totally committed <Col N="1711" /> also to negotiation of desirable changes in the public service pay determination systems.  Our aim is to reach an agreement as soon as possible this year, through negotiations with public service trade unions on a new system.  Any new system will have to be more transparent and operate on assessment criteria which, while being fair to staff, would also be responsive to the particular needs of the Government of the day and the community as taxpayers.  Clearly, to be successful, it will also have to command the faith and trust of both management and staff.  The Government is also committed to working towards arrangements whereby public servants will be put on the same footing as other employees in relation to PRSI.</P>
    <P>This process of consultation with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions has not yet been concluded.  I would expect that the questions raised by the Deputy in relation to the appointment of a public service arbitrator and payment of the arrears due to capping of the general round increases in 1992 and 1993 will also be resolved amicably in the course of these discussions.  I am confident that with goodwill on both sides it will be possible to reach a suitable accommodation which will not alone solve any current difficulties but will also lay the foundations for another consensus-based programme to follow the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>To summarise, therefore, the Government has to date honoured all commitments to public service pay increases which have matured to date.  We hope we will be in a position shortly to conclude our dialogue with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on the issues raised in the budget speech in a manner which satisfactorily addresses the concerns of both sides.</P>

      <P>Deputy Allen <Col N="1712" /> gave me notice of his intention to raise the matter of whether the proposed new Bord Bia will be located in Blarney, County Cork, as this would project an appropriate image for such an organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter.  I am voicing the call of the Chamber of Commerce in Cork, the Munster Agricultural Society and all sections of the communty in Cork city and county for the national headquarters and administrative functions of the newly announced Bord Bia to be located adjacent to the north side of Cork city in the Blarney area.</P>
      <P>Munster has an irrefutable claim to have Bord Bia located in the province and it makes sense in all respects to have it located in an area of high unemployment, adjacent to the north side of Cork city, where in parts there is up to 75 per cent unemployment.  The connotation of the world renowned Blarney label would project a most appropriate green image for a body such as Bord Bia. Munster is the heart of the Irish food and drinks industry, from farm gate to research, production and marketing.  The province is also home to a major indigenous fishing industry.</P>
      <P>Cork city, as the regional capital, has all the necessary attributes to service and capitalise on the natural advantages and manufacturing skills in the food and drinks sector.  For example, it has an unrivalled infrastructure, with an international airport, Ireland's only deep water port with free port status, an excellent rail and road system and cost effective access to the European Community and world markets.  Cork is also well serviced by excellent telecommunications, medical and domestic services and has an abundant fresh water supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cork and Munster has a wealth of educational and research institutions specifically tailored to the needs of the industry, spearheaded by our university <Col N="1713" /> college, the regional technical college, as well as by Teagasc and the FÁS training centre.  The National Teagasc Agricultural and Food Development Authority is located nearby at Moor Park, Fermoy, which includes the National Dairy Products Research Centre.</P>
    <P>UCC has a rich science and technology skills base and houses the only food science and technology faculty in the Republic.  The university in recent years has been highly successful in linking business and food science and technology and has an impressive record at graduate and post-graduate diploma and degree levels in food business, food marketing and research.</P>
    <P>Cork Regional Technical College has been a pioneer and leader in tailoring the science subjects to the needs of industry. In the fifties and sixties its predecessor pioneered the only chemical engineering qualification in the Cork area.  Since then it has been a pioneer in the environmental protection area.</P>
    <P>Cork is also the national centre for brewing and distilling; Beamish and Crawford, Murphy's Brewery as well as Irish Distillers operate their system of production from the Cork area.  There is also significant drinks production in the Cork area.  As well as all this, Cork has an impressive array of related manufacturing enterprises which support the vibrant agri-business and food and drinks sectors in Munster as well as related drugs, health care, pharmaceutical and electronics industries.</P>
    <P>As the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry is aware, Cork is the gourmet centre of Ireland; particularly Kinsale. We estimate in Cork that the principal agri-business companies in the Munster region accunt for a combined turnover in excess of £4 billion every year and employ approximately 20,000 people.  Cork city and county, with a population of 410,000 people, is continually improving its quality of life and is an ideal location for the Bord Bia headquarters. Therefore, given that the Cork <Col N="1714" /> region epitomises the green natural environment that Ireland must project as a location for the sourcing and production of high quality foods, the case I am making is a strong one.</P>
    <P>As a traditional centre of industry and commerce the Cork region has played a major role in the growth and development of the Irish agri-business and, therefore, deserves to be recognised by locating the Bord Bia headquarters in Cork.  I ask the Minister this evening to commit himself to this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>The <i>Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-1997</i> recognised the importance of the food industry and outlines the intention to implement a development programme following consideration of the expert group on the food industry report.  As the Deputy knows, the expert group has recently submitted its report.  It is a comprehensive and detailed document setting out a wide range of recommendations for the future development of the industry.</P>
      <P>One of the recommendations of the group is for the establishment of a single promotion agency for food.  The recommendations of the group, including the one I have just referred to, are to be considered by the Government shortly. If the Government decision is in favour of a single agency we will proceed with the necessary arrangements to set it up, which would take some time.</P>
      <P>The board of a new agency would of course rightly expect to have a say on the question of location and I can assure the Deputy that there would be arguments in favour of the Cork area.  Equally, there would be arguments for other parts of the country also renowned for food production, if such renown were to be the main criterion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any decision about the location of a new agency &mdash; and the expert group recommended that it be formed as a company &mdash; one of the central requirements <Col N="1715" /> would be efficiency of operation.  If a new agency could not operate more effectively than the existing range of food promotion agencies there would be less justification for change.  I believe it is on that basis that the question of location, should it arise, should be looked at.  A new agency would be a means to achieve certain objectives which are spelled out in the expert group's report, such as developing leadership, maximising available resources and establishing an overall strategy for food promotion.</P>
    <P>I think that the House will agree that these are worthwhile objectives for all sectors of the Irish food industry and for the country as a whole.  The important point is that the best way to achieve them <Col N="1716" /> should be found and implemented.  That is the Government's aim, but we are not yet at the stage where we can talk about the detailed requirements for a new agency.  If one is to be set up it is certain that the matter would, in one form or another, come before the House again, giving Deputies an opportunity to express themselves further on the subject.</P>

      <P>It is my intention to develop sound policies for the protection and conservation of all aspects of our national heritage.  I am aware that there is a growing interest internationally in cultural tourism and <Col N="1569" /> that, by taking care of our heritage, we are likely to attract a larger share of this market.  However, my primary objective will be to ensure that everything of cultural value which we have inherited will be a source of inspiration to our people and will be transmitted undamaged to future generations.</P>

      <P>While I have no direct function in the provision of financial assistance to Ardmore Studios, I do, however, regard the studios as an important element of the existing infrastructure for the promotion and development of the Irish film industry. Therefore, I believe that the studios are well placed to exploit the new policy initiatives which I have put in place to exploit the full potential of the industry and create significant employment and value added to our economy.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, these initiatives involve: the reactivation of the Irish Film Board to administer a dedicated fund to assist film projects; and the removal of the &ldquo;cap&rdquo; on RTE advertising revenue and the allocation of specific amounts by RTE for programmes commissioned from the independent sector, under the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Bill, 1993.</P>

      <P>The allocation to the Operational Programme for Tourism represents 5 per cent of the total aid for the Community Support Framework for Ireland 1989-93.</P>
      <P>The preparation of a National Development Plan which will form the basis of negotiation with the EC Commission of the Community Support Framework for EC Structural and Cohesion Funds for the period 1994-99 is underway.  As part of this work the Government is considering the priority expenditure areas for investment to be included in the plan.  As the total of demands substantially exceeds any likely allocation of funds to Ireland difficult decisions will have to be made on which proposals best meet our priority objectives. No decisions have yet been taken by the Government on the allocation of expenditure and aid for the different sectors.</P>

      <P>Section 14 of the Social Welfare Act, 1993, provides that students in full-time education will no longer be eligible to receive unemployment assistance except in special circumstances.  Regulations are currently being drafted which will exempt categories such as mature students and students participating in education schemes for the long term unemployed.</P>
      <P>I also propose to make special arrangements for students living at home who cannot get work under the new summer jobs scheme and whose family is dependent on a social welfare payment.</P>
      <P>The new summer jobs scheme for students will cater for full-time students who cannot get summer jobs and who are no longer eligible to receive unemployment assistance during their summer holidays by virtue of this year's Social Welfare Act.</P>
      <P>Essentially, the new scheme will operate for ten weeks during the period 1 July to 30 September 1993 and will allow students who would formerly have been eligible for unemployment assistance of £15 or more per week to earn up to £400 over the ten week period of the scheme.  Voluntary organisations, community groups and public bodies with suitable work will be able to participate as sponsors.  Payment under the scheme will be made to participating students by the sponsors who will, in turn, be reimbursed by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This innovative scheme has been warmly welcomed by a variety of voluntary <Col N="1578" /> and public sector bodies and applications have been received from sponsors throughout the country, including the Donegal area.  Students living on offshore islands who wish to take up the summer jobs scheme can also have access to any vacancies that arise on the mainland.  This is the first year of the scheme and difficulties arising, such as the situation outlined by the Deputy, will be resolved in a practical way.</P>

      <P>The person concerned applied for on old age non-contributory pension in November 1991.  During the investigation of his means which followed, it was established that he had leased his holding to his son for a five year period. This leasing arrangement was not accepted for old age pension purposes as the son, who is living and working in England is not considered to be in beneficial occupation of the holding.  For this reason it was determined that the person concerned continued to be the beneficial owner of the property and in assessing his entitlement to pension the nett yearly value of the holding had to be taken into account in determining his means.</P>
      <P>Based on his means derived from his holding and capital, it was decided that he was entitled to pension at the reduced rate of £38 per week inclusive of adult dependant allowance with effect from 20 December 1991.  The rate of pension payable with effect from 30 July 1993 will be £49.70 a week.  The person concerned appealed this decision to the social welfare appeals office.  Following an oral hearing of his case in April 1993, at which medical evidence was submitted, the appeals officer disallowed the appeal and ruled that the rate of pension in payment was correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there has been any change in the <Col N="1579" /> beneficial occupation of the holding in question since the oral hearing of the appeal on 27 April 1993, details should be forwarded to my Department and the rate of pension in payment will be reviewed.</P>

    <P>In so far as my area of responsibility is concerned, opportunities for the long term employed are made available by FÁS through the social employment scheme which is the principal manpower intervention aimed at persons who are long term unemployed.  Projects under the scheme are sponsored by public sector bodies as well as by voluntary groups involving work which would not otherwise be undertaken.  Participants are paid allowances which are higher than <Col N="1582" /> the rates to which they were entitled while on the Live Register.  The current basic rate is £75 per week compared with £57.20 per week unemployment assistance. This means that a participant with one adult and three child dependants receives £145 per week compared with £129 while on the Live Register.  I am pleased to say that the rates of payment will increase from July, when social welfare payments are set to increase.</P>

      <P>An application for a foreshore lease to develop a car park facility at the location in question was received in January 1992.</P>
      <P>The application was at that time fully assessed by the engineering branch of the Department of the Marine and there was no objection to the proposal on technical grounds.  The Department also sought the advice of Bord Fáilte which, in March 1992, indicated that they had no objection on amenity grounds.</P>
      <P>Following these assessments the company involved, on the direction of the Department of the Marine under the Foreshore Act, 1993, published notice of the proposal in two local newspapers (<i>Connacht Tribune</i> on 3 April 1992 and <i>Connacht Sentinel</i> on 14 April 1992).  No objection was received in response to these advertisements or otherwise until recent weeks.  In the meantime Galway County Council gave notice of its decision to grant planning permission on 30 June 1992 and confirmed its decision on 4 August 1992.</P>
      <P>A formal offer of a lease was made to the company on 8 March 1993 and following negotiations on the terms of the lease the company formally accepted it on 1 June 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It came to notice early in May that work had commenced on the site in advance of the finalisation of the lease. The applicant was advised that no authority to commence work on the site had been granted and that all works should <Col N="1588" /> cease pending finalisation of the lease. Galway County Council issued a warning notice under the Planning Acts on 25 May requiring that the development be discontinued forthwith.</P>
    <P>While it remains the intention to grant a lease as originally offered and accepted, the formalities will not be finalised until I am satisfied that the works will be in accordance with plans and drawings approved by me and that the Local Authority requirements will be satisfied.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for funding initiatives such as those raised by the Deputy rests with An Chomhairle Ealaíon.  I recently had the pleasure of launching &ldquo;Making Youth Arts Work&rdquo;, the final report of the National Youth Arts Committee.  This committee was established in 1990 to undertake policy development in the area of youth arts (the arts experiences of <Col N="1595" /> young people ouside of schools) and was a joint initiative by an Chomhairle Ealaíon and the National Youth Council of Ireland.</P>
      <P>Broadly speaking, the report identifies the need for a policy led and co-ordinated approach to the development of youth arts by organisations with responsibility in this area, namely the Youth Affairs section of the Department of Education, An Chomhairle Ealaíon, national and local agencies involved in youth services work, youth and arts organisations.</P>
      <P>I understand that the recommendations of the report have been adopted by An Chomhairle Ealaíon and will be further considered in the context of a formal liaison committee currently being established between An Chomhairle and the Department of Education.</P>
      <P>I believe that initiatives such as this will help ensure that youth organisations are in a position to offer young people an opportunity to develop their interest in the whole area of arts and culture.  This will reap long term benefits in terms of enhanced participation in the arts to the benefit of society in general.</P>

      <P>I have no plans at present for the establishment of such a service.  I would prefer to see in the short term greater equality of editorial choice for television viewers in the whole island of Ireland with existing services.</P>
      <P>The policy of successive Irish Governments has been to encourage plurality of television choice and Northern Ireland television services are available to ever increasing numbers of viewers here through natural overspill, cable and MMDS retransmission systems.  Unfortunately, reception of RTE television services in Northern Ireland is less than satifactory, being available to about 40 per cent of the population.  Any improvement in this situation involves the successful negotiation of bi-lateral and multi-lateral agreements on the use of broadcasting frequency spectrum within the constraints of International Agreements to which Ireland and the UK are parties.  Such negotiations are primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, but I would hope that in due course it will be possible to reach a mutually satisfactory agreement that will result in the greater availability of RTE television services in Northern Ireland.  In this regard I would hope also that it may be possible for Telefís na Gaeilge to be an all Ireland television service.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, Non-Consultant Hospital Doctors (NCHDs) are doctors in training.  The programmes laid down by the training bodies require NCHDs to gain experience in various specialities. This is typically broken into blocks of six months.  Many NCHDs are participants in organised rotation schemes lasting 2-3 years made up of a varying number of six month blocks.</P>
      <P>There has been no change in this system in recent times.</P>

      <Quest>if the purchase of the site and the planning process for Dunboyne School in County Meath can proceed immediately; her views on whether the question of the proposed management structure should not delay the process as the management structure can be determined in 1994 following the publication of the White Paper on Education; her views on whether decisions can also be made in 1994 with regard to the local contribution as determined by the management structure decided upon; and if her attention has been drawn to the fact that both Dunboyne and Hartstown schools were sanctioned on the same day in February 1992, and, as the proposed White Paper on Education did not delay the Hartstown school, it should not therefore delay the Dunboyne school.</Quest>

      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 97 and 98 together.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my replies to Dáil Questions Nos. 359 and 473, on 23 February and 23 March 1993, respectively.</P>
      <P>The management structure for the proposed Dunboyne postprimary school will be considered in the context of the White Paper on Education to be published by the end of the year.  The question of a local contribution will not arise until decisions are taken regarding the management structure.</P>
      <P>The suitability of a site for the school is currently being examined.  When this examination is completed my Department will enter into negotiations for its purchase and the detailed planning of the development will be initiated.  When planning is completed this project will be considered for inclusion in the building programme in the light of objective criteria related to relevant educational, building and financial factors.</P>
      <P>I am aware that some Dunboyne parents are experiencing difficulty in securing places for their children in the post primary school of their choice next September. Representations in this regard have not been made to my Department in respect of 1994.  My Department will continue to monitor the situation until such time as the new school is provided in Dunboyne.  It would not be feasible to have the school in place in September 1993 as mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
