      <Qid>1</Qid>
      <asker>Mr. J. Bruton</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>if he will give one Cabinet Minister overall responsibility for western development, in view of a report (details supplied) which predicts a population drop in the west of Ireland of 110,000 over the next 18 years.</Quest>
      <QRef>
      </QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe it is necessary or that it would be useful to give one Minister overall responsibility for western development.  The work of every Department has important connections with and impact on the west as indeed they have on other areas of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has made it clear that statements on the development of each <Col N="1458" /> region of the country, including the west, are now being prepared following on the National Development Plan.  The statement for the west will take account of the report referred to in the Deputy's question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach alarmed by the fact that the report referred to in the question shows that during the next 18 years the equivalent of the population of Counties Sligo and Roscommon will disappear from the province of Connacht.  Does he agree that this suggests that there is a need to have one person at Cabinet level who would have accountability and responsibility for stopping this disappearance of population from the west?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that the appointment of a Minister, as suggested by Deputy Bruton, would have the desired effect.  Indeed, it could hinder rather than help development in that various functions in relation to development are spread across a number of Departments. The statement on the development of the west will be made available shortly and will focus on the requirements outlined in the National Development Plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there not concrete evidence that the west lacks clout at the Cabinet table given that its share of resources under the National Development Plan is smaller than under the previous plan and that this trend of reducing resources for the west seems to be endemic in the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As it is represented by the Taoiseach and two other Ministers at the Cabinet table I do not think the west lacks representation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>As someone who represents the west, does the Taoiseach agree that there is a need to concentrate our efforts given that there is overlapping which has given rise to confusion among <Col N="1459" /> the public and organisations as to who is responsible for development?  In respect of the National Development Plan which the Taoiseach mentioned, the Government failed to provide finance for the Dublin-Westport-Ballina line and for third level courses, as promised; to make arrangements to save 60 jobs which have been lost in Westport and to prevent the closure of 44 beds in Mayo General Hospital&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;aware that a recent survey in Achill shows that the school going population will drop by 50 per cent during the period 1983-97?  Will he agree, therefore, that there is a need for political clout in dealing with those problems?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already said to Deputy Bruton that the west does not lack political clout at the Cabinet table. I would point out to Deputy Kenny that there will not be an election for quite a while so he can spare us the election speeches.  Indeed, under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> the company in County Mayo is operating successfully.  I would have thought he would pay tribute to it given that it has <Col N="1460" /> made an impact.  I should also point out that funding will be provided for the third level courses to which he referred.  He need have no fear about that; Castlebar will be looked after.  Furthermore, the hospital beds to which he referred have been closed on a temporary basis; an emergency service will be available.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the population of the six counties in Northern Ireland, a human tragedy, is 1.5 million?  While we welcome the initiatives to restore peace and save lives there &mdash; everything possible is being done and mountains are being moved &mdash; there are fewer than 500,000 people in the five counties of Connaught, another human tragedy.  Is the Taoiseach further aware that the population of my own county of Mayo has dropped by 80,000 since 1926; that the population of County Leitrim has been halved and now stands at 25,000; that the population of County Roscommon has dropped by 38,000; that the population of County Sligo has dropped by 32,000 and that its towns, town-lands and villages are dying?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot recall the party opposite making any major effort when it had an opportunity to do so in Government or think of any monuments that stand out when we come to the question of development in the west.  I repeat that the west has always been strongly supported by the party I represent and by the other two Ministers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We had similar outbursts from Deputy Higgins before when certain factories closed in the west.  He preached doom and gloom and said that those factories would never reopen. Now, we hear from him again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I know what has been said by the Opposition in regard to a regional airport there.  We will let the credits rest where they should rest.  This party and this Government will totally and absolutely support the west.  We will await the full report of the bishops on the west of Ireland and it will be responded to by the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the bishops' conference has welcomed my proposal of a minister for western development?  Is he aware that it is inconsistent for the Government to argue in Brussels for assistance for Ireland on grounds of peripherality if it is not willing to look after the peripheral parts of Ireland itself?  Is he further aware that the only period during which there was growth of population in the west was during the seventies when a Coalition Government reversed previous industrial <Col N="1462" /> development policy and regionalised industrial development?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not necessary for Deputy Bruton to tell us what Ministers there should be.  There are many Minnisters who have responsibility for various areas.  There is a Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, apart from the Minister for Agriculture himself, who has responsibility for rural development.  County enterprise boards are being set up in Mayo to give an opportunity to Mayo people to use their own initiative.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 8, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the Government's firm conviction that a real opportunity exists at the present time to secure a lasting peace and a permanent cessation of violence.  The Government are therefore giving the highest priority to the development of a basis for peace.  Both the Irish and British Governments bear special responsibilities in this regard.  As the Brussels Joint Statement of 29 October states: &ldquo;The two Governments must continue to work together in their own terms on a framework for peace, stability and reconciliation consistent with their international obligations and their wider responsibilities to both communities&rdquo;.  I welcome therefore the speech of the British Prime Minister in the Mansion House <Col N="1464" /> last night, in which he confirms that he shares our assessment of the opportunity that exists, and in which he states that the British Government for their part are &ldquo;now actively seeking a framework to deliver peace, stability and reconciliation&rdquo;. I hope that we can continue to make progress towards this goal in the period ahead.</P>
    <P>Political leadership, courage and commitment are necessary in order to realise the universal desire for peace on this island.  For our part, the Government are prepared to take risks to achieve this, but we also need realism on all sides.  An environment of peace would, of course, utterly transform the political atmosphere and greatly enhance the prospects for a successful outcome to a resumed process of dialogue, but we are not in any sense saying that peace is a precondition for the resumption of talks. The Government therefore see the parallel pursuit of the peace and talks processes as complementary.  Work on both is proceeding on that basis.  It is important, and people would expect, that a determined effort be made to achieve real progress and to make a beginning of peace a reality as soon as possible, I would hope before the end of this year. Nevertheless, no absolute deadline has been set in respect of either process.  The attainment of peace is however in our view of particular urgency.  As I said in my address to the Fianna Fáil Árd Fhéis on 6 November: &ldquo;While our first priority is to establish peace, which I see as a distinct and separate process, I also believe the talks process must be resumed immediately&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of the agreement that the Taoiseach and British Prime Minister should meet twice yearly to discuss matters of concern to our two countries.  The next such meeting will take place in Dublin in early December. In accordance with established practice, the date will be announced simultaneously in Dublin and London close to the time of the meeting.</P>
    <P>I held separate meetings on 3 November with the SDLP leader, Mr. John Hume, and the Alliance Party Leader, <Col N="1465" /> Dr. John Alderdice.  The Tánaiste and I also had a meeting with an SDLP delegation led by John Hume on Sunday, 14 November.  It would not be appropriate to give details of confidential discussions of this nature.  I can say, however, that they focused upon our shared desire to achieve peace and political reconciliation on this island.  I refer to the positive public statements made since those meetings.</P>
    <P>As regards constitutional change in the context of Northern Ireland, I have already set out the Government's position on numerous occasions and most recently in this House on 6 October 1993.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the Taoiseach in welcoming the British Prime Minister's statement.  I further welcome the Taoiseach's own statement that the peace and the talks processes are complementary and that one does not have to precede the other.  In view of what the British Prime Minister said yesterday, would the Taoiseach not agree that there is absolutely no reason Sinn Féin should not stop now?  All the conditions have been created in terms of allowing them to participate in the peace process.  They have been told they have a place at the talks.  There is no justification for their continuing to maintain that the shooting of RUC men in Newry is some form of contribution to a peace process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already called on a number of occasions, as has the Tánaiste, for the men of violence on both sides to lay down their arms and I have indicated that there would then be places at the conference table for them.  I repeat that call today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that there should in no circumstances be a situation whereby either the IRA or Sinn Féin would have a veto on peace talks and that there would be such a danger if there were too much emphasis on peace before talks?  Will he agree that, although all of us would like to see an early settlement, it is not helpful <Col N="1466" /> to talk of artificial deadlines for either peace or a settlement at this stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must not have been listening when I said there were no absolute deadlines, that we hope to continue to make progress, that it is a matter or urgency, that it is a priority of the Government that we continue along that road and that nobody should have a veto on a peace process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In stating that the peace and talks processes are two distinct and separate processes, does the Taoiseach regard the conditions which might be required for the Provisional IRA to stop their killing and bombing as applying to any talks process which gets underway now or in the foreseeable future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Both the British Prime Minister and I have made it abundantly clear on a number of occasions that the men of violence should lay down their arms and that there would be a seat for them at the conference table to enter into dialogue and discussions on how the future of all communities and all peoples of this island could be worked out, after we had seen a real cessation of violence for a period of time so that people would be absolutely satisfied that such a position existed.</P>
      <P>In regard to the other aspects of Deputy De Rossa's question, talks are continuing and much discussion is taking place behind the scenes between Sir Patrick Mayhew and the Northern Ireland Office and the various political leaders in an effort to identify levels of agreement between the parties.  It is for them to judge when sufficient work has been done to enable them to convene all the political leaders around the table.  We have not arrived at that situation yet.

      <P>Question No. 2, tabled by Deputy Bruton, asked if the Government will enshrine the six principles enunciated by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs in the Constitution. Anybody who studies the six principles will clearly see they are not suitable material for enshrining in the Constitution. We are continuing to work in a manner in which we believe the most progress can be made to find a basis for peace.  We contributed significantly to the resumption of the talks process and we will continue to be involved in that.  The Tánaiste issued invitations to the Unionist parties to meet him, those invitations are being processed in the normal way by the Unionists and it is a matter for them to respond.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach may have misunderstood my question and therefore, I will phrase it another way.  The Tánaiste outlined principles for a democratic settlement in relation to Northern Ireland.  He and the British Prime Minister issued a statement in Brussels which outlined a basis for progress <Col N="1468" /> in relation to Northern Ireland.  Are those principles and that statement the only conditions which will be acceptable to the Irish and British Governments for the involvement of Sinn Féin and the IRA to be represented at any talks when there is a cessation of violence, in other words, that new conditions are not being negotiated, behind the scenes, with Sinn Féin and the IRA which will become the conditions for any talks with the democratic parties in Northern Ireland?</P>

It is a matter for those parties to confirm or deny that position.  We will continue to do our job.  Every week the Tánaiste and I have meetings with various representatives for example, community leaders, who make suggestions as to how progress may be made towards putting together a formula for peace.  There is an overwhelming desire for peace from all sides in the North and throughout the length and breath of this country.  We will continue to take soundings and listen to all opinions in our continuing efforts to put together a formula for peace.  Up to now we have made our contribution towards a basis for the formulation of peace and we will continue to have discussions with the British Government in that regard. We will continue to work with the Northern Secretary of State, Sir Patrick Mayhew, in relation to his efforts to restart the talks process.</P>

      <P>I welcome the expressed personal commitment of the British Prime Minister to a framework for peace and the remarks of the Taoiseach today in terms of both ways forward, the way of peace and the talks process.  Is the Taoiseach aware of the great confusion among both traditions in the North, the Unionists and the Nationalists, which is best expressed by the Northern question: what is the Free State Government up to?  Will the Taoiseach tell us what he means by the phrase &ldquo;peace without a predetermined future&rdquo;?  The Nationalist <Col N="1469" /> and Unionist communities are confused and concerned about what that phrase might mean.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not share the Deputy's view that they are confused about what that phrase means.  During the past few weeks I met various representatives and community leaders who asked the same questions raised by Deputy Currie.  &ldquo;Peace without a predetermined future&rdquo; is a simple phrase.  It means we want to see peace established in the North without prejudice to the future of either communities to a political settlement.  We all want peace and for everybody to sit around a table and work out the best future for everybody living there.  There must be a better way than another 25 years of violence.  We are not asking anybody to predetermine the political future and ultimate political solution. First, we want a cessation of violence that will enable peace talks to get underway in an atmosphere and an environment that will undoubtedly offer a far better chance of success than the present position.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Will the Taoiseach agree that the nub of the British Prime Minister's speech last night was to align the British Government's position with that of the Irish Government as enunciated in Principle 6 in respect of the participation of Sinn Féin at any future talks?  Will he further agree that there is now little difference between the two Governments in respect of Principles 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6?  Has progress been made in aligning the position of the two Governments in accordance with the position of the Irish Government as stated in Principle 1?</P>

      <P>Principle 1 states that, first, the people living in Ireland, North and South, without coercion, without violence, should be free to determine their own future.  That principle is endemic in what I have said all along and in what I have said today.  In relation to the positions of the two Governments, it is clear from the Prime Minister's statements that the two Governments see the two processes as complementary and I have never regarded them as being in competition.  What I have said is that there is an opportunity to develop a peace formula and I do not think the time available to us is indefinite in that respect. There is an urgency and a priority to try to grasp that opportunity while it exists. There is no difference of opinion on the talks process.  Sir Patrick Mayhew and other Ministers are carrying on discussions with political leaders.  The British Prime Minister met the political leadership in the North in the last ten days and all that work is in progress.  I assure the House that there is no difference of opinion as to how the process should continue.</P>

      <P>One wonders whether the Taoiseach has control over it.  I wish to put as clearly as possible my question to the Taoiseach in relation to the IRA.  The Taoiseach said there is an historic opportunity for peace.  Will he confirm that by &ldquo;peace&rdquo; he means in these instances a cessation of violence by the IRA?  If so, given that the Taoiseach indicated he is involved in a peace process, presumably with the IRA through proxies or otherwise, what conditions will the Taoiseach accept for such a cessation of violence?  Are they the Spring principles, the Hume-Adams arrangements, about which we are still kept in the dark, or the Brussels statement?  In view of the fact that Gerry Adams last night rejected out of hand the statement by the British Prime Minister, does the Taoiseach not consider it time for him to tell Gerry Adams to put up or shut up and let us get on with the democratic talks required to provide for a guarantee of peace in the long term?</P>
    </Speaker>

As I said already, it is a matter for the parties concerned, Sinn Féin and the British Government, to respond to the type of question put forward by Deputy De Rossa.  In relation to the work going on between the two Governments to try to develop a peace formula, I am clearly and unambiguously referring to a permanent cessation of violence that will lead to lasting peace in Northern Ireland.  The two Governments are working behind the scenes in that regard and we will continue our efforts to find a formula for peace that will bring to an end the violence on both sides &mdash; there is no point in trying to stop violence on one side if it continues on the other. <Col N="1472" /> We must direct our efforts to try to bring about an environment whereby the men of violence on both sides will lay down their arms.  That is the only way we will achieve lasting peace in Northern Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 30 and 62 together.  I am satisfied that, in general, health boards and hospitals have implemented the provisions of the Charter of Rights for Hospital Patients.  As stated in the Programme for a Partnership Government, the Government is committed to a review of the Charter of Rights for Hospital Patients to make any necessary improvements and to ensure that it provides a properly structured system of patients' rights.  This review is underway at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1473" /> The Charter of Rights for Hospital Patients applies to the acute hospital sector only.  At present, my Department does not routinely monitor the level of complaints received from hospital patients.  However, a preliminary review of the operation of the charter has indicated that there has not been any significant increase in the volume of complaints received following the launch of the charter.</P>
    <P>The question of assessing patient satisfaction in public hospitals and the submission of annual reports of patients' complaints to my Department will be given consideration in the context of the present review.</P>
    <P>Under the general medical services scheme, there are specific provisions in the agreement with participating general practitioners for dealing with complaints. In the year to end October 1993 a total of 19 complaints have been made against individual doctors under these provisions. There are a total of 1,638 doctors participating in the scheme providing services for 1,237,772 people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased the Minister for Health is undertaking a review of the patients' charter and I hope there will be a wide public debate on the matter before changes are introduced.  Most people have the highest regard for the care and dedication of the staff throughout the health services.  I put it to the Minister that without the force of law the patients' charter is not much more than a piece of paper and it is very important that it be given the statutory force of law by way of legislation as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is merit in reflecting on the Deputy's proposition.  Implementation of the charter is being reviewed. Arming people with information of their entitlements is a great advance on the position that existed heretofore.  Interesting facts have emerged from our review to date.  For example, the charter has been generally very well received by health agencies and the public.  Health agencies are implementing the charter <Col N="1474" /> provisions and there seems to be no increase in the volume of complaints.  I will certainly consider the Deputy's proposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister concerned with the glaring anomaly in the working of the charter in terms of access to medical records?  Under the Data Protection Act people have a legal right to obtain their records provided such records are on computer, but the patients' charter does not incorporate such a vehicle for the patient.  I put it to the Minister that in terms of the relationship between the consumer and the provider, a simple complaint about the purchase of a Hoover can be investigated under the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, but the same avenue is not available for the patient under the patient's charter.  Until the Minister enacts appropriate legislation difficulties will arise in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an extension of the existing charter on the provision of access to medical records and it is a matter in which I have been interested for some time.  I see no difficulty for any hospital or health agency in providing access to patients.  In the context of the review, this matter is being addressed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Officials of my Department are regularly in contact with each health board regarding its expenditure and I have been given no reason to believe a financial crisis exists in any board.  Health boards have indicated that extra funding will be required to cover a number of items not included in their original non-capital allocations, including demand-led schemes and additional costs arising on medical indemnity <Col N="1475" /> insurance.  My officials are currently in discussion with the boards to agree the adjustments to be made in the non-capital allocations in respect of approved expenditure, which will be the subject of a Supplementary Estimate.</P>
      <P>While it is difficult to be precise concerning the likely year-end expenditure position following the adjustment of the boards non-capital allocations, it has been made absolutely clear in discussions with health boards that they are required to maintain expenditure within the approved allocation.  The Deputy will be well aware of the major difficulties which have arisen for health boards and their creditors as a result of an accumulation of excess expenditure in the previous years.  It is essential that this does not continue.</P>

      <P>Spoken like a true Fianna Fáiler.  As Ireland has recently been rapped on the knuckles by the International Human Rights Commission on this issue, that the Supreme Court ruled during the summer that the rights of Irish women in this matter must be suspended until legislation is put in place by the Government, that those rights suspended are rights denied to Irish women and that a recent opinion poll showed that 71 per cent of the population favoured the introduction of legislation allowing information on abortion, how can a Labour Minister justify, with his hand on his heart, this lethargy and further delays? He used words such as &ldquo;the near future&rdquo;&mdash; approximately one year after the electorate voted on the matter.  The response by the Minister today in regard to this matter is not sufficient.  Is he saying that he has not yet brought proposals in this regard to Cabinet?  That is a straightforward question.</P>

The point I am making is that there is no sign of further progress in this area one year after the electorate voted on this issue. The fact that the Minister has not brought forward proposals to Cabinet indicates that he is delaying the legislation.  What is new?  I would have expected more from a Labour Minister who was unequivocal on this point before and since the election. He is allowing this legislation to be put on the long finger by his Cabinet colleagues who are opposed to it.  This is a shame; it is a double-cross, so to speak, on women who voted for the Labour Party.</P>

      <P>The Southern Health Board has indicated that the total cost of its contract for 300 hip replacement operations with the Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast, is £500,630.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before entering into a contract with the Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast, the Southern Health Board approached all the suitable public and private hospitals in the country.  The board awarded the contract to the Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast, on the basis of competitive cost <Col N="1479" /> and the ability of that hospital to meet the board's requirements in terms of time-scale and quality assurances.</P>
    <P>The arrangements made by the Southern Health Board with the Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast will provide Cork patients with quality care at a reasonable cost and at an earlier date than would otherwise be possible.</P>

      <P>I am extremely disappointed at the way the Minister fudged the question.

      <P>I asked for a breakdown of the costs but I take it that the Minister is not prepared to answer the question. The reason I asked the question is that I am very anxious to ensure that this procedure will be of maximum benefit to the patients involved.  I wish all parties well in this endeavour.  Nevertheless, I am disappointed that these operations were not carried out in Cork.  It is now accepted that our best medical graduates were forced to emigrate over the past ten years.  Are we now commencing a programme for the exportation of Irish patients?  If this is the case, it is particularly sad.  I ask the Minister to outline the follow-up procedures which will be available to these patients on their return to Cork from Belfast.  Will he give an assurance to this House that this is not a yellow pack job?  The fact that the cost involved was approximately £500,000 sterling &mdash; the currency was not explicit from the answer &mdash; requires us to obtain <Col N="1480" /> a detailed breakdown.

I welcome this initiative and I am hoping to develop other initiatives of this sort.  The more cross-Border co-operation we can develop, the better.  I met Lord Arran, the Northern Ireland Health <Col N="1482" /> Minister, last week and we jointly welcomed this initiative.  We are working jointly on areas where we can co-operate and the more people who traverse the Border for good and peaceful reasons, the better.  That is why all of us should welcome this particular development.  I can assure the Deputy that the finest possible care will be afforded those 300 patients and that they will receive excellent aftercare when they return.  The waiting list initiative that I announced will ensure that in excess of 17,000 patients will be treated, who would not have been treated otherwise, over and above the normal throughput this year.  That is to the credit of this Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 111 and 238 together.</P>
      <P>At present, it is not possible to say with certainty what the incidence of breast cancer is in Ireland each year.  This information will be available from next year from the National Cancer Register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1483" /> Unlike lung cancer, for example, with its well documented links with smoking, the causes of breast cancer remain to be clearly established.  Emphasis is therefore placed on early detection at the pre-invasive stage through mammography, and consequent early treatment.  The yield from mammography is highly dependent upon the medical equipment being used and the expertise of the health professionals involved.</P>
    <P>At present in Ireland, mammography is used largely as a diagnostic tool for symtomatic or worried women on referral by their general practitioners.  There are now diagnostic mammography units at 17 hospitals throughout the country and expertise has been growing in all aspects of the early detection of breast cancer and its treatment.</P>
    <P>There has been considerable debate and discussion regarding the effectiveness of mammography screening in reducing mortality from breast cancer. Mammography screening involves the carrying out of mammography on a mass population basis to detect those women with unrecognised breast cancer.</P>
    <P>Studies have been carried out abroad which suggest that well organised screening programmes can reduce deaths from breast cancer in women aged 50 years and over by 25 to 30 per cent among the screened population.  It must be said, however, that medical opinion is divded on the value of mammography as a mass population screening tool and some doctors consider it to be ineffective.</P>
    <P>It is important to mention also that mammography screening programmes tend to be directed at women aged between 50 to 65 years.  Mammography screening programmes are not effective in reducing mortality in younger women and older women have proved reluctant to come forward for screening.</P>
    <P>As a first step, it is essential to establish whether a reduction in the incidence of breast cancer can be achieved in Ireland.</P>
    <P>For these reasons, my Department is supporting a major mammographic breast screening programme currently underway at the Mater foundation.  This <Col N="1484" /> programme, the Eccles Breast Screening Programme, is part of a network of seven pilot schemes on breast cancer screening being carried out within the European Community.  The programme is being carried out in a defined catchment area, North Dublin and Cavan/Monaghan, and this catchment area represents both urban and rural populations.  All women in the catchment area aged between 50 and 64 years are eligible to attend and will be included in two rounds of screening. Written invitations suggesting a date for screening were issued and these were followed with a second invitation in cases where there was no response.  The age group to be screened complies with EC criteria.  The objectives of the study are: to evaluate the impact of mammography screening on mortality from breast cancer among Irish women; to document compliance with a breast screening programme in Irish women and to compare the specificity, sensitivity and predictive value of mammography screening with that reported internationally.</P>
    <P>The programme is expected to conclude towards the end of next year.  The Eccles Breast Screening Programme is the first study of its kind undertaken in this country and, as indicated in the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, decisions on national policy will be based on the conclusions of that survey.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome any research being carried out in the area of breast cancer but will the Minister not agree that while this research is being carried out, Irish women are dying?  By the end of next year over 660 Irish women will have been killed by breast cancer.  It is simply not good enough to wait for the results of research &mdash; and I accept the Minister's point about the younger women &mdash; when quite clearly, looking at the 50 to 69 age group, the arguments for mammography and for a national breast cancer screening programme are irrefutable. We are one of the few European countries without a screening programme, certainly within the EC, and we have the highest mortality rate in Europe <Col N="1485" /> from this disease.  From the responses of women who are concerned about the effect this is having on their peer group, I would have thought the Minister would be taking a far more pro-active role in relation to the whole question of screening. If we are to wait another 12 months&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, a Cheann Comhairle, but I feel very strongly about this issue.  Will the Minister not accept that Irish women cannot wait for the results of this research when there is so much research and evidence already available that lives can be saved now if a national screening programme is introduced? It could quite easily be introduced in Ireland now rather than waiting on the results of the research.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern about the incidence of breast cancer in Ireland.  It is obviously a worrying factor and it is an issue that I have asked my Department to examine.  However, the Deputy is wrong to suggest that we are out of step with the rest of the European Union.  There are only two organised national mammography screening programmes within the European Union, In the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. All the other countries are evaluating, as we are.  In fact, the regional pilot study to which I alluded in my initial reply is part of a Community-wide analysis of the effectiveness of screening. Seven of our EC partners are joining with us in evaluating the effects of screening. The UK and the Netherlands have established a national screening programme and while the indications from the United Kingdom, for example, are hopeful, my officials and the professionals in the World Health Organisation have indicated that it is too early to say that the UK national screening programme will <Col N="1486" /> have a significant impact on reducing mortality.  I want to see the data for Ireland and I want to devise a programme that will be appropriate to the Irish context and will have the impact that we all require in reducing mortality rates from what is a very worrying disease.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that while Scandinavian countries may not undertake breast screening on a national level in the same way as is done in the United Kingdom, certainly they have used mammography to reduce levels of breast cancer.  Would the Minister not accept that the position here cannot be allowed continue until this research has been evaluated?  Would he agree that our facilities are overloaded, that, for example if one goes to St. Vincent's Clinic one may find 120 to 130 women attending a morning clinic that is held once a week, that the clinic is very often under staffed and that, as the figures indicate, the services for women at risk at these clinics is inadequate to meet requirements?  Would the Minister agree also that we do not need to have a register compiled to tell us that 660 women die annually from breast cancer, a statistic which indicates the necessity for urgent attention and a proactive response on his part?  Would the Minister not agree that we have the highest mortality rate within Europe, a matter requiring immediate action, rather than simply viewing it as a general European phenomenon?  Would he not agree, too that this is peculiar to Ireland in that we have a particularly high level of incidence of the disease as a result of which Irish women are dying?</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and we can learn a good deal from research and programmes in existence elsewhere.  The fact that we identify a problem does not mean that we must jump at the first solution offered. If I am to put a national screening programme in place I want to be convinced in the first instance that it will have the impact we all desire, that of reducing mortality.  I am awaiting the concrete results of the initiatives already in place to determine the value of screening.  I must refute the suggestion that facilities here are totally inadequate to protect women's health.  This is an area that receives particular focus within the national health strategy.  Indeed I hope to see an improvement in the already reasonable facilities obtaining.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 73, 92, 95 and 221 together.</P>
      <P>The total amount of approved net expenditure for years prior to 1993 as yet unrecouped by my Department is £51.767 million.  This was the position as at 31 October and has remained unchanged since 31 May 1993.  The details for each board are as set out in the table which I will circulate with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Since taking office I have been acutely aware of the difficulties being experienced by health boards in relation to cash management and of the impact of these difficulties on suppliers.  These problems have arisen because of excess expenditure incurred by health agencies between the years 1984 and 1992.  I have received representations from individual creditors and trade associations on the matter.  The problem has also been raised at the Committee of Public Accounts and by the Task Force on Small Businesses. I am also fully aware that the current position creates a number of serious difficulties for creditors, particularly for smaller enterprises.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I am pleased to inform the House that I have now agreed a refinancing package with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, which will address the entire problem.  The refinancing package will put health board and hospital finances back on a sound footing and will ensure that the agencies' business can be transacted on the appropriate fair and efficient basis.  The details of the package are being finalised.  I am confident that we will see a significant and permanent improvement in the position from 1994 onwards.</P>
      <P>A number of additional measures are being put in place to ensure that the problem does not arise again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's reply and am particularly pleased that he has undertaken an initiative in this regard.  Since the Minister did not say, I put it to him that the whole basis for his initiative was that, since 1984, health boards here have been allowed to incur massive debts to the tune of £81 million.  There is a message in that for the Minister to undertake a total review of the operations of the health boards' system and the manner in which their finances are organised.  Having welcomed the Minister's package, I put it to him that it is extremely important that it be implemented at the earliest possible opportunity.  I would ask him to accept that in this case time is of the essence. For example, is the Minister aware that certain suppliers are threatening to withdraw essential supplies from hospitals simply because they cannot obtain payment? Is he aware that health boards feature among the worse names in terms of bad debtors nationwide, that within certain health board areas payment for basic items such as bread are not being made on time; that jobs will be lost unless this matter is taken on board by the Minister as quickly as possible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, I am aware of the difficulties, and I am proposing to resolve this problem which has been continuing since 1984.  I intend to have the refinancing package in place early next <Col N="1490" /> year so that in 1994 we will see a dramatic improvement in the solvency of the health boards.  I am also cognisant of the points raised by the Deputy in relation to the general financial operations of health boards.  I am considering the entire matter and may well bring forward legislation to regulate the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister define the words &ldquo;refinancing package&rdquo;?  Do they actually mean more money?  Will it mean that henceforth the Eastern Health Board, and other health boards, will be able to pay their bills to small butchers, bakers and so on within their areas, who are at present losing money, since a £3,000 unpaid bill to a butcher, baker or candlestick maker means they will go out of business?  It is all very well for the Minister to say he has a &ldquo;refinancing package&rdquo; agreed.  Will he say whether it will mean more money for the various health boards nationwide?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that Deputy Owen would not at least even welcome the first initiative to be taken in ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to know what it means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It means that those creditors will be paid within a reasonable time rather than the long period they are required to await payment at present.  It also means &mdash; and I shall explain in great detail &mdash; that health boards and voluntary hospitals will be enabled to be more efficient in the way they handle their affairs so that they can obtain better deals for public moneys.  Of course, it means a cash injection to health boards but not on the basis of simply presenting one's bill.  I have to negotiate directly with health boards and I expect a <i>quid pro quo;</i> I expect a great degree of responsibility on the part of health boards so that this phenomenon will not recur.  I know that the Department of Finance would also expect the same response.  I will unveil full details of the refinancing package as soon as I have concluded my <Col N="1491" /> discussions with each individual health board.  But I am convinced and satisfied that it will constitute a significant step forward in allowing health boards operate on an efficient basis for the first time within a decade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome and await with interest details of the Minister's refinancing package.  Did I detect a slight suggestion of a promise of legislation on the part of the Minister to ensure that the public sector, in this case the health boards, operate normal credit terms with their suppliers?  I put it to the Minister that he might give serious consideration to the jobs that have been lost because of the lack of prompt payment, or even payment on normal credit terms, on the part of health boards nationwide.  Would the Minister take a particular interest in the case of a Wexford man who supplied potatoes to the Western Health Board? Potatoes were to the value of £56,000 supplied to a wholesaler who, in turn, supplied all of the institutions catered for by the Western Health Board but when eight months elapsed without payment being made, the man went out of business. Even at this time that same Wexford supplier has not received payment of that £56,000; he appears to be getting it on the drip but effectively three jobs have been lost as a result?  When the Minister is examining his refinancing package and when contemplating legislation would he ensure that such a small creditor will be paid on normal credit terms at present acceptable in trade generally?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;a particular priority in relation to this matter.  I am glad that, within the short time I have been Minister for Health, we have been able to address an issue that has been talked about for virtually a decade, to get that issue <Col N="1492" /> addressed and taken off the agenda. Obviously there will be negotiations in relation to funding all of this package that need to be concluded both with the Department of Finance and with the individual health boards.  I do not want any misapprehension to be created, that somehow there is a Santa Claus going to present a cheque to everybody and it will be business as usual.  I, and indeed the taxpayer, expect that there will be a responsible financial attitude on the part of every health board; indeed such attitude already obtains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am looking forward to giving encouragement to those health boards who are aware of their responsibilities so that we can get the best possible deal for the taxpayers' money.  We are spending a huge sum of money on health services and we are not, in every case, expending it in an efficient manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's initiative in grasping the nettle in relation to the debts of health boards throughout the country.  As a member of the Eastern Health Board I am particularly pleased that under the direction of the finance officer, Mr. Martin Gallagher, we have made great inroads in addressing some of the difficulties which health boards have experienced.  Perhaps health boards throughout the country would look at the working group set up to deal with small businesses, to arrange terms and so on.  I am a little concerned in regard to one or two aspects.  The Minister says he may be considering legislation or putting in place an infrastructure.  I presume he would still recognise the market demands whether 30, 60 or 90 days in relation to credit terms.  If an invoice goes missing one can appreciate that the health board cannot pay in those circumstances.  At the end of the day there are many schemes which cause serious over runs in <Col N="1493" /> the health budgets, such as the GMS scheme&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and, I envisage, the nursing home scheme.  How does the Minister intend to address over-runs in general if he is to correct the health budgets?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious that health boards should operate on a commercially sound basis without impacting adversely on small businesses and suppliers who need to be paid within a reasonable time. I am concerned that the indebtedness which existed for a number of years has prevented health boards from getting proper value-for-money initiatives going and getting proper cost efficiencies. Despite the problems faced by indebtedness there are health boards who managed to get reasonable deals.  I applaud all the efforts made to date, but I want to move on to the next phase.  We must come to an understanding that health boards, like every other Department of State, must live within the allocation given to them.  They cannot simply trundle on at the end of the year and say: &ldquo;Sorry, we are over running, here is the bill&rdquo; and expect that somebody will pick up the tab.  That cannot be allowed to be the culture.</P>
      <P>Obviously there is an exception for demand-led schemes which, historically, have been separate and that is why the Department of Health produces a supplementary estimate annually.  On demand-led schemes, to which people have a statutory entitlement, it is impossible to calculate requirements to the exact penny at the beginning of the year.  There will always be an over-run on demandled schemes.  In relation to the specific budgets of health boards I, this House and the Committee of Public Accounts would expect them to live within the allocation voted by this House.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I would welcome the Minister's new move if I knew what he was talking about. He has said much about serious financial inputs and chats with the Department of Finance.  The Department of Finance clobbers most Ministers.  Would they regard £5 million as a very generous offer?  The Minister might regard £10 million as a great offer, with the result that £41 million would remain outstanding. The business people who are almost out of business, because of the debts, want to know what money will be provided.  Surely the Minister must have an idea as to whether he is talking about £5 million, £10 million or £25 million, which is still only half way.  Can the Minister give us some idea of the amounts in case everyone goes home happy thinking this problem is solved when it is all only a smoke screen?</P>

Once the full details are made public, following the conclusion of all <Col N="1495" /> my discussions, Deputies opposite will be satisfied.  What I have in mind is a restructuring of the entire package of indebtedness, not making a token payment towards it.  The actual payment of that restructuring is being discussed with the health boards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me be very clear about it.  I am concerned, as was the Committee of Public Accounts and I assumed every member of the health boards, that the indebtedness of health boards for the past ten years has prevented health boards from getting the best deal.

      <P>For the Deputy to suggest that this is Machiavellian is bizarre.  We are going to refinance the indebtedness of the health boards.  The particular proportioning <Col N="1496" /> of that will be unveiled in due course.  It will satisfy this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's extensive but evasive replies, he seems to have confused the issue even more in reply to supplementary questions. Can he state clearly in an unambiguous fashion whether we are talking about a remortgage, wiping the slate clean, a cash injection or a loan?  Can he be a little more specific regarding the restructuring or the refinancing he is talking about?  I would recommend an element of caution in his activities.  What plans does the Minister propose to make to ensure an element of fairness in this restructuring?  I understand that a sum of £74 million is necessary under this initiative.  Is the Minister aware that there are good boys and bad boys, good girls and bad girls among the health boards, that some health boards have been allowed get away with overspending of a reckless nature over the years while other health boards have been engaged in very careful husbandry involving cutbacks to the extent that hardship was caused in the community?  Because they did not shout the loudest&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has made a very fair point.  I have spoken twice this year to the members association of health <Col N="1497" /> boards and I made it clear that it will not be a simple matter of my arriving with a cheque and saying: &ldquo;all your indebtedness is wiped away&rdquo;.  Those boards who lived within their allocation should not be penalised in that way.  We have seen too often in local government and elsewhere that some local authorities who neglect an area suddenly get a huge cash injection and those who do their best to live within their income are punished. That will not happen.  That is why I am saying it will not be a uniform application for every health board.  The Deputy opposite is right in saying that there have been those who were less efficient and less responsible than others and they will have to carry the responsibility into the future.  That will be part of the entire package that will be unveiled in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister for a straight answer to a straight question. Can I tell the suppliers who are owed money from health boards that they will be the first priority in this so called refinancing package, that they will not have to continue to act as bankers to the health boards, that their jobs are sound and that they will get their bills paid? Does the Minister accept that the first responsibility on the health boards is to pay their bills?  If I did not pay my bills I would be put in jail.  Would the Minister not accept that the suppliers to the health boards who are owed money for many months, should now be the first priority for payment?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have worked for months to put a package together, and have had negotiations with the Department of Finance and consultations with the health boards.

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 17 and 119 together.  The Food Hygiene Regulations, 1950-1989, which are implemented by the health boards, are applicable to most food enterprises.  The purpose of these regulations is to ensure that there is no danger to public health arising from the preparation and distribution of food from any source which is intended for sale to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of concerns expressed regarding the application of the regulations to small scale food enterprises operating from domestic kitchens.  The Food Safety Advisory Committee, an expert committee which advises the Minister for Health and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry on food matters generally, was asked to consider if the requirements for registration under the food hygiene regulations of food premises engaged in bona fide home baking for local markets were unduly <Col N="1499" /> restrictive.  The committee has completed its report and I am at present considering its recommendations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  Is he in a position to put a time frame on the deliberations and whether the regulations will be introduced before the end of the year?  Does he accept that what he is dealing with is the life blood of rural communities?  No doubt the Minister is aware of the extreme hardship throughout rural Ireland because of the effects of the changes under the Common Agricultural Policy and the GATT to be agreed later this year.  Precisely because of that, the income from the small enterprises is essential to many homesteads.  Will he ensure that his Department does not place a heavy burden of licence fees, levies and certificate to operate?  Will he reassure us that he will bear that in mind before coming to a final conclusion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of the time frame, I hope to be in a position to sign the regulations before Christmas. Deputy Flanagan will be aware of the background.  We have had representations on behalf of small business operators that the food hygiene regulations were being implemented harshly. Deputy Flanagan was one of the many people who made representations and public statements on the matter.  We have taken them to heart and have decided to introduce a more flexible regime for the smaller operators.  I accept Deputy Flanagan's point that many people in rural Ireland are heavily dependent on the income from this source.  The general registration fee under the food hygiene regulations is £200 at present.  However, the Food Safety Advisory Committee has recommended a much smaller fee of £30 for what it terms a permit for these smaller operations.  The amount has not finally been decided but it will be in or around that figure.  We are also considering changes in the present system where a £200 fee is paid for general registration. The Food Safety Advisory Committee <Col N="1500" /> has suggested &mdash; I will put it no more strongly than that &mdash; that for enterprises below a certain size, where its premises is under 50 sq. metres, that the fee be reduced to £100.</P>
      <P>To address Deputy Flanagan's general point, the Minister and I have instructed the environmental health officers to be as flexible as possible &mdash; we are not anti-entrepreneur &mdash; consistent with their responsibilities to assure the health and safety of the public is protected.  There is a question of balance and in order to tilt the balance in favour of the small domestic operator, for whom Deputy Flanagan has made representations, we have decided to introduce a more flexible set of regulations so that the bureaucracy that applies to the bigger operators will no longer be applicable to the smaller operators.  Nevertheless we will continue to take very seriously our responsibilities to maintain the health of the general public as we have an obligation in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased there will be more flexibility.  Is the Minister of State aware that dozens of small enterprises have ceased production or shut it down almost completely with the consequent loss of part-time jobs in rural areas as a result of the over-zealous implementation of the food hygiene regulations? Does he concede that it appears the Department of Health is in conflict with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry in this regard?  One Department is asking people in rural areas to develop small enterprises, yet the Department of Health is shutting down those businesses.  What does the Minister intend to do to redress the loss of jobs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many reasons that an enterprise closes down, quite apart from the attention of the Department of Health.  I do not accept that the Department of Health has been over-zealous. The environmental health officers have bent over backwards to be as fair as possible.  In case there is a misunderstanding of how the regulations <Col N="1501" /> operate in practice, let me confirm that the Department of Health does not close down any enterprise.  The Department of Health has to take a case to the District Court and the judge makes the decision. It is a District Court decision to close the business.  We have instructed the environmental health officers to be as reasonable as possible.  We recognise that the general regime may be too bureaucratic for smaller operators and that is why we are about to introduce a more flexible regime tailored to the needs of those operators.</P>

The regulations I am about to introduce will have the specific effect of reducing the burden on small domestic operators.  That will be one of the specific results of that, but the question of grant aid is for another Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 25 and 43 together.  The underlying philosophy governing the operation of the home help scheme is that it is a community-based good neighbour scheme which would attract people primarily motivated by the desire to engage in community services.  The voluntary nature of the service is underlined by the fact that a significant proportion of part-time home helps are engaged by voluntary bodies.  In the Eastern Health Board region, for example, the service is provided wholly by voluntary groups.</P>
      <P>The salary scale for full-time home helps with effect from 1 January, 1993 is in the range £182.18 - £193.18 per week. This scale is increased in accordance with the increases granted to non-nursing personnel.</P>
      <P>With regard to persons engaged in the home help service on a part-time basis, the rate of remuneration varies throughout the country and the rates are determined by the requirements and type of task undertaken in individual cases.  It should be noted that payments made to part-time home helps do not come within the scope of the PAYE code.  Neither is such income taken into account for the purposes of a means test where a part-time home help for the spouse of a part-time home help is in receipt of a means tested social welfare payment.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for each board to decide on the level of home help service required and the payments to be made to part-time home helps in respect of this service. The Chief Executive Officer of each health board is in the best position to decide on these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned that the home help scheme is developing in an <i>ad hoc</i> way.  There is wide variety in the rates paid.  In the North Western Health Board it is £4 per hour, in the South Eastern Health Board it is £3 per hour, in urban areas of the Eastern Health Board it is £2.50 per hour and in rural areas of the Eastern Health Board it is £1.50 per hour.  The Minister will agree that there is a danger that this scheme <Col N="1504" /> will develop on the backs of badly paid women.  I know this relates to a community neighbourhood policy and that an aura of charity and altruism is there because women who have worked for a long time in the voluntary sector are involved but there is a danger that their altruism will be abused.  Women doing this valuable work deserve to be paid appropriate wages uniformly throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is merit in what the Deputy says.  I do not want to confuse two issues.  Some people want to be good neighbours and informally support elderly people in their own communities. There is a token appreciation for that, not a significant financial payment.  It is interesting that the rate of remuneration varies widely throughout the country. Individual health boards have the authority under the Health Acts to make those determinations, and the standard is not set by my Department.  From health board to health board the type of work varies greatly.  Some home helps are full-time paid professionals and others are good neighbours offering an hour a day to an elderly person in the locality.  I would be concerned if women were seen to be exploited.  It is something that certainly needs to be taken on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny) Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> In view of our discussion on the financial strictures on health boards, would it not be a good investment to pay women a decent hourly rate to look after the elderly, as that would keep them out of expensive hospital beds?  Is this not worthy of serious consideration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is merit in that. The carer's allowance is based on that philosophy and it is something the Government would like to build on.  Here we are talking about a different concept, the case of an elderly person living alone who needs somebody to come in and light the fire and to keep an eye on him for perhaps an hour a day.  Many people do not want that formalised.  They do not want to become involved in the PAYE <Col N="1505" /> system and they do not want it to impact on social welfare payments and so on. We need flexibility here and the chief executive officer of the health board is probably the best person to make the determination in each case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept that this is a remarkably cheap way to keep elderly people in the community and that it requires greater investment? I accept what the Minister says in relation to this work being outside of the PAYE code and that people are not being paid as they would be paid for a job.  If it is not an ordinary job would the Minister not accept that there should be greater flexibility in the scheme?  There are many cases in which people would look after elderly relatives if they could qualify under the home help scheme or for the carer's allowance.  I know of a person who is being paid to mind someones else's relative, even though her father would much prefer if she was minding him.  If it is not an ordinary job surely it can be more flexible in order to cater for such cases.  Would the Minister not accept that there must be a basic minimum below which the payments may not go?  At the moment payments being made in some health boards are less than some young people are getting for baby-sitting.  A payment of £1.50 per hour is simply not enough.  A standard must be set.  Very often women doing this work are doing a tremendous job, even more than they are asked to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>We always have a conflict between devolving authority to the local health board or the local authority, and most people in the Oireachtas wish to devolve more and more authority. However, when there is disparity in relation to the provision of a service <Col N="1506" /> people want uniformity.  I am concerned at the very low levels of remuneration but this should not be seen in strict terms as remuneration for a job, for the reasons I have outlined.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but obviously if we are recruiting people for a job it must come within the PAYE code and payments will be assessed in relation to social welfare and so on.  If that was done a lot of people who are doing a good job looking after neighbours would back away from it.  It is important to leave flexibility for people who want to do this work in an informal way without getting into the PAYE code.  It suits many people to have this on an informal basis and a great deal of good is being done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister distinguish the difference between leaving flexibility with different health boards and abusing the generosity and loyalty of the many women who give this home help caring service at the moment?  Different rates have been quoted but is the Minister aware that in Wexford town home helps are working for £1 an hour?  I have correspondence from them.  I would ask the Minister not to allow the generosity of these women to be abused.  I agree that we should have flexibility but we should have some sort of general code by which health boards operate in terms of the wonderful value they get from women who look after elderly people and save <Col N="1507" /> health boards hundreds of pounds a week by keeping old people out of institutions.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate also when we might have some general standardisation, while allowing some health boards to be more generous than others if they wish?  There should be a bottom line below which no person's generosity is abused.  Those voluntary workers give much more than one hour of their time to caring for the elderly.  They prepare breakfast and light a fire in the morning for the person for whom they are caring, but in most cases they go back at night to ensure the old person is in bed and they do not claim for that second hour.</P>

Others have to do heavy manual work and are employed full-time earning a specific rate of pay.  There must be flexibility in regard to the home help scheme, but my main concern is that the scheme is not exploited.  For that reason I will raise Deputies' concerns with the chief executive officers who have ultimate responsibility for the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the merits of this scheme and the fact that it is very helpful economically to health boards in that it releases a number of hospital beds, has the Minister considered the negative aspects of not having a common scale of payments or adequate payment for the service?  Would he not accept that many more people would volunteer to become home helps if the rate of pay was higher?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that would be the case.  A total of 8,500 home helps are already involved in the service.  A spirit of good neighbourliness is an intrinsic part of the Irish social fabric and many people are willing to participate in the scheme, some on a voluntary basis.  We need to strike a balance in this regard. We should not have to decide instantly that everyone who carries out a good deed must be remunerated or be regarded as a slave, as stated by a Deputy opposite.  That is not a proper way of looking at the system and most people involved in providing the vast range of social supports and services do not look at it in that light.  However, many people because of an ongoing commitment to the elderly deserve financial remuneration. This is the case at present.  Perhaps the rate is inadequate but we will reconsider the matter.</P>

That anomaly needs to be addressed because we are all aware of relatives who do excellent work in the home help field, but are refused payment.

      <P>Is the Minister aware that many of the 8,500 women involved in this service depend on that income in order to live?  It is not simply a matter of exercising some goodwill towards their neighbours.  They depend on the money.</P>

      <P>Many women in my home town depend on that money to meet the weekly grocery bills.  If the Minister seeks a basic income for such women will he assure us that it will not be done at the cost of cutting back on the number of people in the home help service?  It would be simple for the CMO to say that the rate of pay will be increased and subsequently reduce the number of people on the scheme.  This will require extra investment and I hope the Minister will answer in the affirmative in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1510" /> Many people in our society look after their relatives, but those are not the people about whom we are talking.  We are talking about people for whom this small income per week would enable them to care for their elderly relatives rather than have to go to work or provide a home help service for some other person.  This would be an enabling process whereby people could look after their elderly relatives.</P>

The reality is that I have a finite sum of money available to me and if more money is expended on the home help service it will have consequences for other areas.</P>

      <P>I agree that every act of charity should not be paid for.  Some unskilled women are attracted to this form of work because it allows them to earn money outside the usual tax and PRSI systems and it does not interfere with the earnings of their husbands.  At the same time there is a danger that the position of those women might be abused.  They are people who need a little income but the Minister should be careful that their position is not abused.</P>

I have stated frequently in this House that our health and social services could not function to the high degree of quality which they do without <Col N="1511" /> a huge input from voluntary organisations and individuals.  I do not wish to distort that level of voluntarism.  I agree with Deputy O'Donnell that every act of charity and voluntary effort to help in the community should not be accompanied by a demand for remuneration.  We must strike a balance.  We will examine the diversity of rates available and raise it with the chief executive officers.</P>

I hope the Minister will cater for such exceptions.  The Minister's concern regarding people paying tax because they earn £3 per hour might be overcome by giving people the option to carry out a home help service voluntarily.  However, people doing a good job should be paid a reasonable rate of remuneration.  It should not border on slave labour.</P>

      <P>I would like to raise a matter which relates to the business of the House.  I am not sure whether it is you, a Cheann Comhairle, or the Taoiseach who can answer it.  On 1 April we adopted a resolution establishing the Joint Services Committee.  The House <Col N="1644" /> mandated that committee to produce a report within six months on the adequacy of the research and library services for Members of the House.  It is important that that report should be made available to us and to the Minister for Finance before the Estimate for the Houses of the Oireachtas is drawn up.  The committee has not produced that report and there should be some redress available to the House because of the fact that this resolution has not, apparently, been honoured as it should have been.

      <P>I move amendment No. 34:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 12 and 13, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;or</P>
      <P>(c) to enter any vehicle or be within the vicinity of such vehicle,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There is a huge problem in Dublin due to vehicles being stolen.  I had a very helpful reply from a Garda station in my constituency today regarding a particular problem in an area where, according to Garda records, 18 cars had been stolen in a very short period.  The cars were stolen by a number of people who have since been charged by the Garda.  Those people were from many areas, only one or two were from anywhere near the area in question.  The cars are not simply stolen and driven away.  Those who steal the cars drive around, entertaining their friends, in a sort of street version of Mondello Park.</P>
      <P>There is also the problem of cars being damaged by people trying to steal them. I do not believe these figures are reflected in the crime statistics.  It is my understanding that if a car is recovered within a certain period it is not included in the statistics.  In addition, people have simply stopped reporting damage to their vehicles.  If there is damage to locks after an attempted theft has failed because an alarm goes off, it is unlikely that the Garda authorities will be informed because there is not much they can do at that stage.  Therefore, I believe the crime statistics are understated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The theft of vehicles should be mentioned in this section.  It should be an offence to be in the immediate vicinity of such a vehicle with intent to commit a <Col N="1648" /> crime.  I raised this with the Minister on Committee Stage and she undertook to have a look at the issue before Report Stage.  If the Garda find somebody in the immediate vicinity of a vehicle with a jemmy or one of those instruments which, I understand, they now make on FÁS courses and at metal work classes in schools &mdash; I think it is called a plunger and when it is pushed into the lock the whole centre of it can be taken out &mdash; it should be possible to adduce from that that the person has intentions of stealing a vehicle.  In all the circumstances, this would be a reasonable amendment to include.</P>
    <P>I do not have the latest statistics on the number of cars stolen or the number of attempts at thefts of cars.  Has the Minister this information?  It would be a very interesting figure.  The vast majority of people who purchase a car have to spend an extra couple of hundred pounds on an alarm system.  Yesterday, I saw a 1993 car parked outside a swimming pool in what is probably one of the most fashionable suburbs in the city, with a very big chain and padlock on it.  We should not turn our backs on the plight of people who are simply afraid to park their cars in many parts of the country, certainly in many parts of this city.  In all the circumstances it is reasonable that it should be an offence under this section to be found within the immediate vicinity of such a vehicle with intent to steal.  I hope the Minister will take on board the general thrust of the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty with the first part of Deputy Mitchell's amendment which makes it an offence to enter any vehicle.  Clearly it is an offence to break into a vehicle.  However, to make it an offence to be within the vicinity of a vehicle causes me a little difficulty. What is meant by the &ldquo;the vicinity of a vehicle&rdquo;?  If a vehicle is parked on the side of a street, it would be very easy to be within the vicinity of the vehicle. Subsection (2) of this section effectively puts the onus on the person who is accused of this offence of proving his innocence.  It provides that a person who <Col N="1649" /> was present at any place to which subsection (1) relates &mdash; as it stands, subsection (1) relates to either buildings or the curtilage of buildings &mdash; in such circumstances that it is reasonable to conclude that the person was so present as a trespasser with intent to commit an offence, shall be presumed, until the contrary is shown, to be so present with the intent to commit an offence.  I would like to hear the Minister's observations on this, but my reading is that this means there is a presumption of guilt until a person proves his innocence.</P>
      <P>There might be some grounds for saying that somebody who has broken into a house or a vehicle has some explaining to do and would be expected to have a good reason for being there. However, it seems that it is pushing the boat out a bit too far to suggest that there should be a presumption of guilt on the part of someone who is found in the vicinity of a building or a vehicle until his innocence is proven.</P>
      <P>I would like to hear the Minister's explanation of how this would work.  I would give rise to much difficulty and is a matter that might be usefully looked at before the Bill goes to the Seanad.  Our law has always been based on the principle of innocent until proven guilty. Great difficulties will arise if we stand that principle on its head and assumptions are made that people are guilty until they prove their innocence in respect of offences such as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with Deputy Mitchell's view that people who break into cars are a scourge.  However, I agree with Deputy Gilmore's remarks. If being found in the vicinity of a car with intent to commit an offence &mdash; an offence which falls short of attempting to break into a car &mdash; is to be criminalised, that would create an offence of a very uncertain nature.  If a well known car radio thief is seen walking down the street looking into cars or slouching at a lamp post near a car, will his behaviour be construed as committing an offence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I sympathise with the purpose of Deputy Mitchell's amendment, but I <Col N="1650" /> have grave doubts as to whether the law should be pushed that far.  Subject to the Minister's correction, I understand the Road Traffic Acts provide that it is an offence to attempt to enter a vehicle without the consent of the owner and there is a hefty penalty for that offence.  The unauthorised taking of a car carries a penalty of five years imprisonment.  To extend a similar penalty to people who are found slouching at lamp posts near parked cars stretches the criminal law further than it can reasonably be imposed.  Will the Minister indicate if she is satisfied with the law in relation to people being found in a public place with items which may be used to commit offences?  I am aware that under the Larceny Act it is an offence for a person to travel abroad carrying housebreaking equipment in his or her possession.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell's worries may be addressed to some extent if the criminal law is extended to cover situations where a person is found in a public place in circumstances which suggest he or she intends to commit an offence and is in possession of implements for that purpose. I understand the Larceny Act covers a person who travels abroad equipped for theft, but I do not believe it covers a person who may carry equipment to hot-wire vehicles or force locks to gain entry to vehicles.  I ask the Minister to investigate, between now and the Bill going to the Seanad, if interference with vehicles is adequately covered by present law and if it is a criminal offence for a person to be equipped to interfere with vehicles.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy McDowell's remarks.  There is enough legislation on the Statute books in relation to the Road Traffic Acts to cover situations where people may be found in the vicinity of vehicles.  This amendment may be mirroring the provisions of section 50 of the Road Traffic Act.  That section covers a person who may be found in possession of keys in or around the vehicle in relation to drunk driving incidents.  Under that section it may be construed that such a person may be <Col N="1651" /> attempting to commit a road traffic offence.  Deputy Mitchell's amendment may be attempting to cover what is already covered by road traffic legislation. I agree with Deputy McDowell that the position in respect of vehicles is well covered under existing legislation and that Deputy Mitchell's amendment may be covering an area that is not envisaged in respect of public order.  There may be a case for introducing new road traffic legislation, but this is not the appropriate legislation to provide for this.</P>

      <P>I support the notion intended in the amendment, namely, to deal with positions where vehicles are entered or interfered with.  However, while the first part of the amendment in respect of entering any vehicle is covered by the Road Traffic Acts, the second part of the amendment is not.  The second part of the amendment is too vague to deal with the problem which Deputy Mitchell seeks to address, namely, people who loiter with intent and interfere with vehicles.  Vehicles are parked by footpaths, main streets and everybody can stroll pass or loiter in the vicinity of vehicles.  It would be extremely difficult to make being in the vicinity of a vehicle a criminal offence.</P>
      <P>I do not accept the amendment in its present form.  I would welcome a statement from the Minister outlining the provisions of the Road Traffic Acts in respect of the first part of Deputy Mitchell's amendment refers to entering a vehicle with the intention to trespass and commit an illegal act.  That is not stated in the Deputy's amendment, though it is stated in section 11 (1) (a) and (b).</P>

      <P>We had a lengthy debate on these amendments on Committee Stage and I an unable, essentially for the reasons which I gave at that time, to accept the amendments tabled by Deputy Mitchell.  However, I and, I am sure, the previous speakers, appreciate what the <Col N="1653" /> Deputy seeks to achieve.  I hope the Deputy will accept, in the light of what I have to say, that these amendments are not necessary and could if included in the Bill, give rise to legal difficulties as referred to by Deputies.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that amendment to section 11 raises two separate issues.  First, the amendment provides that it should be a specific criminal offence for a person to enter a vehicle with intent to commit a crime.  The situation the Deputy is concerned about is already adequately covered under existing law and, accordingly, I do not see any need for creating a new offence along the lines he has suggested.  In particular, I would draw the Deputy's attention to the Criminal Damage Act, 1991, which makes it an offence to damage another person's property, including a vehicle. The maximum penalty for a criminal damage offence under the 1991 Act is imprisonment for ten years and a fine of £10,000.  In addition, where a person enters a vehicle without causing damge to it he can, depending on the circumstances, be charged with attempt to commit larceny or unlawful taking of the vehicle.  In that context also the amendment to section 13 would appear to be superfluous given that it is difficult to envisage circumstances where a person enters another vehicle in a manner which causes fear in another person where another crime or an attempt to commit another crime was not being committed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second part of the amendment would make it an offence for a person to be in the vicinity of a vehicle with intent to commit an offence.  I have given serious consideration to this proposal and I do not think it would achieve the Deputy's purpose.  The Deputy may have proceeded on the basis that a person who is intent on stealing or breaking into a car will spend a significant amount of time close to the car before committing the crime.  The reality in most of these cases, however, is that where a criminal finds a likely target he does not tend to wait around but commits his offence without delay.  In any event, where a person has anything in his custody or under his control <Col N="1654" /> to damage any property belonging to some other person &mdash; say, for example, implements intended for use in hotwiring or forcing an entry into a car &mdash; this too is an offence under section 4 of the Criminal Damage Act, 1991, with a maximum penalty of up to ten years. Thus, from a practical point of view I am not convinced that the proposal the Deputy has made would make any additional contribution to tackling the problem of offences involving vehicles.</P>
    <P>I have a further concern about the second limb of the Deputy's amendment. It is that the wording in so far as it would relate to a vehicle would be extremely difficult to interpret and this could give rise to legal difficulties.  In that regard I should mention that the offences which are provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) of section 11 (1) are related to trespassing on property.  I would be concerned that what the Deputy has proposed would lead to enforcement disficulties &mdash; for example would a person have to be in the vicinity of a vehicle for a certain length of time before he could be charged &mdash; and this is another reason I cannot accept it.  The considerations of proof in relation to establishing that some one was in the vicinity of a building for the purpose of trespassing onto it with intent to commit a crime would in reality be different from those in relation to crimes involving vehicles.</P>
    <P>For the reasons I have given I cannot accept the Deputy's amendments.  I know that the Deputy is sincere in trying to address the serious problem of thefts of and damage to motor vehicles but I do not think that the amendments would make any worthwhile contribution towards dealing with the problem.  I hope he can accept that the existing law which I have outlined is sufficient.  By putting down the amendment he has provided a good opportunity to highlight these laws and the various remedies available under the Criminal Damage Act, 1991.  I believe that the powers being given to the Garda under section 8 to move people on, for example, where there are grounds to apprehend for the safety of vehicles <Col N="1655" /> should help deal with the type of problems the Deputy has outlined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made the point in relation to the amendment to section 11 and there is obviously no support for it.  It seems strange that the existing legislation is not being applied in relation to the number of interferences with and thefts of vehicles.  It is extremely risky to park a car anywhere in this city and in other parts of the country, too, because of the likelihood of its being stolen.  Perhaps I did not sufficiently address the second part of my amendment No. 38 which proposes the insertion in the section of the words &ldquo;or vehicle&rdquo;.  In the event of the amendment being accepted section 13 (1) would read as follows: &ldquo;It shall be an offence for a person, without reasonable excuse, to trespass on any dwelling or the curtilage thereof or vehicle in such a manner as causes or is likely to cause fear in another person&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Are Members of the House aware that at a number of crossroads and bridges, certainly in Dublin &mdash; one example is Dolphins Barn Bridge in my constituency &mdash; it is very dangerous for a woman to stop her car?  This relates particularly to women who carry handbags in the car &mdash; men do not tend to leave their wallets lying on the seat of their cars.  It is a regular occurrence for a car window to be smashed, causing fear to the driver of the vehicle.  This is a separate offence from simply stealing or snatching a handbag. It terrifies people, causing them great distress, and should be treated as a separate offence.  It has been suggested that in some cases rats are thrown into cars to terrorise drivers so that goods can be taken from the car or the car can be stolen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members of this House have been mugged at the crossing to which I referred.  I am one such victim.  It is clear that this House is out of touch with reality.  We do not realise the extent of the terror being experienced by people while travelling in their cars.  Any gurrier who smashes the window of a car while it is stopped at traffic lights or elsewhere <Col N="1656" /> should be liable to a penalty similar to that proposed for the offence of trespassing on any dwelling or the curtilage thereof as provided for in section 13, a penalty on summary conviction of a fine not exceeding £1,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both.  That would be a perfectly reasonable provision to include in this section.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether Members have read amendment No. 38 in the context of the section.  I presume they have because this matter was debated on Committee Stage.  The offence for which I am trying to provide should be a separate one.  To take a handbag or other property from a car is an offence in itself, but putting terror into the driver of the car should be a separate offence.  Therefore I believe that these amendments are perfectly reasonable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>A gurrier who is merely standing at Baggot Street Bridge will not be deemed to be committing an offence.  If someone does something wrong they are deemed to have committed an offence but it is very hard to envisage a criminal law which will deal with a gurrier who &ldquo;might&rdquo; do something.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to widen the criminal trespass notion to cover situations which do not relate solely to trespass with an intent to commit an offence.  My colleagues and I tabled this amendment to draw to the Minister's attention a defect in our criminal law as it stands.  For example, I am not aware of any law, though I am open to correction on this, which makes it an offence for me to walk into the Department of Justice with a view to leaving a tape recorder under the Minister's desk, looking at the files in her office or taking photographs of documents in her possession. Perhaps this is an offence under the Official Secrets Act, but I am not talking about the State.  For example, it is not an offence to go into a trade union office and leave a tape recorder there or to go into a business competitor's premises with a view to rooting through his files for the purpose of seeing what is there.  The offence of burglary is trespassing with the intention to commit a felony.  Under the offence of criminal trespass as proposed by the Minister one must intend to commit an offence. However, a person who, under false pretences, breezes into a place where confidential information is stored, who stays on a premises after hours with a view to looking at files or, as was supposed to have been done by a major criminal in this city, goes into the Director of Public Prosecution's office to see what is on file and goes through the available evidence against him, is not deemed to have committed an offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My party want situations such as the famous Watergate scandal in America, where the individuals in question committed <Col N="1658" /> the crime of burglary and were so convicted to be taken into account in this legislation.  Under our criminal law there is no offence of trespassing on somebody else's premises with the intent to unlawfully interfere with their property, for example, by leaving a tape recorder, rooting through their private documents, etc.  It is not an offence for a member of the press to leave a camera or a recorder in a person's house or enter their house for that purpose.  The <i>Daily Mirror</i> may be light years ahead of our media in its inventiveness, as shown recently.  If an Irish newspaper left a tape recorder or bugging equipment in an office belonging to a politician or business man or in somebody's home and it was subsequently proven that one of its sleuths, newshands, had done it, it would not be deemed to have committed an offence under our law as it stands.</P>
    <P>It is very important for people to be entitled to some criminal sanction against someone who enters their house, not with the intention of stealing or committing a crime but to root through their personal documents to find out something about them.  Private detectives in Ireland have a free licence to enter any newspaper office and root around to see what they can find.  This is wrong.  Therefore, we should extend the offence of criminal trespass to cover situations where the intent is not to commit a further offence but rather to invade privacy or commit a similar civil wrong.  The amendment proposes that it should be an offence to enter a place with intent to interfere with any property therein.  Perhaps there is a better way of phrasing this proposal.  It should be a criminal offence for a person to walk into a businessman's office or a newspaper and leave a tape recorder there.  The law as it stands is adequate in this regard.  I will not press the matter further.</P>

This matter should be considered, if not in the context of this legislation, perhaps in the context of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  I would like to hear the Minister's arguments for and against the amendment before I come down in favour of it.</P>
      <P>The amendment raised a general point which needs to be addressed.  Concerns do not arise only about the criminal intent of people who invade property or privacy and use surveillance or recording equipment to steal ideas of copyright or to go through files.  I am very concerned about the number of advertisements for the sale of surveillance equipment which is easily available and easy to use.  Under this Bill the advertisement of brothels is banned. I am not sure if it would be correct to ban the advertising of surveillance equipment in this Bill, but nevertheless a fundamental question arises here which needs to be addressed.  There is a standard advertisement in in-flight magazines and other magazines available in the city for the sale of easy to use surveillance equipment.  There is something seriously wrong with this sort of advertising in principle. It is wrong that a person should unknowingly have their deeds or actions recorded for whatever purpose &mdash; it is an infringement of their rights.</P>
      <P>These advertisements are not directed merely at individuals: some of them suggest that the equipment can be used by business people to learn their opponents' trade secrets.  They may even try to sell the equipment to TDs so that they can learn what other TDs are up to.  This matter needs to be examined and should be legislated for.  I am not in favour of interfering with the legitimate right of people to make necessary recordings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1660" /> However, there is something undemocratic about a business which makes its profits by selling surveillance equipment over which there is absolutely no control. I ask the Minister to give some consideration to this matter.  She may consider dealing with it under the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill or some other Bill.</P>

      <P>With regard to amendment No. 34, I do not think the kinds of instances given by Deputy Mitchell would come within the category of trespass. They might come within the category of malicious damage.  That is the point we were trying to make &mdash; we empathise with what Deputy Mitchell was seeking to do but it is taken care of in other legislation.  People who interfere with cars in that way would not be trespassing on the cars as such.</P>
      <P>With regard to amendment No. 35, I understand what Deputy McDowell is seeking to do.  While I agree that this offence should be extended I have a problem with the wording of the amendment which states that it shall be an offence &ldquo;to unlawfully interfere with any property&rdquo;. There is really no definition of &ldquo;unlawfully interfering with property&rdquo;. That would have to be clarified in some way.  Rather than dealing with it in this legislation it could perhaps be dealt with in some form of invasion of privacy legislation, having regard to the various scandals that have taken place, such as Watergate, where bugging devices were used.  We should have legislation with a wider scope which would cover areas such as entering a premises with intent to interfere with property, whether it be papers or otherwise.  I agree with the intent of the amendment.</P>

      <P>I agree with the amendment. Deputy McDowell has highlighted a gap in the law regarding interference with property and that needs to be addressed.  I am not sure whether this is the precise way to do it but he has certainly put the issue on the agenda and I compliment him for having done so.</P>
      <P>Deputy McDowell did not refer to amendment No. 36 which I believe is being taken with this amendment.  It addresses the point I made earlier about subsection (2) which seems to contain a presumption of guilt until one proves one's innocence.  If a person is found in a building or in the vicinity of a building, there is a presumption in subsection (2) that that person is there to commit a crime unless he or she can show to the contrary.  That is a dangerous provision and I agree with amendment No. 36 which proposes to delete that subsection. I would have thought it was possible to deal with that issue without having this presumption of guilt until one proves one's innocence.</P>

      <P>As a lay person I listened carefully to the Members who are familiar with legal language.  We are in their hands when it comes to the interpretation of the law.  We depend greatly on the contributions of Members with a legal backgrounds to advice us.  However, as a lay person one cannot fail to have opinions on issues that will affect the majority of lay people.  The general public are no trained in the law and therefore depend on Members of the House to examine legislation, thereby ensuring that it contains nothing that could be used <Col N="1662" /> subsequently for purposes for which it was not intended.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 35 would appear to be reasonable but I wish to be reassured in regard to a particular point.  People who enter Government Buildings and other public buildings could find themselves in the very awkward position of having to explain why they are there. People of a legal background try to define everything and cover all eventualities. They try to forecast problems down the line that cannot even be envisaged at this stage.  If a person was found on a premises who could not give a reasonable explanation for being there but who had no intent to commit a crime or to destroy or interfere with property, there is an onus on that person to prove that he or she had not intended committing such a crime.</P>
      <P>I understand the thinking behind the amendment but as a lay person I am concerned that this problem could arise on occasion in the future.  If I am proved wrong in this regard, so be it, but it must be absolutely clear in this legislation who defines that the offence is an offence.  In other words, who will decide whether a person is on a premises with the intention of committing a crime or interfering with material?  I would like the Minister to respond in this regard.</P>

      <P>It would seem that the first part of Deputy McDowell's amendment is covered in the section that he seeks to delete namely, &ldquo;in circumstances giving rise to the reasonable inference that such entry or presence was with intent to commit an offence ...&rdquo;.  The actual section that he wishes to delete states &ldquo;... in such circumstances that it is reasonable to conclude that the person was so present as a trespasser with intent to commit an offence, ...&rdquo;.  It would seem to me that they are coterminous and that that part of the amendment is repeating what is there already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We then come to the second part of Deputy McDowell's amendment which states &ldquo;with intent to unlawfully interfere with any property situate therein.&rdquo;.  If someone is being penalised for trespassing with intent to commit an offence, <Col N="1663" /> surely &ldquo;with intent to unlawfully interfere with any property&rdquo; would be regarded also as the commission of an offence or am I to take it from what Deputy McDowell said that we do not have this category of criminal offence?  It would seem that &ldquo;with intent to commit an offence&rdquo; should cover the other categorisation in the amendment, namely, &ldquo;with intent to unlawfully interfere with any property situate therein&rdquo;.  I would like clarification from the Minister in this regard because it would appear that the matter is adequately covered in section 11.</P>
    <P>I share also the concerns articulated by my colleague in relation to what is an inference in a case where someone might be on a premises with some equipment on their person but might have casually entered that premises for a particular purpose.  Obviously, it is a very subjective matter as to whether that equipment could be used for purposes which might be described as unlawful, whether it involves a piece of electronic equipment or otherwise.  There is a question as to what is a subjective inference and what is a reasonable objective inference in relation to a case of that nature and I would like to hear what the Minister has to say on the matter.</P>

      <P>Deputies will recall that when we discussed this Bill on Committee Stage, an amendment similar to these amendments was tabled in the name of Deputy Harney and Deputy McDowell.  At that time, we had quite a lengthy discussion and I explained that there were difficulties with the wording of the amendment but that between then and now I would consider the possibility of marrying the intention of the Committee Stage amendment with the wording contained in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am now faced with a problem because the amendment before us takes a somewhat different approach from the amendment put down on Committee Stage.  I have listened carefully to Members and I do not think any Member has raised very substantial objections to Deputy <Col N="1664" /> McDowell's amendment.  Although I am not sure that he is pressing to have the amendment accepted, I would be disposed towards accepting it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell was concerned about an issue that I have raised within the Department in relation to the advertising of various pieces of surveillance equipment. That is an issue I am examining in the context of the Miscellaneous Provisions Bill.  If there are proposals I can put in place in that Bill or in a more appropriate one, I will be delighted to do so.</P>
    <P>A number of Members asked what was the difference between what is sought in the amendment and what is now contained in the Bill.  I am not sure that there is a substantial difference.  One might contend, as have a number of Members, that in reality there is no difference between what is proposed in the amendment and what is contained in the Bill. Having said that, I am disposed to accepting Deputy Michael McDowell's case.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Eamon Walsh who asked: who decides?  I am delighted we have now decided that gurriers can appear in pinstripe suits as well as in denims, a very important point made by a number of Members.  With regard to who decides, of course it is the courts who will decide.  It will be up to the Garda to provide the evidence to enable a case to stand.  In the absence of any strong objections by other Members to the amendments, as proposed, I am prepared to accept them.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister is accepting our amendments.  Just in case a query is raised about our proposed removal of section 11 (2) and its replacement by &ldquo;reasonable inference&rdquo;, I should say that as at present drafted subsection (2) says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A person who was present at any place to which subsection (1) relates in such circumstances that it is reasonable to conclude that the person was so present as a trespasser with intent to commit an offence, shall be presumed, until the contrary is shown, to be so <Col N="1665" /> present with the intent to commit an offence.</P>
    <P>I honestly do not think that was very happily phrased, with respect to the draftsman.  Effectively, it meant that if the court reasonably concluded that a person was there with criminal intent, it should be presumed that one was there with criminal intent; whereas in fact a court will not conclude something unless it is proven beyond reasonable doubt. Therefore, a presumption of something already established by the evidence beyond reasonable doubt is not much help.  I am glad the Minister is accepting the amendment because I think it will improve the Bill.</P>

      <P>I raised an issue and perhaps the Minister or Deputy Michael McDowell would address it.  That was the definition of &ldquo;to unlawfully interfere with any property.&rdquo;  As far as I am aware, there is not definition of unlawfully interfering with property.  Would the Minister or Deputy McDowell say whether there is any provision in any Bill that would address that issue?

      <P>In page 6, line 28, to delete &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;building&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We agree with the proposal in section 13 (1) to render it an offence for a person, <Col N="1666" /> without reasonable excuse, to trespass on any dwelling or the curtilage thereof in such a manner as causes or is likely to cause fear in another person.  But I think the provision should apply to all buildings, because the manner in which a person trespasses in order to cause fear can happen just as easily in a building that is not a dwelling place as it can in a dwelling, in particular, large business premises &mdash; for example, somewhere like a warehouse, where there might be very few people or one person on his own, so that the sudden appearance of a trespasser could cause a great deal of fear. Similarly, in the case of something like an agricultural building, if somebody is accosted there, almost certainly they would be alone; but it would not be a dwelling place.</P>
    <P>While accepting that the section, as drafted, covers the greater number of such cases &mdash; no doubt the majority of cases the Minister is endeavouring to cater for do happen in dwelling places &mdash; I do not think it would be unfair to extend it to buildings generally.  For example, such an incident could arise in the case of an hotel which could cause a great deal of fear, depending on the circumstances of the trespass, or equally in certain types of business premises.  Obviously, it would not apply in the case of a a busy shop or the like, because probably it would not cause fear in the same way; but certainly it would cause such fear in a remote building that was not a dwellinghouse, or could cause such fear in the case of a large, thinly populated business premises such as a warehouse or some remote building standing alone.</P>
    <P>For those reasons I would ask the Minister to give careful consideration to extending the scope of the section in the slight manner suggested by this amendment, which I think would be useful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what Deputy O'Malley said in regard to the amendment.  Perhaps there is a reason that the draftsman restricted it to &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo;. The case advanced by Deputy O'Malley is a good one and should be accepted by the Minister.  I should like <Col N="1667" /> to know whether the Minister has any objection to so doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. Wallace Mr. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I too would be interested in the Minister's reply, because the term &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo; to most people means a place where somebody lives or resides.  I gave an example at an earlier stage of a local convent in my parish of Farranree where youths congregate right beneath the windows at night, only 100 yards from the main road, causing tremendous problems there and at the schools adjoining that convent.  The fact that they can congregate there at all hours of the night causes huge problems.  While the Garda can go in there, there is very little they can do unless these people are causing some definite disturbance.</P>
      <P>I too would be interested to hear why the term &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo; has been inserted here.  If the Minister can confirm that the term covers premises such as those I have just mentioned, I would be very pleased; but I would be interested to hear her confirm that fact.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, agree with Deputy O'Malley's amendment.  As I understand it, the term &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo; is very specific.  As a lay person, I would presume it meant a place where one resided, a home or some dwelling occupied by people; whereas the term &ldquo;building&rdquo; would appear to be more appropriate so that the provisions of the Bill would cover such premises.  If the term &ldquo;building&rdquo; is substituted I would presume that that would cover dwellings also.  I would be interested to hear whether the Minister has any difficulty with that proposal.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think anybody in the House has any difficulty with Deputy O'Malley's amendment.  Changing the word &ldquo;dweling&rdquo; to the word &ldquo;building&rdquo; means that <Col N="1668" /> automatically dwelling will be included. I have no difficulty in accepting that amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 6, line 32, to delete &ldquo;12 months&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;6 months&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not a major amendment but it does seem that a term of 12 months imprisonment, on summary conviction, is somewhat excessive for this new offence, particularly when the monetary side of it is limited to a fine of £1,000.  I would think that for almost anybody 12 months imprisonment is umpteen times worse than a fine of £1,000.  The people who are likely to be sentenced to imprisonment are those who would have no possibility of paying a fine.  In the circumstances perhaps a six month prison term would be adequate, particularly where this is a new, statutory type offence.  It is not simply a re-enactment of some old common law offence that existed for hundreds of years.  This is broader in its intent and in its coverage than many offences <Col N="1669" /> of a similar type.  I ask the Minister to consider the possibility of a six month term of imprisonment because 12 months seems to be out of all proportion to £1,000.  I understand the £1,000 fine is limited for constitutional reasons in a court of summary jurisdiction.  If it were challenged the High Court would almost certainly have to come to the conclusion that 12 months imprisonment is much more severe than a fine of £1,000 and is probably equivalent to a fine of £5,000 or £10,000 or even more.  One wonders if a period of 12 months imprisonment would be open to a constitutional challenge. Perhaps the Minister has some views about it.  She might consider the amendment favourably.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the point being made by Deputy O'Malley.  I have some concerns about this amendment which are on the following lines. A growing offence in Dublin relates to dwellings.  Because houses have alarms, burglars are waiting for people to enter their houses and turn off the alarms before actually carrying out the burglary. I suspect there is a proliferation of breakins while people are in their homes, whereas heretofore I suspect burglars waited for people to go out before committing the offence.  If somebody enters a dwelling while the occupant is present and instils fear in them, it comes back to the same principle I mentioned on amendment No. 38.  In circumstances where the courts see fit it should be open to them to impose that stiffer sentence of nine or 12 months imprisonment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section as drafted refers to &ldquo;a fine not exceeding £1,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both&rdquo;.  We should leave the option to the courts.  If the Minister feels otherwise I will not press this amendment.  I understand the points being made by Deputy O'Malley, which are not unreasonable. The amendment is about the question of fear.  Section 13 (1) provides that it shall be an offence for a person to trespass on any dwelling in such a manner as causes or is likely to cause fear in another person.  The incidence of breaking into <Col N="1670" /> dwellings where people are present is on the increase.  In some cases weapons are left near exits in case somebody should attempt to block their escape.  I have misgivings about the amendment.  My preference would be to leave the section as it stands and to leave the decision to the courts.</P>

      <P>I had not intended to intervene but I support Deputy Mitchell in that I believe the term of imprisonment should remain at 12 months.  In our legislation we should show the public and the criminals that we mean business.  At the end of the day the judge has discretion to impose a sentence.  If the term of imprisonment was pitched at six months it might not mirror the gravity of this type of crime.</P>

      <P>I have no strong view in relation to the amendment except that I would echo the points made by Deputies Mitchell and Ahern.  Sometimes when we put down a marker in legislation in relation to a maximum penalty everybody assumes immediately that the maximum becomes the norm.  In fact, as we see the courts operating, the maximum does not become the norm in very many cases.  I would be inclined to go along with both Deputies when they say we should leave some discretion to the judges.  They will hear both sides of the story, will be privy to all the information and all the evidence and will have had the opportunity of hearing the person accused being cross-examined by the law-years from both sides.  I have no strong views on the amendment but perhaps Deputy O'Malley, as a former practising lawyer, would accept that it would be better to leave the imposition of the term of imprisonment to the judge.</P>

While the term of imprisonment of 12 months may appear excessive particularly by comparison with the fine &mdash; it is a new offence of a statutory <Col N="1671" /> nature &mdash; nonetheless it is probably as well to leave the discretion to the court in the hope that they will exercise it sensibly, as I am sure they will.</P>

      <P>These amendments arise from similar amendments Deputy Gay Mitchell tabled on Committee Stage in relation to riot and affray which I promised to look at again.  I am grateful to Deputy Mitchell for having raised the issues involved.  I am advised that such a provision is not necessary in the case of a riot as, unlike in the case of unlawful assembly, actual violence has to be used.  However, I understand there would be merit in including such a provision in the case of affray, as has already been done in the case of violent disorder.  This is proposed in amendment No. 41.  Amendment No. 40 is essentially a technical drafting matter intended to ensure consistency between sections 15 and 16.</P>

I note that this section and the previous section &mdash; section 14 &mdash; included new offences of riot and violent disorder.  Does this have implications for the criminal injuries code <Col N="1672" /> where, at present, in order to qualify for malicious injury compensation one has to get a certificate from the local superintendent stating that an illegal organisation was involved or that there was a riot?</P>
      <P>Section 15 (5) may take care of this situation but I wonder if sections 14 and 15 restrict the qualification under the malicious injury code?</P>

      <P>In page 8, to delete lines 37 to 39.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of my amendment to delete paragraph (a) of section 17 (3) would be to ensure that the offence set out in section 17 could not be triable summarily. The reason we tabled an amendment that blackmail, extortion and demanding money with menaces should not be triable summarily is that the offences envisaged by section 17 are very serious.  When one reads the section, one does not get a full idea of what is involved but it is stated more clearly in the side note where the offences are described in the terminology used previously.  I assume this section is in addition to the common law crimes of blackmail, extortion and demanding money with menaces.  In the present context the crimes of blackmail, extortion and demanding money with meances are, <Col N="1673" /> unhappily, quite common.  They were not common years ago and were regarded as very serious crimes.  They are still very serious but because they are more common, people are less shocked by them.  If somebody is convicted of blackmail, extortion or demanding money with menaces he should not be tried summarily and given the opportunity of being fined a sum of only £1,000 if convicted.  I am making the opposite argument here from what I made on an earlier section because the penalties that can be imposed on summary conviction are not adequate for the series of crimes envisaged by this section, which should be tried on conviction.</P>
    <P>An alternative would be to seek to increase the maximum penalties under the summary conviction paragraph (3) (a), but that cannot be done because it would be unconstitutional to go beyond the two figures mentioned in the paragraph. A person accused of any one of the three offences, which I regard as very serious, should be tried on indictment and the summary option should not be open to him.  In the past &mdash; I am talking about 30-50 years ago &mdash; people convicted of those common law offences of blackmail, extortion and demanding money with menaces tended to be sentenced to very long terms of imprisonment. These crimes were relatively rare, but, unhappily, they are now almost a daily occurrence.  Every effort should be made to put them down and it should not be possible for somebody to make a bargain whereby he would plead guilty to some lesser offence if dealt with in the District Court.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the question of kidnapping was not raised on Second or Committee Stages, I am advised it is not possible to put down an amendment on this Stage. We must take a very strong stand on the question of kidnapping and demanding money with menaces.  I am sorry it is not possible to amend the Bill to make <Col N="1674" /> kidnapping an offence that carries with it not just a life sentence but a life sentence for a minimum of 20 years, the sentence for attempted capital murder.</P>
    <P>The kidnapping offence should at least equate with that but since we cannot deal with that offence under this Bill the section dealing with blackmail, extortion and demanding money with menaces needs to be strengthened.</P>
    <P>People do not kidnap others simply for the notoriety but because they intend to demand money with menaces or to blackmail others.  This House needs to take a strong stand on that type of behaviour. Sadly, there is evidence that the offence of demanding money with menaces is on the increase.  We should put down a marker that this offence will not be dealt with summarily and that in future all such cases will be dealt with on indictment and that, if convicted, somebody may go to prison for up to 14 years and pay a fine of an indeterminate nature. Knowing the type of sentence to be applied, might put the frightners on people who have an intention of committing such crimes and it may also persuade some of those involved to have second thoughts.</P>
    <P>I support Deputy O'Malley's amendment and I hope the Minister finds it possible to accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>While I agree with some of the sentiments expressed by Members on the opposite side it boils down to a matter of degree.  Earlier, we were discussing the issue of the Judiciary's discretion and perhaps when initiating legislation we should be concentrating on giving the DPP and the prosecuting gardaí power to use their discretion in the use of particular legislation.  I understand there is existing legislation, the Larceny Act, which deals with some ares of minor offences.  If we restrict this Bill we are, in effect, restricting the discretion of the prosecution to go one way or the other, for example, when an itinerant is begging on the main street, he is, in effect, demanding money with menaces.  If this amendment was accepted we would be restricted to treating this as a minor <Col N="1675" /> offence under the section.  Another example is where bigger schoolboys demand money &mdash; known as &ldquo;odds&rdquo;&mdash; from younger schoolboys.  It is a matter of degree.  I understand that the intention behind this amendment is to deal with more serious offences but I am loath to restrict the discretion of those instituting the proceedings to decide which Act to invoke.  I believe the Minister should let things stand the way they are.</P>

There may be other legislation to deal with the area of protection money, another activity that we read about frequently. Whether it is hearsay or otherwise there seems to be clear evidence that it is going on.  If this section is to deal with the problem we must make it clear that it cannot be allowed continue.  It must be stressed that there is a determination on all sides of the House to ensure that the Garda have the necessary powers to deal effectively with that type of crime.</P>

      <P>Most, if not all, cases under the heading will be tried on indictment.  I would like to send out the sort of signal suggested by Deputies O'Malley and Mitchell to people involved in the kind of activity in question. Nevertheless, it is important to leave the discretion to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Deputy Ahern mentioned the kinds of cases which might rarely arise, but it is safer to leave the discretion to the DPP.  The Director of Public Prosecutions might decide that a case should be tried summarily and the District Court might refuse to accept <Col N="1676" /> jurisdiction on the basis that the offence was of such gravity that it should be dealt with in a higher court but, on balance and having listened to all the contributions, we should leave the discretion there.  I am sure Deputy O'Malley would not envisage the Director of Public Prosecutions directing that a very serious offence would be sent to the District Court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's response as she has been fair and open minded about all of the amendments that have been tabled.  I did not want to go into specific detail in relation to this but what happened a little over a week ago is exactly what is covered here &mdash; extortion and demanding money with menaces.  So that the Minister and the House will understand the seriousness of this, the menace with which money was demanded was that if the person did not pay up, his wife and children would be injured or killed.  What menace, what extortion can be greater than that?  It should not be possible to have such cases tried in the District Court because of their seriousness.  If the word went out from this House that if one is charged with an offence of that kind one would be charged on indictment it might be a deterrent.</P>
      <P>People are revolted by what has happened in the past week or so and this was not the first such event.  We have had such crimes every three or four years going back over the last 15 or 20 years. They are very serious and terrifying, and only God knows how many people are not living here today because of these kind of occurrences.  The Minister will recall one case where, happily, the victim of the kidnap was rescued but the country lost a soldier and a garda who were both shot dead on that occasion in the most tragic circumstances simply because they were doing their duty in rescuing the unfortunate man.  In that case a large sum of money was being sought and what happened showed the extent to which the people concerned were prepared to go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to last week's event people are asking why the person who took <Col N="1677" /> delivery of the money, who has been identified to the police and has visited the police and made a statement, has not been arrested and charged?  The Garda may have their own reason for wanting to delay that process, but on the face of it it seems very serious.  Because nobody has been apprehended yet for that offence and because the kidnappers could get the substantial sum of money which they sought, it might act as some kind of encouragement to others to try the same thing in respect of some other unfortunate family.</P>
    <P>If this was Committee Stage I would strongly urge the Minister to think again and come back to us on Report Stage but unfortunately this is Report Stage.  I wonder if there is some way in which we could limit the possibility of any except trivial cases, being tried in the District Court.  I accept that some cases might be trivial, but they would be half jocose, whereas the average case of this type is very serious, even if the amount of money involved is small.  The very fact of demanding money with menaces or through blackmail is a serious matter indeed.  If the Minister can assure me that she will look at the case between now and when the Bill goes to the Seanad and will devise some way whereby none but the most trivial of cases would come to the District Court, that would be satisfactory and I would be glad to withdraw this amendment.  I know it is not easy to draft these things but the matter is very serious and this section deals with the very events of the last week or so which so deeply shocked many people.  This House should be seen to respond seriously to it.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Malley accepts the point which Deputies made in relation to the absurdity of any Director of Public Prosecutions referring to a district court a matter with such serious consequences as events of the last two weeks in this city. I do not believe any of us could conceive a position in which that might happen.  I am as anxious as Deputy O'Malley and others to send a strong signal to the people involved in that kidnapping.  First, I want to send a signal of support to the Garda that they will apprehend those involved and that they will be dealt with by the courts and, second, a signal that when they are apprehended they will be dealt with appropriately.  I visited the Lacey family and saw at first hand the great distress caused to all members of that family &mdash; Mr. Lacey, his wife and children and their babysitter &mdash; over a long period.  I am aware of the trauma that family face as a result of their kidnapping.</P>
      <P>I am anxious that the signals sent from this House are that the law is tough, that we intend to deal with such criminals, that they are not wanted in our community, that we will root them out and that all the necessary support and resources will be given to the Garda to enable them apprehend those responsible.  Deputy Ahern and others referred to a number of less serious crimes under this section. Therefore, it is necessary not to close off the avenue open to the DPP to refer matters to the District Court.  I will reconsider the matter before the Bill goes to the Seanad.  I am glad Deputy O'Malley recognises the difficulty of devising a suitable formula, but if we can devise one I will be delighted to introduce it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 43:</P>
      <P>In page 8, after line 41, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;18.&mdash;(1)  It shall be an offence for any person to have in his possession or under his control any thing or recorded information, in circumstances which give rise to the reasonable inference, that such possession or control was for the purpose of the commission of a serious offence.</P>
      <P>(2)  In this section, `serious offence' means any offence which is punishable on indictment by a term of five years imprisonment or any greater punishment.</P>
      <P>(3)  In a prosecution for an offence under this section, it shall not be necessary for the complaint, charge or verdict to specify any serious offence, where the court or jury trying the offence is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the possession or control was for the purpose of committing any one or more of a number of serious offences.</P>
      <P>(4)  A person guilty of an offence under this section shall be liable on conviction on indictment to a term of three years imprisonment or a fine of £50,000, or both.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment proposes the insertion of a new section before section 18 to cover a matter which is not an offence at present, the unlawful possession of incriminating matter.  I have personal experience of this difficulty and I know what inspired Deputies McDowell, Harney, O'Donnell and me to table this amendment.  At present the gardaí can search a person or his or her house under warrant and find obviously incriminating material.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1680" /> It would be evident from the material found that he or she intended to commit a serious crime, but that person has not committed an offence unless it can be proven that he or she conspired with others to commit the offence or had actually attempted to commit it and failed.  If the crime was still at the planning stage, possession of incriminating material relating to it would not in itself amount to an offence.  To illustrate this I will give the House an example of what inspired us to table this amendment.  This is by no means the only such case because we were told by the gardaí at the time that they had dealt with many similar cases.</P>
    <P>Approximately one year ago a barrister acting for me went to a particular place in Dublin five days a week, Monday to Friday.  He normally took the same route every day from his house to a location in the centre of Dublin.  In pursuing an investigation into another crime, the gardaí arrested a person and following his arrest went to his flat in Dublin and among his papers discovered drawings relating to the daily journeys of the barrister working for me.  Those drawings showed where his house was located, the time he left his house, from where the car was collected, the route he took and the approximate time at which he arrived at his destination each day. Two or three places on the map where the car would normally have to stop because of traffic congestion or traffic lights were marked with an asterisk.  The Garda got in touch with the person immediately and warned him he was in danger of being kidnapped.  I was told about it the same day and it caused me great concern.</P>
    <P>We assumed that the person on whom that incriminating documentation was found would be charged with carrying out some form of activity preparatory to kidnapping, but that was not the case. He was charged with offences relating to firearms found in his flat, but he was not charged with the possession of incriminating matter although it was evident that he was carefully planning a kidnapping. He could not have been doing anything else with the documentation in <Col N="1681" /> his possession because it would have been meaningless in any other context.</P>
    <P>This proposed new section endeavours to make it an offence to draw up or possess such documentation in circumstances that give rise to reasonable inference that such possession or control is for the purpose of the commission of a serious offence which is defined as being punishable on indictment by a term of five years' imprisonment or any greater punishment.  It is obviously not intended to relate to what might be classified as a medium offence, it relates only to the planning of serious offences.  The amendment specifies that it is not necessary to prove beyond reasonable doubt that a kidnapping, a murder or an assault which may cause grevious bodily harm is envisaged. The prosecution must prove only that a serious offence is planned and the proposed penalty on conviction on indictment is a term of not more than three years' imprisonment or a fine of £50,000, or both.</P>
    <P>Numerous crimes of that nature take place.  It is well known, for example, that there is a certain criminal in Dublin who plans crimes but does not execute them himself; rather he gets other people to execute serious crimes on his behalf.  If he was found in possession of maps or other documents which made it clear that he was planning a crime would the Garda Síochána and the State not look foolish if they could not charge him with anything? That is the position under the law at present.  I understand that that man is free even though the Garda Síochána publicly associate him with the commission of a variety of serious crimes in this city.  I do not think that this should be allowed to continue.  The Oireachtas should give whatever powers are necessary, within reason, to the Garda Síochána and the courts to convict a person who is clearly planning a serious offence.</P>
    <P>The reason these surrogate criminals, these godfathers of crime, do not physically commit crimes themselves but rather hire others &mdash; usually younger people who are paid, I presume, a proportion of the proceeds of the crime for carrying it out on their behalf &mdash; is <Col N="1682" /> because this loophole exists in the law. This amendment would close it, with the result that these people would be caught. Neither I nor my colleagues are suggesting that the average person might have some doubts; nobody would have any doubt about what the intention of the person caught with a document was, because the person concerned would not have had it for any purpose other than kidnapping or something more serious. As I said, the reason people plan crimes but get somebody else to carry them out is because there is a breach in the law.</P>
    <P>I should point out to the Minister that crimes being planned, which are carried out by other people, include not only burglaries and other run of the mill crimes but also murder.  Of late there has been a number of murders, particularly in Dublin.  The Garda Síochána seem to be in no doubt and so tell the media that the people who carried them out were hired hitmen.  If the Garda Síochána were to get evidence, either on the person, in the car or in the house of somebody who was making an arrangement to have somebody else murdered or kidnapped, is it not outrageous that they would not be able to prosecute them?  This amendment, which would insert a new section 18, would cover that point and I strongly urge the Minister to accept it.</P>
    <P>We have constantly to think in terms of keeping not just one step ahead of the criminals but at least keeping up with them.  Ideally, we should be one step ahead of them at all times in framing the criminal law.  However, we are about two steps behind them.  All I am asking is that we keep up with them.  It is a sick and sorry joke that somebody can plan a murder or a kidnapping and nothing can be done, even though there is clear evidence that this is the case.  He is able to laugh, yet again, at the Garda Síochána, who have had plenty of experience of this, particularly in Dublin.  For these reasons I strongly urge the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    <P>I have not had an opportunity to discover if there are corresponding provisions in other countries, but I am quite confident that there are similar provisions <Col N="1683" /> in other countries.  If somebody was caught in the act of planning a crime such as this and was in possession of an incriminating document, I have no doubt that in jurisdictions such as the United States and on the Continent they would be guilty of an offence and convicted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised to learn from Deputy O'Malley that there are no similar provisions in the existing legislation and, if that is the case, they should be included.  It was my understanding that the Offences Against the State Act dealt with this problem but perhaps my memory is faulty in that regard.  I support the thrust of Deputy O'Malley's amendment.  Even though it has its defects its intent is clear and it is worthy of strong support.</P>
      <P>In the early to mid-eighties I was asked by a television interviewer if I was aware there was organised crime in the city.  I replied that I had only heard rumours, that I could not produce any substantial evidence which would stand up, but there is no question that we have moved on since then.  There is now an organised criminal underworld.</P>
      <P>Recently in Dublin somebody casually walked up to a man who was standing near a Halloween bonfire with his daughter and shot him, reloaded and shot him again.  That person knew that that man was going to be there at that time.  It has been suggested that this was carried out by a subversive or by somebody who was hired.  It appears that there is now a guns for hire service available on the criminal market in Dublin, not just the gun but the hitman or the gunmen also.  I do not know how such a service has taken off so quickly in recent years.  Perhaps some of these criminals have noted the ease with which the subversives have been able to tout guns and to take life.  This development should be the source of grave concern to Members of this House.  The fact that these crimes are planned and executed indicates clearly that a business like and callous approach has been adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When these people are caught they <Col N="1684" /> seem to be well informed as to where they stand legally.  Indeed, some have defended themselves in court.  The wrong balance has been struck in the law.  It should be a crime to be in possession of plans or recorded information which indicates clearly that it is their intention to commit a serious crime.  If there are reasonable grounds for believing they are planning a crime then it should be possible to charge them and present the evidence to the court.</P>
    <P>The amendment put down by Deputy O'Malley is defective.  Subsection (3) of his proposed amendment is too widely drawn and subsection (4) is drawn in a way that might give rise to difficulties; it does not specify a term not exceeding three years but a term of three years. That is a statutory sentence and, generally, statutory sentences can cause problems.  The general intent of what the Deputy is proposing is certainly worthy of support.  In fact I do not think three years would be enough.  It should be up to five years or more, depending on the gravity of the offence.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will indicate if the existing legislation covers the difficulty raised by Deputy O'Malley and, if it does not, will she agree that this amendment or an amendment similar to it is desirable? If she is not prepared to accept this amendment &mdash; and I recognise that there are defects in it &mdash; I would urge her, if it is not already provided for in law, to bring in an amendment before the Bill goes to the Seanad.</P>
    <P>This is an area of growing concern. There seems to be a great increase in planned crime.  Areas of the city will be divided between different gangs of criminals. We are heading in that direction. We clearly must tackle this problem.  If the Minister accepts the general thrust of this amendment, I would ask that she incorporate a provision along those lines. A statutory sentence of three years is not sufficient.  A sentence of up to at least five years should be provided for.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in response to a similar amendment on Committee Stage, I have sympathy with <Col N="1685" /> what is being proposed here.  However, I am sure that Deputies O'Malley and McDowell appreciate that the issues raised by the amendment, impinging as they do on the law generally in that area, are extremely complex ones.  I am reluctant to proceed with an amendment along the lines proposed without the benefit of a detailed review of issues in this area generally.  Unfortunately, as I indicated on Committee Stage, it would not be possible to have my consideration of the issues involved completed without delaying the passage of this Bill.  That was accepted by all sides.  In the circumstances, I regret that I am not in a position to bring forward an amendment at this stage or to accept this amendment. However, I would like to assure the Deputies that I have directed that an assessment be undertaken with the Garda Síochána as to any deficiencies in the existing law in this area which might be hampering the fight against crime. Obviously I would prefer to have the outcome of that assessment before supporting or, indeed, making any specific proposal in this area.</P>
      <P>I propose shortly to bring forward a Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill which might well prove a suitable vehicle for an amendment along the lines proposed.  I emphasise that I am not rejecting the principle of the amendment. I accept that a very strong case is made by Deputy O'Malley, one that was made by his colleagues, Deputies McDowell and Harney, on Committee Stage.  I would like to be in a position to consider it further and to bring forward an appropriate amendment largely based on the amendment before us this evening in the context of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill to be introduced later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand what the Minister is saying.  There are a few points I would like to make in relation to this proposed offence.  The Minister will be aware that in relation to criminal offences, there are various degrees of participation.  First, there is primary participation; second, there is participation <Col N="1686" /> as an accessory before the fact or an accessory after the fact; third, there are the people who conspire to commit offences and, fourth, there are people who attempt to commit offences.  The latter categories, when I was learning criminal law, were called inchoate offences in that they fell short of the completed act but, nonetheless, were criminal in themselves.  What is merely a preparatory step is not, in our existing criminal law, an offence <i>per se</i> in the vast majority of cases.  There are some statutory exceptions.  A preparatory step involving more than one person usually betokens a conspiracy which is an offence.  Our law relating to conspiracy has not been updated as it has been in England and therefore in Ireland we have a far more draconian law.  If two people agree together to do an act which is either contrary to public morality or a civil wrong and not even a criminal offence in itself, that agreement can itself amount to a criminal offence.  I suggest to the Minister if she is reviewing this area of legislation that she should take a look at the conspiracy legislation introduced in the United Kingdom which, at least, tried to modernise and make some sense of the law of conspiracy.</P>
      <P>The offence envisaged here does not involve more than one person but does involve a preparatory step of a kind which can be detected and which amounts to something less than an attempt to commit the offence.  It is not simply a matter of the grave circumstances which Deputy O'Malley outlined, where apparently no prosecution was open on what ought to be clear grounds for prosecution and punishment. It goes further than that.  In many instances, in Northern Ireland at any rate, people are convicted of having in their possession information which would be of use to terrorists and, therefore, notes on movements of UDR men or prison warders or RUC men or their wives, etc. are of themselves things which it is not lawful to be in possession of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one goes back to the Tom King conspiracy trial in England which ended in a quashing of the conviction by the Court of Criminal Appeal on different grounds, <Col N="1687" /> the situation was that the prosecution were faced with a fact, if the evidence was as they alleged it to be &mdash; and bearing in mind the quashing of the conviction, one has to be careful.  They could prove observation of Tom King by people from a distance.  They could prove that somebody was involved in keeping his premises under observation.  They could prove, apparently, that people had in their possession recorded information which was for some nefarious purpose, the precise nature of which was never quite clear.  As I understand it, the issue arose in that trial as to whether there was a conspiracy to murder shown by the facts that were proven and the information that was found or whether it amounted to something less than that such as a conspiracy to accumulate information on movements solely.  Such issues arise in conspiracy trials and I believe that it is better to have a law which is clear as to what it means.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell criticises subsection (3) on the grounds that it is unduly wide. I do not think it is because if somebody other than, say, a member of the press, has an account of my movement, or my wife's or children's movements and observations about means of access to my house in their possession, I cannot show, and the Director of Public Prosecutions cannot show in such a case, whether this is with a view to coming into my house and burgling it and destroying it or burning it down; it could be for the purpose of kidnapping or murdering me. Nobody knows the precise offence that might be contemplated.  If information relating to a person's movements or in respect of access to a household had been found in the possession of a person who was on trial, the jury might conclude that the possession of such information was for the purpose of kidnap, murder, robbery or a serious assault.  If an offence of this kind is to be put on the Statute Book it must contain a provision that the prosecution do not fall into the dilemma, as happened in the Tom King case, of having to prove precisely what was in the mind of the people who gathered the <Col N="1688" /> information.  It need not be proved that the information related to a kidnap rather than a murder and the proposition need not be put to the court that it must decide the ultimater aim if the court can arrive at the conclusion beyond reasonable doubt that, whatever the aim was, it amounted to a serious offence being contemplated.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider not only the scenarios that Deputy O'Malley and I mentioned but all the things that may be happening around this city now.  It is absurd that if somebody is found walking down Grafton Street with careful notes about the alarm system in a jewellery shop, the movements of its employees and the name and home address of the watchman of that shop, the possession of such information is not an offence under our criminal law.  If someone is found in possession of a map or plans and has no reasonable excuse for possessing such material and the court can conclude that the possession of such information was for the purpose of committing a serious offence, that should be a criminal offence.  Deputy Mitchell made the point that the possession of such information should carry a penalty not exceeding three years' imprisonment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Five years or a lesser term, but that is not a serious criticism of the section.  A serious offence means any offence punishable by more than five years' imprisonment, in accordance with the definition in the Criminal Justice Act, 1984.  To do something in contemplation of a serious offence should not necessarily carry the same penalty as a serious offence.  That is the thinking that lies behind a lesser penalty than the five year imprisonment term.  Whatever penalty is imposed the principle must be conceded that unless something amounts to an attempt or a conspiracy, it falls between two stools and out of the criminal system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note that the Minister would like to consider the matter further and perhaps deal with it under the proposed Criminal Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  If <Col N="1689" /> someone is caught tomorrow with a file of papers on another person's movements and it appears that person was putting together a plan for kidnapping, is the criminalising of such behaviour to be put on the long finger?  It does not matter under which Bill this matter is dealt with.  However, the Minister cannot afford to generally review the law relating to the whole area before acting in the matter.  The provision in the proposed amendment, or a similar one, is urgently required.  It would be a great scandal if another instance such as that to which Deputy O'Malley referred goes unprosecuted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy McDowell's comments.  I thank the Minister for her assurance that she will consider a section on the lines proposed in the amendment in other legislation, but I am concerned about the delay.  I do not accept that the proposed section is badly drafted, except for an error in the last subsection where it should state, &ldquo;to a term not exceeding three years, imprisonment&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;to a term of 3 years imprisonment&rdquo;.  I would be open to the term being extended to five years, as proposed by Deputy Mitchell, and the offence should also be subject to a fine not exceeding £50,000.  That error was probably typographical.  Otherwise, the section stands up.  Subsection (3) stands up also.  It could be made clearer by including that it should not be necessary for the complaint charge or verdict to specify any particular serious offence, where the court or jury trying the offence is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the possession or control was for the purpose of committing any one or more of a series of offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The arrangement for crime from a position of one step removed is becoming more common.  The godfathers of crime in Dublin organise crime but never take part in criminal acts.  They hire people to carry out such acts, but they do the planning.  The only incriminating evidence one may get on such people is some form of document or recorded information of the type envisaged in the <Col N="1690" /> amendment.  The amendment proposes that it shall be an offence for any person to have in his possession any thing or recorded information.  The word &ldquo;thing&rdquo; is deliberately broadly drafted to include, for example, a gun.  Some of those people have guns for hire.  The unlawful possession of a gun is an offence, but if it is possessed for the purpose of committing a serious offence the person in possession of the gun is guilty of a more serious offence in this regard.</P>
    <P>Similarly, recorded information &mdash; for example, tapes of telephone conversations illegally tapped, maps, plans, drawings and accounts of people's movements on a habitual basis &mdash; may be in a person's possession for only one purpose. Deputy Mitchell suggested that the Offences Against the State Act covers the possession of incriminating documents.  I was very familiar with all the Offences Against the State Acts.  However, my recollection is that incriminating documents relating to offences under the 1939 Act and the amending Acts do not relate to a document that would be incriminating in terms of what the Department of Justice regards as ordinary crime as opposed to subversive crime.  If it was thought necessary to include such a section in the 1939 Offences Against the State Act because one would not get a conviction against some of those people without a section of that kind, it is surely necessary in the nineties to have a similar section or an analogous section for non-subversive or ordinary crime.</P>
    <P>Today ordinary crime is almost as organised as subversive crime.  It is no longer carried out by some lone ranger. Serious crimes are carried out by organised gangs, often made up of ten to 12 people, each of whom has a specialised job in the preparation and planning of the crime.  They often base their methods on what subversive gangs have done. Therefore it is not unreasonable to ask in the nineties that there should be in our ordinary criminal law a section akin to the section in the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, regarding the possession of incriminating documents.  This should have been done before now.  I accept that <Col N="1691" /> the Minister may want to think a little more about this matter, but on the other hand I am fearful about long delays.  I strongly urge her not to leave the matter to another Bill; rather she should try to have whatever examination is necessary carried out on the matter between now and Committee Stage in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Among other matters covered by the word &ldquo;thing&rdquo; in subsection (1), which can only have the inference that they are there for the purpose of committing a serious crime, would be, for example, sets of handcuffs which are used in kidnappings; masks and balaclava helmets, which are used for robberies and various other crimes; and elaborate disguises such as wigs and so on that are also used&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am not to be taken as suggesting that everyone who wears a wig is necessarily a criminal or has criminal intent.  As on a previous occasion &mdash; perhaps this is slightly outside the rules of order &mdash; I invite the Minister to tell me whether she will consider this matter between now and Committee Stage in the Seanad rather than leave it to a Bill. With the best of intentions, a Bill of the kind she is talking about may, through nobody's fault, not appear in this House for 12 to 18 months and may not be passed for two or three years.  Therefore, I would like her to consider the matter in the Seanad.</P>

      <P>The reason I said I would prefer to have time to consider the matter between now and the introduction of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill is because that Bill is nearing finality in the Department and I hope it will be published early in the next session.  Therefore, we are not talking about a 12 or 18 month or a two year delay.  Because of the urgency in relation to this Bill and the fact that Senators are pressuring Members of this House to get it into the Seanad for discussion, <Col N="1692" /> I felt I might not have sufficient opportunity between now and then to include an amendment such as this.  If I felt there was sufficient time I would give that commitment here, but I would not like to give a commitment that I could not stand over.</P>

      <P>In page 9, line 5, before &ldquo;on summary conviction&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;having elected for summary disposal of the offence,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a matter of fundamental interest to me, a matter about which this House should think long and hard.  There are two schools of thought on this issue: first, that a person accused of assaulting a policeman in the due execution of his duty should be entitled to a jury trial; and, second, that he should not be so entitled.  There are overwhelming reasons that a person accused of assaulting a policeman in the due execution of his duty should be entitled to a jury trial. The old excuse trotted out on occasions such as this that a comparatively trivial offence does not merit a jury trial does not stand up to scrutiny, because a comparatively insignificant assault may be prosecuted at the insistence of the Director of Public Prosecutions as a common assault charge.  In those circumstances an accused person is not given an absolute right to a jury trial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However when it comes to what is certainly a more grave matter, an assault on a peace officer, normally a garda, in the due execution of his duty, a fundamentally different set of considerations comes into play, that is, the appropriate mechanism for determining the rights or wrongs as between a garda and a member of the public in the event of a conflict of <Col N="1693" /> evidence.  I am not talking about making barristers rich by having unnecessary trials on indictment.  I am dealing with what I believe is a very real problem. For example, in places such as the west, where the local district judge is well known to the Garda, where he sees them day in and day out in his court, in those circumstances he is not the appropriate person to deal with such an offence. Everybody who has ever been involved with the criminal law knows that, as time goes by, judges become was weary and battle scarred.  Their innocence and naivety evaporates and they build up much scar tissue in terms of the cases with which they deal &mdash; in many cases that could be described as experience.</P>
    <P>However, I know of cases where members of the Garda Síochána have assaulted ordinary individuals.  The individual has to go before a District Court judge who is well known to the Garda and who has heard him testify on many occasions.  In the circumstances &mdash; let us bear this in mind &mdash; this judge has to give a verdict whereby to doubt the garda's word would make future operations of the court on that garda's evidence very difficult indeed.  I say that simply because I know that is what happens on the ground.  District Court judges have to work with the Garda day in and day out and they have to accept their word on speeding and licensing offences and so on.</P>
    <P>When it comes to a decision as to whether a garda pulled the baton unnecessarily or shoved the drunkard unnecessarily, it is almost humanly and emotionally impossible for most members of the Judiciary to hold the scales of justice fairly in their hands.  I am not putting any blame on the Judiciary, but it is very difficult for them to apply the ordinary principles of criminal law in these cases and to say that if there is reasonable doubt they will acquit the accused.  Members may think that such cases rarely arise, but that is not so. When I became a barrister in the mid-seventies such an offence, which is equivalent to the offence being created under this Bill, was dealt with under section 38 <Col N="1694" /> of the Offences Against the Person Act. Frequently people availed of their right to a jury trial.  On many occasions I witnessed cases where the jurors' mouths were hanging open by the end of the case and they wondered who should be in the dock and who should be the witness giving evidence.  In those circumstances the jurors had no problem about acquitting the accused.  On many occasions juries considering a fracas between the gardaí and the accused, decided that they still had a doubt about the issue, were not satisfied that they had been told the entire truth by the gardaí and acquitted the accused.  Unfortunately, a directive was issued by the Director of Public Prosecutions office to avoid wherever possible laying a charge under section 38 of the Offences Against the Person Act and to use instead a late 19th century summary jurisdiction Act, which, deprived the accused of the right to a jury trial.  That directive was very clear in its terms.  It told the Garda that it was not to bring charges under that section anymore as it gave the accused the right to opt for trial by jury.  That is most unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>It is not as if this is an extreme rarity. In a recent case the Supreme Court heard how a District Court judge had heard a case involving the prosecution of an accused by gardaí in respect of an assault on them.  It turned out that the District Court judge had bent over backwards to secure a conviction, had rubbished the evidence which tended to support the accused's account of the incident and had imposed, but had revoked, a sentence of imprisonment on one of the witnesses for the accused for lying to the court.  The Minister will be sorry to hear that this happened within the past six months.</P>
    <P>The issue is not whether the odd case like that comes before the Supreme Court; the significant issue is who should hold the scales of justice between the ordinary person and the Garda.  When one is dealing with a situation where an offence of this kind is punishable, either on indictment or on a summary basis, the question must arise: who makes the decision and on what grounds do they opt for summary jurisdiction in the District <Col N="1695" /> Court or decide to allow the accused a trial on indictment?  I have great sympathy for anyone who says that a jury trial should not take place in regard to what is a comparatively minor incident. Equally, I hold a very strong and passionate view that nobody who gives an account of an incident involving an assault and on whom violence has been used should be imprisoned if he and his neighbours are not satisfied at the end of the day that he has had a fair trial by people who have no axe to grind in the issue and who are not predisposed to, or acquainted with one witness rather than another.</P>
    <P>Because of the local nature of the District Court and the inevitable familiarity of the judges with the Garda in the District Court jurisdiction, it is necessary in some cases for the accused to have the right to opt for a jury trial.  There are circumstances where a person accused of assaulting a garda in a fracas where he has sustained major injuries should be entitled to opt for trial by his peers.  That was the position well into the eighties until some clever person in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions noticed that this right could be avoided by using a later Act.  In Dublin most of the District Court judges do not know individual gardaí and it is no embarrassment to them to disbelieve a garda. However, in rural Ireland it is a major issue if a garda, especially a sergeant, is disbelieved by his local District Court judge on a charge of this kind.</P>
    <P>There is another issue which needs to be raised in this context, that is, compensation to gardaí arising out of a fracas. It frequently happens in such circumstances that a garda is entitled to compensation under the Garda Síochána Compensation Act.  If the garda secures a conviction against the other person involved in the fracas he will clearly be entitled to compensation.  I am worried that in circumstances where gardaí may have used excessive force they will be tempted to go to the local District Court judge and get a conviction against the <Col N="1696" /> person involved in the fracas and, second, have a right to compensation.</P>
    <P>Nobody in this House admires the Garda Síochána more than I, but the issue of holding the scales of justice between the Garda on the one hand and the ordinary Joe Soap on the other is fraught with difficulty when it comes to the word of one against the word of another as to whether excessive force was used, whether a baton was unnecessarily used, who struck the first blow, who pushed whom and who was the causing agent in the dispute.  It is precisely in such cases that an individual is entitled to a fair trial by 12 ordinary people who will listen to all the evidence and possibly find against the Garda.  I am not calling for trivial cases to be heard before juries as such cases can be dealt with in the same way as cases of common assault.</P>
    <P>District Court judges dealing with these cases not only face the embarrassment of potentially having to disbelieve a garda whose evidence is in conflict with that of a member of the public but they can find themselves in the position of imposing a sentence in respect of an injury done to a person whom they know very well.  There is pressure on them to hand down a tough sentence to mark disapproval of assaults on gardaí, which is a perfectly reasonable policy. However, as a person well known to them has been assaulted, impartiality is not written over the entire transaction.  The hallmark of a satisfactory criminal case is when an accused person, if convicted, at least says it was a fair trial.  The hallmark of an unsatisfactory criminal case is when the accused person says of the trial &ldquo;It more or less had to be that decision.  The sergeant was well known to the District Court judge&rdquo;.  The proper way to get around this is to hold open the right, which this section proposes to close, given in the 1840s or 1850s to persons accused of assaulting police to have the matter decided by a jury and not just by a local magistrate.</P>

    <Col N="1697" />
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann recognises the need for an equitable and comprehensive world trade agreement but refuses to accept the agricultural provisions of the emerging Uruguay Round agreement on the grounds that they impose excessively onerous and unbalanced restrictions and obligations on the EC and are inconsistent with the principle of equality of treatment of all partners.</P>
      <P>We have put this motion before the Dáil because we fear that the Government, in particular the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, will let slip the last opportunity that may be available to restore an element of equity and fairness to the agricultural provisions of the GATT.  If this opportunity is lost, and we gather that whatever will be done must be done before 15 December, barely a month away, the consequences for our farming community, rural communities in general and our food industry could be devastating.</P>
      <P>As GATT negotiations stand, the European Community will have to take on a certain number of obligations. It will be obliged to lower its internal agricultural prices to approximately world price levels; it will be obliged to reduce accordingly the level of export refunds and import levies required to sustain the target price levels within the European Community; it will be obliged to dismantle substantially its price support arrangements; to guarantee expanded access to Community markets for meat, dairy products and for other key products and expanded access for exporters in other GATT partner states, while itself suffering a reduction in its ability to export to those states.  It will be obliged to accept that its meat producers will continue to be excluded from the rapidly growing Japanese market for meat, a situation which has prevailed since 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1698" /> Without going into too much detail, the specifics of this are appalling.  Internal support for agriculture would be cut by about 20 per cent over six years with the exception of certain direct income supports which are considered not linked to production or prices.  Export refunds in the Community would be reduced over that six year period by 36 per cent in financial terms and the volume of products to be covered by export refunds would be cut by 21 per cent compared to their average levels in the period 1986-90. Import levies in operation in the Community would be converted to tariff equivalents, &ldquo;tariffied&rdquo; as they say, and reduced by 36 per cent over six years. That prospect &ldquo;tariffies&rdquo; me.  There would be a minimum access requirement for GATT partners of 3 per cent of internal EC consumption in the first year and 5 per cent in the final year, that is compared to a base on the period 1986-88. The European Community would be obliged to undertake those obligations.</P>
    <P>While the European Community is accepting those reductions in its ability to support farm prices and in its ability to export, what is happening to the other GATT partner countries?  They, in particular the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, would benefit from new opportunities to increase their exports.  As the European Community producers disappear from markets around the world, those extra export opportunities would be opened up to exporters in the other GATT partner countries, particularly, as I said, the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.  Producers in those countries will not be obliged to accept any discipline or restriction on their production levels.  In fact, we can already see that levels of production in dairy products, for example, are expanding in New Zealand and may begin to expand in the United States.  Producers in those countries are gearing up to move into the markets out of which the European Community will be progressively frozen. Those countries will not be obliged to give any reciprocal guarantee of access <Col N="1699" /> for European Community exporters to their markets.</P>
    <P>On any judgment, the provisions of the infamous Blair House Agreement must be regarded as seriously unbalanced.  The European Community must suffer restrictions while its partners in the GATT gain extra opportunities for expansion.  There is no such imbalance in any other part of the emerging GATT agreement.  In no other sector can we see such a clear contrast between what happens to one trading partner and what will happen to all the rest.  No other sector in any part of the GATT will lose in the way European Community agriculture will lose, no other country &mdash; apart from Ireland &mdash; will lose on a scale relative to its GNP from these agricultural provisions. The consequences of these arrangements in rural Ireland will be nothing short of catastrophic.</P>
    <P>We propose that is simply not acceptable. It is time for the European Community, and indeed for the Government, to wake up and try to restore equity to an agreement that is one way traffic.  We normally look for an element of give and take in international agreements.  The only element of give and take in this Blair House Agreement is that the European Community has to give while the other partners do all the taking.  That has been signalled ever since that most appalling unilateral cave-in by the then Commissioner for Agriculture, Mr. Ray MacSharry, at Dromoland Castle in August 1991.  Since then, the European Community has allowed itself consistently to be out-manoeuvred by the United States negotiators.  He went to Dromoland Castle and, perhaps seduced by the beauty of the place, offered unilaterally a 30 per cent cut in the levels of EC internal support.  I do not know what game he thought he was playing; perhaps he thought that if he showed willingness, the United States negotiators would say the deal was in the bag.  However, at Dromoland Castle Ray MacSharry gave the American negotiators a taste of blood, and they liked it.  They realised they had breached the EC's defences and <Col N="1700" /> decided they would go back for more.  Go back for more they did, with a vengeance, and since then the European Community has been on the run.</P>
    <P>I do not know exactly what went on in the Commission at that stage, much less what was happening in Government here.  At that time it was still a Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government, the Progressive Democrats have not yet taken French leave.  I am not sure what was going on either within the Commission or within the Government here.  It seems that within the Commission, Commissioner MacSharry, who was making all these generous offers, was actually being undermined by colleagues of his in the Commission, by Commissioner Andriessen and, one suspects, by the President of the Commission, because it appears they were talking separately to the Americans and saying that there might be a little more available.  I do not know what was happening within our Government at that stage, but certainly they were not awake to the implications of what was happening under their very noses.  It may have been that because it was the summer period &mdash; Fianna Fáil members of the Government seem to follow a general policy of just disappearing for the summer, keeping their heads down and saying nothing in the hope that nobody will notice their absence &mdash; they did not make any comment about the serious implications of what Commissioner MacSharry had offered at Dromoland Castle.</P>
    <P>This Government and its predecessor failed utterly since then to bring home to the EC Commission just how serious would be the implications of this emerging deal for Ireland.  Such protests as were made by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture &mdash; I will revert to those in a few minutes &mdash; were feeble and wimpish in the extreme and did not appear to carry any conviction.  Certainly, they had no effect on the course of the negotiations between the Commission and the United States.</P>
    <P>In a very real sense both the Taoiseach and Minister for Agriculture must bear the responsibility for the dilemma we <Col N="1701" /> now face.  We should have very little sympathy in this House for the Minister for Agriculture.  I see he sent the unfortunate Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy McCreevy, into the House this evening, who has hardly had a role in these negotiations.  As far as I know, he was brought along to one jumbo Council meeting when Sir Leon Brittan terrified the entire Council of Ministers and got the kind of marching orders he wanted to get to go to Washington without, as far as one can ascertain, one cheep of protest from any of the Ministers.  I contend it is the Minister for Agriculture who should be here explaining himself.  I do not blame the Minister for Tourism and Trade; I am sure he had other things on his mind, such as promoting tourism. Indeed, we are going to need that tourism, if he can promote it, because it will be the only source of revenue in rural areas if the Minister for Agriculture gets his way and this GATT Agreement is imposed on us.</P>
    <P>At this very late stage in the game the very least we are entitled to expect is that the European Union would be deemed to apply the kind of hard ball game the United States negotiators have been playing ever since the MacSharry cave-in. At the very least what we need at this stage are, first of all, reciprocal guarantees of access to markets in other GATT countries, however they are expressed. We cannot go along with a unilateral surrendering of markets by the European Union without obtaining something in return.  Second, we need from the other GATT member states, particularly from the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, reciprocal undertakings from those states to control their levels of production of key agricultural products. Without those kinds of reciprocal undertakings and agreements, the GATT Agreement as it is now emerging will constitute a one way ticket to penury for rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>I have been campaigning around the country on these issues since the early part of 1991.  As a Member of this House concerned with what is happening in rural Ireland, not just in my constituency but <Col N="1702" /> in the 41 constituencies nationwide that will be affected by this agreement &mdash; even urban constituencies will be affected since our food industry will be very much in question &mdash; I have been campaigning throughout the length and breadth of this country over that period on these issues, keeping in touch with them as they emerge, as the problems are brought to the surface.</P>
    <P>I have to say quite honestly that rarely have I found a level of disquiet such as that I found about what will be the effect of this emerging GATT Agreement on rural Ireland.  Everywhere I go I meet it. Even without my saying anything about these issues, people are coming to me &mdash; farming people, people in the food industry &mdash; expressing their worries and fears when they look at what is about to be visited on us.  It is one of those issues on which they began, early in 1991, with a fairly vague, rather unfocused fear of what were the implications, but as time has gone on they have come to understand more and more of just what is involved, more and more fearful of the implications for their businesses, way of life and for their communities.</P>
    <P>I have had these fears expressed consistently since then.  For example, last Friday evening I was in County Mayo.  In two different places I met large numbers of people whose principle concern now is the effect of these reductions in export refunds and so on on their levels of income, their ability to sustain their families and to provide for their families.  I find increasingly that, in addition to being concerned for themselves, their families and businesses, people are worrying &mdash; and articulating it very clearly &mdash; about the effects of all of this on the communities in which they live.  They are beginning to fear in a very real sense that many of their communities will simply disappear.</P>
    <P>I spent all day yesterday in the constituency of Cork South-West.  I spent a good portion of the day talking to people in two of the major milk processing plants there.  They are extremely worried.  I would have to admit that it is difficult to spend a day in Cork South-West without <Col N="1703" /> coming up once or twice against people who support the Minister for Agriculture since it is his home constituency.  But I find that even those people are extremely worried at what is facing them.  Indeed, they are not all that sure that they are being told what are the full implications of this deal.  I suppose I should not be too surprised to find that in some cases they are now giving out a line which I think the Minister for Agriculture must be planting.  They are saying that, although all of this will be very difficult, they expect something to be imposed at the last moment that will in some way mitigate the effects of these changes.  I have the impression that the Minister for Agriculture is sitting there in desperation, like Mr. Micawber, hoping that something will turn up, hoping for some last minute miracle that will avert the catastrophe which he must surely see as coming, but actually doing very little to bring it about. That something will not just fall out of the sky; it will have to be worked for, and there is very little time left in which to ensure that anything happens.</P>
    <P>I have been wondering about just what is the Government's view on these things and what view has been taken by the Minister for Agriculture about what is emerging.  I looked back over a small selection of quotations over the past few days that might indicate to us what the Minister and indeed the Taoiseach might have been thinking.  For example, in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 2 November 1992 I found a report of statements made by the Minister for Agriculture and Food on the previous evening.  We might have expected on that occasion that the Minister would have been endeavouring to put as good a gloss as he could on what was happening. We must remember that 12 months ago we were in the midst of the general election campaign when one might have expected that a Minister for Agriculture would have been endeavouring to present things in a positive light.  We find that what the Minister for Agriculture was saying then was irresponsible, verging on the absolutely nonsensical. He was talking about the <Col N="1704" /> emerging agreement and was quoted as having said on 1 November 1992:</P>
    <P>However, to be acceptable, the agreement will have to be both balanced and global.  We have insisted that the compensatory measures associated with CAP reform will be completed safeguarded in the &ldquo;green box&rdquo; mechanism, so that they will be permanent and not subject to reduction under GATT rules.</P>
    <P>That was where the rot started, because in making that point about safeguarding these compensation mechanisms the Minister exposed the flank.  He indicated very clearly that the opposition of the European Community to the trade parts of this agreement possibly could be bought off by internal compensation being allowed to operate within the Community. We have seen the results of that.</P>
    <P>Only a month or two ago there was another argument between the European Commission and the United States negotiator now, Mr. Mickey Kantor, when we had the very worrying spectacle of our Tánaiste going off, indicating that if agreement could not be reached on the kinds of things that the European Community wanted changed in the emerging agreement, perhaps the Americans might be good enough to agree that we could have compensation from internal Community resources.</P>
    <P>In other words, the Americans would tighten the screw still further on us on the trade side and we would dig around within our own resources to find some way of compensating for that.  In that regard the Tánaiste displayed an appalling lack of any familiarity with even the most elementary rules of economics but, more importantly, he was clearly signalling to the United States that we could be bought off by being allowed to compensate ourselves for new difficulties that the United States might visit upon us.</P>
    <P>The most worrying part was that all this seemed to be part of a set up.  Looking at it from where I stand it seemed that there was signalling in the background between the Commission and Mr. Mickey Kantor and the Tánaiste.  The Tánaiste duly <Col N="1705" /> made his statement suggesting that maybe we could compensate ourselves and, right on cue, one day later Mr. Mickey Kantor said: &ldquo;I have not time to think about all this, I do not want to change anything in the GATT agreement but if the European Community wants to operate internal compensation that is all right with me&rdquo;.  That is a picture of a Government that has completely abdicated responsibility to try to get any of the changes we need in this GATT agreement.</P>
    <P>I read in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 17 November 1992, the following statement attributed to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry:</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Mr. Walsh, yesterday expressed confidence that the Commissioner will return from Washington with a &ldquo;fair and balanced&rdquo; agreement within the parameters which had been set for him.</P>
    <P>I wonder what the Minister was playing at when he said he was confident that the Commissioner would return from Washington from a negotiation, with a &ldquo;fair and balanced&rdquo; agreement within the parameters which had been set for him. Those parameters already included the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy which, in turn, had been driven by the EC Commission's desire, at almost any price, to get a trade agreement with the United States.  Our Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, weakly and without any kind of determination, agreed to put us in the hands of a Commissioner who was already bound by this nonsensical Common Agricultural Policy reform that has given us the kind of bureaucracy that farmers have to deal with today and said he would come home from Washington with a &ldquo;fair and balanced&rdquo; agreement.</P>
    <P>On 21 November 1992 the Minister is again quoted in <i>The Irish Times</i> as saying that &ldquo;compensation measures would be safeguarded&rdquo; but, for the first time, he expressed concern about limitations on subsidised exports in the beef and dairy sectors.  He said he will need to be clear that these can be accommodated within <Col N="1706" /> the Common Agricultural Policy reform arrangement before there would be any question of his acceptance of the agreement in the EC Agriculture Council. Here again the Minister clearly indicated that he was not going to rock the boat. So long as he could be assured that all these changes being visited on us could be accommodated within the Common Agricultural Policy reform which, in turn, was driven by the EC Commission's desire to have a trade agreement with the Americans he would not object too much.  That is about as weak as one could possibly find and another indication of how weak the stance of the Irish Government has been on this essential issue.</P>
    <P>On about 20 November the first sign of real opposition from the European Community emerged not from the Irish Government but from the French Government.  The French Government was the first to react strongly to these talks and at that stage they got no real support from the Irish Government, only these wimpish expressions by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry that he would like to know that these new impositions on us could be accommodated within the Common Agricultural Policy reform.  <i>The Irish Times</i> of 21 November 1992 stated:</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, Mr. Reynolds, said last night he was satisfied that the EC Agriculture Commissioner, Mr. Ray MacSharry, had got the GATT balance right and that Ireland's interests would be protected under the new arrangements.</P>
    <P>That was possibly the most damaging statement made at that time because in that short sentence the Taoiseach made the fatal admission that he felt Ray MacSharry had got the balance right, there was no problem with the emerging arrangements and that Ireland's interests would be safeguarded and protected when, in fact, we all know the arrangements do nothing of the kind.  The Taoiseach had admitted that he was not going to create any waves or rock the boat.  It is no wonder that what has emerged has been so inimical to us when our <Col N="1707" /> Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry was unable to raise a boo about the arrangements and our Taoiseach said that the Agriculture Commissioner had got the balance right.</P>
    <P>Two days later the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry was still worrying about the compensation mechanisms but he was not doing anything about it.  How could he in view of the fact that the Taoiseach had already put up the white flag of surrender and said he thought the balance had been got right. An article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 24 November 1992 quoted this gladiator of a Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry saying:</P>
    <P>While welcoming the fact that a &ldquo;most damaging&rdquo; trade war had been averted by the GATT agreement, the Minister for Agriculture said he was concerned over the limitations on subsidised exports, particularly as they would affect the beef and dairy sectors.</P>
    <P>In the one statement he said he was worried about some parts of it but he had accepted that a &ldquo;most damaging&rdquo; trade war had been averted.  This war had been averted and the Minister had not fought even the most token battle about the features in this agreement which are most damaging to Ireland's interests and to Irish farming.</P>
    <P>I said that in my view the CAP reform, which the Minister was so complimentary about, was driven by the Americans and by the EC Commission's desire to get a trade agreement with the GATT.  I also said it seems that the then Commissioner MacSharry had been undermined because the President of the Commission and the trade commissioner at the time were running a separate agenda from his and pushing the Americans in the direction where they could get the most concessions from Commissioner MacSharry.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's statement that the then Commissioner MacSharry had got the balance right is absolutely inexplicable. That was the most damaging admission made during the whole process and the one that has caused the greatest <Col N="1708" /> problem ever since.  I am tempted to ask if the Taoiseach's admission was just another little anecdote in the process of dehumanising the GATT but it certainly was not calculated to do anything worthwhile to protect the interests of Irish agriculture or the Irish economy generally.</P>
    <P>What happened since?  Between December 1992 and April 1993 the agriculture Ministers of the EC repeatedly failed to give any new instructions to the Commission about what they wanted in the agricultural part of the GATT agreement. The agriculture Ministers, and the jumbo council that included the trade Ministers, agreed to a bland anodyne set of marching orders for Commissioner Leon Brittan and sent him off to Washington in the hope that he would come back with some clarifications and interpretations that would protect agricultural interests in the Community.</P>
    <P>As it happened, a short while after the famous jumbo Council meeting which the Minister for Tourism and Trade attended with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, I happened to be in Brussels for another meeting and I dropped into a meeting of the EPP group in the European Parliament that was being addressed by Commissioner Leon Brittan.  This was before his trip to Washington to seek these clarifications and interpretations on GATT.  I spent an hour and a half listening to him talking about this approach to GATT and I had among my papers the statement issued by the jumbo Council setting out the instructions given to Commissioner Brittan on what he was to look for.  It was very clear that he had not the slightest intention of straining himself in the least to try to fulfil even the bland and anodyne instruction given to him by the Ministers.  Mr. Brittan was going to Washington for cosmetic reasons so that he could say he had tried.  He would come back to another jumbo Council of Ministers meeting and say &ldquo;I am sorry, gentlemen, Mickie Kantor remains obdurate.  There is nothing much we can do, but maybe we can find some way of compensating ourselves internally&rdquo;.  He would say that in the sure and confident expectation that the Ministers would all <Col N="1709" /> say &ldquo;Yes, sir; yes, sir; three bags full, sir&rdquo; and go home and stop rocking the boat. I think that was unpardonable.</P>
    <P>Some light began to emerge.  The Government began to show some sign that it understood, even dimly, what was about to happen.  We then had this grand circus act of the Taoiseach going of last May to meet President Mitterrand.  When he came back from the meeting he announced that he had set up a &ldquo;strategic alliance&rdquo; with the French to make sure that we got something worth while out of GATT.  That was a very interesting episode, not least for the way it showed relations in the Government parties.  As it happens, at a meeting of the Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy of Tuesday, 11 May, GATT came up for discussion.  I will now quote from the Official Report of that committee meeting of 11 May, El, No. 1.  In column 9 the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Joe Walsh, said:</P>
    <P>At international level, the GATT negotiations have not made the degree of progress which some expected late last year.  I have to reiterate again that I have considerable difficulty with aspects of Mr. Dunkel's Draft Final Act and with the EC/US Blair House Agreement.  I am continuing to press for improvements,...</P>
    <P>He goes on to expose the flank again. This &ldquo;Chocolate Soldier&rdquo; does not seem to have any concept of how to conduct a battle.  Further on he stated:</P>
    <P>I also have to recognise that there will be, over the medium term, a move towards freer trade in agriculture and food products.  So we have to prepare for this by increasing the competitiveness of our industry.</P>
    <P>Translated into the way it would be read in the Commission and in Washington, that would read: Deputy J. Walsh says &ldquo;I surrender.  We know this is going to happen and I am not going to cause you any more problems.&rdquo;  I objected to that at the committee meeting and I will not bore the House by reading from the <Col N="1710" /> record; but, interestingly, that great wise man of the Labour Party, Deputy Kemmy, took issue with me.  In case you did not know it, Sir, Deputy Kemmy has become an apostle of free trade.  In column No. 46 of that same report Deputy Kemmy took me to task for objecting to what was going on in the GATT negotiations:</P>
    <P>A trade war with America, as advocated by Deputy Dukes, would be suicidal for a small country like Ireland.</P>
    <P>That is the genius, this homespun philosopher, the mighty mouse from Limerick who accuses me of wanting to start a trade war with America which would be dreadfully damaging for this country. What happens?  After the Taoiseach returns and announces his strategic alliance with President Mitterrand, who is the first out of the traps to congratulate him?  None other than Deputy Kemmy. The man who accused me of wanting to foment a trade war by objecting says now that the grand alliance between the Taoiseach and the French President is a great thing, although, mind you, it was supposed to have the objective of slowing down the gathering rush towards giving in to the Americans.  I have seen sycophancy in my time but Deputy Kemmy must take the prize, the Nobel Prize in sycophancy.</P>
    <P>It would be tedious to go over again the consequences that we can forsee for Ireland in particular and for the European Community in general.  What it means is that we will have to decrease the volume of our production of beef, pigmeat, cereals and all the major dairy products and possibly also of sheepmeat in order to accommodate the agreement that has been made with these other countries.  The reductions we can foresee in dairy products, for example would be the equivalent of about a further 2 per cent cut in milk quota across the county. The consequences of that are huge.  We can see the difficulties that farmers already have from the Minister's failure to get back any of the 4.5 per cent most recent cut in the milk quota, but we will have to deal with a further cut that is half <Col N="1711" /> that again.  That will put milk producers, particularly small milk producers, into a very difficult position.</P>
    <P>What is going on?  There are negotiations about what are called &ldquo;clarifications and intepretations&rdquo; of these various cuts in export refunds and in the volume of production.  That sounds grand.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry is trying to fool us into believing that this actually means something.  What it actually means is that instead of having to bear a big proportion of all the cuts in the first couple of years of the process, the burden will be pushed back to the later years.  Instead of being hanged quickly, Irish agriculture will be throttled slowly.  That is the only difference. After six years of the measures in this agreement the end result will be the same.  It might happen more quickly if there is no clarification and interpretation and a little more slowly and painfully if there is clarification and interpretation. If that is all we have, the situation facing Irish agriculture, our rural communities and our food industry is very difficult.</P>
    <P>The Government and its predecessor was always great as saying how much extra employment would be generated by the expansion of our food industry. They were just fooling themselves.  There are some Deputies in the Labour benches who know what I am talking about.  I spent a part of yesterday morning in a very impressive cheese plant in south west Cork.  It employs between 25-30 people on a three shift basis.  Ten years ago a plant of this size would have employed between 40-50 people but in four or five years' time the same plant will probably be run by four or five people. While there may be possibilities in expanding our food industry in terms of the volume of production, I would not bet that there is any great possibility of increasing employment.  If we have the cuts in the volume of production that are being imposed on us by the GATT Agreement there will be absolutely no chance of increasing employment in the food industries.</P>
    <P>The GATT agreement is objectionable <Col N="1712" /> for other reasons.  It will make farm income more and more dependent on what is known as the cheque in the post. That will make farmers' income more and more vulnerable to the kind of lunacy that was being urged on us earlier this year by the Minister of State in the Department of Finance, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald.  We averted that for this year, but there will be a problem in the future.</P>
    <P>This agreement does nothing for the less developed countries.  I hope some people on the Government side will see that.  Let nobody on the Government side try to blind this House with the proposition that this GATT agreement is the application of free trade principles.  At the insistence of the US it excludes sea transport and air transport.  The Government made a big enough mess of the whole Shannon issue recently.  It also excludes telecommunications and financial services.  It is not in any sense a comprehensive free trade agreement and these totally unbalanced provisions on agriculture must be taken out or it will be the worst nonsense ever visited on the European Community and on agriculture in particular.</P>

    <P>I am sure Deputy Dukes is disappointed that the Minister for Agriculture is not in the House but perhaps he could have gone some way in drafting the motion to ensure that he would be here.  Deputy <Col N="1713" /> Dukes summed it up when he said that he objected to the GATT agreement for reasons other than agriculture reasons. He is a very knowledgeable person, so he should know that the GATT agreement is not solely about agriculture, but about world trade.  When he referred to the GATT agreement, what he seemed to mean was the Blair House agreement as it relates to the GATT agreement.  As Minister for Trade it is my responsibility to lead negotiations on the GATT agreement on behalf of the Government.  In matters relating to agriculture, the Minister for Agriculture makes his contribution. The GATT agreement is the responsibility of the Minister for Trade on behalf of the Government and the negotiations on behalf of the EC Community are led by the Commissioner for Trade, Sir Leon Brittan.</P>
    <P>Agriculture contributes less than 2 per cent of total world trade.  Perhaps when tabling a future motion to get the Minister for Agriculture into the House the Deputy will phrase it in a different way. The GATT agreement is a world trade agreement, not an agricultural agreement.</P>

      <P>The Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations is the most ambitious and complex round of trade negotiations undertaken so far.  It began in Punta del Este in Uruguay in 1986. It ranges over 15 negotiating topics and involves over 100 participants.  Among its aims is the inclusion under GATT of many new topics such as agriculture, textiles, services and intellectual property. Some of these topics involve trade issues which previous rounds proved unable to resolve.  It is not surprising then that the conclusion of the Uruguay Round is more than two years behind schedule and even with very little time to go to the latest deadline of 15 December there is still a large number of unresolved issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one thing about which we should all be clear and that is the necessity successfully to conclude the negotiations at an early date.  The role of <Col N="1714" /> GATT in the proper functioning of world trade is a vital one which must be maintained and improved so that the multilateral trading system is not undermined.</P>
    <P>We have in recent years seen an erosion of the multilateral trading system with a proliferation of unilateral measures, unfair trading practices and the increasing trend towards regionalisation. These developments are not in Ireland's interests and if allowed to continue will have a detrimental effect on our future growth potential which is so heavily dependent on developing our export markets and increasing our exports.</P>
    <P>The Government is keenly aware of the importance of a stable economic trading environment to our future economic development.  As Minister for Tourism and Trade, I am especially conscious that exports are the lifeblood of the Irish economy.  Today some 60 per cent of the output of Irish industry is exported and two-thirds of our manufacturing jobs depend on exports.</P>
    <P>Ireland's exports have grown very significantly in the past ten years &mdash; from £5.7 billion in 1982 to £16.6 billion in 1992.  In 1992 Ireland's trade surplus exceeded £3.4 billion, marking an amazing turn around in Ireland's economic fortunes as we had a trade deficit of over £1 billion only ten years earlier.</P>
    <P>In 1992, our total exports of goods amounted to £16.6 billion with £4 billion representing agri-food exports and £12 billion representing industrial exports. Our main manufacturing exports included chemicals, £3 billion; data processing equipment, £2.6 billion, and machinery £1 billion.  Our overall trade surplus in 1992 increased to £3.4 billion &mdash; this represents 13 per cent of GDP, one of the highest in the world.</P>
    <P>We have therefore a strong interest in the creation and maintenance of a stable, well regulated, liberal world trading environment.  Failure in these negotiations would produce the exact opposite.  It could lead to a rapid escalation of trade conflicts, the imposition of high, prohibitive tariffs, a blizzard of anti-dumping actions and high <Col N="1715" /> countervailing duties against imports. Failure could create a hiatus during which the main trading blocs could drift into an increasingly antagonistic trade war.  We got a small hint of what that might entail during last year immediately prior to the negotiation of Blair House agreement when the US threatened to introduce punitive tariffs on EC exports and the EC responded with the threat of retaliatory measures against US products.  Some very important Irish products featured on the US &ldquo;hit-list&rdquo; and the effect would have been to stop the trade in these products, with the consequences of significant job and export earnings loss.</P>
    <P>Even bearing in mind that 31 per cent of our exports go to the UK and 43 per cent to other European Community countries, it would seem certain that even these markets would be seriously affected by a trade conflict and that our ability to export would be severely curtailed. Couple that with the fact that a failure to reach agreement would deny us the trade opportunities that are forecast to flow from the expected growth in world trade and one can see how important the achievement of a fair and balanced agreement would be to Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is in this context that we have defined our attitude or policy in relation to the various elements of the Uruguay Round negotiations.  This policy can in broad terms be defined as a commitment to a global and balanced agreement which has regard to our concerns in relation to specific topics in the negotiations.  The question of refusing to accept any element of a final agreement in isolation does not arise at this juncture.  The attitude of the Government will be determined when the final package is presented.  The attitude will depend on the balance of the package which will include the extent to which Ireland's specific concerns have been addressed.</P>
    <P>I would now like to deal in some detail with some of the subjects being negotiated in the round, the current state of play in each case, the pros and cons for Ireland in the various areas as I see them, and the general approach that Ireland is <Col N="1716" /> following in what looks likely to be the concluding stages of the negotiations.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to speak at length about agriculture as my colleague, Deputy Liam Hyland, Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, will deal with this subject in depth.  However, in any discussion of the Uruguay Round, it is always necessary to stress that Ireland has very serious concerns about the impact that existing proposals on reductions in agricultural supports and on market access for agricultural products would have, not only on the Irish agriculture and food sectors but also on the Irish economy as a whole. That is why we continue, within the Community, to try to negotiate the necessary changes to the Blair House, agreement to make it compatible with the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and to lessen its negative impact.  The European Commission, as the Community's negotiator, is committed to continue to seek clarification, enlargement or modification of that agreement in order to make it more acceptable to the Community. Ireland will, within the Council of Ministers, continue to press the Commission to seek solutions to the problems we have identified.</P>
    <P>The negotiations on textiles are a very important area as far as Ireland is concerned. As the House will be aware, much international trade in textiles and clothing is governed by the Multi-Fibre Textile Arrangement &mdash; the MFA &mdash; which is a derogation from GATT rules. This arrangement of some twenty years standing gives protection to the industries in developed countries from too rapid an increase in competition from developing countries.  The main aim of the MFA is to allow for the gradual liberalisation of trade in textiles by permitting the industries in developed countries to restructure and adapt so as to be able to face competition from low cost imports.</P>
    <P>The EC, as a trading block, is a participant in this, as are 42 other countries including the USA and Japan as well as the developing countries.  Ireland is party to the agreement as a Community member state.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1717" /> The aim of the negotiations is to integrate the sector into GATT on the basis of strengthened GATT rules and disciplines. The operation of the MFA has meant that, alongside agriculture, the market for textiles and clothing is one of the world's most heavily regulated.  It is vitally important, therefore, that the GATT arrangements agreed to textiles respect the delicate and sensitive balance in the industry.</P>
    <P>The main issues in the negotiations so far have related to, on the one hand, how and over what period of time textiles would be integrated into GATT and, on the other, the extent to which GATT rules and disciplines &mdash; e.g. market access, safeguards etc. &mdash; would be strengthened.  Specific issues arising include product coverage, duration of the integration period, the length of the stages of integration, annual growth rates and transitional safeguards; in other words, what type of regime would apply during the period of integration.</P>
    <P>The overall EC approach is to minimise the economic effects by having a long, staged transition with freedom of choice of the products to be integrated at the various stages.  This would be accompanied by a transitional safeguard mechanism which allows for a selective approach and an examination, at each stage of transition, of whether the objectives in the relevant strengthened GATT rules had been met.  Because of the significance of Irish textiles and clothing in employment terms, there is a real risk attached to a very sudden liberalisation of trade.  We are very much attached, therefore, to the overall EC approach.</P>
    <P>We are not altogether happy about the way that things are developing in the textiles negotiations.  While the proposed transitional period could be acceptable, we consider that the proposed growth rates are too high.  Therefore, a significant improvement is needed in the market access package, particularly in the reduction of tariff peaks, to create the overall balance that would make any agreement acceptable.</P>
    <P>This leads me to the market access negotiations which cover, <i>inter alia,</i> the <Col N="1718" /> reduction of tariffs and the elimination of non-tariff barriers.  The reduction of tariff barriers and non-tariff measures have traditionally been the cornerstone of GATT trade negotiations.  The current round is no exception and the success of the negotiations will depend to a great extent on the quality of the tariff and non-tariff reduction package agreed.  Previous negotiations have been very successful in reducing tariffs &mdash; average tariffs on manufactured goods in industrialised countries fell from 40 per cent in the forties to 6 per cent by the early 1980s. However, that low average rate still masks much higher tariffs in individual sectors, something that has been a particular focus of the present round.  Tariff levels also remain high in many developing countries.</P>
    <P>The target for tariff reduction is an average one third cut across the board, including reductions in high tariffs and a greater degree of tariff bindings, that is tariffs which cannot be reduced.  All the participants in the negotiations have committed themselves to achieving this target; negotiations now are focusing on the detailed way in which this can be achieved.  The agreement reached at the Tokyo G 7 meeting last July is an important element in this regard and could result in much larger tariff cuts in particular areas.  What is important now is that the parties to the Tokyo agreement do not renege on their commitment.  I am happy that the European Community has been to the forefront in taking the initiative in this regard by submitting an illustrative offer in Geneva showing how it would implement the agreement.  The purpose of this approach is to put the pressure on our major negotiating partners to play a more active role in the negotiations which is in line with the conclusions of the General Affairs Council of the 8 November.</P>
    <P>The outcome of these tariff and non-tariff barrier negotiations will directly affect Irish imports and exports across a variety of products and markets.  Of particular interest of course are developments in sensitive sectors such as textiles-clothing, which I have already mentioned, <Col N="1719" /> as well as sectors of growth potential such as some high-technology products.</P>
    <P>The impact at the sectoral level will involve a combination of different effects depending on the nature of trade in the particular sector.  These include the level of import penetration, the access to export markets, the competitive position and the growth potential of the sector.</P>
    <P>Our assessment of the Irish position, based on the present state of the negotiations and taking into account the combination of different influences I already mentioned, is that there would be a generally positive effect for Irish industry and that significant opportunities would arise for increased output, increased foreign earnings and increased employment.</P>
    <P>If there was agreement today on the lines of the sort of proposals that at this stage look likely to emerge on market access for industrial goods, there would be significant economic gains for Ireland from this category of the negotiations.</P>
    <P>The major growth opportunities are likely to be in manufacturing sectors such as mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, office and data processing equipment and chemicals.  These positive opportunities become even more marked if one measures them against the likely alternative to a GATT agreement situation and that is a trade hostilities situation and all the difficulties that that entails.</P>
    <P>Of course, as I said, there are also sensitive industrial sectors of particular interest to us and we approach the negotiations on these in a way that looks to minimising the negative effects of liberalisation and maximising any opportunities.</P>
    <P>Another element of the negotiations likely to create significant opportunities for Ireland is services.  Current GATT agreements cover goods only, but with services continuing to gain a larger share in output and trade, one of the Uruguay Round aims is to draw up a new General Agreement on Trade in Services which will be known as the GATS.  It would apply to all trade in services, areas such as <Col N="1720" /> financial services, transport, professional services, communications, construction, distribution, education, health etc.  While it would be separate from the goods agreement, it would be based on similar principles and procedures.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that, in Ireland as elsewhere, a services agreement will impact not only on trade, but also on the way in which services are regulated, since disciplines accepted in GATS will have to be respected in domestic regulation. Normal regulation of all services will, of course, continue, but any discrimination, for example as between non-EC countries, or between service suppliers from Ireland and those from outside the EC, will have to be avoided if it is contrary to any commitments taken in the agreement.</P>
    <P>In the services negotiations, the aim of the EC, and of Ireland, is to achieve an agreement with wide sectoral coverage and wide country participation on the basis of extensive MFN treatment &mdash; that is, each party giving equal treatment to all other countries who sign the agreement &mdash; and national treatment &mdash; that is, in our case, giving non-EC service suppliers, when operating on our market, the same treatment as our own suppliers. The impact of the agreement will, however, vary from sector to sector and from country to country.  For example, air transport, where extensive international arrangements already exist, will be almost totally excluded, and there will be derogations from MFN and national treatment in many sectors.  Closer integration and a higher degree of trade liberalisation among members of economic integration areas, such as the EC will, of course, continue.</P>
    <P>Negotiations on services are continuing in Geneva on this basis, with the US indicating that it will take wide MFN exemptions if sufficient market access commitments are not given by others. The EC has offered relatively wide access to its own market, but on the basis that the offer may be reduced if it is not matched by others.  There is still some way to go before agreement can be reached, with most problems relating to <Col N="1721" /> the sectors of financial services, audio-visual services, maritime transport and telecommunications.</P>
    <P>In financial services, the remaining requirements are to get sufficient market access commitments from OECD members and from the more developed non-OECD countries, and to have the US request for an MFN exemption dropped.  The position on maritime transport is similar in that attempts are continuing to get a sufficient number of countries to sign up to a worthwhile liberalisation package.  Telecommunications is likely to be largely left for separate negotiation after the round. This sector is not yet fully liberalised within the EC &mdash; a timetable for completion of the internal market has recently been agreed and this will have to be respected in the GATS negotiations. On audiovisual services, there is still a long way to go before agreement can be reached.  The US already has a very strong position in the EC film and TV market while the European share of the US market is, in comparison, very low.  The EC wishes to see further development of its own industry.  It is also seeking a recognition of the special characteristics of the industry to reflect its role in fostering culture and the European identity before making a commmitment on the sector.</P>
    <P>The services negotiations are, of course, seen as part of the whole Uruguay Round package and many countries are careful in regard to services commitments until they can be happy with the outcome on goods with agriculture and textiles often being important in this regard. Some developing countries find themselves in a situation where their service industries are less developed and less fully regulated than those in developed countries.  Any agreement will give these countries extra flexibility and their market access commitments will be less extensive than those of developed countries. In general, account is taken of each country's level of development in assessing the commitments that might be expected from it in any GATT agreement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1722" /> Ireland's attitude to the services discussions has been positive.  We view the impact on Irish services of a successful GATT agreement as being beneficial. Some GATT induced increases in import competition would be expected on the domestic market, for example, in assurance. However, this would probably be modest, especially in the context of the separate effects of the Single Market.  It would also be offset by export gains in markets where Ireland currently faces trade barriers, for example, the USA in financial services and in consulting.  Internationally-traded services could be expected to experience growth through the liberalisation process of an agreement and they would be affected by overall changes in the growth in world trade. Service exports such as freight and transportation, tourism, financial and technical services, software and other internationally-traded services would all benefit from the increased buoyancy in world economic activity that a GATT agreement would promote.</P>
    <P>For all sorts of reasons, statistical and otherwise, it is extremely difficult to quantify precisely the economic gains that might arise from the establishment of multilateral disciplines in services.  An assessment from the OECD is that the same sort of gains would be achieved for services as experienced following the establishment of multilateral rules for trade in goods some 40 years ago.</P>
    <P>I mentioned at the outset that the scope of these negotiations covered a wide number of topics; these include the functioning of the GATT system and the various codes which operate within it. GATT is not just about free trade and access to markets.  It is also concerned with clear rules regarding agreed exceptions to free trade and, consequently, about business conditions and certainty. Over the last two decades confidence in the GATT system has been gradually whittled away, especially because of the growth of non-tariff barriers outside GATT procedures and the increasing preference of Governments to deal with their trade problems by bilateral means.</P>
    <P>A very significant topic for the negotiations <Col N="1723" /> has been trade related intellectural property issues such as trade marks, patents and copyright.  US and EC companies claim to have suffered considerable losses because of infringement of their intellectual property rights. Major problems are refusal to grant patent protection to pharmaceuticals, copyright protection to musical recordings and audio-visual works and counterfeit of trade marks.  The World Intellectual Property Organisation has been unable to redress these difficulties. Business, therefore, puts pressure on Governments to seek a solution through GATT.</P>
    <P>Ireland has supported the EC position that an intellectual property agreement should be made an integral part of GATT with appropriate dispute settlement procedures and enforcement rules.  Specific areas of importance to the EC are the protection of geographical names; the introduction of copyright protection for computer programmes, the need for stringent provisions for the protection of industrial designs and models, including textiles designs.</P>
    <P>The Draft Final Act largely incorporates the EC's position.  The main shortcomings are in relation to the level of protection provided for geographical names and industrial designs and models even though textiles models have been covered.</P>
    <P>Another issue which has tended to undermine the credibility and effectiveness of the GATT in recent years has been the inability of the system to act promptly and effectively in the settlement of trade disputes.  Governments have been unwilling to respect their commitments under GATT and have been reluctant to allow the implementation of the recommendations of the so called &ldquo;Panels&rdquo;, independent groups of exports set up to adjudicate on disputes.  Under existing arrangements panel recommendations must be adopted by consensus and Governments have used this to block the adoption of recommendations that they do not like.  The EC would say that the US have been most to blame in this regard; the US <Col N="1724" /> would probably say the exact opposite.  In any event, the establishment of a prompt and effective dispute settlement system is seen as a central element in achieving a successful conclusion to the round. the overall aim of the negotiations in this regard is to achieve rules for settling disputes which will apply across the board to disputes on trade in goods, trade in services and trade-related intellectual property questions.</P>
    <P>These would be embodied in the new multilateral trade organisation, MTO, which is being proposed to follow a successful agreement.  The proposal to establish an MTO has been a major outcome of the negotiations and is seen as a way of improving the workings of GATT.  The current multilateral trading system consists of the GATT, the Tokyo Round Agreements and numerous arrangements, decisions, understandings and agreements, all without a common institutional basis.  A permanent institution is needed to ensure the integration of the system, especially with the new agreements on services and intellectual property which form part of the Uruguay Round negotiations.</P>
    <P>The proposed MTO agreement requires that parties must accept all three major parts of the package: goods, services and intellectual property.  It allows countries to accede in future only upon acceptance of the whole package.  It also establishes that members may withdraw from the system only by withdrawing from the whole package.  Without the solid legal basis of an MTO agreement there would be an incentive for some countries to continue as contracting parties of the GATT but not to accept the Uruguay Round agreements.</P>
    <P>One of the major objectives of establishing an MTO would be to enhance the stature of the GATT system <i>vis-à-vis</i> other international organisations.  Establishing an MTO within the existing GATT system will enhance the status of the GATT by giving it legal personality to deal effectively with other organisations. If the Multilateral Trade Organisation comes into being as envisaged, the whole structure of multilateral cooperation <Col N="1725" /> and obligation on trade matters will be given a firm and permanent footing, literally for the first time.</P>
    <P>Precedent will be critically important for the future GATT-MTO agenda because precedent &mdash; meaning what has happened in the last few years and what will happen in the next few weeks &mdash; will largely determine what can be done in the years ahead.  Above all, it will be determined by the outcome of the present Uruguay Round negotiations. The round will set the ground rules for global trade policy for the rest of this century and beyond and will govern whether Governments feel it is worthwhile to devote thought, money, people and political capital once again to a multilateral co-operative effort to renegotiate and liberalise their trade relations.  In a broader context, the outcome of the round will help to shape the future course of the world economy and to decide whether the GATT will be functioning in an era of protectionism or of renewed and confident commitment to open markets. The next 30 days will be crucial for these negotiations.</P>
    <P>Ireland will continue to participate, over that important period, with the objective of securing a successful conclusion to the round.  We will insist that any final agreement must be global and balanced and must not impose a disproportionate burden on any sector or region.  A Government decision on Ireland's attitude to any draft final agreement will be taken on that basis.</P>

      <P>Listening to Deputy Dukes one would have thought that the GATT was simply about agriculture; it is, of course, about trade.  It would be well to remember that 12 per cent of our exports go to the United States of America, which is as much as go to Germany.  Therefore, the implications of a trade war would be absolutely horrendous for this country. For example, 80 per cent of the produce of Waterford Glass goes to the United States of America and 70 per cent of Bailey's Irish Cream is exported to the USA.  Much of our exports in the food industry go to the United States.</P>
      <P>Having said all that, it is fair to recognise that the GATT represents an enormous challenge to agriculture.  One way or the other agriculture, as it now stands, is in decline everywhere.  In the sixties agriculture employed about 30 per cent of the workforce.  It now employs of the order of 15 per cent and by the turn of the century it is estimated that less than 10 per cent of the Irish workforce will be involved in agriculture.  In the last three years the food industry has seen tremendous consolidation.  Something like 80 per cent of milk processing is now done by five major players.  Seventy per cent of the beef and pigmeat sectors are controlled by four major companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dukes is right when he talks about the limited prospects for increased employment in the food industry. However, the food industry does have considerable further potential to generate exports for this country and, <Col N="1727" /> indeed, it has some potential to generate increased employment.</P>
    <P>The dimensions of the problems which face agriculture can be gauged by the fact that in the United States of America each farmer is subsidised to the tune of £8,000 per year, whereas the corresponding figure for the European Community is £13,000.  Per hectare in the United States each farmer is subsidised to the tune of £64 compared to a corresponding figure of £523 in the EC.  The shape of things to come for Irish farmers can be gauged from the fact that, as trade develops, farms will become larger.  We have a clear indication of that from the USA where the average farm size is now 134 hectares compared with 25 hectares in Europe, and in Ireland it is considerably smaller than that.</P>
    <P>We are to a large extent between the devil and the deep blue sea.  There are no easy options.  It is not just a matter of the down side in relation to agriculture. There are also the positive opportunities which will be presented to us.  There are opportunities for the pharmaceutical industry, for the spirit and beer industry, for construction equipment, for medical equipment and for a variety of other industries.  Those industries should be able to benefit from the GATT.  When we bear in mind that something like 56 per cent of our gross national product is exported, we cannot lightly contemplate a trade war.</P>
    <P>It is easy for Deputy Dukes to talk about the down side for agriculture.  I cannot recall Deputy Dukes making any proposal beyond saying that we should negotiate more effectively.  It is easy to say things are wrong and to quote at length from <i>The Irish Times</i> and from Ministers' speeches.  It is another matter to say what can be done and it is yet another matter to say how proposals can be implemented.  It is pretty well unthinkable that we should get ourselves involved in a trade war.</P>
    <P>There is one last point I would like to make.  A firm of economic consultants has already done a report on the problems that will arise as a result of the <Col N="1728" /> GATT and also on the advantages.  I understand that report is with the Government and it would be useful if it were published.  It would clarify many of the issues.  We would do well to face up to the issues as they arise.  Sooner or later they will have to be addressed.  I again thank Deputy Molloy for his graciousness and generosity in allowing me in.</P>

      <P>B'fhéidir go raibh sé beagáinín glic ag an Rialtas an tAire Turasóireachta agus Trádála a chur isteach sa Teach anocht chun léacht a thabhairt dúinn ar GATT i gcoitinne agus gan deileáil leis an bpríomh-phointe sa rún a cuireadh ós comhair an Tí, sé sin an cur isteach ar an dtionscal talmhaíochta a thiocfaidh as an socrú seo má chuirtear i bhfeidhm é sa chaoi ina bhfuil sé beartaithe faoi láthair.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The December 15 deadline for finalising the GATT Agreement is now just a month away.  Previous deadlines have not been realised, but it is obvious that next month's target date is vital, and failure to reach agreement could spark a dangerous trade war which would be entirely regressive and damaging.  A GATT Agreement is an essential prerequisite to growing world trade and boosting economic growth in the global economy. As a small open economy, Ireland depends to an exceptional extent on developing and expanding overseas markets and has a keen interest too in the prosperity of overseas customers. Ireland's national interest in a global and balanced GATT Agreement is therefore self-evident.  But the nature and content of the agreement concluded is of the most vital concern to this country.  In particular, our unique dependence within <Col N="1729" /> the European Community on our agricultural sector must be taken fully into account.</P>
    <P>I state that, conscious of the fact that there are 14 other sectors covered by the draft agreement and that major problems still remain to be resolved in some of these also, where other countries are concerned. However, here in Ireland our real concern surrounds our unique dependence on agriculture, not only in terms of the number of people directly employed in farming but also the number of downstream processing jobs.</P>
    <P>For instance, as the Culliton report pointed out, our food industry accounts for a fifth of all Irish exports and over 20 per cent of all manufacturing employment in this country.  Moreover, the food industry is crucial to the further development of indigenous industry, which is the only basis on which any serious inroads can be made into the unemployment crisis.  The fact that a product like Bailey's Irish Cream liqueur has already figured on a potential US hit list in the event of a trade war that might ensue in the absence of a GATT Agreement underlines the problem.  Bailey's are a major user of Irish milk and cream and the company underlines the direct relationship between farming and industrial jobs.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear therefore that the issue of a GATT Agreement represents a serious dilemma for this country.  Given our overall reliance on exports we need an agreement.  Last year our exports were valued at £16 billion &mdash; but it cannot be at a price that would cause serious damage to our single most vital industry, which is agriculture; a quarter of last year's exports value was generated by agriculture and food.  For these reasons it is essential that the eventual GATT Agreement that emerges must safeguard our vital farming and food sector interests.</P>
    <P>I welcome the commitment of September 20 from the so-called Jumbo EC Council that the European Community will ensure that international agreements like the GATT are compatible with the CAP and that it must not jeopardise the CAP, either directly or indirectly.  But <Col N="1730" /> there is still immense confusion and fears about the possibility of fulfilling this commitment.</P>
    <P>The elements of the Blair House Agreement of November 1992 which must be adjusted are well known by now. The proposed 21 per cent cut in subsidised exports would mean cutbacks in the level of output in sectors that are vital to the wellbeing of Irish farming and agribusiness, especially beef, where exports would be reduced substantially in the first year.  Therefore, among the issues that must be revised is the back-loading rather than front-loading of reductions in agricultural exports and the associated problem of seasonality of output here.  For instance, this year our disastrous grain harvest underlines the necessity to work within an overall adjustment period of five years rather than concentrating on the degree of adjustment to be achieved in each single year.  However, it is good we have achieved a significant reduction in beef intervention stockpiles and achieving higher commercial sales of Irish beef. Naturally that is the route we must take and we need to accelerate the creation of market-led agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>The Government must ensure also that changes arising from the Blair House draft agreement in respect of agricultural output here do not exceed the changes already arising under the CAP reform programme which anticipated the GATT changes that would arise.  That is the objective of the Jumbo Council guidelines issued at the meeting held on 20 September.</P>
    <P>Current intervention stock piles of beef, butter and cereals should not be included in the Blair House draft calculations since they arose in the period before that agreement.  Special window sales should be allowed for the disposal of those stocks independent of the Blair House targets but such funding would be problematic.</P>
    <P>The US authorities have been insisting that adjustments like those being sought should be achieved internally by the European Community, but that would pose major difficulties for the Community <Col N="1731" /> budget.  The budget for the Common Agricultural Policy is already exhausted and is expected to exceed its guideline next year by some 900 million ECUs.  That means that there would be immense difficulty in getting Community agreement to fund adjustments of the Blair House targets, such as the disposal of intervention stocks.</P>
    <P>However, the issue of the manner of applying an eventual Blair House deal from country to country within the Community and from product to product is also of vital concern and the Government must ensure that at this follow-on working through stage of any agreement our vital farming interests are safeguarded. In other words, if a Blair House final agreement emerges, it will be a matter for the Community to apply burden-sharing between the 12 member states.  The vital and unique dependence of Ireland with France, must be taken fully into account also.</P>
    <P>The task facing the Government is obviously complex and difficult, but it needs to be much more robust, visible and vocal in the battle to adjust Blair House and ensure the vital interests of our farming sector.  However there is no indication that it is displaying the kind of vigour we have come to associate with the rearguard action being fought for instance, by the French Government. Our Government is simply trying to have it both ways; feigning concern for our farmers and agriculture, but leaving the real donkey-work of lobbying and challenging Blair House to the French to Commissioner Leon Brittan.  We cannot over-emphasise how unique Ireland's position is and the necessity to protect agriculture as our main industry, at the same time we must ensure ready access to world markets for our agriculture and food products.  Ireland's overall dependence on access to export markets for all manufactured goods is greater than most countries and any move to return to increased tariff barriers on the world markets would have correspondingly disastrous results for this country.  Our only hope of ever being able to provide <Col N="1732" /> adequate jobs to employ our people is dependent on our ability to produce quality goods at an efficient price for which there is a demand in the market place. Our future prospects as a nation depend on our having open access to world markets. It is very much in our overall interests that a satisfactory GATT is achieved that will give us the access we require.  The benefits accruing to Ireland would spread over a wide variety of products and markets, as outlined by the Minister in his speech.</P>
    <P>With just one month left before the crucial GATT deadline, it is worrying that the Government is not displaying the zeal and vigour one would expect of those charged with negotiating on our behalf. It is not satisfactory that even up until today the Government has not yet finalised its consideration of the special report prepared for the Minister for Tourism and Trade on the effects of GATT.  The findings of that report have not been made available to Members of this House.  In reply to questions on 27 October the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry stated that the Government would finalise its position in regard to that report shortly and publish it.  It is very disappointing that a debate is taking place without Members having the benefit of seeing the consultants' report.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, when replying to questions, stated that the Minister for Tourism and Trade initiated the report and would bring it to the Government.  I would have expected that the Minister, in his long dissertation to the House, would have referred to the content and findings of that report.  We want to know the effect of the Blair House Agreement, especially if it is implemented in the form of a final GATT agreement.  The debate is the poorer for that report not being available to Members.  I offered to share my time with Deputy Crawford and I am making a Minister's blunder by not allowing my colleague in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Deputy Molloy.  The implementation of the GATT agreement has led to a serious <Col N="1733" /> situation developing here.  At this stage it is nearly too late to deal with it.  I am aware that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry is in Brussels, but the fact that neither of the junior Ministers is present gives some indication of the Government's commitment to agriculture. Deputy Upton made the point that agriculture is now no longer an important issue for this country.  Following the EC agreement on prices, Deputy Dukes and other colleagues called for debate on that agreement in this House but obviously agriculture is no longer considered an important issue.</P>
      <P>We must consider the problems regarding negotiations in respect of the GATT agreement and the recent CAP reform.  I do not want to take from the work of the former Commissioner for Agriculture, Mr. MacSharry.  However, one of the biggest mistakes by a former Government was to accept the post of Agriculture Commissioner.  At the time the post was easy to get because no other member state wanted it.  During the years we benefited from our ability to negotiate with the Agriculture Commissioner and the outcome benefited small farmers. Those negotiations were successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One need only recall the special agreements negotiated for this country by the former Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald and the former Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Deasy.  They were able to obtain the support of our Commissioner who was in a position to enlist the support of the agricultural Commissioner of the day. Unfortunately, when Ray MacSharry became Commissioner for Agriculture our negotiators ceased to make a case for agriculture.  There was not a whimper from our negotiators in respect of what was happening at Commission level.  The only whimper was when Commissioner MacSharry left office, the French started to show their teeth by leading the way and we placidly fell in behind them.  I know agriculture may not be an important issue for discussion and the Minister may not be interested in listening.  The reality is that we did not have the guts to stand up against our Commissioner and we have lost out as a result.  Deputies <Col N="1734" /> Dukes and Molloy outlined the massive cuts we will suffer from now until the year 2000.  The damage it will do to Irish farmers and the Irish economy will not be understood until it happens.</P>

      <P>For a number of years Kerry County Council and many organisations throughout Kerry have made numerous appeals to have the Tralee to Mallow rail line upgraded, but to no avail.  On Thursday last, 11 November, there was a very serious rail derailment on the outskirts of Tralee.  Thirteen people were removed to Tralee General Hospital with minor injuries and all were detained.  Thankfully, none of them was seriously injured, which could have been the case had the accident happened approximately 100 yards further down the line where the drop could have been from 50 to 75 feet.</P>
      <P>Emergency funding is necessary on the Tralee-Mallow line.  Substantial funding &mdash; £275 million &mdash; is included in the National Plan for upgrading the national railway line.  I appeal to the Minister to make available the necessary funding to upgrade the Tralee-Mallow line forthwith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The old Craven carriages, which are approximately 32 years old, are still in use on this line and this is no longer acceptable.  The Tralee to Mallow line is a vital link to Kerry, which is a major tourist county.  There are two Inter-city trains direct to Dublin.  I understand that 550,000 people used the Tralee-Mallow line last year compared with 450,000 passengers on the Dublin-Belfast line. Millions of pounds are being spent on the <Col N="1735" /> Dublin-Belfast line with nothing being done for the Tralee-Mallow line.  The people of Tralee and Kerry will no longer stand for this.  They are now demanding action.</P>
    <P>Tralee is a major rail depot for Kerry. Approximately 25,000 tonnes of fertilisers per year and 8,000 tonnes of cement is handled here as well as all Guinness products for Kerry, with the exception of Killarney and Kenmare.  For Kerry Group, a major employer in Kerry, 1,000 40 ft. containers for the North American market are handled.</P>
    <P>I understand that 17 diesel cars and ten new engines have been purchased and are due for delivery in April 1994.  I appeal that a new engine and four diesel cars be allocated to the Tralee to Mallow line and that work on upgrading the track proceed immediately.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Foley for sharing his time with me.  The derailment of a train on the Tralee-Mallow line has caused serious concern in Kerry it has shattered the confidence of Kerry's travelling public in Iarnród Éireann services.  It is absolutely vital that Iarnród Éireann restores that confidence.  I ask the Minister to ensure that full details of the cause of the derailment be made public by Iarnród Éireann. Rail and rolling stock on the line must meet the highest possible safety standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tralee-Mallow rail line is used by huge numbers of rail travellers on a regular basis.  The derailment could have occurred at a time when hundreds of passengers were on board.  There are more than 600 students at Tralee Regional Technical College who do not come from Kerry, and many of these students travel home by train every weekend. Thousands of visitors use this rail line every year, and weekend commuters from Dublin and Cork pack these trains on Friday and Sunday nights.  We can only imagine how serious the situation would have been if it had been a crowded train that was derailed.  The Mallow-Tralee rail line gives access to two of <Col N="1736" /> Kerry's and indeed Ireland's most famous beauty spots, Killarney and Dingle, so one can imagine the usage of trains in the summertime.</P>
    <P>As a public representative with responsibility to the community I demand that both rail and rolling stock are maintained to a standard that will guarantee safety of rail travellers on the line in question, the Tralee-Mallow line. I hope the Minister can give an assurance tonight that money will be provided for this purpose so that confidence can be restored in Iarnród Éireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Foley for sharing his time with me.  The recent derailment at the Bog Road Bridge, Ballyseedy, has again raised the question of the adequacy of the Tralee-Mallow line. In recent years there have been a number of incidents on this line, some of which could have been very serious.  Iarnród Éireann carries out regular walking inspections of the line.  However, I am sure the authorities in Iarnród Éireann will agree that the line needs to be considerably upgraded, including improved signalling, line straightening and alleviation of flooding at some locations.</P>
      <P>If we are to make the line safer and restore the confidence of the commuters from Kerry to destinations outside the county, including students, businesspeople, tourists and so on, it is important that a large amount of the £275 million available for upgrading rail lines be used on this line.  Ten new locomotives will be commissioned shortly and I appeal that one of these be assigned to the Inter-city line between Tralee and Dublin.  Of the 17 rail cars promised by the Taoiseach to Cobh, at least one of these should act as a feeder service between Tralee and Mallow.  As a result of the recent incident, the Tralee-Mallow line must be placed on top of the priority list for major upgrading work because of its importance to the future of the county.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's motion has been prompted by the unfortunate accident which occurred <Col N="1737" /> on Thursday last when the 9.55 passenger train on its way from Tralee to Cork was derailed about three miles outside Tralee.  The guard's van and the passenger coaches were derailed and indeed one of these coaches ended up lying on its side.  As a result of the accident, 12 passengers were admitted to Tralee General Hospital and I understand that one still remains there at present.  I am sure that the experience was a very harrowing one for those involved and I would like to take this opportunity to extend my sympathy to the injured and to wish them a speedy and complete recovery.  Indeed on the day of the accident the chairman of CIE reported to me directly from the scene and I asked him to convey my sympathy to the injured.  I would also like to pay tribute to the staff of Iarnród Éireann, to the medical and emergency services and to the Garda for the part they played in mitigating the worst effects of the accident, especially as regards the help they gave to the injured and distressed.</P>
      <P>The priority at this stage is to identify the exact cause of the derailment.  This is, of course, primarily a matter for Iarnród Éireann and I am advised that the company's investigation has already begun. The chairman has indicated to me that the investigating team's report is expected to be ready for submission to my Department within about eight weeks.  The Department's railway inspecting officer, who also visited the accident site on the day of the derailment, will examine Iarnród Éireann's findings to see whether any additional inquiries are necessary.  In particular, he will evaluate the report's conclusions with a view to making recommendations which I would submit to the company so as to prevent, or at least minimise, the chances of a similar occurrence in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Safety is an essential element of railway operations and the maintenance of safety standards, including the allocation of the necessary funds, is as much a part of the rail operator's responsibilities as any of the other aspects of running a railway system.  The requirement to have regard to safety of operation is one of <Col N="1738" /> the statutory duties imposed on Iarnród Éireann and one which, I know, the company takes very seriously indeed.  The CIE chairman has assured me that safety continues to be Irish Rail's main priority and will not be compromised.  The company continuously strives, as a matter of policy, to improve the quality of service and standards of safety on the railway. Under existing arrangements all of the 1,944 kilometres of track on the rail network are visually inspected at least twice weekly.  Any defects found on inspection are reported and arrangements are made for their immediate repair.  Maintenance personnel are located strategically throughout the rail network for this purpose. In addition, the chairman has indicasted that Irish Rail has detailed and extensive procedures in place to ensure the safe operation of railway services at all times.</P>
    <P>Safety, as we know, carries a price tag, and the cost associated with maintaining safety standards on our rail network is one of these areas of essential expenditure for which Iarnród Éireann is required to budget in the normal way. If, for example, the investigation of the Tralee derailment identifies a particular need for safety-related expenditure on the line, it will be a priority matter for Iarnród Éireann to find the necessary funding within the overall resources available to the company.</P>
    <P>Iarnród Éireann is, of course, heavily dependent on the Exchequer as a source of funding, and the level of Exchequer support for the railway over the years has been very substantial.  Total direct support for the railways amounted to £1,030 million between 1980 and 1992. In the same period, capital investment of over £250 million was made by CIE in the railway network.  Of the 1993 Exchequer grant to CIE of £108.4 million, £90.4 million will go to Iarnród Éireann.  Of this amount, approximately £45 million will go to the maintenance and upkeep of the railway infrastructure.  Apart from a small number of exceptional items, the deployment of the Exchequer support is a matter for CIE.  In addition, the Public Capital Programme for 1993 provides for <Col N="1739" /> capital expenditure by the CIE group of up to £97 million, up to £77 million of which will be spent by Iarnród Éireann on a number of major developmental and track renewal projects.</P>
    <P>The Deputies mentioned the question of assistance for improvements to the Tralee line under the National Devlopment Plan.  The House will probably be aware that the plan includes provision for an EC-assisted national mainline rail development programme involving expenditure of approximately £185 million supported by the Cohesion Fund and the Structural Fund in the period 1994-99. In addition, a further £90 million approximately of unco-financed investment is proposed over the period of the plan subject to the resources available to CIE.  The unco-financed expenditure will be funded from CIE's own resources. The total investment in railway network under the plan will amount to £275 million over the period of the plan.</P>
    <P>The Mallow-Tralee line is included in the network proposed to the Brussels authorities for EC grant assistance under the proposed programme.  This funding will enable an accelerated track renewal programme to be undertaken, together with the replacement of the existing signalling system.  The new trackwork will be in the form of continuously welded rails on concrete sleepers which will permit faster speeds on the line.</P>
    <P>Finalisation of the investment programme proposed in the National Development Plan, as regards specific expenditures on individual railway lines, will follow from consultations over the coming months between the Department, CIE and the European Commission.</P>
    <P>Deputies will appreciate that in the circumstances any commitments to individual projects in advance of the finalisation of the overall programme would, obviously, be premature.  I wish to confirm, however, that I will take on board the points raised by the Deputies and I will keep them informed of Iarnród Éireann's proposals in relation to this line.</P>

      <P>Athenry is one of the main towns in County Galway.  The water supply in the town, which is switched off at 12 o'clock at night and not switched on again until 7 a.m. the following morning, is totally inadequate.  This causes major problems for the people of the town, particularly the elderly and families with young children. Obviously the water tanks are depleted during the night and a further problem is caused by the noise of tanks being filled in the morning.</P>
      <P>It is totally unsatisfactory that a town the size of Athenry does not have a 24-hour water supply.  I understand it was proposed some considerable time ago to extend the Oranmore to Derrydonnell water scheme to Athenry, thus providing a 24-hour water supply for the town.  I also understand that leaks in the town system, which is an old system, are causing problems.  Galway County Council is proposing to allocate funding in 1994 to enable these leaks to be detected.</P>
      <P>It is of the utmost importance for the future of Athenry that it has a proper and adequate water supply.  The east part of County Galway generally has suffered from depopulation and it is very import-and that further development takes place in these areas so as to curb this problem. A prerequisite for any future development of Athenry has to be an adequate water supply.  I ask the Minister to provide the necessary funding to extend the water supply from Derrydonnell to Athenry, a distance of some miles.  The extension of the supply and its connection to the existing water system in the town should be carried out in conjunction with a programme undertaken by the local authority to identify leaks in the town's present water supply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, accepts that there are long-standing water supply problems in the Athenry area.  Rationing measures and other restrictions on water <Col N="1741" /> supply have resulted from this situation, and these are clearly a source of inconvenience, and in some cases, hardship whenever they occur.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy John Browne, met recently with a deputation from the mid-Galway area to discuss water supply problems in the Caherfinisker and Lisheenkyle areas.  The position regarding Athenry's water supply problem and the need to extend the mid-Galway regional water supply scheme to serve the town of Athenry was also highlighted on that occasion.</P>
      <P>The mid-Galway regional water supply scheme was designed over a decade ago to provide water to the area in a number of separate stages.  The mid-Galway region was divided into four zones for this purpose.  Zones 1, 2, 4 and Phase 1 of zone 3 have already been connected to the regional scheme, at a cost of more than £1.7 million.  The latest phase completed, zone 3, phase 1, has brought water from Oranmore to Derrydonnell. The town of Athenry is in zone 3 also and under the next stage, zone 3, phase 2, it is proposed to pump water from Derrydonnell to a reservoir to be constructed at Knocknacreeva.  The water will be then pumped from the new reservoir to the town of Athenry and surrounding areas.  The proposed works include 11,324 metres of trunk mains, 6,098 metres of rising main, and two pump stations.  The reservoir at Knocknacreeva will have a storage capacity of 4,545 cubic metres.  This will provide a guaranteed supply to the town of Athenry and serve a number of group schemes along the route.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Galway County Council has been advised to prepare contract documents for site investigations for this second phase of zone 3.  These are awaited in the Department of the Environment.  Contract documents for the pipelines and reservoir will obviously depend on the results of these site investigations.  The overall estimated cost of the second phase, at 1992 prices, is £1.8 million.  This scheme is currently being considered for EC co-financing in the context of the <Col N="1742" /> post-1993 operational programme for environmental services.</P>
    <P>The National Development Plan provides a total of £605 million for the water and sanitary services programme for the period 1994-99.  This level of expenditure is in line with the commitments of the environment action programme.  Within the framework of the National Development Plan and its emphasis on targeting areas of greatest need, preparation has begun on the operational programme for environmental services.  Priorities under the operational programme will take account of a wide range of factors including the need to meet our obligations under the EC Urban Waste Water Directive, to improve water quality standards, and to meet the requirements of industry and the tourism sector.</P>
    <P>Galway County Council has benefited considerably in recent years from investment in water and sanitary services schemes.  Over the last five years alone, nearly £16 million has been allocated to schemes in the county.  The allocation for 1992 and 1993 has been in excess of £5 million each year.  The Tuam regional water supply scheme, at an estimated cost of some £20 million, has been submitted to the EC Commission for Cohesion Fund aid.  This project is currently at tender stage.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the position on the Athenry water scheme is that site investigations &mdash; a vital part of the planning process &mdash; are being advanced.  Approval of the main scheme will have to be considered in the overall context of the new operational programme for environmental services.  I will, however, bring Deputy Ó Cuív's concerns directly to the attention of the Minister for the Environment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, you will be glad to know that I do not have any of the destroyed cauliflowers with me tonight, they have long since been buried again in the soils of north County Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1743" /> During the exceptional weather conditions last May and early June when 300 per cent of normal rainfall fell, hundreds of acres of vegetables, potatoes, soft fruits and cereals were lost irretrievably. In some instances, farmers suffered a 70 per cent reduction in output and many potato growers report that instead of achieving eight to ten tonnes per acre they are getting returns on the remaining land of one to two tonnes per acre.</P>
    <P>Following the carrying out of a scientific survey by Teagasc, it is now estimated that the losses have reached at least £10.7 million and many of the growers have been pushed to the edge of financial ruin.  At a packed meeting yesterday in the Grand Hotel in Malahide, many growers from counties Wexford, Wicklow, Kildare, Meath, south Louth and, in particular, from north County Dublin, outlined the devastation which has been caused to their businesses. In the potato crop area, the &ldquo;Brithis Queens&rdquo; variety was worst hit.  This variety represents 50 per cent of the total County Dublin acreage of 5,500 and a great number of those acres were lost. The vegetables worst hit were iceberg lettuce, cauliflowers, early swedes, parsnips and broccoli.  In Wexford particularly, 152 acres of strawberries were destroyed and most of the crops that remain have suffered yield and quality reduction.  Even protected crops, as Deputy Howlin will tell the Minister, suffered from water logging.</P>
    <P>There is a great air of devastation about this industry.  Many spoke movingly at the meeting yesterday of the fact that they will now have to apply for social welfare benefit and give up their businesses. I recognise that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the Minister of State have expressed sympathy and support for the growers' plight. Last week, the Minister, Deputy Joe Walsh, announced the allocation of £1 million for compensation.  This is not enough.  It will not make up for the damage that has been done to this industry. It is to be welcomed that the Minister has accepted the principle of paying compensation <Col N="1744" /> for these excessive losses, but this amount of compensation in no way matches the needs of this industry which is on its knees at the moment.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that in excess of 450 jobs are threatened in the horticultural industry.  If a factory with the same number of employees was threatened with closure, the IDA and many other State bodies would be offering millions of pounds in inducements to foreign investors to try to save those jobs, and rightly so.  The Minister has his chance to save those jobs in the horticultural industry.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that it costs £50,000 approximately to create one industrial job.  In order to replace the approximately 466 jobs that are threatened in the horticultural industry, it would cost £23 million.  I am giving the Minister those figures as an indication of how little he has actually offered to save the jobs in horticulture.  Surely it is not too much to ask the Minister to make an adequate level of compensation available to these farmers and their families so that they can continue in this important indigenous industry.  If his responsibility for horticulture is to have any meaning, here is his chance to indicate it.</P>
    <P>I warn the Minister that if he does not wish to preside over the demise of the horticultural industry, particularly in areas of north County Dublin such as Lusk, Rush and parts of Skerries, he would be well advised to examine the Teagasc report and convince the Minister for Finance that he needs additional funding.  He must also convince the EC that it is necessary to have equivalent funds to make up for these exceptional weather circumstances.</P>
    <P>This industry has come together as a cohesive force.  I want to say to the Minister's colleague, Deputy Howlin, that there was a very large contingent from County Wexford at the meeting yesterday.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Owen has already stated, a fund of £1 million has been established, out of which assistance will be granted to horticultural and potato growers who suffered major or total crop losses due to abnormal weather conditions this year.  The assistance will be focused in those areas most seriously affected.  My Department, in conjunction with Teagasc, is at present compiling the detailed information required before the exact criteria for eligibility for assistance can be determined.</P>
      <P>With regard to the overall picture, my information is that the bad weather resulted in a general reduction in yields. However, much of that reduction has been compensated for by increases in prices.  The principal crop affected was the potato crop.  The current price at the Dublin wholesale market for a 25 kilogram bag of &ldquo;Kerr's Pinks&rdquo; is £4.50 compared with £2.50 this time last year. Similarly, &ldquo;records&rdquo; are selling for £3.50 compared with £2 last year.  I recognise that some farmers were more seriously affected and it is those that I will be endeavouring to identify and assist.</P>
      <P>I must point out, however, that the provision of this assistance will under no circumstances be accepted as a precedent for the future.  The risk of crop losses is a normal commercial risk associated with crop production.  In future farmers will be expected to make provision for such losses either through insurance or the establishment by the farming organisations of a fund with contributions from members out of which those who suffer losses could be helped.</P>

      <P>Mayo General Hospital cost £10 million to build and by any standards it is a fine, modern hospital which is well equipped.  It was a long awaited and eagerly anticipated development. However, rather than improving the quality of service available to the patients in the area, constant cutbacks and under-funding have repeatedly turned back the clock.</P>
      <P>Last July, the Western Health Board closed the 12-bed gynaecology section. For the past number of weeks, elderly male patients have been transferred to the maternity section.  This is an appalling development.  It is not fair to the males in question, who are weak, ill and vulnerable; but it certainly is not acceptable to pregnant women awaiting the birth of their babies or women who have just given birth to babies.  It is simply an unacceptable practice and marks a new low in the quality of service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The final straw was the announcement this week that D block, the only female surgical ward in the hospital, is to close for a seven week period as and from Sunday next.  Taken in conjunction with the conditions obtaining in the maternity unit, with the locking up of the gynaecology section, this represents an appalling attack on the health and dignity of female patients.  It means that anything of a routine nature will have to be deferred.  It also means that potentially dangerous ailments, which appear on first analysis to be routine and simple enough, will be given time to worsen and become potentially life-threatening.  It now means that acute female surgical cases will be scattered among the remaining open wards where all elective surgery <Col N="1747" /> has to be put on hold.  This is simply unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enda Kenny and I have been contacted by distraught patients at the hospital.  We have been contacted by the relatives of patients at the hospital.  We have been contacted by the nursing staff and authorities at the hospital who are appalled at what is now happening and at what is planned.</P>
    <P>I contacted the Western Health Board today.  The raw reality is that finance is the root of the problem.  Mayo General Hospital has pruned its level of services to the very bone.  In regard to expenditure on those services, every possible economy has been made.  However, there is a level below which it simply cannot go.  That level was reached in July last, has now been reached in relation to the maternity treatment and has certainly been reached with the decision to close the only female surgical ward.</P>
    <P>The fact is that, after all necessary economies, the hospital authorities are now £350,000 short of what they require to run the hospital.  I listened to the Minister for four years when he was in Opposition; but I warn him now, in his capacity as Minister for Health, that this money simply must be found.  It is his job as Minister for Health; it is his social and moral responsibility to find this money. By his failure to provide adequate funding to run the hospital he has placed the hospital authorities in a position in which they are faced with impossible choices. This is an attack on the health of women. In fact, it is a breach of human rights. We are aware of the increasing incidence of mastectomy operations and the trauma involved for patients.  Surely we have reached an all time low when mastectomy patients, whose ongoing treatment and prosthesis require privacy and individual specialist attention, will not now be given this attention because the nurses will have been switched to some other section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can tuttut <Col N="1748" /> all he wants.  Because of the closure of the female surgical ward all booked admissions will be cancelled.  People on waiting lists are being told that they cannot be attended to in the foreseeable future.</P>
      <P>The Minister can play around with words and figures all he wants.  What I have relayed to him is the position on the ground in the hospital if this closure goes ahead.  There is no point in building a new, modern hospital with a grandiose opening if the money is not provided for running the service, because the level of service now envisaged is scarcely on a par with that applicable in some Third World countries.  I warn the Minister that this will not be tolerated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Jim Higgins for allowing me a proportion of his time on this matter of grave concern and of very serious consequences for the entire population of County Mayo.</P>
      <P>I respected the present Minister for Health as Opposition spokesperson on Health for the Labour Party before his present appointment.  But in his present capacity he has to preside over the selfsame service he decried from those benches.  While he might attempt to run them in a different fashion, the consequences on the ground are horrific.</P>
      <P>I live in Castlebar town.  Mayo General Hospital is of great importance to the town and surrounding regions.  The method being adopted by the Western Health Board of day surgical treatment does not take into account the distance travelled in a county such as Mayo.  For example, it is 70 miles from Castlebar to Belmullet and Blacksod.  How is a patient expected to travel up by ambulance for a day operation and return the same evening?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I challenge the Minister, as a man, as a politician and as Minister, to travel down to Mayo General Hospital on Monday morning next and explain to the matron, nurses, doctors, patients and staff how he envisages the hospital being run at optimum levels when there has been a padlock on the gynaecology ward since July last, when there will be further <Col N="1749" /> padlocks placed on D block, particularly when one takes into account that since 1987 the number of admissions has increased from 12,050 to 14,900, an increase of 23 per cent; that casualty treatments have increased from 11,757 to 16,420, an increase of 40 per cent, with no increased employment there; and that 19 jobs are being lost as a result of this latest proposal.  In circumstances in which the Government have promised that everything would be bright and beautiful under the National Development Plan, people are absolutely appalled that 42 beds are proposed to be closed in Mayo General Hospital.</P>
    <P>When replying I hope the Minister will give us some consolation, some hope. Indeed, I hope he will take up my challenge to him to travel down to Castlebar on Monday morning next, when the Western Health Board intend implementing this draft, nonsensical and very serious proposal, and explain what is happening.</P>

      <P>It is regrettable that once again Deputy Jim Higgins has made an unwarranted attack on the quality of services at Mayo General Hospital without any regard to its impact on the patients or the service providers. It is difficult to believe that Deputy Jim Higgins, for whatever reason, is prepared to label the general hospital serving his area as &ldquo;Third World&rdquo; as he did in this morning's papers.  He knows as well as I do that the service provided there by highly trained, dedicated staff is on a par with the very best available anywhere in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>He must be aware also that there are no waiting lists at Castlebar General Hospital.  Despite the fact that the Western Health Board received nearly £2.2 million additional money under the current waiting lists initiative, it was not necessary to allocate any proportion of these funds to Castlebar because there are no waiting lists in any of the relevant speciality services provided <Col N="1750" /> by that hospital.  Deputy Jim Higgins should also be aware that, there was a significant increase in activity throughput in the hospital in 1992 as compared with 1991, this heightened the level of activity will be maintained in 1993.</P>
      <P>The decision of the Western Health Board to close some beds on the surgical side of the hospital is being presented by Deputy Higgins and others as unjustified and related solely to budgetary considerations. Let me put the issue in context. During 1993 the Western Health Board has taken a number of practical steps at the hospital to improve efficiency in line with good established practice everywhere else.  This year it has established an eight bed medical assessment unit to ensure that all overnight medical admissions are necessary and has opened an eight bed day surgery unit.  The board is also about to implement an integrated admissions policy which will ensure that all beds at the hospital are used efficiently to meet patients' needs.  <i>Inter alia,</i> that should eliminate the problems which have arisen in relation to the placement of male and female patients within that hospital.</P>
      <P>The Deputies opposite have made much of the fact that the closures are directed at women.  Of course, this is not the case.  The decision of the board in relation to elective surgery applies equally to men and women.  There is absolutely no threat to emergency admissions, irrespective of the numbers that may arise.  In order that the position can be made crystal clear locally the Western Health Board itself has arranged for a briefing of Mayo members of that health board later this week.</P>
      <P>Given that the hospital does not have a waiting list, it would be reasonable to expect that the introduction of these measures, that is, the day surgery &mdash; the current normal advance in medicine nowadays &mdash; would reduce the need for existing surgical beds to be open throughout the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, there is a financial dimension with which the Western Health Board and all other health boards must cope.  When I made allocations to the <Col N="1751" /> health boards in respect of this year I was satisfied that those allocations would support the approved level of activity. This assessment is supported by the information available to me in respect of this year, that the throughput will at least maintain last year's record throughput.  I made it clear to the health boards that I did not expect them to produce more activities than their allocations could sustain, that I expected them to live within their allocations subject to certain exceptions, notably demand-led schemes and certain other unavoidable costs such as increases in medical defence fees.  I am sure that Deputy Jim Higgins and his <Col N="1752" /> party will agree that this approach is reasonable, especially in the light of the financial strategy disclosed by his colleague last week, that of wanting to cap expenditure in mine and every other Department to 2 per cent this year.</P>
    <P>They cannot argue both ways simultaneously over on those benches.  I want to repeat that, even with the temporary closure of beds between now and the end of the year, the Western Health Board has confirmed that there will be no reductions in the overall level of activity at Mayo General Hospital.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 17 November 1993.</P>

      <P>The problems in Germany relate primarily to blood and liquid plasma.  I am informed by the Blood Transfusion Service Board that blood and liquid plasma have not been imported by them into Ireland from any country in the past ten years.  Ireland has achieved self-sufficiency in blood and liquid plasma.  In Ireland, there is a very high standard of donor screening which accords with the EC and Council of Europe guidelines.  I am confident that the screening procedures of the Blood Tansfusion Service Board are adequate to ensure high quality blood which conforms to the highest international standards.</P>
      <P>Whilst, as I have already indicated, the problems in Germany relate primarily to blood and liquid plasma, I wish to set out the position in regard to blood products. I am informed that from 1987 to 1989, Irish plasma was exported for fractionation under contract to Armour Pharmaceuticals in Germany and subsequently re-imported as blood products. The plasma used in these blood products was from Irish donors and the finished blood product was virtually inactivated.</P>
      <P>The Blood Transfusion Service Board has also informed me that any blood products imported by them from Germany have been virally inactivated and do not pose any risk of HIV to any Irish patient who may have received them. Notwithstanding this, the Blood Transfusion Sevice Board, as a pecautionary measure, has implemented a recall of one product imported from Germany.</P>
      <P>I understand that certain other blood products originating in Germany have been imported into this country other than through the Blood Transfusion Servce Board and while these products have also been virally inactivated, the National Drugs Advisory Board has, as a precautionary measure, directed last week that all of these products be withdrawn.</P>
      <P>I have asked my Department to review the procedures in place at present to ensure that the highest possible levels of safety in relation to blood and blood products continue to be maintained.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 48 together.  Alcohol related problems make a heavy demand on our psychiatric services.  Traditionally those suffering from alcohol related problems have been treated in our psychiatric hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the report of a study group on the development of the psychiatric services, <i>Planning for the Future,</i> published in 1984 referred to the trend in <Col N="1515" /> Ireland towards greater specialisation in the management of alcohol related problems. This approach often involves costly in-patient care which tends to separate the treatment and management of alcohol related problems from the environment in which they occur.  The report recommended that the emphasis in the management of alcohol related problems should be on community based intervention rather than on specialist inpatient treatment.</P>
    <P>There would, however, continue to be a need for detoxification facilities in hospitals and a small number of residential places for people who for social reasons, cannot benefit from day programmes.</P>
    <P>The recommendations of <i>Planning for the Future</i> were endorsed in the Green Paper on Mental Health published by my Department in 1992.  With the shift in emphasis towards out-patient treatment and counselling, it proposes that the consultant psychiatrist would spend more time in training other members of the inter-disciplinary team and in counselling and advising members of the primary care services.  It noted that the role of the specialist service should be to support the general practitioner in resolving alcohol-related problems in the context of the health of the individual and family as a whole; and it envisaged an important role for nurses and social workers.</P>
    <P>In line with this approach, comprehensive community-based alcohol treatment programmes are being promoted. Health Boards which have not already developed local alcohol treatment services are being encouraged to do so and to consider ways in which services provided by voluntary and private organisations can be integrated with health board services.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, the emphasis in regard to alcohol related problems should be on their prevention.  This is a key element in the formulation of a national policy on alcohol being developed by the Advisory Council on Health Promotion wherein the broader economic, social, educational, cultural and health factors <Col N="1516" /> which impinge on alcohol use and misuse are addressed.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27, 75 and 98 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies will be aware, approval was given to the Southern Health Board by my Department to provide new clean air theatre facilities at St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital, Gurranebraher, at a cost of nearly £1 million. Work on the project commenced recently.</P>
      <P>The contract period of the project is 40 weeks and I understand that the contract was structured in order to facilitate the continued functioning of the theatres for all but four to six weeks of the contract period.  Representatives of the consultant medical staff were included in the project team which planned the development over many months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In early October 1993 the consultant orthopaedic surgeons indicated to the hospital management team that, in their opinion, the theatres in St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital would have to close following the commencement of building work due to the increased risk <Col N="1517" /> of infection which would ensue.  A report on the theatre complex by the consultant microbiologist was subsequently commissioned and on the basis of the findings, the surgeons took a clinical decision to cease operating.</P>
    <P>The microbiologist's report indicated, however, that the elevated bacterial counts in the theatres complex were due to the inability of the ventilation to handle organisms shed by personnel, rather than contamination from the building site or related building activities.</P>
    <P>The Southern Health Board is in the process of installing a temporary ventilation system in the theatres.  It is expected that this work will be completed this week after which the theatres will be tested again for bacterial levels.  The board has assured me that every effort has been, and will continue to be made to find a resolution to this problem at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>With regard to orthopaedic services generally in Cork, the Deputies will be pleased to note that in August last I approved the filling of a fifth consultant orthopaedic surgeon post in Cork on a permanent basis.  I am confident that this post together with the development of new clean air theatre facilities will substantially improve the service for orthopaedic patients in Cork.</P>

      <P>The provision of general practitioners' services at local level under the general medical services scheme is a matter for individual health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, under the scheme there are agreed procedures <Col N="1518" /> which apply in the case of the death of a participating doctor.  Specifically, transfers of patients from the list of a vacant practice are not permitted until after the vacant post has been filled.  This provision has been agreed with the Irish Medical Organisation and is in place to ensure the effective and proper organisation of general practitioner services.  The Southern Health Board in accordance with these procedures froze the vacant panel on the death of the participating doctor pending the permanent filling of the vacant post.  As there is now a legal claim by another local doctor in respect of this panel, the board is not in a position, at the present time, to fill the post on a permanent basis which would allow the transfer to take place.  As an interim measure the board appointed a fully qualified locum doctor to provide a general practitioner service to the patients in question.</P>
    <P>I have been assured by the board that the GMS patients on the panel including the person referred to by the Deputy continue to receive a high quality general practitioner service.</P>

      <P>During the course of the last GMS Review, representatives of the Irish Medical Organisation and the Irish College of General Practitioners accepted that there was scope in the GMS scheme for achieving savings in expenditure on drugs without adversely affecting the quality of care for patients.  The drugs strategy, which was agreed with them and which includes indicative drug targets, is aimed at encouraging each general practitioner to review his/her existing prescribing practices with a view to achieving not only more cost effective prescribing, but also better quality and safer prescribing for all patients.  The strategy has, therefore, included a major emphasis on educational programmes in the whole area of therapeutics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no question of the strategy interfering with the right and duty of <Col N="1525" /> individual doctors to prescribe as appropriate for each patient.</P>
    <P>Annual expenditure on drugs in the GMS has increased by approximately 11 per cent per annum, in real terms, in recent years.  Latest figures available for the current year show that this trend increase has reduced to approximately 5 per cent in real terms.  It is difficult to arrive at comparable trend figures for the Drugs Refund Scheme because of structural changes which have taken place in the scheme in recent years. However, payments made on the scheme in the first six months of this year show a 7.8 per cent increase on the payments made in the last six months of 1992.  In the same period payments made on the Drugs Cost Subsidisation Scheme rose by 12 per cent.  This latter increase, while significantly greater than the rise in GMS costs, comprehends an increase of 14.5 per cent in the numbers of people registered under this scheme.</P>

      <P>As I am sure the Deputy will appreciate, the scheduling of surgery is a matter for the clinical judgement of the consultant concerned. I have made enquries from the Mater Hospital and I have been informed that this person has been on the priority waiting list for cardiac by-pass surgery and aortic valve replacement since 21 May, 1993.  The hospital is unable at this stage to give a precise admission date for his operation.  However, if the person feels that his condition has deteriorated he should contact his general practitioner who would be in the best position to highlight his case to his consultant.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I have allocated a sum of £1 million in 1993 from the Waiting List Fund to increase the throughout of open heart surgery at the National Cardiac Surgery Unit, Mater Hospital which will bring the annual capacity up to 1,000 open heart operations.  I have also provided for a doubling of cardiac surgery at Cork Regional Hospital from 200 to 400 patients each year.  The combined increased capacity in both Dublin and Cork will mean a new national throughput of 1,400 cases in the public sector which represents an increase of 47 per cent on the previous capacity.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 54 and 235 together.</P>
      <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the Chief Executive Officer of the appropriate health board are unable, without undue hardship, to provide general practitioner services for themselves and their dependants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Income guidelines are available to assist Chief Executive Officers in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the Consumer Price Index.  The guidelines are higher for persons aged sixty-six to seventy-nine and higher again <Col N="1528" /> for those aged eighty and over.  However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, that person may still be awarded a medical card if the Chief Executive Officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.  In view of this special provision, I do not think that it is justifiable to extend an automatic entitlement to a medical care to any specific group without any reference to their means or, in the case of children, to their parents means, particularly given the many areas of pressing need in the health services and the limited resources available to meet them.</P>
    <P>Every person who is in genuine need of a medical card must, of course, receive one, and I am satisfied that the health boards give sympathetic consideration to applications made on the grounds of special medical needs.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 58 and 61 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Estimates indicate that the number of people with a significant form of dementia in this country, including Alzheimer Disease is between 20,000 and 30,000.  My Department has made a financial contribution to the Alzheimer Society to carry out research on Alzheimer disease and to identify the needs of carers of people with dementia.  The <Col N="1532" /> results of his research were published in July last by the Alzheimer Society in the report entitled, &ldquo;Caring Without Limits&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Report <i>The Years Ahead &mdash; a Policy for the Elderly</i> emphasised the need to develop a range of services for people with dementia and their families, including purpose built accommodation. The report was adopted as official government policy towards the elderly in October, 1988.  Health Boards have prepared plans to implement the recommendations of the report.  Between 1990 and 1992 an additional £9 million was made available to the health services to implement the key recommendations of the report, including the strengthening of home and community support for people with dementia and their families.  The investment by Boards in additional community nursing day care and respite services has increased the support available to sufferers of Alzheimer Disease and their carers.  The appointment of two psychiatrists specialising in the care of the elderly mentally ill and infirm, with support staff, in two parts of Dublin has demonstrated the value of such initiatives and more allocations will be made as soon as resources permit.  Some health boards are planning major service developments for the mentally infirm, stimulated by the commitments in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to develop services for the elderly. The care of those with dementia is clearly emerging as a priority for many boards, a development which I fully support.</P>
    <P>The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, which commenced on 1 September last widens options available to those caring for dependent relatives with dementia.  Under the Act, the health boards may pay a subvention towards the cost of care in a nursing home of a person who needs that care and who does not have the resources to pay the cost.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied tht there has been significant progress towards translating policy into a practical network of services for Alzheimer patients and their carers <Col N="1533" /> while acknowledging that more remains to be done.</P>
    <P>Within the Southern Health Board's community care programme, Alzheimer sufferers receive a range of services such as general practitioner care, public health nursing home help, housing assistance, respite and in-patient care and day care. The Alzheimer Society provide day care in a centre leased to them by the Board.</P>
    <P>In 1989 an additional 15 beds were opened in the Dementia Unit at St. Stephen's Hospital bringing the complement for this unit to 30 beds.  The Board accepts that additional units are needed at various locations throughout the Board's area.  The Board also proposes to appoint a psychiatrist specialising in the care of the elderly, mentally ill and infirm with a supporting team of professionals. These developments will take place as soon as financial circumstances permit.</P>
    <P>The Southern Health Board is about to undertake a major review of services for the elderly in the Board area commencing with a conference on Friday 19th November, 1993, entitled &ldquo;The Years Ahead &mdash; 5 Years On&rdquo;.  The needs of Alzheimer sufferers and the appropriate level of service provision will be examined in that context.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 63 and 231 together.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the provision of speech therapy in the North Eastern Health Board area is a matter for that Board and in the case of County Kerry, for the Southern Health Board.  It is up to each Board to decide on the priority it affords the various services in the light of available resources.</P>
      <P>The North Eastern Health Board employs 10 full time speech therapists and 3 sessional staff.  The breakdown between community care areas is as follows.</P>
      <P>Meath community care area has 4 full time staff, i.e., Principal and 3 basic grades, as well as one sessional therapist who provides 4 sessions a week.</P>
      <P>The Louth area has 3 full time staff, i.e., 1 Principal and 2 basic grades, as well as one sessional therapist providing 7 sessions a week.</P>
      <P>Finally, the Cavan/Monaghan community care area has 3 full time speech therapists, i.e., 1 Principal and 2 basic grades as well as one sessional therapist who provides 6 sessions a week.</P>
      <P>The Southern Health Board employs three speech therapists in County Kerry &mdash; one principal and two basic grades. The Board recently made an application for the appointment of six additional speech thereapists and my Department has approved the appointment of two speech and language therapists.  I understand that the Board intends to assign these additional staff to County Kerry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a broader level, I would like to state my concern about the adequacy of speech and language therapy services in different parts of the country and I regard the expansion of such services as a priority.  For this reason almost £200,000 <Col N="1535" /> of the £1.5 million provided this year for physical disability services will be devoted to improvements in speech and language therapy services.  I hope to build on these developments in the future. However, the Deputies will appreciate that in the light of competing demands for development of other services for people with physical and sensory disabilities improvements in the speech and language therapy services can only come about on a phased basis.</P>

      <P>It is not obligatory for cigarettes for sale at duty free shops in this country to carry Government health warnings.</P>
      <P>The Tobacco Products (Control of Advertising, Sponsorship and Sales Promotion) Regulations, 1991, detail the requirements for health warnings on cigarette packets.  Duty free cigarettes are specifically exempted from the Regulations.</P>
      <P>It is not proposed at this time to introduce a stipulation that cigarette packets in &ldquo;duty free&rdquo; carry a warning.  However, as health warnings are now required Community-wide, it is probable that cigarette packaging in duty-free may begin to carry warnings.  It is a matter which I will raise with my Community colleagues.</P>
      <P>Such warnings are not covered by any EC Directive.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 68 and 108 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1538" /> The health boards provide a range of services and supports to assist children who are not receiving adequate care and protection, irrespective of the reasons why they are regarded as being at risk.  I would like to assure the Deputies that the professionals working in the health care services are acutely conscious of the special vulnerability of the children of parents who are drug addicts.</P>
    <P>Depending on the circumstances, children are either provided with community based suports such as day fostering and day care services to enable them to continue to live at home or, in extreme cases, are taken into the care of the health boards and placed with foster families or in residential care.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Eastern Health Board have placed a total of 10 children in foster care arising out of AIDS/HIV situations.  One family left 5 orphans, one of whom also died of AIDS while in foster care, the remaining 4 are still in care. Another fostered child, whose mother died of AIDS, is himself HIV positive.  In two other families, each involving two children, both sets of parents are alive: in one case both parents have AIDS, in the other both are HIV positive.  All four children are in foster care.</P>
    <P>Prospective foster parents are made fully aware of all medical circumstances concerning the child to be placed with them and are assured of whatever consultant or other medical access they require in the course of the placement. All fostered children are provided with medical card cover and any other home support necessary.  The services of the Board's AIDS counsellors are also available to affected families.</P>

      <P>The Eastern Health Board has completed 37 suitability assessments for foreign adoptions to date under the Adoption Act, 1991.  In 29 of these cases, completed assessment reports have been transmitted to the Adoption Board.  In addition, 5 completed reports are awaiting consideration by the health board's placement committee prior to their being forwarded to the Adoption Board.  In the other three cases, the prospective adopting parents decided not to pursue the matter following the completion of their assessment.</P>
      <P>The Adoption Board has approved 17 of the 29 assessment reports transmitted to it by the Eastern Health Board and has made declarations of suitability and eligibility in favour of the applicants concerned. Consideration of seven cases is ongoing and one other case has been referred back to the Eastern Health Board for further information.  The Adoption Board was not satisfied to make declarations of suitability and eligibility in 4 cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not possible to indicate how many children have been adopted abroad by Irish residents since enactment of the <Col N="1540" /> 1991 Act because there is no legal requirement on adoptive parents to notify a public authority here on their return to this country with the child.  Since the legislation came into force, the Adoption Board has made a total of 85 declarations of suitability and eligibility to adopt in favour of Irish residents proposing to adopt a child outside the State.  It is open to people who adopt children abroad to apply to the Adoption Board to have the adoptions entered in the Register of Foreign Adoptions.  I understand that the Board has received five such applications from Irish residents who, since the commencement of the 1991 Act, have adopted a child in a foreign country.</P>

      <P>The most recent information available to my Department on employment of persons with disabilities in the public health service relates to those employed in the health boards and specialist health agencies.</P>
      <P>At the end of December 1992, the number of persons with disabilities employed in the bodies in question was 433, compared with 415 in December 1991.  On the basis of the December 1992 information, employment of persons with disabilities stands at 1.08 per cent of total staffing in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since compiling this information, a new definition of a disabled person has been adopted by the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> Monitoring Committee for Employment of People with Disabilities in the Public Service and the Private Sector for monitoring purposes.  I will be writing to all health agencies in the near future with a view to obtaining an accurate assessment of the number of staff with disabilities <Col N="1541" /> employed on the basis of the new definition.</P>
    <P>I should add that I am committed to the objective of achieving the 3 per cent employment quota for people with disabilities in the health service.  While the employment of staff is, in the first instance, a matter for each health agency, I will continue to impress on each agency the need to have due regard to the commitment to the disabled when recruiting staff and in cases where the quota has not been achieved, to make every effort to secure an appropriate increase in the number of disabled employed consistent with operational and employment control requirements.</P>

In addition to the staff already working in the West Cork service, the board has indicated that up to one further occupational therapist, two nurses and four attendants may be needed for the new service.  The Inspector of Mental Hospitals in his recent reports of the West Cork services has also recommended the <Col N="1542" /> transfer of services from Skibbereen to Bantry as a desirable element of the development of an overall community based service for the West Cork area.</P>

      <P>The 1990 intake of student nurses, most of whom commenced their training on 8 October 1990, have now completed their training programme and those who register with An Bord Altranais will be eligible to seek employment as qualified psychiatric nurses in all psychiatric units throughout the country.  It is understood from the Eastern Health Board that all 19 students involved are being provided with post-registration work experience by the hospital concerned on a part-time or job-sharing basis until the end of the year when the situation will be reviewed.

      <askee>Minister for Health</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to a recent survey expressing serious concern at the future viability of General Practice in rural areas in view of the drop in population; the steps, if any, he proposes to take to ensure an adequate level of service.</Quest>

      <P>Demographic changes in population have implications for the organisation of general practice and the distribution of medical manpower.  In determining general practitioner manpower needs in the General Medical Services (GMS) at regional level, health boards are required to ensure that patients have a proper level of access to general practitioner services and have a reasonable degree of choice having regard to the viability of practices. Where necessary, boards may contract with additional practitioners to provide services in particular areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that regard the number of doctors providing services under the GMS has been increasing in recent years; currently there are 1,638 doctors participating in the scheme which is the highest number since the scheme was introduced.  This <Col N="1548" /> figure is expected to increase further in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>In rural areas and where population numbers are declining, special considerations are also necessary to ensure that practices remain viable and that doctors continue to be attracted to practice in rural areas.  The GMS agreement provides a number of additional incentives for doctors who practice in rural areas where patient panels are geographically dispersed.  Under the agreement capitation fees and payments in respect of domiciliary consultations are linked to the distance of patients from a doctor's surgery with higher rates paid for patients who live some distance from the surgery.  In addition a rural practice allowance is payable to doctors who live and practice in areas which meet specific criteria in terms of population size and distribution.</P>
    <P>The current GMS contract also provides for special considerations where doctors practice in remote areas.  Following consultation with the relevant health boards and the Irish Medical Organisation a number of areas have been designated as remote areas which attract special considerations in respect of the remuneration package for doctors in such areas.  This system is being closely monitored in the interests of continuing the provision of effective general practitioner services.</P>
    <P>My Department's Blueprint for the Development of General Practice to which all parties to the current agreement are fully committed is specific in the need to continue to improve and develop general practice.  The implementation of the blueprint is being pursued by my Department in conjunction with health board's general practice units.  The on-going development of general practice in rural areas is an important part of this process.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 93 and 107 together.</P>
      <P>The scheduling of appointments for assessment at out-patient clinics is a matter for the consultant concerned, and urgent cases are always accorded priority.  Should a patient be concerned about his or her condition, they should return to their general practitioner who would be in the best position to emphasise the urgency of their case to the consultant concerned.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Western Health Board received an allocation of £2,192,600 under the recent Waiting List Initiative, the highest amount given to any of the health agencies, and, as a result, has contracted to perform an additional 160 orthopaedic procedures at Merlin Park Hospital this year, including 85 additional hip replacement operations.  This work is now well underway.</P>
      <P>In addition, the recent opening of the new Clean Air theatres in Merlin Park Hospital, also funded by the Waiting List Initiative, should significantly increase the throughout of orthopaedic cases.</P>
      <P>My Department has recently asked the health board to prioritise its consultant staffing requirements, including orthopaedics, and to submit detailed costings so that these can be further considered in my Department.</P>

      <P>The Adoption Act, 1991, provides a statutory framework for the recognition of adoptions effected in countries which operate a system of legal adoption similar to our own system.  In cases where a foreign adoption effected in favour of Irish residents does not qualify for recognition under the 1991 Act, it is open to the adopters to apply to the Adoption Board for an Irish adoption order in respect of the child.  In this context, I might mention that the Supreme Court ruled earlier this year that children born abroad of foreign parents and who are residing in the State come within the scope of the Adoption Act 1988.  That Act permits, in exceptional cases, the adoption of children who have effectively been abandoned by their parents.  The Supreme Court ruling should facilitate the adoption of some foreign children in the care of Irish residents.</P>

      <P>It is estimated that about 15,500 persons have a moderate, severe or profound degree of mental handicap and most require extensive support from the health services. A further 10,000 who have a mild mental handicap require some ongoing support from the health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over 13,000 people with a mental <Col N="1555" /> handicap were in receipt of specialised mental handicap services at the end of 1992, of whom 6,600 were in residential care and approximately 6,800 attended day care or workshop services.  In addition, some 7,500 children attend special schools and classes operated under the aegis of the Department of Education.  Details on the number of people with a mental handicap receiving home support or respite care services are being collected at present.</P>
    <P>Total health expenditure on services for people with a mental handicap in 1993 will be about £217 million.  This includes expenditure of £35.5 million on disabled person's maintenance allowances, and £3.7 million on domiciliary care allowances.</P>
    <P>A breakdown of this expenditure between institutional and community-based services is not readily available. People with a mental handicap also have access to the generic health services the cost of which would be difficult to quantify and is not included in the figure of £217 million.</P>
    <P>The existing data indicate that about 1,300 persons are listed for residential services and 1,400 for day care services.  These figures need to be validated and agreement has recently been reached between my Department and the statutory and voluntary agencies providing services to people with mental handicap on the development of a national data base which will provide a wide range of data of this nature.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that the Government is committed to developing and expanding services for people with mental handicap.  As I have stated in the House on previous occasions an additional £8.5 million was made available for the development of services for people with a mental handicap in 1993.  It is the largest amount ever allocated for the development of services for people with a mental handicap and is in addition to the £6 million made available last year which has been repeated in 1993.</P>
    <P>The question of the provision of <Col N="1556" /> resources in 1994 for the development of services for people with a mental handicap is currently the subject of discussions with the Minister for Finance in the context of the budgetary arrangements for 1994.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House will be aware, the central recommendation of the report of the Kilkenny Incest Investigation was that the necessary resources be made available to facilitate the implementation of the remaining sections of the Child Care Act, 1991.  The investigation team saw the full implementation of the Child Care Act as the single biggest contribution which could be made towards promoting the welfare of children and protecting those who are at risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has accepted this <Col N="1558" /> recommendation and is committed to the full implementation of the Act by the end of 1996.  I am pleased to say that considerable progress has been made over the last few months in preparation for the implementation of the Act.</P>
    <P>The Government has made available an additional £5 million this year to begin the process of putting the necessary services in place.  The full year cost of this initiative is in the region of £10 million. This is the largest ever investment of resources in the child care area in a single year and demonstrates the commitment by Government to the provision of a comprehensive range of services and supports to assist children and families in need.</P>
    <P>Following extensive consultations with senior health board management, I have approved a package for new developments for each health board area which will prepare the ground for the assignment of additional functions under the Child Care Act, and will greatly strengthen the capacity of the boards to respond effectively to the needs of children and families.</P>
    <P>Among the important new initiatives that I have approved are: the creation of over 100 new posts of social worker and child care worker, the creation of three new posts of consultant child psychiatrist for the child and adolescent psychiatric services, the creation of over 20 new posts in the child psychology services, the expansion of the home maker and home help services to assist families in difficulty, the establishment of community mother's programmes in a number of boards, increased financial support for pre-school services in disadvantaged areas, the development of additional hostel places and services for homeless children, improvements in services for victims of family violence in rural areas, the development of foster care services and improvements in staffing levels in a number of children's residential centres. I have asked the health boards to take urgent steps to put these developments in place as quickly as possible.  The new services are already coming on stream and I expect all the developments that I <Col N="1559" /> have outlined to be fully operational by the beginning of 1994.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to a number of important measures that are being taken to give effect to other key recommendations in the Kilkenny Incest report.  My Department, in consultation with the Garda Síochána, has prepared a draft new procedure for the notification of suspected cases of child abuse between the health boards and the gardaí.  This procedure, which revolves around a standardised form for the reporting of suspected abuse, is aimed at ensuring closer co-ordination between key personnel from both agencies in order to facilitate the twin objectives of protecting the child and the full investigation of any crime.  The procedure will shortly be operated on a pilot basis in a few selected areas prior to its being introduced nationally.</P>
    <P>My Department is also in the process of preparing a discussion paper on the mandatory reporting by designated persons of all forms of child abuse to the health boards.  This paper will form the basis for wide-ranging discussions and consultations with the relevant interest groups.  The Medical Council has also been requested to review its guidelines in relation to medical confidentiality as it relates to child abuse.</P>
    <P>A key element of the development plans for child care services in each of the health boards has been the creation of a post of development officer for child care.  The establishment of this position will ensure the effective co-ordination of child care service developments and the identification of future service needs within each health board's functional area.  I have given approval to each health board to proceed to fill this post and a number of development officers have already been appointed.</P>
    <P>In the area of prevention, the &ldquo;Stay Safe&rdquo; child abuse prevention programme is currently being introduced in primary schools throughout the country.  While there is some opposition to the programme, the organisers are confident that the implementation process will be <Col N="1560" /> completed in all areas by the end of the current school year.  A working group, representative of my Department, the Department of Education and the Eastern Health Board, has already put the process in train for the development of suitable materials for a similar prevention programme for second level schools.  It is expected that these materials will be available for piloting in 1994.</P>
    <P>The Kilkenny Incest report also contains proposals concerning the role of agencies outside the health services in relation to child abuse.  Developments in relation to these recommendations include the establishment by the Garda Síochána of a women and child unit to specialise and ensure an expertise in dealing with cases of abuse.  In addition to this, the recommendations of the team with respect to barring orders are being considered in the context of a review of barring orders currently being undertaken by my colleague, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>I hope the Deputy will accept from the various initiatives which I have outlined that a considerable amount has been achieved in the six months since the Kilkenny Incest report was published.  It is my firm intention that this momentum will be maintained and that significant further progress will be made in developing comprehensive and integrated structures and services for the care and protection of children.  The new Child Care Policy Unit, which I have established within my Department, will have a pivotal role in this process.</P>

      <P>The report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women referred to the commission's earlier recommendation to the Government on the availability of non-directive counselling and stated that, since the constitutional amendment on information had been passed, this recommendation was no longer necessary.  The report went on to recommend that, when legislation to implement the amendment is introduced, unreasonable restrictions should not be imposed, and that the aim should be that appropriate information should be available to those who require it.</P>
      <P>I have already stated that I will be bringing this legislation to Government in the near future and I will, of course, be mindful of the commission's recommendation in that regard.</P>

      <P>The problem of drug misuse is a complex and difficult one and there are no easy or instant solutions available.  In 1991 the Government introduced a strategy based on the recommendations of the National Co-ordinating Committee on Drug Misuse.  This committee consists of representatives from the Departments of Justice, Health, Education and Foreign Affairs, the Garda, Customs and Excise, the health boards, the Health Research Board and CELAD.</P>
      <P>The strategy which it recommends, and which is being implemented by the various Departments and State agencies, is a co-ordinated strategy in the areas of supply reduction, demand reduction and increased access to treatment and rehabilitation programmes.  The strategy is closely monitored by the National Coordinating Committee under the chairmanship of the Minister of State at the Department of Health who has been designated by the Government as the Minister responsible for its co-ordination and by the various responsible Departments. Further measures to improve law enforcement in relation to supply reduction, are being considered by the Minister for Justice at present.</P>

This funding has been allocated to the health boards to assist with the implementation of the Act.  I expect that the funding allocated will be fully spent on implementing the Act this year.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the funds allocated are adequate to meet the cost of the Act this year and that the implementation of the Nursing Homes Act has not been impeded for financial reasons.  I am concerned, however, about the slow pace of registration of nursing homes under the Act.  This issue has been considered by the group established by my Department to monitor the implementation of the Act.  The group has recommended measures which should help accelerate the registration of homes under the Act.</P>

      <P>The latest consultant manpower survey carried out by Comhairle na nOspidéal in respect of 1 January 1993 indicates that there were 82 obstetrician-gynaecologist posts in the public health services of whom two or 2.4 per cent were filled by women.  Of the overall total number of consultant posts in the public health services at that date, 1,170, some 166 or 14 per cent, were filled by women.</P>
      <P>Whilst some progress has been made towards achieving a more equitable male-female ratio in overall consultant employment, as evidenced by the appointment of an additional 42 female consultants since 1 May 1989, an increase of 33 per cent, it is apparent that a good deal of progress remains to be made in the obstetrics-gynaecology specialty and more generally if this goal is to be attained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The role of my Department in securing such progress is in monitoring adherence <Col N="1565" /> to equal opportunities legislation in relation to recruitment procedures and in encouraging the professional bodies and employers to ensure that any perceived obstacles to progress are removed.  I am also cognisant of the recommendations of the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women in relation to improving the rate of participation of women at senior management level, including consultant level in the health services.  I would like to advise the House that the Advisory Committee on Women's Health which has been established in my Department is giving consideration to this matter.</P>

      <P>The section on the Common Foreign and Security Policy in the Conclusions of the European Council meeting in Brussels on 29 October 1993 states that &ldquo;the Western European Union will shortly implement the various provisions embodied in the Treaty and the statement on the Western European Union&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Treaty referred to is the Treaty on European Union.  The only provision in that Treaty which relates to the Western European Union is Article J.4.2 under which the European Union may, by unanimity, request the Western European Union to elaborate and implement decisions and actions of the Union which have defence implications.  The other provisions referred to in the sentence quoted above from the European Council Conclusions are the provisions of the Declaration on Western European Union adopted by the member states of the Western European Union at the time of the Maastricht European Council.  The implementation of this Declaration is a matter for the member states of the Western European Union.  The European Council Conclusions simply note that it is their intention to do so shortly.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to her parliamentary question on the same topic and my reply on 24 March 1993.</P>
      <P>The Office of Public Works has been working on the restoration of Cormac's Chapel at the Rock of Cashel for a number of years.  The work involves conservation of the wall paintings, the cleaning, repairing and conserving of masonry, some replacement of stonework, repairing the arch of the south door, fitting doors and windows, laying a floor to the croft, and the provision of appropriate heating and lighting.  The programme also included a major archaeological excavation which was completed this year.</P>
      <P>The timescale for the completion of the works is determined to a great extent by the conservation work on the paintings. Experts engaged by the Office of Public Works have advised that in the interest of protecting the wall paintings the work should be spread over a long period of years.  The time taken on any particular part of the paintings depends on the condition of that section which only emerges as work proceeds.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, the current phase of conservation works at Cormac's Chapel will take at least three and a half years to complete.  When the work has been completed a subsequent monitoring and maintenance programme will be set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1569" /> Once Cormac's Chapel has been restored, it is proposed to begin a major programme of conservation works to the Cathedral which will take a number of years.  The works here will include masonry and plasterwork conservation, and restoration of the roof of one of the chapels of the north transept to shelter the box tombs.</P>

      <P>I do not accept that the difficulties of the clothing and footwear industry can be wholly or even largely attributable to the <Col N="1570" /> increase in the VAT rate from 16 to 21 per cent on adult clothing and footwear announced in the 1993 Budget.</P>
      <P>As regards the volume of retail sales, it is perhaps noteworthy that the data for the five months following the budget compared with the same period last year show an increase in the drapery and apparel sector of about 4 per cent, but a decrease in the footwear area of about 7 per cent.</P>
      <P>I am fully aware of the various concerns of the industry, and indeed I have recently received a pre-budget submission from its representative body.  I will bear these points in mind in the runup to the forthcoming budget.  However, I have indicated on a number of occasions that, for budgetary and other reasons, I do not intend to reverse my decision to place adult clothing and footwer on the standard rate of VAT.</P>

      <P>Ballyteigue Burrow was established as a nature reserve in 1987 in order to conserve an ecosystem which includes a heath dune and part of the foreshore.  It is one of Ireland's rare intact dune systems and is of great importance ecologically.  The ecosystem incorporates many rare plants, in particular Perennial Glassworth and Wild Asparagus which are protected under a Flora Protection Order (S.I. 274 of 1987).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Serious damage is being caused to the reserve by horse training and related activities.  Ballyteigue Burrow is one of only two areas in the country where the protected plant Perennial Glassworth is <Col N="1572" /> present.  This rare plant grows below the high tide mark (foreshore) and up to 50 per cent of the plant has been damaged by horses galloping on the foreshore.  It was because of this and other unlicensed activities on the reserve that the Office of Public Works sought and received an injunction in August 1993 restraining anyone from bringing horses on to the reserve.  A stay of three months on this Order was granted to one horse trainer, who had previously held a permit to exercise horses on the reserve, to enable the trainer to make alternative arrangements. Apart from that particular trainer, no other person holds or has held any licence or permit to exercise horses on the reserve.</P>
    <P>Any activity or use which damages or is a potential threat to the ecosystem in the nature reserve must be prevented in order to discharge the obligations imposed by the Wildlife Act, 1976 to protect our natural environment.</P>

      <P>The only two commercial State-sponsored bodies which fall within the Ombudsman's remit are An Post and Telecom Éireann.  The inclusion of these two bodies within his ambit is largely explicable by two factors (1) that the services which they provided had previously come within the Ombudsman's purview when carried out by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and (2) an exceptional public demand for the Ombudsman's services in these areas.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to extend the Ombudsman's remit to commercial State-sponsored bodies generally.  As I explained in response to a similar parliamentary question put down by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, which I answered on 31 March of this year, unless I became aware of significant levels of dissatisfaction among customers with the existing consumer redress mechanisms provided by such bodies, I would not see any need to consider seriously including them within the ambit of the Ombudsman.  In the case of the bodies mentioned by the Deputy, I am not aware of any such difficulties.</P>

      <P>Figures for savings, fraud detection and prosecutions on a national basis are not kept on a sector by sector basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However in the Dublin Regional area, which covers counties Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow, a specialist squad was set up in 1992 to focus on employers in the construction industry.  To date about 550 employers have been surveyed and savings <Col N="1578" /> of the order of £2.5 million have been indentified.  I recently announced the introduction of two further squads to concentrate on this area.</P>
    <P>There are no prosecutions pending at this stage as employers are being given the opportunity to avail of the amnesty from prosecution.</P>
    <P>My Department is not aware of any widespread abuse with the operation of the C45 system.  The operation of the system is regularly reviewed by my Department is conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Employers and contractors in the construction industry are obliged to notify my Department when an employee or sub-contractor is hired.  This system is being backed up by a sustained campaign of visits to employers by the Department's inspectors.  Over the period of 1991 to 1993 approximately 40,000 employers will have been visited.  A significant proportion of these are employers and contractors in the construction sector.</P>
    <P>Some years ago, the Government decided that State contracts should not be awarded to firms who do not comply fully with their Tax and PRSI obligations.</P>
    <P>In the light of the considerable investment envisaged in the National Plan I will be introducing further measures to ensure that employers and sub-contractors meet their PRSI and notification obligations, and to root out any abuse of the social welfare system.</P>

The scheme is currently available in the greater Dublin area and in Counties Kilkenny and Waterford.  It is being extended to other counties.  It has operated very successfully and there are now over 1,600 clients with deductions under the scheme.</P>
      <P>I favour the extension of the Household Budgeting system to other social welfare customers, including lone parents. However, because lone parents are paid by order books, significant changes to existing systems would be required to make the facility more widely available. This matter is currently being examined by my Department and An Post.</P>

      <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the fact that local shops in the Collock Garda District have experienced violent robberies recently and that there is a view that these crimes are being committed by known drug addicts; and if she has satisfied hereself that adequate gardaí and patrol cars are available in this district in view of the population of the area.</Quest>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that this year to date there has been an increase in the number of robberies in the Coolock area against the background of a reduction of about 6 per cent in the overall crime rate for the area as a whole.  It is known that an increase in crime in any area can be indicative of an increase in drug misuse, but the Garda are not in a position to say whether this constitutes an explanation for the recent increase in robberies in Coolock.</P>
      <P>The current Garda manpower at Coolock station is 91.  There are seven mobile units based there, including three cars, two vans and two motorcycles.  These are supported by the Divisional Task Force, by the Special Drugs Unit based at Santry station and by the Central Drug Squad based at Harcourt Square.  All members of the Garda Síochána are empowered to deal with offences relating to drugs and enforce these laws as part of their daily duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda authorities are satisfied that the overall resources allocated to police <Col N="1585" /> the Coolock area are adequate to meet the demands being placed on them at present.  They also inform me that the situation is kept under continuing review.</P>

      <P>The report of the Committee of Inquiry into the Penal System &mdash; generally known as the &ldquo;Whitaker&rdquo; report &mdash; contains two categories of recommendations.</P>
      <P>First, there are the recommendations in the report which consist of broad statements of principle, such as the need to respect the fundamental human rights of a person in prison and allow them to maintain their dignity except to the extent invitably associated with the loss of liberty.  The validity of principles of this kind have been recognised for decades and the Whitaker report acknowledges this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, there are the specific recommendations which the committee clearly regarded as the means of giving practical expression to the statements of principle. In relation to the &ldquo;specifics&rdquo; there has been some quite significant progress, for example: (1) the Whitaker report recommended that greater use be made of alternatives to custody.  Various alternatives were already in place when the committee reported &mdash; and the committee recognised this.  There has been a greatly expanded use of alternatives in the interim with about 3,200 offenders on alternatives of various kinds at the present time.  Extra staff have been appointed to the Probation and Welfare Service who have the task of taking offenders on special supervision in the community.  &ldquo;Drop-in centres&rdquo; have been provided &mdash; one in Dublin and one in Cork &mdash; where counselling services are available to the offenders in question; (2) <Col N="1586" /> the report recommended the appointment of a medical director.  He was duly appointed in October, 1990; (3) the report recommended the establishment of a group which would have responsibility for providing the Minister for Justice with independent advice on the administration of long term sentences, including life sentences.  With the approval of the Government the Minister established such a group, under the chairmanship of Dr. Whitaker, towards the end of 1989.  The group has the task of reviewing the cases of all offenders who have served imprisonment sentences of seven years or more &mdash; whether a life sentence or a fixed long term sentence. The only offenders excluded are capital murderers; (4) the state of industrial relations &mdash; a matter which was of great concern to the Whitaker Committee &mdash; has improved significantly in the past few years.  The prison Officers Association have publicly acknowledged the progress which is being made in this regard; (5) various improvements have been made to prison accommodation and more is planned including advances in in-cell sanitation, etc.  These improvements are in line with recommendations in the report; (6) new duty rosters were introduced for prison officers.  This was also recommended in the report, and (7) a number of other recommendations in the report concerning personnel matters have also been implemented, e.g. mixed staffing of all prisons, compositions of recruitment interview boards, etc.</P>
    <P>There are specific recommendations which have not been implemented but which are kept under review.  I will be looking at these again, in the context of a through review of prisons' policy in which I am currently engaged.  This review is now at an advanced stage.</P>

      <P>There is a substantial body of legislation already in existence dealing with the storage and supply of petroleum spirit.  This legislation is contained in the Dangerous Substances Act, 1972, No. 10 of 1972, the Dangerous Substances (Detail and Petroleum Stores) Regulations, 1979. S.I. 311 of 1979 and the Dangerous Substances Retail and Petroleum Stores (Amendment) Regulations, 1988, S.I. No. 303 of 1988.</P>
      <P>The 1979 regulations oblige all persons in control of petroleum spirit to take all parcitical steps to prevent persons under 15 years of age having access to petroleum or to any container which has not been rendered free of petroleum spirit or fumes.</P>
      <P>Section 22 of the 1972 Act requires that every container of petroleum spirit other that the fuel tank of an engine must be clearly and conspicuously marked with the words &ldquo;Petroleum Spirit&rdquo; and &ldquo;Highly Inflammable&rdquo;.  In addition, under section 52 of the 1979 Regulations the labelling on such containers must include the details of the amount of petroleum spirit contained therein and a specified danger symbol.</P>
      <P>In view of the volume of sales of petroleum on a daily basis it would not be practical to require that the register of all sales made by retailers be maintained, nor is it clear that such a measure would serve any useful purpose in practice.</P>

      <P>I would like to remind the Deputy and the House that my primary responsibility as the insurance supervisory authority is to ensure that insurance companies meet the solvency and reserve requirements laid down in statute.  The purpose of these financial requirements are that moneys be available to meet claims when they arise.  In order to meet these requirements and to operate on a viable basis insures must be free to accept and reject risks and to charge premiums which they deem appropriate in the light of their underwriting experience.</P>
      <P>The cost of motor, employers' and public liability insurance in this country is considerably higher than in competing economies.  It is clear that the current level of insurance costs in Ireland is a major cost penalty on Irish-based firms and on local authorities.  Therefore, the objective, in the current drive to reduce insurances costs must be to achieve a significant reduction in the cost penalty that insurance represents in the interests of employment creation and retention.</P>
      <P>I am considering a proposal whereby I will be seeking Government approval to allow me to have a function in relation to one particular and important aspect of insurance costs &mdash; i.e. the cost of pain and suffering compensation in personal injury claims.</P>

      <P>I am aware that a number of Irish insurance companies underwrite income continuance plans. These insurance companies are subject to existing insurance legislation.  I should point out that my primary responsibility, as the insurance supervisory authority, is to ensure that insurance undertakings meet their statutory solvency and reserving requirements.  In order to meet these financial requirements insurance undertakings must be free to make their own underwriting decisions.  As such, the terms and conditions of individual insurance contracts are matters to be agreed between the insurer and policyholder.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 166, 167 and 168 together.</P>
      <P>The terms of eligibility, level of allowances and other operating conditions of the FÁS enterprise scheme are determined on the basis of seeking the optimum balance between the resources available and the desire to facilitate the maximum number of persons who may benefit from participation in the scheme. This invitably means some limitations on both the level and extent of the support that can be given and on the categories of persons who can participate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the current arrangements relating to the scheme are the most appropriate given the constraints I have <Col N="1594" /> mentioned.  As with all schemes, the scheme, is kept under review and will be adapted if and when circumstances demand or allow.</P>

      <P>State-occupied property is statutorily exempt from local rates but local authorities in the past received a separate State grant, known as the bounty in lieu, in respect of such property.  In 1989, the bounty in lieu was merged with the rate support grant and all local authorities, including Dublin Corporation, had their rate support grant allocations increased to reflect this change.  No distinction is drawn between the former separate elements in the determination of increases in the amounts of rate support grant allocations.</P>

      <P>No proposal has been received from Ennis UDC to provide a water and leisure complex in Ennis.  However, in January this year, my Department received an inquiry from Clare County Council regarding the availability of capital to carry out major refurbishment works at the Ennis swimming pool.  The council were subsequently advised that, having regard to the limited capital resources available for the swimming pool programme, and the number of other projects awaiting approval, it would be some considerable time before I would be in a position to give any commitment towards funding the refurbishment.</P>

      <P>Buses in use in this country are generally built outside Ireland and our capacity to influence bus design and construction is therefore limited.  In addition, national regulations imposing unique bus construction requirements could be deemed to be a barrier to the movement of vehicles within the internal market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand, however, that the EC Commission are considering the formulation of an appropriate type approval directive requiring new buses to be fitted with anchorages and seat belts to standards laid down by the EC.  I have written to the EC Commissioner for Transport <Col N="1602" /> conveying my support for this.  It is also open to the EC Commission to propose a directive making the wearing of bus seat belts, where fitted, compulsory.</P>

      <P>The administration of the local improvements scheme is devolved to county councils, subject to the provisions of the Local Government (Roads and Drainage) Act, 1968, and to general guidelines issued by my Department. Under the Act, councils may carry out works only by way of agreements with the landholders concerned, while the guidelines require councils to limit commitments in respect of such agreements so as to stay within the annual grant allocation. Councils are also instructed not to incur excess expenditure in anticipation of future grants.</P>

These grounds offer considerable fishing opportunities covering a range of quota and non-quota species, including cod, haddock, monk and redfish.  Irish boats have access to these waters and are entitled to catch quota species up to the limit of our quotas.  In addition, there are no limitations on the catching of non-quota species in this area.</P>

      <P>The collapse of sea trout stocks in the Bertraghboy Bay area is being investigated and acted upon in the context of the national research conservation and management programme to address the decline in sea trout numbers, comprehensive details of which were given to the House in my reply of 21 October last.</P>
      <P>A comprehensive research programme for 1993 has been under way with additional emphasis on stock sampling data from river systems and sea lice biology and distribution.  This work has included a joint river sampling programme/netting survey of sea trout stocks in rivers and estuaries undertaken by the Department in conjunction with the central and regional fisheries boards and the Salmon Research Agency.  Stock sampling of the Gowla and Ballinahinch Rivers in the Bertraghboy Bay area has formed part of the programme.  The results of the sampling programme are currently being evaluated by the scientific sea trout working group which will report to me shortly on the outcome of this year's research programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1605" /> Fish farming operations in the bay in question have been intensively inspected under the Department's monitoring programme. The inspection programme is designed to ensure that lice loads on salmon farms are reduced to a minimum and that appropriate remedial action is taken where lice levels are shown to be high.  I am advised that most recent inspections at Bertraghboy and elsewhere confirm that lice management systems are proving effective in minimising lice loads.  As part of a co-ordinated bay management strategy, it is intended that fallowing arrangements for Bertraghboy Bay will be activated for the months ahead in line with fallowing strategies being pursued generally by the fish farming industry.</P>
    <P>In addition to the continuing research and management effort, strengthened conservation bye-laws were put in place this year to protect existing stocks of sea trout.  The conservation by law reintroduced last May prohibited the drift netting of salmon and trout in a number of areas including Bertraghboy Bay.</P>

This procedure normally takes up to six months or more.</P>
      <P>I cannot comment on the inclusion or otherwise of specific townlands at this stage.

Later, this latter measure was reintroduced.  I am continuing to monitor the pigmeat market and my Department is maintaining close contact with the EC Commission in the matter.</P>

      <P>An amount of £1 million was provided in the 1993 budget to provide relief for County Donegal potato growers.  Following discussions with the EC Commission, the Commission approved the terms of a scheme for the restoration of production potential in the county and agreed to pay 75 per cent of the cost of the scheme. Payments are now virtually complete, the EC contribution being £1.2 million with the Exchequer providing £0.4 million out of the total of £1.6 million.</P>
      <P>I have now decided to supplement the EC assisted scheme from the Exchequer funds still available by providing assistance to seed growers with less than two acres and making a special payment to Donegal Potatoes Ltd., who are central to the seed potato industry in the county and who were very seriously affected by the very poor harvest.  A supplementary payment will also be made to seed potato growers who have already benefited under the EC assisted scheme.  The combined cost of these actions is about £0.3 million.  Arrangements for the payment of this amount are under way.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Donegal South West</i>): Tógfaidh mé Ceisteanna 211 agus 212 le chéile.</P>
      <P>Bíonn iarrachtaí leanúnacha ar siúl ag Údarás na Gaeltachta i gcónaí d'fhonn fiontraíocht áitiúil a spreagadh agus d'fhonn tionsclóirí a aimsiú a bheidh sásta tionscnaimh fhiúntacha a bhunú i nGaeltacht Thír Conaill &mdash; ceantair Ard an Rátha agus Chill Charthaigh san áireamh &mdash; d'fhonn deiseanna fostaíochta breise a chur ar fáil do phobal na gceantar sin.</P>
      <P>Maidir le Ard an Rátha, níl an baile féin sa Ghaeltacht.  Ag deireadh 1992 &mdash; an dáta is déanaí a bhfuil figiúirí fostaíochta ar fáil ina leith &mdash; bhí 44 dhuine fostaithe go lánaimseartha agus 34 dhuine go páirtaimseartha/séasúrach i dtionscail sa cheantar a fuair cúnamh ón Údarás.  Is amhlaidh gur dhún Garn Teo ó shin i leith agus gur cailleadh 18 den 44 phost lán-aimseartha dá bharr.  Tuigim ón Údarás, áfach, go bhfuil togra ionaid á phlé acu d'iarmhonarcha Garn Teo ach go bhfuil sé ró-luath go fóill a rá cén toradh a bheidh ar na comhráite.</P>
      <P>Foilsítear eolas in aghaidh na bliana i gCuntais an Údaráis faoi na cuideachtaí i gceantair ar leith ar ceadaíodh cúnamh dóibh agus a ndearnadh íocaíochtaí leo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I dtaca le Cill Charthaigh tá gach is féidir á dhéanamh ag an Údarás chun fostaíocht bhreise a chruthú sa cheantar sin agus chun an fhostaíocht atá ann cheana &mdash; go háirithe sa tionscal teicstíle &mdash; a chaomhnú.  Bunaíodh tascghrúpa ar leith i 1991 chun deiseanna fostaíochta a spreagadh agus a bhrú ar aghaidh i nGaeltacht Iardheischeart Dhún na nGall I gcoitinne agus tá an grúpa sin ag feidhmiú i gcónaí.  Is obair leanúnach í deiseanna forbartha a aimsiú agus a chur ar aghaidh agus tagann na torthaí aisti chun cinn de réir a chéile.  Tuigim ón Údarás go bhfuil toradh fónta ar shaothar an tascghrúpa sin go dtí seo agus go bhfuil <Col N="1618" /> dul chun cinn maith á dhéanamh sa cheantar ar fad &mdash; ceantar Chill Charthaigh san áireamh.  Le linn 1992-93 cheadaigh an tÚdarás tograí éagsúla do Chill Charthaigh agus, sna trí cinn is mó díobh, tá sprioc iomlán de 76 phost nua lánaimseartha ach na tionscnaimh sin a bheith faoi lánseol.  Tá roinnt de na poist sin cruthaithe cheana féin.  Tá tograí eile á bplé don cheantar i láthair na huaire agus tuigim ón Údarás go bhféadfadh suas le 20 post a bheith i gceist i gcás ceann amháin díobh.  Tá sé ró-luath, ar ndóigh, sonraí níos iomláine a thabhairt i dtaobh na dtograí áirithe sin.</P>

      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 227 and 234 together.</P>
      <P>The long term illness scheme covers fifteen specified illnesses and there are no plans at present to extend the scheme to include any further conditions.</P>
      <P>The long term illness scheme, however, is only one of a number of schemes in operation which provide assistance towards the cost of prescribed drugs and medicines for persons with ongoing medical conditions.</P>
      <P>Persons, with conditions such as that described by the Deputy, who in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board are unable to meet their medical expenses, without undue hardship, may be granted a medical card which will entitle them to the supply of all drugs and medicines without charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any other person with an ongoing medical condition, which imposes a requirement for continuous medication, can benefit under the terms of the drug cost subsidisation scheme.  This scheme limits the actual expenditure of authorised <Col N="1622" /> beneficiaries, on prescribed medicines, to £32 per month.</P>
    <P>In the light of the existence of these schemes, I have asked the Eastern Health Board to investigate the specific case referred to by the Deputy and to communicate directly with the person concerned.</P>

      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy's question refers to the new service for people with a mental handicap in Maynooth.  This unit is a highly specialised facility consisting of 5 houses providing residential care for 22 people with a mental handicap who were also behaviourally disturbed. The unit is staffed by 18 nurses and 19 care staff and provides a 24 hour service. Consequently there is some rotation of staff due to the level of care provided and the special needs of the residents.  Since the unit opened over a year ago, three staff have left the service and have been replaced.  The rotation of staff and the level of staff turnover is in line with the position which applies in other units providing a similar service.</P>
      <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that this facility provides an excellent service for a group of people who moved from inappropriate accommodation on the campus of a psychiatric hospital to a much more homely and appropriate service. I understand that all the people concerned are adapting very well to their new surroundings.</P>

      <P>The mobility allowance was increased from £416 to £432 per annum in July 1993. This monthly allowance is increased annually in line with budgetary increases in social welfare and health allowances.</P>
      <P>The mobility allowance is normally paid in addition to the disabled person's maintenance allowance of £59.20 per week or other social welfare payment.  It is designed to finance the occasional taxi journey for a person with a disability who is unable to use public transport and who would benefit from trips from home.  I am satisfied that the rate of allowance is adequate for this purpose.</P>

      <P>The refund of drugs scheme provides for a refund of expenditure above £90 in respect of medicines purchased for consumption in any calendar quarter.  If a person purchases drugs or medicine on the last day of a calendar quarter, such drugs or medicines would not normally be intended for consumption within that quarter.  In these circumstances the health board will consider such expenditure for refund purposes in the following quarter in which the medicine is intended for consumption.</P>

      <P>The pay of school caretakers in primary and post-primary schools is determined by reference to the pay of comparable grades in local authorities. I understand that an adjustment on a phased basis in the rate of pay for school caretakers in rural areas under the terms of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is under consideration at present.</P>
      <P>The number of caretakers employed at primary level at present is 271.  The total for the post-primary level is 479.  Caretakers in primary, community and comprehensive schools are employed by their respective boards of management.  In the case of the voluntary secondary schools, they are employed by the relevant school authorities.  Caretakers in vocational schools are in the employment of vocational education committees.</P>

      <P>My Department already provides grant aid to local authorities for the provision of a library service for primary schools.</P>
      <P>This arrangement has been in place since 1971.  The grant is paid in respect of all primary school pupils in each local authority area.  The money is distributed to the chief librarian of the Local Authority Area and, supplemented by other funds at the disposal of the chief librarian, is used to buy books for lending or distribution to schools.</P>
      <P>All local authorities participate in the scheme so every primary school has access to a lending and reference library service.  In some rural areas the local authority provides a visiting library service.</P>
      <P>The library grant was increased in 1992 from 38p to 47p per pupil and I secured a further increase in 1993 which brought the grant to its present level of 50p per pupil.</P>
      <P>In 1989 an allocation of £1 million was provided through national lottery funds for the replenishment of the stock of books used for the national schools library service.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that local authorities are providing a valuable library service to our schools.</P>
      <P>In the case of second-level schools, my Department makes grants available for the running costs of schools and it is open to schools to buy books for their libraries out of these grants.</P>
      <P>In the provision of new second-level schools, or major extensions to existing schools, a library room is usually included.</P>

      <P>Officers of my Department's Inspectorate have indeed met with representatives of the Parents for Integration Association and heard their concerns for their children's education.</P>
      <P>The main point made by the group's representatives related to the level of support teaching from the Visiting Teacher Service which they considered necessary for their children.  Specifically, they indicated that they required one visiting teacher for every four children and that each child should receive five hours' tuition per week from that teacher.</P>
      <P>It was pointed out to the group that it is my Department's policy to encourage the maximum possible level of integration of handicapped children into ordinary schools.  However, it was also explained that the pace of such development and the degree to which integration can be achieved will vary in accordance with the assessed needs of each individual child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was further pointed out that arrangements are being made to extend the support of the Visiting Teacher Service to include additional Down's Syndrome children <Col N="1635" /> in ordinary national schools and that a special in-service course for the teachers in question has been arranged to facilitate this.  It was emphasised, however, that the specific level of support being requested by the parents could not be provided and that the level of service would in any event be dictated by the needs of the individual child.  I should point out that I am giving active consideration at the present time to the Report of the Special Education Review Committee, including that group's recommendations on the supports required to facilitate the integration of children with disabilities in ordinary schools.</P>
    <P>I am also arranging a special seminar to discuss that report on 6 December next and I look forward to hearing the views of the Parents for Integration Association on that occasion.</P>
