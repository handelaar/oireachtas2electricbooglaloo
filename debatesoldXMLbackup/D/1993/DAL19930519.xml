      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1, 4, 5 and 6.  It is further proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: (1) No. 1 shall be decided without debate; (2) The proceedings on the Report and Final Stage of No. 4 if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 7.00 p.m. by one Question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall in relation to amendments include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Justice; and (3) Private Members' Business shall be No. 9 and the proceedings thereon shall be brought to a conclusion at 8.30 p.m. today.</P>

      <P>I am sure the House would wish to express its satisfaction at the decision of the Danish people to endorse the Maastricht Treaty, which we endorsed.  However, this means that the Irish Government now has an obligation to fulfil its promise to introduce an amendment to the European Communities Act, 1972, to enable Ireland to formally ratify the Treaty.  As the House is aware, even though the Irish people ratified the Treaty the Oireachtas has not done so because the Department of Foreign Affairs has not yet produced this legislation.</P>

      <P>We will start <Col N="9" /> with amendment No. 1 in the name of Deputy Harney.  I observe that amendments Nos. 6, 7, 8 and 9 form a composite proposal.  I observe also that if amendment No. 1 is negatived, amendments Nos. 6, 7, 8 and 9 cannot be moved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 29, to delete &ldquo;judge&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;person&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I was disappointed in the amendments circulated by the Minister of State as he did not take on board the suggestions made in the long debate on Committee Stage on this issue.  It is not appropriate that the person who will supervise the implementation of his important legislation should be a serving judge of the High Court.  On Committee Stage I outlined a number of reasons why it is inappropriate. The judge in question may be involved in trials at a subsequent date.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State said he has had a letter from the Bar Council to the effect that a serving judge who would supervise the implementation of this legislation will not subsequently be involved in criminal trials, but that is not good enough.  There are long delays in our courts.  We do not have enough judges and we should not remove one judge from hearing criminal trials for the purposes of this legislation. I presume a judge will be appointed for a number of years.  It is not enough to have an assurance from the Bar Council. I do not question the integrity of that body but the Bar is not regulated by statute, unlike the Incorporated Law Society.  This House should make the appropriate regulations to implement this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a widely held view that judges are not the only people who are fair and impartial.  We should not confine independent referees to members of the Judiciary.  One of my amendments seeks to put into place the committee set up under the 1974 Act, to establish the Office of the Director of Public Prosecution. It comprises a number of people, including a representative of the Bar Council and the Secretary to the Government <Col N="10" /> who meet with the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court and so on for the purpose of deciding who should be the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Such a committee would be the appropriate body to select the person to oversee the implementation of this legislation.  I am not satisfied that the Minister of State has taken on board to any degree any of the suggestions made in the long debate on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>This good legislation was prepared when my party was in Government. Indeed, we insisted on it because of the unsatisfactory arrangements that were in place for the interception of telecommunications packages and so on.  We all know of the appalling interference in the early 1980s for political motives.  I did not table many amendments to the Bill but the points I am making in relation to a serving judge are not unreasonable. Had the Minister of State proposed a retired judge I would have accepted that. To insist that the person who will supervise the implementation of this legislation should be a High Court judge is wrong. It is a mistake which will tie up one member of the High Court who cannot be involved &mdash; if the Minister of State and the Bar Council are correct &mdash; in criminal work.  We have too few judges and long delays, particularly with regard to civil cases.  The last thing we need is to clog up our already cumbersome and slow court hearing procedure any further.</P>
    <P>In this amendment I did not refer to &ldquo;his&rdquo; so that it would not be sexist in any sense.  Deputy Gilmore drew my attention to that.  Last night I talked to some people who were involved in the Commission on the Status of Women and they made this point very forcefully.  The Commission recommended that the Interpretation Act should be changed so that we would have legislation that was not sexist or would imply that a Minister was automatically a man which is normally the case in legislation which comes before this House.  This is not particularly relevant to this legislation but I hope the Minister, coming from a Department which I hope will introduce many law <Col N="11" /> reform proposals on the criminal side, will take this view on board when framing legislation.</P>
    <P>If amendment No. 1 falls, the others, which are consequential to a large extent, will not be relevant.  If the designated person is to be a judge of the High Court the subsequent amendments will not make sense.  I do not intend to repeat the remarks I made as we move through the Bill, but I am very disappointed that the Minister of State has prepared so few amendments and that he has taken on board very few of our suggestions.  Other than changing the Army representative to a Chief of Staff, the Minister of State's amendments are very poor.  I am disappointed because there was a great deal of co-operation, goodwill and consensus when dealing with this legislation.  The Minister of State could have gone a little further but, perhaps, his hands were tied. However, if we are to have effective debates on legislation here or in the new select committees, we need to have a more realistic response from the Government. No valid reasons were put forward for not taking these suggestions on board. It seems to be sheer doggedness on the part of the Minister of State and the Government which puts us into a situation where we will just move our amendments to no great effect.  I hope that will not be the trend for the future in relation to Bills from the Department of Justice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny) Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Carlow-Kilkenny</i>): I thought the Minister was quite reasonable in accepting two amendments which I moved.  Considering the stone-walling that goes on in so many Departments I compliment the Minister on accepting those two amendments.  Perhaps Deputy Harney is right that the Minister of State is under pressure from the Department not to accept other reasonable amendments but at least to have two amendments accepted is an improvement.  I hope it will be the start of a new trend, that the Opposition may be credited with having some intelligence and that their <Col N="12" /> proposal will be acceptable to some Departments.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I support Deputy Harney's contention that the Bill would be improved if the reference to &ldquo;judge&rdquo; was removed.  I should say that in the beginning I thought that a judge would have been the ideal person, but I now support those who argue that a judge could be tied up because of involvement in a case.  There is a shortage of judges and there are long delays in having cases heard.  Therefore because of his involvement in a case where he sanctioned a phone tap or made inquiries, a judge may have to step down.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the wonderful work done by the Ombudsman, I would have no fear about stepping into the unknown or be worried that a lay person would not be able to handle the matter.  I ask the Minister of State to consider accepting the amendment because it would be of help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I too support the amendment and I lean more towards Deputy Harney's view of the Minister of State's willingness to accept amendments than to Deputy Browne's.  Given the absence of ministerial amendments dealing with the issues which have been raised and the responses of the Minister of State, it would seem that the reasonable points made in respect of a number of amendments have not been taken on board. This is most disappointing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Harney's point in relation to the Interpretation Act.  I recall that shortly after I entered this House, when I tabled my first batch of amendments, I used the form &ldquo;he/she&rdquo;, but when they appeared on the list of amendments only the word &ldquo;he&rdquo; was used. When I queried this I was told about this obscure legislation, the Interpretation Act.  I asked the then Taoiseach if he would consider amending that legislation to give recognition, in the description of gender in legislation, to 50 per cent of the population.  He expressed a willingness to do so and stated in response to my question that he would consider introducing legislation to amend the Interpretation <Col N="13" /> Act.  That is almost four years ago and I very much regret that this has not happened to date.  It is a very simple matter and could be dealt with quickly. It would be warmly welcomed both inside and outside the House and bring to an end the archaic procedure whereby in almost all legislation 50 per cent of the population is insulted.</P>
    <P>On the question of whether the person who will conduct the review of the operation of this Bill should be somebody other than a judge, I expressed my support on Committee Stage for the case put forward by Deputy Harney that it should be somebody other than a judge.  We tend to have a fascination with judges and have a tendency to elevate members of the Judiciary to positions they were never intended to hold.  There is no reason the review should not be conducted by somebody other than a judge particularly, as Deputy Harney has pointed out, since the Judiciary already have a full agenda.  It would be wasteful to divert High Court judges away from the work that they should normally process, particularly when there are so many eminent people who could carry out the functions specified in this legislation. Therefore I support the amendment that somebody other than a judge should carry out the review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea) Willie O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I take Deputy Harney's point about the Interpretation Act.  I have asked my officials to check what the up-to-date position is and I will communicate in writing with the Deputy. I understand that there was a Private Members' Bill on the Seanad Order Paper during last session; I do not know what has happened since.  The Deputy mentioned that I had been given an assurance from the Bar Council, but this was given by the Chief Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The essential feature of these amendments is to replace the term &ldquo;designated judge&rdquo; as the person who will review the legislation with &ldquo;designated person&rdquo;.  I can assure the House that I have given this matter very careful thought in view of the arguments made on Committee <Col N="14" /> Stage.  I wish to assure the House that my decision not to accept the amendment was not a knee jerk reaction or a reactionary response but was made after I had given the matter careful thought.  I would like to explain the reasons I made this decision.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 8 of the Bill, relating to the review of the operation of the Bill by a judge of the High Court, have to be understood in the context of the entire scheme introduced in the Bill. The Convention on Human Rights requires that a person whose rights are affected by the system of authorised interception should have adequate guarantees against abuses and an effective remedy if such abuses occur.  It is essential therefore to have some form of review of the operation of the system and redress.  In the normal way a person whose rights are violated by administrative action, or who alleges that their rights have been violated by administrative action, can have such action reviewed in the courts.  But because of the inherently secret nature of the interception system it is necessary to restrict access to the courts and so it is necessary to establish an alternative forum which can ensure that the system is being operated properly.  When I talk about the need to restrict access to the courts because of the inherently secret nature of the system, I refer the Deputies to section 10, under which access to the courts will be restricted.</P>
    <P>A reasonable solution is to entrust this duty to an independent judicial person who, by his training and experience, is well qualified to scrutinise and report impartially on the operation of the system.  The office of designated judge, along with the complaints referee, is fundamental to securing and maintaining the balance between the needs of society and the rights of individuals.  It introduces an independent element into the system of authorised interceptions and is thus crucial in ensuring that the system will enjoy public confidence.  The confidence can best be secured from the outset if the public know that the continuing review of the Bill will be undertaken by a person <Col N="15" /> who holds high judicial office.  The work of the designated judge could not necessarily be performed by just any person, no matter how eminent that person might be.  The work we are talking about is the continuing review of the exercise of ministerial functions and all of the associated administrative procedures.  The judge will be able to go where he likes, see what material he likes and talk to whoever he likes.  It is a role for somebody who commands public confidence, who is absolutely independent, who has an experienced legal mind and who can act independently and decisively.</P>
    <P>Because of the particular duties imposed on the designated judge there will be no question of such a judge taking part in any criminal trial or in any appeal from a criminal trial.  That is one of the reasons the original draft of the Bill was changed so that the invitation to the High Court judge to undertake the duties specified in section 8 will come from the President of the High Court.  That has regard to the duties of the President of the High Court in the allocation of business among the Judiciary.  The fact that the invitation will come from the President of the High Court, while not the purpose of the change, will further reassure the public about the office of designated judge.  There would also be no problem in civil cases, because if a case arose in which a judge considered he should not take part he could exclude himself from the trial and be replaced by another judge without anyone being aware of it.</P>
    <P>The second part of the amendment refers to the use of the committee for the purposes of section 2 of the Prosecution of Offences Act, 1974, for the selection of a person for appointment to be the designated person.  That committee was set up under the 1974 Act to select candidates for appointment to the office of Director of Public Prosecutions.  The committee draw up a list of suitable candidates and the Government makes the appointment.  While the position of designated judge is a very important one and <Col N="16" /> the fact that the Bill specifies that that person must be a High Court judge indicates the importance of the position, it is effectively a part-time position and could not be compared with that of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  In any case not just any person can be appointed Director of Public Prosecutions.  The committee established under the provisions of the 1974 Act do not have a completely free hand in its selection.  The 1974 Act specifies that the Director of Public Prosecutions be a practising barrister or solicitor of at least ten years' standing.  If the Act is to be reviewed by a judge of the High Court, the arrangements in section 8 are the most appropriate to be invoked for his appointment, that is that he be invited to undertake the duties specified in that section by the President of the High Court and then designated for that purpose by the Government rather than selected by a committee.</P>
    <P>I have given these amendments quite a lot of thought since Committee Stage. I am happy that the present arrangement, while not perfect, strikes the right balance. For those reasons I cannot accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed with the response of the Minister of State. I welcome the fact that he will review the provisions of the Interpretation Act. However, I noted, when he spoke about a High Court judge, that it was always &ldquo;he&rdquo;.  Therefore, am I to presume that the designated judge will be male?  I know that at present there is one female judge only of the High Court and I look forward to the day when there will be many more. There are approximately 15 High Court judges and what we are proposing to do here is to exclude him or her from criminal work.  Indeed conflicts of interest may arise in relation to civil actions.  It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that somebody who feels that their telecommunications messages were interfered with unfairly or intercepted could take a civil action.  It does not necessarily follow that it would always be a criminal trial whenever conflicts of interest might arise in relation to these <Col N="17" /> matters.  For example, the judge in question could be involved in circumstances in which a person would be involved in civil litigation to claim damages against the State.  Indeed the case taken by a former Member, Geraldine Kennedy and journalist Bruce Arnold was a civil constitutional case which was taken to the Supreme Court.</P>
      <P>All the arguments of the Minister of State apply equally to a retired judge in assuming independence, clarity, understanding of the law and so on.  That applies equally to a retired judge and to one of the District Court, Circuit Court or the Supreme Court.  Why do we single out the High Court?</P>
      <P>I am asking the Minister of State to substitute &ldquo;designated person&rdquo; for &ldquo;designated judge&rdquo; which would give us scope to appoint perhaps a judge of the High Court, a retired judge, the Ombudsman or a retired public servant.  There are quite a number of options but we are closing every option except that of a High Court judge.  That is a mistake and a lost opportunity.</P>
      <P>As I said earlier, there are long delays in civil litigation here; two, three or four years being the norm in which to have a case heard.  While that does not happen in all cases, it is mainly because we do not have sufficient numbers of judges at all levels, at Circuit and High Court levels in particular, or indeed at District Court level.  It is an awful shame that &mdash; for the sake of the present 40 authorisations about which the Minister of State informed us recently &mdash; if the number is 15 High Court judges, we propose taking one-fifteenth of our resource; in other words, taking that person out of the system, away from hearing criminal cases altogether, clogging the litigation system further.</P>
      <P>The Ombudsman is regarded as an independent person.  He is not a person with legal expertise.  Sometimes people who do not have legal expertise have much more understanding of the effect of different provisions on individuals, and, equally, can have the requisite clarity of mind, independence of thought and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="18" /> The Minister of State, in responding in regard to the committee appointed under the provisions of the 1974 Act, for sending forward candidates to be appointed as Director of Public Prosecutions, said that all they do is to forward names to the Government.  I know that is all they do but it is a safeguard, a screening mechanism. We cannot computerise the selection of individuals, somebody has to take the decisions, but it is important that the process of selection is independent.  I believe it is; it is successful and commands respect because of that.  It is a much better system than the Government picking out someone and appointing him or her as Director of Public Prosecutions because of the ten years' experience as a lawyer at the Bar, or as a solicitor.  Of course, any such appointee needs that experience to be a Director of Public Prosecutions.  Somebody who did not have legal training would not be in a position to do the job.</P>
    <P>We had a long debate about this on Second and Committee Stages, it has been aired here this morning, but the Minister's response is very disappointing. Let me give this warning to the Department of Justice: in so far as we want to find independent persons for the future I hope this will have been the last time we shall have presumed that the only independent person we could find was a serving member of the Judiciary, in particular a judge of the High Court. That is an insult to many people and, as I said, will tie down one-fifteenth of our very small resource.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough for the Minister of State to say that he has the assurance of the Chief Justice that this appointee will not be involved in criminal trials.  I do not question the integrity of the Chief Justice, or what he said, but that is not good enough.  We are enacting law; the law should insist that the appointee will not be involved in criminal trials.  After all, as I said, somebody could take a civil action for damages, when there would be nothing &mdash; in law &mdash; to prevent the judge in question from presiding.  I presume the person would be honourable and would not preside, nonetheless, we should not <Col N="19" /> leave it to the honour of individuals; we should ensure, when enacting the law, that we avoid loopholes of this kind, especially when drawn to our attention. We can make mistakes sometimes because things are not drawn to our attention, but this is being drawn to our attention.  We are making a mistake in not writing that into the legislation but <Col N="20" /> simply relying on the word of the Chief Justice of the day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c)  the nominated officer shall maintain a record of any authorisations given under paragraph (b).&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment arises out of a Committee Stage amendment from Deputy Gilmore which sought to remove the power of the Minister to grant oral authorisations.  That amendment was unacceptable on policy grounds but I undertook to have another look at the procedures to see if I could do anything to futher assure Deputies that the system for granting oral authorisations could not be abused.  The amendment I am now proposing will place an obligation on the nominated officer to maintain a record of any oral authorisation given by the Minister.  During Committee Stage comments were made which suggested to me that the provisions relating to oral authorisation might not be fully appreciated. Therefore, I would like to explain briefly how the system works and in what circumstances an oral authorisation might be sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fundamental point is that all the provisions relating to applications for authorisation, such as the conditions to be fulfilled, apply equally regardless of whether the authorisation will be given in writing or, in the first instance, given orally.  It is the authorisation that may be given orally &mdash; an application cannot be made orally.  Therefore, there could be no question of the Commissioner approaching the Minister at a function with a request for an oral authorisation. There can be no cutting of corners just because something may be urgent.  The request must be made by the Commissioner in the usual way in writing to the nominated officer.  The nominated officer will consider the applications in the same way whether the authorisation will be written or oral &mdash; indeed, at that point the nominated officer may not know whether the authorisation will be written or oral.  Again, in the case of every application the nominated officer must make a written submission to the Minister with his opinion on whether the specified conditions stand fulfilled.  At that point if, say, the Minister is away from the office for the day, it may be undesirable to await the return because of the urgency of the application.  In those circumstances the nominated officer could contact the Minister and if she is satisfied that the case is one of exceptional urgency, she can give an oral authorisation. Under this amendment the <Col N="23" /> nominated officer will at that point record the fact of the authorisation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very impressed with the Minister's use of the word &ldquo;she&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no real scope for abuse in the present system.  However, I recognise there is concern among some Deputies that there could be abuse, so to allay that concern I am proposing this additional safeguard which I recommend to the House.</P>
      <P>There is one final point I would make about section 2 (2) (b).  Where the Minister gives an oral authorisation it must be confirmed in writing &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo;. Those words &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; gave rise to some comment on Committee Stage.  The draftsman was consulted and he said they meant no more and no less than &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo;.  It is simply a question of drafting style which phrase is used.  However, he has advised against amending the words to &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo; as to do so could rise in some people's minds the possibility that the phrases had different meanings and that could have consequences for other legislation. I commend the amendment to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reminded by the Minister's last remarks of a parish priest who when he received requests for anniversary masses announced that the masses would be held as soon as possible. This gave rise to considerable concern and anger on the part of the parishioners, particularly the relatives of the deceased, who wished to have a date identified on which the mass would be said.  I am not sure that by defining &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; as meaning &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo; will give us a great deal of joy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased the Minister has come back with this amendment which goes part of the way at least to addressing the concerns expressed on Committee Stage. The reasoning given by the Minister to allay our fears about any possible abuse of the oral method of giving authorisations seems to contradict entirely the <Col N="24" /> case he made on the last occasion for the need for oral authorisations.  On that occasion he presented scenarios of circumstances that were of such great urgency that the Minister could not possibly give authorisation in writing, even to the extent that the Minister travelling in her car could not stop at a place where she would have access to a Fax machine to give the authorisation in that way.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has stated that the procedures that will have to be followed in respect of an oral authorisation will be similar to those that must be followed for a written authorisation &mdash; in other words, that the application as well as the supporting case for the authorisation will have to be in writing.  It seems that it will take some time for the designated officer to prepare that material and if time has to be taken in making the application it is not unreasonable that the authorisation be given in writing.  There is a degree of contradiction between the case made by the Minister on the last occasion for oral authorisations in terms of the urgency involved and the inconvenience and delay that might occur in the event of the Minister being required to give the authorisation in writing.</P>
    <P>However, some progress is being made here in that the procedures that will have to be followed in the case of oral authorisations will be similar to those followed in the case of written authorisations.  There is at least a requirement that a record will have to be kept by the nominated officer of all authorisations which are given orally.  That minimises the possibility of abuse for the use of oral authorisations.  While it does not go the whole way to meet the concerns I raised on Committee Stage it is progress.  Given the Minister's reluctance to accept other amendments I can only express my thanks to him for having gone that far at least.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this amendment which is a further safeguard. Obviously, the intention is that this procedure would only come into play in cases of exceptional urgency.  I raised this <Col N="25" /> matter on Committee Stage and having read again the provision it is not clear what information will be available to the Minister when making this decision.  The Minister of State told me on the previous day that the Minister would have all the information he or she would have if they were signing this authorisation as opposed to giving an oral permission. Will the Minister clarify that issue?</P>
      <P>The Minister of State said that where the Minister gives an oral authorisation it must be confirmed in writing &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; and so on.  I will not dispute that because we could spend all day arguing about nothing.  Generally, the phrase used in legislation is, &ldquo;as soon as is practicable&rdquo;. When I occupied a similar post as the Minister of State the draftspersons office told me that if something was to happen as fast as was possible that was the phrase that was to be used.  Will the Minister clarify that?  I will not argue about the words as they are not that relevant.</P>
      <P>Is it the case that some of these words are more legally binding than others?  If that is the case we are all aware of the great joy lawyers derive from litigation about the meaning of words which earns many of them very good salaries for a considerable length of time.  This is the kind of language we need to standardise in our legislation because if one Bill uses the words &ldquo;as soon as is practicable&rdquo; and other Bills use the words &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; I can foresee different judges, or, perhaps, the same judge, interpreting both phrases differently, even though the intention may be to achieve the same objective.  I raise that issue in the context of legislation generally with a view to standardising words so that we all have a clear view of what exactly we are talking about.</P>

      <P>Obviously, what we want to achieve, arising from Deputy Gilmore's point on the previous day, is that a record be maintained in writing.  I shall give the Deputy's request some thought. I agree with Deputy Harney's point in regard to standardising phrases such as &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo;, &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo; and &ldquo;as soon as possible.&rdquo;  I am informed that when we want to get something done quickly it depends on what phraseology is used by the draftsman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reject Deputy Gilmore's assertion that what I am saying contradicts what I said on the last occasion.  I should explain, in response to Deputy Harney's question, how this will operate in the event of an emergency.  A written submission has to be made by the Commission, e.g. the Garda Commissioner &mdash; for the authorised officer.  The authorised officer must then prepare a case in writing for the Minister.  The Minister does not necessarily have to see the submission from the nominated officer but in practically every case she will see it and note that it is signed by the nominated officer. The nominated officer will proceed on the information given to him by the Commissioner and he can make his own inquiries.  He can also bring to bear his own knowledge.  What we envisaged in the case of an emergency is that the Minister may be away in which case the nominated <Col N="27" /> officer will contact the Minister and read to her over the telephone the written submission he is making in favour of the granting of the authorisation.  The Minister will then give the authorisation orally.  The nominated officer will make a record of that and when the Minister returns to her office she will see the written submission from the nominated officer.  The substantive information the Minister will have in relation to the granting of an oral application will be the same as if she has granted a written authorisation. While the information from the nominated officer will be in writing it will be read to her over the telephone.  I commend the amendment to the House.</P>
    <P>This Bill was initiated in the Seanad and I do not know what the mechanism is for amending it at this stage.  We cannot consider it and report back.  The draftsman is happy with it and I do not think there is any question of people making many tapes; all we need is a record we can all see and have access to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 8, to delete lines 16 to 19, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(II)  the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accepted on Committee Stage the substance of amendments from Deputies Mitchell, Browne and Harney concerning the Chief of Staff and undertook to request the draftsman to draft for Report Stage amendments covering the point.  Amendment No. 3 will ensure that all applicants from the Defence Forces for authorisations will be made in writing by the Chief of Staff.  This will be consistent <Col N="28" /> with the position in the Garda Síochána where all such applications are made by the Commissioner.  The amendment does not affect the existing requirement that any application from the Defence Forces be accompanied by a recommendation from the Minister for Defence.  That was the position when it had to be an officer not below the rank of colonel.  It will be the same even though the Chief of Staff is now making the application.</P>
    <P>The draftsman has used the words &ldquo;the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces&rdquo; rather than the words &ldquo;the Chief of Staff of the Permanent Defence Force&rdquo;.  The wording he used is in line with the definition of &ldquo;the Chief of Staff&rdquo; in the Defence Act, 1954.  The same wording is used in the consequential amendment to section 7.</P>
    <P>Also, the 1954 Act defines &ldquo;Officer&rdquo; as being a officer of the Permanent Defence Force.  That is why that expression was used in the original draft of the section which we are now amending.  I am accepting the substance of the amendment but I am not using the terminology &ldquo;the Chief of Staff of the Permanent Defence Forces&rdquo; because that is in line with the explanation of that position in the Defence Act, 1954.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Carlow-Kilkenny</i>): I welcome the amendment and I have no objection to the deletion of the word &ldquo;Permanent&rdquo; from the title of the Chief of Staff.  We know who the Chief of Staff of the Army is and we talk about the Army more than the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome this amendment.  I tabled a similar amendment on Committee Stage.  However, I have to take issue with the Minister about dropping the word &ldquo;permanent&rdquo;, although I will not press it.  Before I tabled my amendment I telephoned the press office at the Department of Defence and, indeed, the Army press office to ask the exact title of the Chief of Staff which I took down word for word. This is a small thing to ask.  Perhaps the Minister could not justify not taking on <Col N="29" /> our amendment so he had to leave out something.  I will not argue about it. However, it seems strange that the officer is to be an officer of the Permanent Defence Forces, but the Chief of Staff is of the Defence Forces.  The Minister had some explanation but I did not quite understand it.</P>
      <P>I am delighted that the Army person will be at the same level as the equivalent person from the Garda Síochána and will be the highest serving officer, that is, the Commissioner in the case of the Garda Síochána and the Chief of Staff in the case of the Defence Forces.  It is appropriate and correct that the people responsible for initiating authorisations for the interception of telephone messages should be most senior officer from either the Army or the Garda Síochána. Certainly, if the Chief of Staff is not aware of the necessity to intercept somebody's telephone message then either he is not doing his work or the necessity does not arise at all.  Anybody who is a security risk to the State will obviously be known to the Chief of Staff.  Therefore the argument on the last occasion that the Chief of Staff might not necessarily know, because it would be an officer below him who would be handling matters of this kind, does not stand up.  I am delighted that the Minister has accepted the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 9, between lines 8 and 9, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;8.&mdash;At the end of the six month period following the enactment of this Act and at the expiration of every subsequent six month period the Minister shall publish or cause to have published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> a report which shall include the following details in respect of the period in question:</P>
      <P>(a)  the number of warrants issued for the interception of postal packages; the number of addresses in respect of which such warrants were issued; and the number of postal packets intercepted,</P>
      <P>(b)  the number of warrants issued for the interception of telecommunications messages; the number of addresses or mobile units in respect of which such warrants were issued; and the number of telecommunications messages intercepted.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We had quite a lengthy discussion on this amendment on Committee Stage.  The purpose of the amendment is to require the publication at six monthly intervals of the number of warrants issued for interceptions of both telecommunications messages and postal packages.  I argued that it was in the public interest to know not the identity of those whose telephones are being tapped or whose letters are being intercepted but the overall number of interceptions being authorised.  It is important that that information be in the public domain to prevent any abuse of the powers given to the Minister for Justice in this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State generously informed the House on Committee Stage that the current number of interceptions <Col N="31" /> in respect of telephones was 44.  It is not excessive and I would not regard that as an abuse of the powers.  The Minister also indicated that he would bring in an amendment on Report Stage to require the High Court judge who will be carrying out the periodical review of the legislation and the operation of the Act to include in his report the number of authorisations given.  He further accepted an amendment from Deputy Browne that the maximum period within which such a review would be undertaken would be reduced from two years to 12 months.  I am disappointed that the Minister has not tabled an amendment which would require the High Court judge to include the numbers in his report.  The publication of the number of authorisations is still at the discretion of the Minister or, ultimately, of the Taoiseach.  I put it to the Minister that there is a necessity to build into the legislation a requirement that the numbers be published from time to time.  I appeal to him to accept the amendment that I have tabled, or at the very least to assure the House that the information I am seeking to have made public will be given by way of response to parliamentary questions tabled here from time to time.  One way or another it is important that this information be made public.</P>
    <P>I say that because there has been concern in the past about the abuse of the power to issue such authorisations.  On 13 September 1993 <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> published what it described as transcripts of telephone conversations involving a number of senior personnel in the Fine Gael Party.  I certainly do not support or in any way condone the taping of telephone conversations and it is clear that such taping in that particular case was highly illegal.  That was a gross invasion of privacy irrespective of whether it was a private citizen or somebody in public life.  I find it equally distasteful that such conversations should be published.  However, I know the Minister of State has a certain enthusiasm for the publication of taped telephone calls <Col N="32" /> irrespective of whether they are true or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to prolong discussion of this issue.  I will accept what the Minister of State says.  The reported conversation between Deputy Bruton and Deputy Noonan in the report in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> on 13 September 1993 raised two issues which the Minister needs to address in the context of this amendment.  The first is the reported widespread use of telephone tapping described, which, it says here, goes back to the time of Deputy O'Malley.  There was a reference to the fact that if the information was made public it could be <Col N="33" /> embarrassing.  That raises the question as to whether it was the widespread practice of Ministers for Justice in the past to authorise the tapping of telephones.  It raises also the possibility that there might be similar abuse in the future.</P>
      <P>I accept, for reasons of tackling crime and protecting the security of the State, it is not possible or desirable that the identity of the persons whose telephones are being tapped should be made known. However, to prevent abuse and to allay public concern, it is important that the number of telephone taps should be made known to the public from time to time.  The Minister provided us with the current number of telephone taps and the House appreciates that, but it would be useful to know the number of telephone taps and the number of persons whose telephones were tapped.  Such information should be in the public domain.</P>
      <P>The second issue which arises from the reported conversation is a disturbing reference to a former Minister for Justice having taken transcripts of conversation from the Department of Justice when he left office.  A newspaper article stated: &ldquo;when Doherty left office he took stuff with him out of the Department of Justice&rdquo;. A later reference in the same&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quoting from a newspaper article.  My amendment seeks to have built into the legislation a formal procedure for making known publicly the number of telephone taps authorised by Ministers for Justice.  I am doing that to prevent any possible abuse in the future by Ministers for Justice in relation to the authorisation of telephone taps.  In supporting that I am quoting an article in a newspaper which said there had been <Col N="34" /> widespread use of telephone taps in the past, to the extent that at least one former Minister for Justice thought that if such information became public it would be embarrassing, which suggests that there may have been abuse on the part of somebody. That article also stated that a former Minister for Justice took with him out of the Department of Justice information regarding the extent of telephone tapping and, more disturbingly, took the transcripts of the conversations concerned. It is important that the Minister of State should use this opportunity to tell the House what inquiries have been made arising from the publication of that article.  I do not wish to go over the number of telephones tapped in the past; that is history and this Bill attempts to prevent such abuse in the future. However, I am concerned about this report which claims that a former Minister for Justice may have taken transcripts of tapped telephone conversations out of the Department of Justice.  The Minister of State should set the record straight in regard to whether that has been inquired into, whether it is true and what will be done about it.  I am seeking to put into legislation some mechanism whereby information can be made known formally to the public about the extent of telephone tapping.  My amendment proposes that the number of telephone taps should be published every six months.  If, for some reason, the Minister persists with the decision he took on Committee Stage in not accepting my amendment, I invite him to confirm his willingness to provide that information in response to parliamentary questions.  The information I seek to make public in the amendment should at least be made available in response to parliamentary questions.  If the Minister is at least prepared to go that far we might be able to make progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Gilmore's amendment which seeks to elicit information.  On Committee Stage the Minister of State accepted a reduction to one year in the time limit in which a High Court judge will have to report, but the <Col N="35" /> information he or she must report is vague.  This amendment seeks to give the public basic statistical information and getting basic information here is virtually impossible, particularly from the Department of Justice.  State Departments in general are paranoid about secrecy in regard to information.  As a Minister of State I regularly saw files which were marked &ldquo;secret&rdquo; yet contained nothing which could have been regarded as secret.  They merely contained basic statisical information.  There is an arrogance on the part of the State in withholding information to which individuals are entitled.</P>
      <P>Various persons, including the former Taoiseach, gave commitments about a freedom of information Bill but if sensible amendments such as this are opposed what would be the point in having such a Bill?  We were required to implement a directive on the freedom of access to environmental information by the end of last December.  Subject to restrictions in regard to security and trade secrets, State and public authorities are required to make available to the public information regarding the environment.  That directive has not yet been implemented here despite the fact that the necessary legislation is in place.  The provisions of the Environmental Protection Agency Act allow us to implement that directive. Regulations can also be made under that Act but there is a reluctance to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was pleased that the Minister of State recently gave statistics in relation to the number of authorisations in force at present, it got extensive media coverage because it related to statistics, about which we get very little information.  Last week a question was tabled to the Minister in regard to whether any public representative's telephone was tapped.  She said no Member of the Oireachtas has had his or her telephone tapped which, presumably, means that other public representative's telephones are tapped.  I do not disagree with that.  If the security of the State or the investigation of serious crime requires the tapping of a telephone of a public representative, a journalist or <Col N="36" /> anyone else, we must have the powers to do so.  We must not act with our hands tied behind our backs because we are afraid of the person.</P>
    <P>Under the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, it is a criminal offence to intercept telephone messages or postal packages and to make the contents known to others.  Have any prosecutions been brought under that Act?  I am not aware of any.  Has the person responsible for getting the information from Deputy Bruton's mobile telephone been prosecuted under that Act?  Transcripts of telephone conversations I made on a mobile telephone were circulated to individuals about a year ago.  I did not take any action in regard to that because, as many people said, mobile telephones are not secure and it is easy to intercept conversations on mobile telephone.  I do not have to worry about the telephone conversations I have with others.  However, everyone is entitled to their privacy and private telephone conversations with one's grandmother, grandfather or whoever should be private.  Other people should not be entitled to hear those conversations or publish transcripts of them.</P>
    <P>Despite our reluctance about issuing statistical information, which this amendment seeks, we are paranoia about interfering with individuals' privacy.  If journalists get a &ldquo;scoop&rdquo;, they are not concerned about the effect it might have on an individual or a family.  The &ldquo;scoop&rdquo; comes first and the family come very much behind that and that is regrettable. That does not relate just to Bishop Casey. People's private sexual affairs are their own business and the media do not have a right to publish details about people's private lives regardless of who they are unless it interferes with the public policy stand they might take.  If an individual's telephone conversation is recorded unknown to that person it is highly improper for that conversation to be transcribed and published for the world at large.  We must protect the privacy of individuals.</P>
    <P>One of our country's strong marks is <Col N="37" /> our written Constitution under which individuals have basic fundamental rights which have been liberally interpreted by the courts in the past.  The courts have given us most of our rights in relation to certain matters.  The right to privacy is fundamental and it should only be interfered with when the security of the State or the investigation of serious crime is involved.  Notes or recordings of overheard telephone conversations should not be taken and circulated just because the people involved may be well known. That is wrong.  We must institute proceedings against such individuals and make an example of them.  In regard to Deputy Bruton's case I understand the Garda were successful in their investigations but I would be interested to know if there will be a prosecution.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore's referred to a former Minister for Justice who took documents from the Department of Justice.  If that is the case &mdash; I read something about that many years ago &mdash; the Minister of State and his Department, should speak to the person concerned and request that the documents be returned to the Department. That is not to say that the individual would not have photocopies of the documents.  Those documents should be returned as they are the property of the Department and not the individual.  As the Minister of State is aware many reasons were given on that occasion to tap the telephones of journalists and, perhaps, of colleagues.  The reason given for the latter was that colleagues were supposed to be subverting the State. Telephones were tapped then for political reasons and not for the investigation of subversive activity of other crimes. The privacy of individuals was grossly interfered with, not just of journalists but of colleagues.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore referred also to other former Ministers for Justice such as Deputy O'Malley.  Deputy O'Malley was Minister for Justice when he was about 30 years of age in 1970-71 at a time when the troubles in Northern Ireland began violence broke out during the period 1969 to 1971.  It was a difficult time for this country when the terrorist organisations, <Col N="38" /> who have bedevilled us since, came into being in a powerful and important way. They caused all the havoc and difficulties we have had since.  Deputy O'Malley was a young and courageous Minister.  He could never stay more than two nights at any address for security reasons.  It is fashionable now to stand up to the Provisional IRA, one is not ridiculed for doing so.  However, in the 1970s it was not so fashionable and many accusations were made about the infringement of civil liberties and so on.  It was the start of a very dangerous period and the approximate 2,500 deaths in Northern Ireland since, may have changed many people's minds or perhaps, the public perception has helped to change their minds.  It was not fashionable then to face up to the terrorists and Deputy O'Malley was an extremely brave Minister.  He suffered a great deal, as I am sure the Minister of State is aware.  His family suffered also. They had to be evacuated from their home in Limerick on many occasions for security reasons.  His mother-in-law's public house was blown up in Northern Ireland.  Deputy Gilmore's remarks should be made in that context.  I have no doubt that any telephone taps authorised by the former Minister for Justice, Deputy O'Malley, during these years were at the behest of the Garda Síochána and the security forces.  He did not authorise this course of action off his own bat, he acted on the advice and at the request of the authorities in order to help the investigation of serious crime.</P>
    <P>It is approximately four years since the last report on the prison service was published by the Department of Justice and it is about the same length of time, 1989, or so, since a report on the probation service was published.  Those reports contain information useful to policy makers, and others interested in those areas, for example, students of criminology, the prison service, the Garda Síochána and so on.  It is difficult to obtain this information and such reports should be published annually as a matter of form.</P>
    <P>We should not have to wait three to five years for those reports.  When the <Col N="39" /> reports are finally published the information contained in them is out of date and, therefore, is not so useful.  If statistical information is not provided at the time it is somewhat irrelevant.  Given how difficult it is to obtain such reports we must write into this legislation the requirement, as suggested by Deputy Gilmore, that every six months basic information will be furnished regarding the number of authorisations issued for the interception of telephone messages or postal packages.  If we do not do this we will get a skimpy report and that is not good enough.  It is not in keeping with the ethos in regard to openness in our society.  Unlike most European countries, Ireland and Britain are conscious of secrecy and denying individuals their right to information.</P>
    <P>This is a good amendment.  The Minister has given no valid reason for refusing to accept it.  If access to information, the broadening of democracy, more openness and the objectives contained in the Programme for Government are to mean anything in regard to change, this amendment should be accepted.  We should not vote against it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny) Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Carlow-Kilkenny</i>): We could discuss the past when some shady deals did occur but this Bill represents a change and seeks to bring everything into the open.  The Minister will be advised by the Chief of Staff of the Army and the Commissioner in these matters.  Everything is legal and above board and because we live in a democracy there will be no embarrassment in publishing numbers.  A great deal of information could not be published because it would be helpful to those we are trying to keep under control but the number of legitimate telephone taps and other such information should not be concealed. The number of authorisations given should be made available every six months.  This will not affect the security of the State or democracy, rather it will help democracy and keep the public informed.  I support the amendment.  It is <Col N="40" /> a logical one because it legitimises actions taken for the protection of the State.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to illegal telephone tapping and interception of telephone calls.  That will not be covered by this Bill but I would be sympathetic to individuals who innocently turn a knob on a radio receiver set and pick up messages accidentally.  There should be a clear onus on radio and television stations and newspapers not to relay or print conversations picked up in that way.  I would be much more interested in seeing people who illegally intercept telephone conversations punished for making such conversations available to the media.  I hope that the people listening to me in the Public Gallery will not find themselves put in jail at any stage.  The transcripts of private conversations should not be made public.  It should be remembered that the printed word can make off-the-cuff comments seem twice as bad.  For example, a person could say jokingly during the course of a telephone conversation that he will have the other person shot in the morning.  If this comment is printed in the newspapers it gives a different impression of what was actually said.  We should ensure that all people who tap phones illegally are punished severely.  I have no qualms about people listening to phone conversations if they come across them by chance, but people who deliberately tap another person's phone in the hope of making money from selling the conversation to the media should be severely punished.</P>

      <P>I am most disappointed that Deputy Gilmore should choose to bring the debate down to that level.  I do not believe that one should refer to tapped private telephone conversations in the public domain.  I do not agree with this practice.  In fairness to him, I do not think <Col N="41" /> the editor of the newspaper in question agrees with this practice either.  Both he and I have apologised; neither of us knew at the time how the information had been got.  The matter should be left at that.</P>
      <P>I accept the points made by Deputy Harney about Deputy O'Malley and why he did what he did at the time.  As the House will be aware, the security and safety of the State were in danger not just from the Provisional IRA, for whom I have no brief, but also from the Official IRA.  I do not intend to rake up the past. If other people stay away from the past I will do the same.  However, if they want to reduce this debate to a certain level they will find me a very worthy protagonist &mdash; I have plenty of ammunition, if Deputies will excuse the pun.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore asked for various information.  I do not have this information to hand.  He asked me to guarantee that the information would be forthcoming if he put down a question.  I cannot give the Deputy that guarantee. All I can do is advise him to put down a question and I will see what can be done.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore also said he wanted his amendment accepted in order to prevent abuses.  I was under the impression that the whole reason for the legislation was to prevent abuses.  We are putting on a statutory basis what was previously done in an administrative way. We are also building very fundamental safeguards into the Bill.  As a matter of fact, I can compare this legislation to the requirements set out in the European Convention on Human Rights and the requirements set out in the Malone judgment.  We are providing more safeguards in this legislation than the European Court of Human Rights asked us to give in the Malone judgment; we are going further than the European Convention on Human Rights in terms of the safeguards built into the legislation. Therefore, I do not think anyone can reasonably argue for the acceptance of any amendment on the basis that it will prevent abuses and introduce safeguards. That is precisely the operation in which we are engaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to Deputy <Col N="42" /> Bruton's case.  Deputy Harney raised some questions on this matter.  The tapping of Deputy Bruton's phone was a criminal offence.  The matter has been investigated and the file has been sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions, who decides in the case of an indictable offence whether or not a prosecution should be taken.  With regard to Deputy Harney's other questions, I have been told that prosecutions have been taken under the 1983 legislation in relation to the interception of or interference with postal packets.  I am not aware of any other prosecution for interception of a telecommunications phone message, but I have asked my officials to make inquiries as to the number, if any, of prosecutions taken.  This information will be communicated to Deputy Harney.</P>
    <P>With regard to the general thrust of the amendment, I opposed this amendment on Committee Stage because I considered that it would cut across the functions of the designated judge.  I have listened carefully to the arguments which have been advanced since then but I have not been persuaded that there is any reason to change the opinion I expressed on Committee Stage.  However, I think I have gone some way towards meeting one of the objects of the amendment &mdash; and this has been acknowledged by Deputies on all sides of the House &mdash; by reducing the possible interval between the designated judge's report to the Taoiseach under section 8 (2) (a) from two years to 12 months.  I did this as a result of a suggestion put forward by Deputy Browne.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the rationale of this amendment and my decision to oppose it is not taken lightly.  There is not much I can add to what I said on Committee Stage other than to say that the Bill will introduce a self-contained scheme for the regulation of the grant of authorisations for interceptions by the Minister for Justice. The new safeguards are an integral part of that scheme and the offices of both the designated judge and the complaints referee are an important and central part of the scheme.  Their functions and duties have been carefully thought out and it is <Col N="43" /> very important that they are not only independent in the performance of those functions and duties but are also seen to be independent.  It would not be appropriate for the Minister to retain for himself or herself any functions that might parallel or conflict with the functions assigned to the designated judge or complaints referee.  That would be the case if the amendment became part of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I undertook on Committee Stage to examine the possibility of introducing a compromise amendment on Report Stage.  I have done this.  For example, I considered whether the Bill should specify that the report of the designated judge should contain information as to the number of warrants granted during the period covered by the report.  I have given this matter a great deal of thought and have finally come to the considered conclusion that such an amendment would not be justified on its merits. Because of his independent role, I think it would be much better to leave it up to the judge to decide what information he will or will not disclose in his reports to the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>I cannot, of course, say today that the designated judge definitely will include information in his reports as to the number of warrants issued in any particular period.  I cannot say either that he might not include much more information than envisaged in the amendment and that the amendment might have, unintentionally, a constraining effect.  I will come back to this matter later.  The designated judge will, as I said, be wholly independent; he or she will not be beholden to anybody.  I do not believe that any High Court judge would be content to continue in the office of designated judge if a Taoiseach censored a report because it contained matters which it would be inconvenient for the Government to publish, as opposed to matters which it would genuinely be prejudicial to the prevention or detection of crime to or to the security of the State to disclose.</P>
    <P>I have been looking at a fairly recent report of the British commissioner, who <Col N="44" /> performs broadly similar functions to those envisaged for the designated judge. If Deputies Gilmore, Harney and Browne wish, I will make a copy of the report available to them.  I note that the British commissioner includes quite a lot of statistical information in his report. For example, he specified the number of warrants in force on 31 December 1989 and the number of warrants issued during the course of that year.  I am referring to Lord Justice Lloyd's report issued in 1990, the latest report I can get my hands on.  He further divides the number of warrants into those issued in relation to interception of telecommunications and interception of letters; and he also distinguishes between those granted by the Home Secretary and those granted by the Secretary of State for Scotland. Obviously that does not apply in this country.  He also gives some general information on the type of crime for which warrants have been issued.  By far the largest number in the year under review was for serious crime.  He disclosed that 60 per cent of all warrants issued at the request of the police were concerned with large scale importation or distribution of drugs and 24 per cent were concerned with armed robbery.  The remaining 16 per cent covered fraud, large scale receiving and other serious crime.  Just under 50 per cent of all warrants issued at the request of the police resulted, directly or indirectly, in arrests and in some cases also the recovery of property.</P>
    <P>The British Act has a provision similar to that in our Bill concerning the exclusion of any material which would be prejudicial to national security or the prevention or detection of serious crime and, in the case of Britain, to the economic wellbeing of the United Kingdom. The power to exclude any part of the report is greater under the British legislation than under our proposed legislation. The report to which I referred had a note attached to it pointing out that a confidential appendix had been excluded from the report in accordance with the appropriate provisions of the British <Col N="45" /> Interception of Communications Act, 1985.</P>
    <P>While not wishing to draw any conclusions from what I have just said, I think it is clear that in England at least the amount of statistical information given in the report of their commissioner is greater than that envisaged in the Deputy's amendment or any amendment I could propose.  Rather than trying to commit the designated judge to providing some statistics, as I had suggested as a possible compromise amendment, I think it is far more appropriate to let him decide himself on what statistics he will disclose and how he might wish to present those statistics.  Accordingly, I came to the conclusion that any amendment would be neither necessary nor desirable.</P>
    <P>I oppose Deputy Gilmore's amendment for the reasons I outlined and I have also decided not to propose my compromise amendment for the same reasons. The British legislation is worded in the same way as ours except that one can refer to economic interests as an excuse for keeping material out.  This is what the designated person under the British legislation has decided to disclose.  Anybody who engages in debate in legislation here or who has had any legal training will know that Irish legislation, which is similar to British legislation, will be interpreted by the Irish Judiciary by looking at how similar legislation is interpreted in the neighbouring jurisdiction. The British have interpreted legislation similar to this in a way which will give considerably more information than would be given by virtue of Deputy Gilmore's amendment.  The draftsman fears that if either Deputy Gilmore's amendment or my amendment was taken on board it would be restrictive and ensure that the judge does not have a free hand. In the interests of giving greater access to information, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret the Minister's rejection of this amendment.  In relation to his remarks about the standard of the debate, it is a great pity that he has not chosen to apply to my acceptance of his <Col N="46" /> earlier intervention in relation to the letter he wrote to the <i>Sunday Independent</i> the same standard that he quite clearly expects from everybody else in relation to his acknowledgement of his having written the letter in the first place. The Minister is no stranger to the side swipe and if he intended by some of his earlier remarks to have a side swipe at me, he will have to think again.  If his remarks about raking over the past were intended as some kind of menacing threat to me, I assure him that I have no worries about raking over the past.</P>
      <P>In relation to the issues before us, this legislation arises directly from abuse in the past by at least one Minister for Justice, if not more, of the procedures that existed for the tapping of telephone calls. Telephone calls and letters are private and should remain private.  Telephone conversations should not be eavesdropped or mail opened by people other than by those for whom they were intended.  I accept that there are exceptional circumstances relating to the investigation of crime and to the battle against subversion where it is necessary for the State to intercept telephone calls or mail. I accept that this legislation is intended to establish the procedures for doing that on a statutory basis and that we also have to build into that legislation safeguards from the point of view of the general public and the individual citizen to ensure that there is not abuse in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I referred to the past it was to demonstrate that there is evidence that there was abuse in the past.  My concern is to ensure that that abuse would be discontinued in the future.  One of the ways to prevent abuse is by giving the public information.  I am seeking in my amendment to give the public information about the extent of the use of the exceptional powers provided in this legislation so that the public have some idea of the extent to which telephone tapping or the interception of mail is being used.  I do not want access to that kind of information to be continuously on the basis of a report of an illegally tapped conversation between Members of this House, in which they refer to the use <Col N="47" /> of telephone tapping in the past or to the leaking of documents which former Ministers for Justice may have taken out of the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Minister of State did not use the opportunity to respond to the concern I expressed about the report that a former Minister for Justice took documents out of the Department and that those documents may have contained transcripts of taped conversations which arose from telephone taps irrespective of whether those telephone taps were justified or part of the abuse that has given rise to this legislation. I regret that the Minister has not responded to that and, quite clearly, I will have to pursue it in some other way because there is an issue of public concern that information available to a Minister for Justice by virtue of his position and available to him on a confidential basis in his official capacity should remain in his possession.  That gives rise to a nightmare scenario.  In the public interest that aspect needs to be addressed.  I regret that the Minister of State has not taken the opportunity to do so here today.  I hope that at some future stage either he or the Minister for Justice will deal with this matter.</P>
    <P>I have no alternative but to press my amendment which I argued for on Committee Stage and again today.  To argue, as the Minister of State has done, that by putting a requirement into the legislation that the statistical information would be published, would be seen as limiting the information that might be made available publicly is disingenuous, particularly when on the last occasion he argued that, to combat crime, there might be a case for not releasing that information.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that this matter should be left to the discretion of the High Court judge reviewing the legislation.  It is a <Col N="48" /> matter for this House.  It is a matter for the Legislature to decide the type of information that should be made available publicly.  That is all my amendment seeks to do.  We should decide the type of information which should be made available publicly.  It is placing an unreasonable demand on the High Court judge who will be reviewing the operation of the Act to say that it is up to him to decide what information should be made available, when the Minister is not prepared to accept what information should be made available, when he is suggesting that the House should duck that issue and should not make a decision on the extent of the information that should be made available.  What is sought in my amendment is minimal.  Indeed, the Minister in arguing his point drew attention to the fact that all I am seeking is minimal information.  It is important for public information and public confidence that we do not have a situation in the future where a Minister for Justice could become so arrogant in office as to believe he has the right to engage in the excessive tapping of telephone calls.</P>
    <P>We have had much abuse of power in this country and it was an abuse of power which gave rise to this legislation in the first instance.  We must stop the abuse of power and one of the ways to do this is to let the public know what is being done in their name.  I have no problem with telephones being tapped or letters being intercepted where that is required to tackle crime or subversion.  I have said that on a number of occasions in this House.  However, safeguards must be built into the legislation that protect the public interest, the individual citizen and society in general against the kind of abuse that has taken place in the past.  I intend to press my amendment.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(1)  The Act of 1983 is hereby amended by&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the insertion of the following definitions in section 2:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;&ldquo;communication&rdquo; means a postal packet or a telecommunication message including a message reproduced by electro-magnetic radiation including fibre-optics, microwave or radio;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;interception&rdquo; means an act that consists of the opening, attempted opening or use of technology to establish the contents of a postal packet addressed to any person or the delaying or detaining of any such postal packet or the doing of anything to prevent its due delivery or the authorising, suffering or permitting of another person (who is not the person to whom the postal packet is addressed) to do so;&rsquo;, and</P>
      <P>(b) the insertion in section 84 (1) (a) after &lsquo;attempts to open&rsquo; of &lsquo;or uses any technology to establish the contents of&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I tabled a similar amendment on Committee Stage when the Minister of State said that there was no need to include a definition of &ldquo;communication&rdquo; or a wider. He felt that all the matters raised were covered.  However, I am not satisfied that that is the case.  The Minister of State was vague and stated &ldquo;I understand that these <Col N="52" /> matters are covered in the main Act of 1983&rdquo;, but that Act does not contain a definition of &ldquo;communication&rdquo;.  This is a mistake.  Neither does it contain a definition of &ldquo;telecommunication&rdquo;, if memory serves me correctly.</P>
    <P>In so far as it is possible to do so &mdash; I know that this is not an easy thing to do &mdash; we should seek to include definitions in all legislation.  Even when reference is made to a main Act, it would be no harm to repeat definitions at the beginning of new legislation.  In the first instance, this would be good practice and, second, it would help to clarify what we are talking about.  Because I did not read it in conjunction with the 1983 Act, which is quite lengthy, the Bill did not make much sense when I read it first.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to go on at great length because we had a good debate on Committee Stage.  I took the definition of &ldquo;interception&rdquo; from an amendment which was tabled by Deputies Costello and Upton, then Senators, in the Seanad, where here was a good debate on this Bill.  It was very comprehensive.  I should say that the Labour Party tabled excellent amendments and I am astonished that on the last occasion the Bill was discussed, apart from Deputy Gallagher, no other Labour Party Member bothered to contribute. He put forward amendments but they were later withdrawn.  It is strange that the Labour Party has not got involved in this debate, given that some of its Members were very much involved in the Seanad and many of the changes they advocated have not been made.  In the context of the partnership, they have not used their clout to have made to the Bill any of the changes they considered important a matter of months ago.  That is a matter for them.  However, having read their contributions and amendments, I did offer them the opportunity, by tabling their amendments, word for word, and told them I was doing so &mdash; I hope I was not infringing on any copyright laws &mdash; but I did give them the opportunity of coming in to speak on them, if not to vote for them, but they chose not to exercise that option.</P>
    <P>We have more than aired the substance <Col N="53" /> of what I am endeavouring to do here, which is to clarify exactly what we are talking about, in particular, the matter of the attempted opening.  I do not believe that is sufficient.  As I understand it, there is equipment available to scan postal packages without opening them to ascertain their contents but the provisions of this Bill do not adequately address that matter.</P>
    <P>I might add in passing &mdash; and I should like to hear the comments of the Minister of State on this &mdash; I was interested to note from the Principal Act of 1983 which I had not read before, since until now I had not had a great interest in telecommunications matters, that it is an offence to delay the delivery of a postal package, a provision which, I am sure, is not widely known to the general public. I have had the experience of letters sent to me from this House which seemed to take an enormous amount of time to reach my home.  I had a recent experience of a notification of the first meeting of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security which was posted here on a Friday but did not reach my home in Dublin until the following Tuesday.  Of course, I did not receive it until Tuesday evening, as I had left home that morning before the post arrived; yet that meeting took place on that Tuesday morning.  I wonder whether people responsible for postal delivery take Oireachtas envelopes seriously.  Do they regard them as merely unimportant circulars?  I know that letters for friends of mine living in the Dublin mountains are delivered only when the postman has a couple of letters for other houses in the area.  If, say, it arrives on a Monday, if there is no letter for anybody else in the area on that day &mdash; and I accept there are not many houses there &mdash; it might not be delivered until the following Thursday or Friday.  I am not saying that is necessarily bad, my constituents are not making a big issue of it because, as they say themselves, generally speaking they will be bills which, if delayed, is all to the good. However, if the provisions of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, were implemented, that could not <Col N="54" /> happen.  Indeed one of my colleagues, within the context of the recent general election &mdash; unfortunately, a failed candidate &mdash; is still fighting a case with the postal authorities in relation to his election address, part of which was not delivered to some of his constituents and another part delivered when the election was over.  Apparently some people took it upon themselves to decide not to bother delivering it; I do not know whether they did not like the particular individual but it is unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>Since we have such provisions in the Principal Act I should like to think they will be implemented.  This matter is more appropriate to the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Cowen, and the authorities in respect of which he is responsible, the semi-State bodies under his control, certainly I have never heard of people being prosecuted under the provisions of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, and those provisions have not been implemented for periods of the year in some regions.  If such legislative provisions exist and require letters and/or packages to be delivered in a particular order, those deliveries should be effected in accordance with the legislation; otherwise we should amend the legislation.  To a large extent perhaps it is not practicable, a word we used earlier, to have deliveries to every single home nationwide every morning.  It is expensive, which I accept; perhaps deliveries every two or three days would be acceptable.  I am not necessarily saying that it should be an offence but, if it is, laws not enforced become laws disregarded and not respected.  If we have laws certainly we should implement them and if not implemented, action should be taken against those who do not implement them.</P>

      <P>(<i>Carlow-Kilkenny</i>): I support Deputy Harney's amendment. When introducing legislation we should do so in a manner that will not lead to our being caught out later by modern technology.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the points made by Deputies Harney and Browne about future inventions, to which I shall revert in a moment.  Deputy Harney is right in saying that these amendments were tabled in the Seanad where they received fairly extensive airing and they were discussed again at some length here on Committee Stage.  Because of the persuasive arguments put forward, I undertook to make various inquiries.  Basically this legislation is authorising legislation only, relating to circumstances in which actions which would otherwise be illegal will be authorised, so that the Garda Commissioner will be able to take such action on the authorisation of the Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>The basic legislation Deputy Harney seeks to amend &mdash; and I accept it can be amended here &mdash; is the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, which is primarily a matter for the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications.  That is why I must obtain their consent and talk to them in regard to how they feel about amending their legislation.  There have been extensive discussions, not only with the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications but with An Post and Telecom Éireann.  I am glad we engaged in such discussions because I learned a few things I had not known previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two main elements to this amendment with which I will deal separately. First, there is the definition of &ldquo;communications&rdquo; which also includes a definition of &ldquo;telecommunications&rdquo;.  On Committee Stage I explained in some detail the origin and evolution of &ldquo;telecommunications&rdquo;. Much store has been put on the fact that &ldquo;telecommunications&rdquo; is not defined and owes its meaning to case law going back over many years.  The legal advice from the Department of Transport, Energy and <Col N="56" /> Communications is that this is a good argument for not defining the term, that any word whose meaning has evolved over so long a period, which has withstood all technical inventions in the telecommunications area in the course of those years, would be interfered with at our peril.  It is an adaptable word that not only has comprehended all appropriate technical advances to date but can also comprehend future technology.  That is the way it has been interpreted.  I quoted last time, I think, from <i>Halsbury's Laws of England.</i></P>
    <P>It is not merely a question of saying that the amendment is unnecessary, although it is not a basis for good legislation to accept amendments which are unnecessary but otherwise would do no harm.  In this case, any amendments which would define &ldquo;telecommunications&rdquo; to have any effect or meaning would have to be contained in the provisions of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983.  I have already explained fully that the provisions of that Act are the responsibility of the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications.  Indeed their legal people have informed me that it is not just a question of the amendment being unnecessary but that it could be positively harmful in that it could import an element of uncertainty into an area in which there is certainty at present, or as much certainty as one can reasonably expect.  As I said, &ldquo;telecommunications&rdquo; includes all modern means of telecommunications, such as mobile telephones, which nobody could have foreseen in years gone by. There is absolutely no reason to believe that it will not also comprehend future technological advances.</P>
    <P>I might make one final point on this element of the amendment.  The 1983 Act is very long with extensive Schedules but, from a cursory examination, I could find no use of the word &ldquo;communications&rdquo; in the context in which it is defined in the amendment.  For example, in section 63 (7) of the 1983 Act &ldquo;communication&rdquo; clearly is restricted to the expression &ldquo;postal packet&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I oppose the amendment to the definition <Col N="57" /> of the interception of a postal packet for different reasons, which is what I learned from having investigated the matter.  On the face of it, on Committee Stage, this appeared a good amendment. Accordingly, meetings took place with the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications and with An Post with a view to getting agreement to its acceptance.  Before giving the reason for being unable to accept this amendment I should like to explain that An Post has informed me it has no equipment which can read the contents of a postal package or a letter.  The same can be said of the Garda although that is irrelevant to this amendment because the Garda, with or without a warrant, do not have any power to intercept a postal package.  I do not know whether such equipment exists.  All I know is that neither the Garda nor An Post has ever heard of it.  An Post has a machine which, by X-raying a postal package, will show in outline whether it contains a gun or explosives; it shows in outline the contents of a packet.  In the normal way, under section 19 of the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act, 1925, An Post may detain and examine and if necessary open any postal packet, known or suspected of containing a firearm or prohibited weapon or any ammunition.</P>
    <P>However, An Post may not wish to open a particular postal packet, for example, when they have been warned by the Garda that there are letter bombs in the post.  Apart from not wishing to open every packet, it could in any case be dangerous to open them.  In those circumstances the packet will be taken aside and X-rayed, that is the use of technology to establish the contents of a postal package.  Any change to section 84 of the 1983 Act along the lines of the amendment would mean that An Post would no longer have the power to take aside a packet that it suspects may contain explosives and X-ray it.  That would be an unacceptable position for An Post and for the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications and, accordingly, I could not agree to the amendment. <Col N="58" /> The definition of &ldquo;interception&rdquo; in the amendment is unacceptable because it includes the words that I have explained are unacceptable.  In any case it is unnecessary to define &ldquo;interception&rdquo; in the 1983 Act as its meaning is covered by section 84.  The first part of the definition of interception in relation to postal packages in the Bill is simply a reiteration of section 84 (1) of the 1983 Act.</P>
    <P>To sum up, all the elements of this amendment have been thoroughly examined and, indeed, dissected and discussed in great detail between the Department of Justice, the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann.  Because the Department which is mainly responsible, the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, does not wish to have an amendment to that effect in the legislation, I regret I cannot accept the amendments.  I would be acting contrary to its wishes by using this Bill as a vehicle to make amendments in its legislation.</P>

      <P>The Minister says he is delighted he consulted widely and that he has learned a great deal, of which he would make us aware.  Without wishing to be offensive, I have not learnt anything new and I did no hear anything that I had not heard on the last occasion.  I was interested to hear the Minister say that An Post does not have any machinery or technology that can read the contents of a letter.  While it is true that it does not have it now, that is not to say that such technology will not exist tomorrow, next month or next year.</P>
      <P>Recently, when the Minister for Justice was opposing public order legislation that I proposed, she said it was a replica of British legislation which was introduced to deal with riots and since we did not have problems with riots we did not need it.  Presumably the argument was that until we have riots we do not need to introduce legislation, we will never act in advance and that we will react rather than anticipate what might or might not happen.  There seems to be a reluctance to anticipate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State gave three <Col N="59" /> reasons for not accepting the amendment. He said it was a matter for the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications and not a matter for the Department of Justice as the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications would not take too kindly to changes in its legislation.  Of course, it is not a matter for either Department; it is a matter for this House to make the law.  I understand the conflicts, the difficulties and the fine lines of demarcation that exist between Ministers and I am not trying to ignore them, but at the end of the day legislation is a matter for this House and the chances of having an opportunity in the lifetime of this Dáil to amend the Telecommunications Act, 1983, are remote.  I am not aware of any commitment in the Programme for Government to change that Act nor am I aware of any great effort on the part of any Member to have other sections of the Act changed.</P>
    <P>My amendment seeks to improve the main Act by including definitions.  These definitions may not be the ideal.  The Minister said that a definition had evolved with practice and if that is the case perhaps we should have taken the evolved definition and made it the definition. If we seek to clarify something and we have no definition, we end up with a confused situation and, perhaps, end up restricting the purpose of the legislation. That certainly would not be my wish.</P>
    <P>I do not see any break in the attitude of the Minister of State and I will therefore not delay the House.  I tabled this amendment again to give us an opportunity to discuss this issue.  It is disappointing that we do not introduce definitions of what we are talking about. There seems to be a reluctance to introduce clarity because the argument is that clarity will in some way restrict what may or may not be the consequences of legislation and will lead to confusion.  That is very poor argument.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State undertook to make inquiries about a requirement under the 1983 Act to prosecute those <Col N="60" /> who have in any way delayed the delivery of a postal package.</P>
    <P>This happens every day of the week. I did not specify any technology in my amendment as in paragraph (b).  I used the phrase &ldquo;or uses any technology&rdquo;. That allows for future developments and I cannot see how that could be restrictive. I am not restricting it to the matters referred to under the definition of &ldquo;communication&rdquo;. I suggest that any technology to intercept, or to discover the contents of a postal package should be covered by this legislation.  The fact that it will be covered because definitions and interpretations evolve is not good enough.  It is disappointing.</P>

      <P>In page 14, line 36, to delete &ldquo;subsection is&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;subsections are&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As these are the last amendments we will be discussing I take the opportunity to respond to a point raised earlier by Deputy Browne.  I have consulted with the parliamentary draftsman on the term &ldquo;record&rdquo; and he is happy that &ldquo;record&rdquo; means a record in writing.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 12 arises out of an amendment put down by Deputy Gallagher on Committee Stage.  Its purpose is to ensure that any request to Telecom Éireann from the Garda Síochána for metering information will be in writing and signed by a member not below the rank of chief superintendent.  It will also ensure that any request for such information from the Defence Forces will be in writing and signed by an officer of at least the rank of colonel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will explain briefly the background to these amendments.  Metering information is essentialy information about the use of the telecommunications services. <Col N="61" /> It can, for example, refer to the number of calls made from a particular telephone or the telephone numbers dialed.  This information has, in the past, been given on request to members of the Garda Síochána by Telecom employees for the purpose of prevention or detection of crime or in the interests of State security.  The information given to the Garda does not disclose any part of the contents of the telephone calls and, therefore, does not require a warrant. However, the decision of the European Court in the Malone case requires that requests for metering information be placed on a statutory basis and that is the purpose of section 13 (2).</P>
    <P>In theory, any member of the Garda Síochána could request a Telecom employee to disclose metering information to him without reference to a senior Garda officer in accordance with the provisions now being put on a statutory basis.  In practice, those requests are signed by a senior Garda officer of at least the rank of chief superintendent. The purpose of the amendment is to put that practice on a statutory basis.  It means that no member of the Garda Síochána below the rank of chief superintendent and no member of the Defence Forces below the rank of colonel will be able to approach a Telecom employee directly for metering information unless he has a signed authorisation as provided in the amendment.  This provides an additional safeguard by formalising the system for obtaining metering information. That is in everybody's interests particularly those of Telecom employees who provide the information and the general public who will be further assured that the system cannot be abused.  For those reasons I commend the amendment to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>We are simply changing the position of the word.  I welcome these amendments.  It is always acceptable to put existing powers on a statutory basis, thereby introducing greater clarity.  The Minister said that this measure will apply to metering information and not to the contents of calls.  I would like to know whether the Garda Síochána or the Defence Force will have to pay for this information.  In a debate that is taking place in Private Members' time the question arose whereby members of the public who request a breakdown of telephone calls made from their own house are charged for that information, and that is unacceptable.  People sending bills should be required to specify details of what the charge is made for as is the system in most countries, rather than giving a global figure.</P>
      <P>I was in London about two weeks ago and a friend showed me her telephone bill which detailed not only the number called but also the time and duration of the call.  Therefore if one made a five minute call to Dublin and was charged £10 one could query that charge.  That is a good system.  A similar system operates in the United States, although people do not have to pay for local calls within a specific region.  The telecommunications companies there give specific details of calls.  Similar details to those given on credit call bills, for example, should be given on telephone bills.  It is unacceptable that one has to pay for information relating to telephone calls and that there is no breakdown of local calls. Perhaps the Minister would comment on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the telecommunications company has information which it gives to the Garda Síochána or the Defence Force for security or crime related reasons surely it can give it to the users of their service. As I understand it, the company does not have a breakdown of local calls.  I know this matter is outside the scope of this Bill and is a matter for another Minister, but as we are talking about metering <Col N="63" /> information I am using the opportunity to see if the Minister has this information &mdash; if not, I will understand.  If such information is available it should be given to the consumer so as to ensure their bills are correct.  Most of us probably do not realise how long we spend on the telephone, and itemised bills would be welcome. This amendment is an important one.  I always support measures that put existing powers on a statutory basis.</P>

      <P>On Deputy Harney's main point about whether the Garda have to pay for this information, my information to date is that the Garda is in discussions with Telecom Éireann about this matter. My view is that the Garda should pay in the same way as do other consumers. However I do not wish to pre-empt the outcome of the discussions that are taking place.</P>
      <P>I have no official information on the matter raised by Deputy Harney of the breakdown of local calls.  I am constantly approached by constituents with complaints about telephone bills.  My information from Telecom Éireann is that it does not provide a breakdown of local calls.  I fully endorse Deputy Harney's remarks; it is my wish that the company provides such a breakdown so that people can tailor their telephone calls to take account of their financial resources.  Telecom Éireann has informed me it will introduce such a system which, as Deputy Harney said, operates in Britain.  In view of the changes recently announced by my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, it is vital that such a system be introduced as soon as possible.  I have no official information on this matter but I add my voice to that of Deputy Harney and others who are calling for a more detailed breakdown of calls.  It is important that people are told what they are paying for.</P>

      <P>In the definition of animal the Bill states: &ldquo;except in the definition of &ldquo;substance&rdquo; and section 11 (1) (e), means any animal in relation to which this Act applies by virtue of section 2&rdquo;.  Why is the phrase &ldquo;except in the definition of &ldquo;substance&rdquo; and section 11 (1) (e)&rdquo; included?  In defining substance the Bill states that substance means any matter irrespective of origin, whether such matter is of human origin, animal origin, vegetable origin, chemical origin, any other substance or any combination of the foregoing.  I do not know how animal can be defined as being any of these things.  Section 11 (1) (e), which is the greatest load of gobbledegook, states: &ldquo;in, on, under or from any land or premises or in, on or from any vehicle, there is or was any animal of any species to which an animal remedy is being or has been administered or there is or was any food derived from such an animal or any carcase of such an animal.&rdquo; That is accepted as not coming under the heading of &ldquo;animal&rdquo;.  I am not surprised as I would never suspect for one minute that it concerned the defintion of an animal.  Section 1 says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;animal&rdquo;, except in the definition of &ldquo;substance&rdquo;...means any animal in relation to which this Act applies by virtue of section 2.</P>
      <P>Section 2 (2) (a) defines animals very clearly as being a domestic animal, a wild animal in captivity, or any other wild animal; and subsection (1) lists birds, fish, reptiles, etc.  I would like to know the reason those with expertise in the draftsman's office inserted the word &ldquo;except&rdquo; in the definition of &ldquo;animal&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Deputy Browne will be aware that the phraseology used in formulating Bills is often technical from the point of their contents.  He will also be aware of the importance of having a Bill drafted in a manner which will stand the test of time in our courts and elsewhere.  When he refers to gobbledegook I do not think he meant it in the context of being critical of those who drafted the Bill.  The phraseology used in Bills has to be such as to ensure they are legally sound.  That is the background to the question raised by the Deputy.  I will endeavour to the best of my ability to sort out the confusion to which he referred.</P>
      <P>If accepted, this amendment would limit the scope of the Animal Remedies Bill to which the Act applies.  The definition of &ldquo;substance&rdquo; in the Bill uses the term &ldquo;animal&rdquo; in its unrestricted and widest sense and is in line with the European Communities definition in legislation relating to animal remedies.  The amendment, if accepted in relation to section 11 (1) (e) which empowers authorised officers to examine animals of any species, would limit their powers to examining those animals covered in the Bill.  It is possible that evidence relating to prohibited animal remedies might be obtained from examining animals other than those covered by the Bill.  Therefore I propose leaving the subsection as it stands.  It allows the maximum flexibility to cover every eventuality.  The use of the word &ldquo;substance&rdquo; in the context of the Bill is far more effective in terms of the objective we want to achieve under this provision.  It may appear confusing; nonetheless, all the advice available to me clearly indicates that the word &ldquo;substance&rdquo; covers a wider range of possibilities and eventualities.  I hope the Deputy will accept that the best legal advice available to me suggests that, from the point of view of section 1, the word &ldquo;substance&rdquo; is preferable to the word &ldquo;animal&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>(<i>Carlow-Kilkenny</i>): When I referred to gobbledegook I did not intend to be offensive to anyone who <Col N="67" /> drafted the Bill.  In this day and age of modern language it seems that nothing simple can be drafted in Bills.  We have to continue using the language Daniel O'Connell used in his parliamentary days when he was able to drive his famous coach and four through everything. Despite the Minister's efforts to explain it to me, I find it very difficult to accept the words: &ldquo;&lsquo;animal&rsquo; except in the definition of &lsquo;substance&rsquo;...&rdquo;.  I accept there may be something legal required for experiments and so on.  The Minister of State did not define how an animal could be &ldquo;in, on, under or from any land or premises...&rdquo; as contained in section 11 (1) (e).  I would ask why that section has to be excepted from the definition of an animal.  Is that a misprint?</P>

      <P>The objective of this section is to cover every possible eventuality from a legal point of view.  Therefore, the legal advice available to us in the Department is reflected in the phraseology used in the Bill.  I do not think we should get bogged down in technicalities. Arising from the contributions on Second Stage there are no divisions in this House concerning what we want to achieve.  I am sure we would all be united in putting together a form of words in legislation which would guarantee what we want to achieve.  Therefore, the explanation I am giving in relation to the formulation of the work is, from a legal point of view, what we consider to be necessary.  We have had situations where animal vaccines were challenged.  The Deputy will have to accept my explanation. The point raised is not a major factor in regard to the Bill's objective. These are technical points and perhaps have a legal bearing, but they do not in any way alter the effectiveness of what we are trying to achieve.</P>

      <P>Like my colleague, I too am concerned about this legal jargon, which is creeping more and more into legislation to cover eventualities that can never happen, and certainly would never happen in regard to section 11 (1) (e).  It <Col N="68" /> is similar to the form which issued to farmers recently for headage payments. So much irrelevant material was in that form that it prevented many people from completing it.  One had to deduct headlands, rocks, marshes, etc.  That type of language is very confusing to farmers, whose full co-operation the Minister should seek in all matters concerned with disease eradication and illegal substances. I would ask the Minister not to have the Bill couched in such language that the ordinary man on the farm cannot immediately understand what the Department or the Minister is trying to convey to them.  I would urge the Minister of State to take it back to the draftsmen and get them to break it down into a simpler form of words.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">

This debate, the explanatory memorandum &mdash; a much simpler and understandable version of what we are trying to achieve &mdash; along with the guidelines which will issue from the Department will be relied upon by farmers rather than examining the contents of this Bill. I can well imagine the difficulties which individual farmers would experience in terms of what we are trying to achieve. In relation to all legislation we have to ensure it is legally sound, otherwise we would be in the courts in days if there were loopholes in some of its specific requirements.  I fully understand the view expressed by the Deputy in relation to the form of words used, but I do not accept the point that it will be confusing to farmers.  All they want to know is what we are trying to achieve, how we propose to deal with the problem, how its provision will be implemented and what the penalties will be.  We are talking about technical and legal points which do not have a bearing from the point of view of farmers understanding it.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Deputy that at our meeting on 10 March he discussed the question of initiatives for growth, for increased economic activity throughout the world, the GATT talks, and Prime Minister Rasmussen asked me to take a message from the Danish Presidency to President Clinton on St. Patrick's Day which I did.  The Deputy will be aware that the growth initiative has finally been launched and I expect the question of high unemployment throughout Europe will be an issue for discussion at the Copenhagen Summit. In that regard the Presidency sets its own agenda, but they are in no doubt as to what the priorities are for the Copenhagen Summit.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that there are many lessons to be learned from the extreme difficulty that was experienced in getting both the Danish and French public to support the Maastricht Treaty in their referendum and that such difficulties are likely to recur in referenda in all member states unless the way in which European Treaties are drafted is changed to take them out of the hands of Intergovernmental Conferences meeting in private with no public accountability while they are at work, and to ensure that the form of European Treaties in future is more similar to federal constitutions of countries like the United States, Australia and Canada where there are clear rights for localities, for Governments and for citizens as well as for the union rather than the type of &ldquo;bureaucratise&rdquo; that tends to characterise existing European Treaties, including even the Treaty of Rome?</P>

      <P>Deputy Bruton is talking about future Treaties.  The next one we could be talking about is in 1996 which, indeed, will be under the Irish Presidency.  We will have plenty of time and experience between now and then to learn what is good and bad in the Maastricht Treaty as is presently agreed. It is never easy for 12 member states to agree on a particular type of Treaty. There is no doubt that in Denmark and in France the ordinary citizens felt there was a distance being created between themselves and the central management of the 12 member state Community. Consequently there was a large debate on subsidiarity.  Maybe many things were being done at central level that could be done better at national level.  I do not think any of us would disagree with that and maybe if that had been recognised in time a different view might have been taken at the time they were discussing the Maastricht Treaty.  We will have plenty of time to discuss it between now and 1996.</P>

      <P>With reference to the Danish Referendum and the changes the Danish Government negotiated consequent on the rejection by the Danish people the last time around, does the Taoiseach consider that it ought now be necessary to re-present the changed Treaty to the Irish people in view of the fact that the issues which the Danish Government renegotiated and got agreement on were not presented to the Irish people at the time of our Referendum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree also that with reference to the Maastricht Treaty assisting in job creation and growth, the reality, which is clear to nearly every country now, is that the monetarist basis of the Maastricht Treaty inevitably deflates our economy and all other economies and will not lead to <Col N="72" /> growth, and that talking about growth packages is so much nonsense.</P>

      <P>That is not the question the Deputy asked.  If he wants to ask a further question he is free to do so, provided the Chair allows him.  In reply to the second part of the Deputy's question, I believe that there is a strong need for all the member states to generate economic growth within the Community and within the world economy as a whole. The Japanese and everybody else must contribute to that effort and, of course, the EC must make their contribution.  I see no other way of bringing about the growth that will help us as we depend so much on outside growth, having to sell 70 per cent of our produce abroad.  Despite what the Deputy may think about the Maastricht Treaty, we have managed to have continuous growth in the Irish economy, averaging 4.5 per cent between 1987 and 1991 and from about 2.5 to 2.75 per cent in 1992.  The figure for 1993 will not fall far short of that 1992 figure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 7 and 10 together.</P>
      <P>A number of applications for extensions of time to allow Dublin County Council complete the review of its development plan have been granted since the five year period for the completion of the review expired in 1988.  The most recent extension, up to 31 December 1993, was granted by me on 14 May 1993.  The urgent need to complete the review has been conveyed on a number of occasions to Dublin County Council.</P>
      <P>The making, review and amendment of a development plan is a matter for the elected members of a local authority, having regard to the advice of its officials and having considered any objections or representations made to them with respect to the draft plan.  The making and review of a development plan, as opposed to decisions on specific material contraventions of an existing plan, should be carried out on the basis of simple majority decisions, in common with most democratic decisions.</P>
      <P>The Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963 requires development plans to be reviewed at least once in every five years.  This is a recognition that planning must cater for change and that zonings may need to be adjusted from time to time to cater for new development needs or to reflect policy variations of various kinds.  Rezoning is therefore a necessary and essential exercise but it must be carried out in an orderly way, taking full account of all relevant planning considerations, including infrastructural and other resource implications.</P>
      <P>In general, I believe that the zoning and rezoning process works quite well. Decisions on the zoning of specific areas of land are, of course, matters for the elected local council and are not subject to review or approval by me.  I am not, therefore, in a position to make any comment on specific zoning decisions, and I have never done so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="78" /> My recent remarks about the situation in County Dublin arose from a concern about the public perception of the development plan review process in the country and the resource implications.  It is, of course, quite proper and, indeed, essential, for councillors to take a view on the overall provision which should be made in particular areas for development of various kinds.  If such issues were settled by the council, on the basis of an objective appraisal of all relevant considerations, the subsidiary question of which parcels of land should be zoned for different purposes could then be resolved with less controversy.  As things stand, there is a danger that the wrong impression will be given and that the zoning process will be seen by the public as little more than a process of arbitrating on the claims of a limited number of individuals and companies who wish to develop particular lands.</P>
    <P>On the question of resources, I would draw attention to the fact that, in the case of water and sewerage schemes alone, proposals in respect of Dublin city and county costing up to £500 million are already on record in my Department. In these circumstances, it is obviously essential that decisions about the location of possible new development must take very serious account of the availability of these and other essential services, and the cost of extending them to new areas.</P>
    <P>I make no apology for drawing attention to matters such as the foregoing, arising from my general responsibility for the planning system and for infrastructural programmes.  It is, however, a matter for all of those who are directly involved in the development plan review process to decide what changes, if any, should be made in the light of my remarks which, I am sure, are now well known to all concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The review plan operates under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act.  Through familiarity we refer to the Act as the Planning Act, 1963, but it also deals with development and we are inclined to forget that aspect.  I thank the Minister for the time <Col N="79" /> he spent investigating the question and for his extensive reply.  Is he still a supporter of the new town centre concept? I ask because some of the public disquiet resulting from the reporting of Dublin County Council meetings in recent times stems from the decisions to zone and service large tracts of lands in three areas made on the advice of planners in the 1970s by the then councillors.  Thousands of public authority houses have been built with few facilities in those three areas. As a result there is no demand for private sector development there.  To protect investment the officials and the manager do not recommend further zoning in other satellite towns or village and town in County Dublin.  Will the Minister indicate his views on the new town centre concept and, with the wisdom of hindsight and the example in the UK, state whether it is a concept we should have followed?</P>

      <P>I will try but I respect the Minister's excellent answer and this is a complex subject.  Will he indicate how balance could be brought back to this issue?  It appears that councillors, responding to natural demands to allow those areas to grow in the village and town centres around the county, are frustrated by the constant recommendations of the executive of the council not to extend zoning to those areas to protect the investment decisions taken 20 years ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>One cannot turn back the clock.  The question of how the population growth in the capital city and the greater Dublin area is out of kilter with most capital cities as a percentage of the total population was in many ways caused by centralisation and the manner in which our Government systems worked, it was something we inherited.  We must now concentrate on what is in place and ensure we do not have <i>ad hoc</i> planning arrangements.  The planning and development plan is not just a councillors' plan, it is a people's plan.</P>
      <P>The 1963 Act incorporated consultative processes which have been lost because they have grown too complex. We must simplify that process so that the public can have confidence in what is happening and that the resources necessary in terms of infrastructural development are limited to what we can afford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Doyle is correct concerning areas zoned for private devlopment but <Col N="81" /> because of extensive local authority housing development, they do not have amenities and are no longer attractive. As in Gardiner Street and other inner city developments the ability to restore these areas and achieve the right mix must be encouraged.  That will only be done when we have the range of facilities, not just in terms of housing but infrastructures such as shopping centres and other amenities that may be required.</P>
    <P>I wish to concentrate on the central core areas where there is still a lot of land, much of it blighted but which we can, as demonstrated in the docks and other areas, inject with new life and resolve the environmental and transport difficulties in these peripheral developments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Minister to his speech to the Irish Planning Institute on 11 May in which he described some of the recent decisions of Dublin County Council as displaying a frightening degree of irresponsibility.  Is he familiar with the RTE radio interview a few days later by the leader of the Fianna Fáil group on Dublin County Council who stated that the Minister had apologised to her and to other members of the group for his contribution at the IPI conference? Did the Minister apologise?  Has he withdrawn &mdash; or is he considering withdrawing &mdash; any of the statement made by him to the IPI conference?  Does he stand over that statement?</P>

      <P>I have a very brief question for the Minister.  I was glad to hear his reply to my first question from which I conclude there is no question of an apology to the Fianna Fáil group on Dublin County Council.  Is he aware that some of the recent decisions by the county council are now creating a legal quagmire, including a bizarre site meeting which was held yesterday in Baldoyle on a decision which has already been made?  Dublin County Council will be replaced by three new county councils on 1 January and if legal challenges resulting from decisions by the council are not disposed of by that date or any subsequent decision which is required of the county council&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;arising from those legal challenges is not disposed of by 1 January, will the Minister accept it will put the entire development plan at risk? Has the Minister given any consideration to what might be done after 1 January?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>No political party has a monopoly on virtue in these matters.  In relation to possible legal challenges to decisions already taken by the county council it is clearly not a matter to which I can refer today.  In view of the fact that the three new councils will be established as and from 1 January next year, there is an urgent need to ensure that work on the development plan is completed before that time.  Otherwise we will be faced with further delays while the new councils complete work on the development plan.  As the House knows, the present plan is five years out of date and is desperately in need of updating.  I am extremely anxious to ensure that this work is completed well in advance of the establishment of the new councils and I <Col N="83" /> will avail of all avenues open to me to do this.  These councils can make their amendments to the plan in their own time.  I am according the highest priority to having this work completed before the establishment of the new councils.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 11 together.</P>
      <P>Projects funded from Structural Funds are already subject to a range of statutory environmental requirements, including, as appropriate, environmental impact assessment and licensing controls.</P>
      <P>A number of amendments to the Structural Funds regulations have been proposed by the EC Commission and are under consideration by the General Affairs Council.  These include proposals to require regional development plans&mdash; the National Development Plan in Ireland's case &mdash; to include an assessment of the environmental situation of the region and its expected development with regard to the strategy and operations envisaged in the plan.  It is also proposed that plans should include arrangements to associate relevant environmental authorities with the preparation and implementation of operations envisaged in the plan.  While the revised regulations have not yet been adopted, appropriate arrangements, including arrangements for monitoring having regard to these proposals, are being considered in the context of the preparation of the National Development Plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A substantial proportion of the Irish submission for Cohesion Fund assistance in 1993 relates to projects directly suportive of Community and national environment policy.  Both these and the transport projects submitted have been carefully selected with regard to the environmental and other criteria of the fund and have been subject to intensive assessment, including environmental <Col N="85" /> impact assessment, as appropriate.  I am satisfied that they will make a very positive contribution to improving and protecting the quality of our environment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask why environmental impact assessments were not made an essential requirement for projects seeking funding under the Cohesion Fund?  The recently revised regulations for the Structural Funds introduced the concept of environmental profiles.  Even if environmental impact assessments were not made a requirement for projects seeking funding under the Cohesion Fund, environmental profiles should have been made a requirement at the very least.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">

      <P>The establishment of the Cohesion Fund was a major development in the context of the environment&mdash; it is directed primarily at the protection of the environment.  With regard to the Irish submission, all the projects are individual projects, the great majority of which have already been subjected to an environmental impact assessment.</P>

The greater part of the Cohesion Fund for 1993 is devoted exclusively to meeting the requirements of the waste water directive and drinking water directive, which we have transposed into Irish law.  The House can be assured that there will be no let up in ensuring that we meet the highest possible environmental criteria and standards under that fund.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 24 and 78 together.</P>
      <P>Regulations to transpose Directive 90/313/EEC on Freedom of Access to Information on the Environment into Irish law will be made later this week.  I intend to promulgate these regulations widely, together with detailed guidance notes and a shorter information leaflet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulations, like the directive, will embody broad definitions of the kind of public authorities and environmental information to which its provisions apply. It will therefore be a matter of legal interpretation in particular cases whether a <Col N="87" /> public authority or specific information are covered by the regulations.  It will however be relevant to the position of An Bord Pleanála that the directive excludes bodies acting in a judicial or legislative capacity and also permits refusal of information in relation to matters which are or have been <i>sub judice</i>, or which are or have been under inquiry, or which are the subject of preliminary investigation proceedings.</P>
    <P>As regards the High Court judgment referred to, the regulations will be made under section 110 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992; the European Communities Act, 1972, is not involved.</P>
    <P>As regards reports of county councils acting in breach of the directive, all public authorities, including local authorities, have been requested to comply with the provisions of the directive pending the making of implementing regulations. While I have no supervisory or appellate role in relation to local authorities in this matter, I understand that the two county councils named in the report have stated that their actions comply with the provisions of the directive.</P>

I should say I accept the points in this regard made by the Minister in his reply.  We should ensure that An Bord Pleanála adhere to the principle behind the directive on access to information.  Would the Minister not agree that soon there will be no transparency in regard to An Bord Pleanála? I wish to give an example of what can happen.  I was asked to make inquiries about a decision made by An Bord Pleanála. Following my inquiries I was not in a position to give a satisfactory answer to the people who made the query in the first instance &mdash; in other words, I could not find out what had happened.

      <P>The Planning Appeals Board makes the decision on the basis of the recommendation made by the inspectorate. The directive does not give one any freedom in this regard.  Judicial and quasi-judicial functions are excluded; I do not have any discretion.  Only 7 per cent of the total planning applications are sent to An Bord Pleanála.  Ninety-three per cent of the applications are decided at local level.  If one wishes to obtain information, the decision would already have been taken by the board.  In order for information to be of benefit it should be available before decisions are taken. That system is quite transparent and one of the most open in Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no proposals to establish a single housing authority for the Dublin area.  The establishment of such an authority would be inconsistent with the restructuring of local government which is in progress in Dublin and to which the Government is committed under the Programme for a Partnership Government.  However, the need for appropriate mechanisms to ensure adequate co-ordination of housing and other services between the authorities in the Dublin area is clear.  This will be addressed in the context of the Bill, which will be brought forward later this year, to establish the new county councils and in the development of proposals for the establishment of regional authorities.</P>

Is the Minister concerned about the fact that through Dublin Corporation he is the greatest slum landlord in this country? Is the Minister satisfied that, according to the last available figures, in the region of 15 per cent of corporation dwellings do not have a bath and that about 9 per cent of corporation dwellings do not even have an inside toilet?

We are providing <Col N="90" /> considerable funding to deal with the problem outlined by the Deputy.  All the reports on the problem recommended that Dublin Corporation housing in the county be transferred to the relevant councils when the new councils are set up on 1 January next.  This has financial, organisational and other consequences for Dublin Corporation.  We must consider the best system of dealing with the problem when the Bill setting up the new councils is enacted and the regional authority for Dublin is being established.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Wexford</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 13, 39, 42, 55 and 82 together.</P>
      <P>Groundwater is a major renewable resource which already provides some 25 per cent of drinking water supplies in Ireland.  The planning of my Department's water and sanitary services programme is taking increasing account of groundwater potential and the need to protect and maintain high groundwater quality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A comprehensive statutory control regime is already in place under the Water Pollution Acts to enable local authorities to protect groundwaters from the entry of polluting matter.  Discharges of trade and sewage effluents to groundwaters are subject to licensing and there are specific controls to prevent groundwater pollution arising from the discharge of harmful substances.  Effluent discharges of List I substances, the most harmful, and any such discharges arising from disposal or tipping operations are prohibited.  Substantial powers are available <Col N="92" /> to local authorities to deal with any pollution which may arise.</P>
    <P>Septic tank pollution is a common threat to groundwaters.  Revised standard recommendations for septic tank systems, drawn up by the National Standards Authority of Ireland, were notified to all planning and sanitary authorities in 1992, with the request to have regard to these recommendations in operating planning control.</P>
    <P>As regards landfill sites, there are longstanding guidelines from my Department to local authorities on selection, management and operational aspects.  Further requirements on landfill, which are being developed at EC level, are likely to include more stringent controls on landfill practice and national waste disposal policy is being adopted in line with these prospective requirements.  The Environmental Protection Agency will have a statutory role in determining criteria and procedures for landfill site selection, management and operation, and in supervising the monitoring of sites by local authorities.  In addition, I intend that new waste legislation, currently in preparation, will provide further controls on landfill operations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree with the finding of Green 2000 that many of the landfill sites are badly located and badly managed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Wexford</i>): Local authorities are the monitoring bodies for landfill sites.  There has been a substantial reduction in the number of waste disposal sites between 1984 and 1989 &mdash; the number has decreased by 25 per cent. The Taoiseach, and the Minister for the Environment, stated in a debate that they were prepared to accept the recommendations of Green 2000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I note that the Minister did not answer the last question.  Does the Minister agree with the finding in the Green 2000 report that we do not have adequate research on either the status of our existing ground water supplies or the threats to them?  Does he agree that ground water is our most fundamental natural resource because without clean water life cannot survive?  Would he agree that in the event of nuclear fallout ground water will be the only safe water available to us because surface water will be polluted?  Would he agree, therefore, that this issue should have top priority in environmental planning and that we need a comprehensive map of ground water supplies in Ireland as quickly as possible? Would the Minister agree that circulating standards for new septic tanks to planning authorities is useless if existing tanks are polluting ground water, and that something should be done about existing septic tanks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Wexford</i>): I recognise the importance of ground water supplies. Under the 1977 and 1990 Acts local authorities have responsibility to protect ground water from pollution.  Information on the quality of ground water is being gathered by local authorities as part of the regime being put in place to implement an EC directive concerning the protection of water.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Wexford</i>): There have been a number of advances by the Government.  The Environmental Protection <Col N="94" /> Agency, which has been established, will have responsibility in that area.  A circular on new standards and better planning for septic tanks has been sent to local authorities and they have set about implementing the standards laid down.  I accept that in the past septic tanks caused problems.  I hope that, because of the standards laid down by the Department in conjunction with the local authorities, there will be a vast improvement in that area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>It is regrettable that Ministers are so programmed in relation to alternative responses that they cannot even react to direct questions.  Will the Minister of State agree, in relation to the EC Directives dealing with ground water supplies which were introduced in 1988, that many group water schemes which came into existence in the sixties are unsatisfactory in terms of the criteria laid down and that this will have implications for milk producers having regard to the new milk hygiene regulations?  Will the Minister of State reassure organisations responsible for group water schemes, who have submitted requests for finance to carry out improvements, that it will be made available to meet present day criteria?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of the Environment has always given priority to the need to eliminate pollution in any area where there is a difficulty with a ground water supply.  Will the Minister of State give an undertaking that when local authorities put forward proposals in an effort to eliminate pollution where there is a clear problem with a ground water supply they will be given priority in respect of funding in 1993-94 and subsequent years?</P>

      <P>In relation to infill sites will the Minister of State accept that in far too many cases in the past, in terms of location, maintenance and management of such sites, at best local authorities were careless and indifferent?  Will he further accept that very often the gamekeeper is also the poacher?  With the advent of the Environmental Protection Agency will the Minister of State spell out clearly its role in achieving higher standards?  That is the key question&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Wexford</i>): I accept that in the past landfill sites were not managed in the way they should have been.  I hope, however, that in future, with the aid of the Cohesion Fund, we will have state of the art landfill sites.  There is such a site in Athlone while two applications have been received from local authorities for <Col N="96" /> funding from the Cohesion Fund.  I expect major improvements in that area in future.  The Environmental Protection Agency will have a statutory role in determining the criteria and procedures for landfill site selection and will supervise the way in which such sites are monitored by local authorities in future.  This should lead to major improvements.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the development projects being undertaken in the Temple Bar Area are being carried out by the private sector.  These projects may avail of the special taxation incentives and rates remissions which apply in the area. Temple Bar Properties Limited, the development company established under the Temple Bar Area Renewal and Development Act, 1991, has drawn up a development programme for its properties in the Temple Bar area providing for cultural, residential, leisure and small <Col N="99" /> business uses involving expenditure of £100 million.</P>
    <P>It is intended that cultural projects will be put forward for assistance from the next tranche of Structural Funds; the current tranche is already partly funding some of these projects.  Exchequer counterpart funding for the cultural projects which are approved for EC funding will be provided through my Department's Vote.</P>
    <P>The commercial and semi-commercial projects in Temple Bar Properties' development programme will be expected to be self-remunerating.  These projects will be funded by loans from the European Investment Bank and the Bank of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Phase I of a programme of infrastructural investments in streets etc., which is nearing completion, has been funded from a combination of EC sources, Dublin Corporation and other local contributions.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 51, 84 and 85 together.</P>
      <P>The Programme for a Partnership Government accepts in principle that there should be constitutional change to give voting rights to emigrants and indicates that this issue will be further examined. As the Minister responsible for electoral law, the matter is one for attention by me, in the first instance.  I intend to conduct a comprehensive examination of the issue and to make proposals to the Government in the normal way.  No specific deadline has been set at this stage.</P>
      <P>In accordance with normal practice, it is not proposed to publish papers submitted to the previous Government in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister state if we are being repetitive in having another study conducted for the Government on the question of voting rights for emigrants given that one was conducted for the previous Government?  Will the Minister inform the House what conclusions were reached in that study?  I remind the Minister that the issue of voting rights for emigrants was formally raised first by way of a Private Members' Bill in this House introduced by one of the partners in Government.  Will he avail of the opportunity provided by the European elections next year to hold the referendum referred to in the Programme for Government?  Will he avail of the opportunity in the election Bill he promised to introduce to permit some voting entitlement for our emigrants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a fairly significant difference between this Government's approach to this matter and that of the last Government who left some <Col N="101" /> difficulties unresolved.  I am restricted in what I can say because of other decisions over which I have no control and which involve Government confidentiality. However, it is well known that the recommendation of the Attorney General, under Article 16 of the Constitution, was that there were very strict limits on the use of that Article for extending voting rights to emigrants, that it would be confined to people who were temporarily resident in another country and has retained their domicile here.  There was much public debate and difference about its interpretation.  The Government has accepted that there would be a need for constitutional change, which was not accepted or agreed by the Government on the last occasion.  Bearing in mind all the ramifications involved, it would be impossible to take all factors into account in the electoral Bill being drafted.  We would have to be fair to the resident and emigrant population and take into consideration the question of taxation. Other issues would have to be resolved such as the option of Seanad representation which was put forward by the Fine Gael Party.  Clearly these options are not for immediate implementation in the electoral Bill I am preparing.  It is not my intention to include such a proposal in this Bill.  It will take longer but it will be concluded within the lifetime of this Government.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Durkan for putting his finger on one of the problems involved.  Clearly, any decision on numbers would be based on the length of time a citizen might have been absent from the country, when he or she might have emigrated and whether <Col N="102" /> the facility, if granted, should be extened to people who had left the country for, say, five or ten years.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fine Gael Party is in favour of representation in the Seanad. In relation to votes for emigrants, has any consideration been given &mdash; we had the example in another part of the island today &mdash; to the misuse of proxy and postal voting, in an effort to subvert democracy? Will the Minister examine what is happening north of the Border today and consider the fact that friends of some of the people who are subverting democracy in other parts of the world have a certain influence and would be involved in this type of activity on a significant scale? Certainly, if they were entitled to elect Members to this House in such circumstances, the balance of power here could be affected?  We are, in principle, in favour of votes for emigrants but will the Minister examine this and ascertain whether any method can be devised to prevent this type of malpractice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There is the principle of whether one could or should introduce votes for emigrants while being fair to both the resident and emigrant populations. That question can be decided only by the people in a referendum.  The points the Deputy raised are legitimate. There is no question but that problems would be posed by proxy voting and its supervision even if we used an embassy. Here there is a good chance of somebody knowing those casting a vote but there would not be the same opportunity if one applied this in the way that might be expected.  In fairness to Members who have raised questions, I should say it is clear that any mad rush towards electoral reform this year, or to do something without taking all the implications into <Col N="103" /> account, would not be in the national interest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

Is he aware that Irish citizens resident in France and Italy have no vote in either European or local elections? Would he agree that representations should be made to put that right?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to give Deputy Bruton a hard and fast answer on this.  Having examined fairly extensively the different systems and excluding for a moment the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty, its subsequent ratification and its possible application in different countries &mdash; there is a very wide variation between what is happening in European countries in regard to the question of franchise for emigrants and/or people living in those countries.  First, there is a need to generate more realistic thinking because, in certain cases, it is quite generous but, in others, is so limited as to be in name only.  Whatever we do we should devote considerable thought to it and get it right in the end.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 22 together.</P>
      <P>It has been the intention at all stages that a central hazardous waste incinerator would be provided by a private sector operator who would be responsible for selecting the location subject to the necessary planning and other permissions. A facility would have to be regulated according to the highest environmental standards, particularly having regard to the draft EC Directive on incineration of hazardous wastes. Public safety and environmental factors would arise for assessment as part of the EIA process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department recently developed a number of initiatives to assist industrial <Col N="106" /> waste prevention and reduction.  These include a study of clean technologies commisioned from international consultants and the establishment of an information centre for industry. However, it is widely recognised that waste prevention measures of this kind can only make a partial contribution to the management of hazardous wastes.</P>
    <P>Organo-halogens do not represent 60 per cent, but on current estimates some 16 per cent, of hazardous waste streams arising for incineration in Ireland.  While control measures at EC level and under the action plan of the Oslo and Paris Commissions will reduce the production and use of certain organo-halogens, these measures will not decisively affect Irish hazardous waste quantities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Two questions arise from the Minister's reply.  The previous Government sought submissions from those wishing to establish a toxic waste incinerator and had narrowed the field down to five.  Are those five submissions still live or is it the Minister's intention to invite new submissions?  Will he also indicate what sites are being considered by his Department for the location of a toxic waste incinerator?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;by new interests who are examining how a sophisticated and safe method of disposal of hazardous wastes might be effected.  Clearly the question of the location of possible sites will be a matter for the private sector operator and I have no information, official or unofficial, on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that a number of ancient, overloaded and inefficient incinerators are emitting toxic and dangerous fumes?  Will he further agree that the absence of a national waste policy and a decision on a centralised site <Col N="107" /> is seriously hindering the development of our chemical and pharmaceutical industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The need for an early decision on the incineration of hazardous waste is essential.  This was referred to and endorsed in the Culliton report which, at certain times, is the bible of different parties in this House.  In the National Development Plan it was decided that the Government would address this question and provision has been made for grant aiding that facility.</P>
      <P>I accept there are incineration facilities, in particular clinical incinerators, which require drastic change.  The facilities in the major chemical and pharmaceutical industries meet the most rigorous conditions but my fear is that the waste from incinerators in smaller establishments, colleges, science laboratories in secondary schools and garages gets into the water without the people concerned knowing about it.  I want to address that problem.  I have publicly questioned our policy on waste and where we might find a solution to the problem of waste disposal.  We cannot in the foreseeable future depend on getting derogations to continue to export the problem to other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister quantify the feedback for such an incinerator in the year 2000?  Does that amount justify the construction of a national facility?  I accept the principle that each country should look after the disposal of its own toxic waste but the smaller countries may not need individual incinerators, given that we could deal with the problem on a Community basis.  With the introduction of clean technology and ECO audits will we have sufficient toxic waste to justify the construction of such a facility in Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Certain halogenated materials, including CFCs and halons and methyl chloroform will be eliminated when the new Directive which phases out their use in stages in the years 1994-96 will <Col N="108" /> reduce toxic waste in the Community, but by a very small percentage.  It is estimated that this accounts for approximately 2 per cent of waste that can be incinerated which will make a very small difference.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that there is about 60,000 tonnes of toxic waste each year.  I have looked at the situation in the Netherlands and Denmark, countries with a very high environmental profile, and tonnage of this volume is sufficent to make the provision of a toxic waste incinerator an economic development.  I have a problem with unidentified toxic waste but the real problem is that society does not recognise its extent or whereabouts.</P>
      <P>I have referred to a number of establishments which generate toxic waste, they are small elements of the problem. Deputy Bruton referred earlier to contamination of the drinking water systems and the leachate from landfill sites is one of the causes.  At present waste product which may be toxic is disposed of in landfill sites without the knowledge of the local authority or the monitoring authorities because if there is a breakdown in the industry the waste which may be toxic is disposed of in a landfill site, which is unsuitable.  I want to bring this problem into the public domain.  There is no such thing as a risk free environment.  If we continue our present procedures I want to reduce the risks to the greatest possible extent.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the support from the political parties, apart from the Government parties, in trying to sort out this problem in a way compatible with the development of our industry and which does not cut across our efforts to introduce clean technology or for recycling or reusing materials.  The Netherlands which has made great efforts in recycling or reusing materials, admits it can reduce the waste by about 5 per cent with the potential to reduce it to 10 per cent by the year 2000, that gives an indication of the extent of the waste that still remains to be dealt with and that is what we are trying to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms. Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to be brief but <Col N="109" /> a great many questions arise from the Minister's reply.  The Minister knows my position on the toxic waste incinerator. Are we talking of providing a toxic waste incinerator before we introduce the waste disposal Bill and the mandatory auditing of waste?  It is amazing that we are going down the path of developing the concept of incinerating toxic waste as a long term solution to the problem of such waste when we should take the long term view.  The Minister referred earlier to the derogation but how long will this derogation apply?  Is pressure being applied in relation to it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is incomprehensible that people who are genuinely interested in the environment are quite prepared to transport, on land or sea, toxic waste matter to another country which has a facility they accept is good enough to deal with the waste there but not good enough to deal with it in Ireland.  I find it difficult to justify travelling very long distances to resolve a problem in that way.  Second, I cannot accept that because we are preparing a waste Bill, which I hope will be before the Dáil in the autumn &mdash; we are prevented from discussing in the open how we deal with this problem.  I have indicated on a number of occasions its four distinct parameters: first, we advance clean technology, change processes, reduce, minimise and eliminate the problem wherever we can; second, reuse and recycle wherever we can; third, phase out the clinical waste and the problems of 150 units in hospitals around the country.  We are facilitating that directive and trying to ensure it is workable and that it operates at the highest standards possible.  Fourth, on the question of incineration and generation of energy from the combustion of waste, all technological advances in this area must be used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, on the question of landfill, where will sites be obtained and can we expect to deposit a continuous volume of waste into landfill?  Does the policy relate totally to landfill?  A sum of £52 million is spent on waste management at present, There is a great need to ensure that there <Col N="110" /> are fewer landfill sites and that consumers, wholesalers and people in local towns reduce the volume of waste and effort to clean up areas.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of a problem, particularly in the northern part of my constituency, in regard to the monitoring of possible threats of hazardous waste which is in storage at a particular site pending exportation?  Is he satisfied that local authorities have adequate technical resources to monitor this waste and also to monitor transportation of hazardous waste?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There will never be sufficient technical resources to deal with this problem while waste management is not sufficiently updated and is haphazard, as is the case at present.  I do not think Deputy Bruton is asking me to afford technical facilities to monitor a problem which should be solved.  A different approach needs to be taken. Perhaps there is sufficient technical advice and services available for waste management and with the changes I propose this problem can be solved.</P>

      <P>In my earlier response I indicated that while I appreciate the sentiments expressed, I cannot accept the amendment on the basis that it would very much limit the scope of the Bill.  In addition, the definition is very much in line with the EC definition in regulations. It is possible that the wording proposed could relate to an animal from which a substance might be derived and for which a wider definition would be required.  The section provides the widest possible basis for the application of regulations and what we hope to achieve.  It covers a wider range of animal life than is the case in the provisions which have been <Col N="163" /> outlined.  Therefore it is in everybody's interest to leave the wording as it stands in the Bill.</P>

      <P>In page, 6, subsection (2), line 32, to delete &ldquo;seven&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;nine&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is intended to increase the number of members on the consultative committee from seven to nine and is in line with the spirit of the debate in the House on Second Stage.  On that occasion I indicated to Deputy McManus and others that I would endeavour within the framework of the Bill to accommodate their individual points of view. By increasing the number of members on the consultative committee from seven to nine we are making provision for the level of representation identified in the House on Second Stage.  It would be my intention to give representation to the organisations referred to on the last occasion and also to consumer representatives and the food processing sector.  It is important that this committee be as broadly based as possible and that it contains the widest range of technical advice, information and expertise which could be made available <Col N="164" /> to the Minister.  I am satisfied that by extending the membership from seven to nine I will be able to accommodate all the views expressed by Deputies on the last occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome the Minister's amendment which will enable the committee membership to be increased from seven to nine.  I would urge the Minister to accept amendment No. 4 in which we have named the groups which will provide a representative on the committee. The reason for this is simple.  We all want this Bill to work; that has been said time and again by various Deputies on Second Stage.  If it is to work we must have the goodwill of the major players concerned &mdash; the farmers, the vets and the meat industry.  If totally independent people are to be nominated by these organisations, it is important that the organisations be named and that they be asked by the Minister to nominate representatives.  We felt very strongly about this request.  This procedure has been very successful with other boards and other committees.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister therefore to reconsider the position and ensure that the Irish Farmers' Association, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers' Association, the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries, the veterinary profession and the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, as well as people from the meat industry, be specifically named in the Bill.  If we are to get that goodwill it is important that those organisations nominate their representatives to the committee.  I am not suggesting that the Minister of State would appoint people who would not be suitable, but some other Minister might appoint his own people who might not necessarily be the best representatives of the sectors concerned.  I would ask the Minister of State to reconsider the position and to accept amendment No. 4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's approach in relation to these amendments.  It is important that the consultative committee be properly structured. In the past there have been <Col N="165" /> undesirable methods of recruitment by Ministers to State boards, which was inappropriate in view of how modern Ireland operates.  The idea of having a committee that actually reflects the larger community of interests is an important principle to establish.  I welcome the Minister's approach, but if he is simply expanding the committee from seven to nine he is leaving it open for some future Minister to adopt a different approach. While he has the right approach, there is no guarantee that some future Minister may not go back to the bad old ways.  We must go ahead with the amendment.  I support amendment No. 4, which includes my amendment No. 3 but expands the whole principle of who should be represented on the committee. The two amendments can be combined quite easily.  One point must be made concerning the relationship not only between agriculture and the consumer but between the chemical industry, the pharmaceutical industry and the consumer. It is this.  Chemicals and pharmaceuticals have had much bad press, some of which has been justified, because of the abuse, the overuse and the inappropriate use of drugs, but sometimes because people are ignorant about the use of these drugs.  It is important to avail of the opportunity to inform the public, through the Consumers Association, of the benefits as well as the abuses, because we are inclined to take for granted many of the very sound benefits of the drug industry.  People are always inclined to think of the worst when examining the whole area of antibiotics, vaccines or whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an unfortunate tendency to underestimate the consumer, the intelligence and the awareness of people, and to presume they would not understand when dealing with technical matters.  One thing I have learned as a public representative is that one should never underestimate the depth and breadth of people's knowledge nowadays, because everybody has been educated by television, secondary school and so on. People are interested in the larger questions about the food industry, agriculture <Col N="166" /> etc.  It would be beneficial to include in the Bill that this principle has been conceded by the Minister of State so that there is a recognition by the Department that the consumer will be a pivotal factor in the future development of agriculture and particularly of the food industry.  I would ask the Minister of State to consider the amendment in relation to the initial principle of expanding the consultative committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is adopting a sensible approach in relation to increasing the number of people who can be appointed to the committee from seven to nine.  I am not sure whether it is a good idea to have people representing named organisations, with perhaps the exception of the Consumers Association.</P>
      <P>In regard to farmers' representation on the committee, we have to bear in mind that the extent to which angel dust has been abused in Ireland is of the order of 50 per cent of all animals going to slaughter.  On the basis of the law of averages it is likely therefore that many members of the farming organisations would themselves have been guilty of abuse.  I suspect that some of those people may be in a position to make representations through their association to the person who would be the representative of that association on the consultative committee, and that in turn may not be in the best interests of what is good for the country.  I would have a certain amount of concern about that, because this committee embodies one of the wonderful Irish paradoxes where everybody who speaks in public is totally opposed to the abuse of these drugs and yet they are abused to a great extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to nominating various interest groups, and presumably this Bill will remain on the Statute Book for a long time, some of the organisations mentioned in amendment No. 4 will probably have less significance than they now hold, whereas there will probably be other groups who will gain much more significance as time goes by.  The Minister may be tying his hands if he agrees to people who are nominated by the various <Col N="167" /> organisations.  I feel strongly that the Consumers Association should be represented on this committee because in Ireland we do not give sufficient attention to matters which concern consumers and, ultimately, the consumer is right.  That is the reality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Bill goes through in its present form the Minister, and future Ministers, can nominate whoever they like.  It is our duty to legislate and we have only one opportunity to do so.  The amendment is, therefore, reasonable. I have no objection to any named body being inserted or even to the Minister of the day being allowed to nominate a certain limited number.  It is extraordinary to hear a Labour Deputy advocating giving the Minister nominating rights in respect of boards, committees or State boards because the party he represents holds the opposite view which was trenchantly expressed here on several occasions.</P>
      <P>Deputy Upton's assertion that up to 50 per cent of cattle sent for slaughter are affected by angel dust should not go unchallenged because it is damaging the beef industry, the consumer and everybody else concerned with the elimination of the use of this banned drug.  We must all work towards eliminating abuse and we must be vigilant.  That is why the amendment was put down.  The farming organisations should also be vigilant and specific responsibility for this matter should lie with them.  That is why the amendment proposes that these organisations should be nominated with others. We, as legislators, should have the say as to who is controlling this.  They should be people with an interest in this area and a commitment to solving the problem.  It is in the interests of everybody, all the associations named here, cattle producers and consumers to eliminate abuses of drugs.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow Kilkenny):</i> I support this amendment and I oppose what Deputy Upton said.  Let me first deal with the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="168" /> There should not be a question mark over anyone's appointment.  I do not know why any Minister would want to reserve the right to nominate somebody off his own bat when the IFA and the ICMSA have the expertise and can submit a nomination to the Minister.  I do not see why the Minister will not accept the amendment.  Why should the consumers, who may have to eat meat that they do not want, not be able to nominate their expert?   Why should the chemical groups not nominate their expert in that field?  It does not matter how much the Minister's integrity is upheld or appreciated in this House; there is a danger he might nominate a certain type of individual, who may be an expert but about whom there will always be a question in regard to his nomination.  In my own field of education I had an argument with the Minister not too long ago when a subcommittee was set up on school discipline; everybody was on it except teachers.  Why should the people dealing with what is going on not be asked to nominate their expert?</P>
    <P>In fairness to the IFA and the ICMSA, the beef industry is probably very important to them but I cannot go along with the suggestion that they might nominate somebody who would close his eyes to what might be going on.  The IFA and the ICMSA are very responsible bodies. They do not want to see any use of angel dust because it is damaging a major industry.  If this drug is abused we will find ourselves unable to sell our beef because nobody will want to buy from us.  I am confident that the IFA will do everything possible to stamp out the abuse of angel dust.  Some farmers abuse this drug, TDs do things they are not supposed to do and we do not comdemn every TD in the House.  Every profession has its black sheep and someone always wants to make a quick buck, but responsible farming organisations would never condone the abuse of angel dust.  For that reason I would have the utmost confidence in their nominees.  The Minister should accept this amendment for his own sake.  Allowing the Minister to nominate people puts him under pressure and <Col N="169" /> open to unkind comments as to whom he nominates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the extension of this committee as outlined by the Minister. Most of the comments on the Bill so far have been about the abuse of substances like clenbuterol and hormones and how those abuses will be penalised. The other aspects of the Animal Remedies Bill have not been highlighted, for example, the advances in the remedies, the therapeutic agents such as antibiotics, anti-fungal agents, anti-inflammatory drugs, anti-helminhics and the new development of vaccines.  Perhaps a preamble to some sections might advise on the proper use of these excellent substances that have come on the market and how they should be used properly by farmers, taking into consideration advice from the veterinary profession, the farming community, the Department of Agriculture and maybe the Department of the Marine.</P>
      <P>Much misuse arises from a lack of knowledge of these substances and how to use them properly.  People believe that a very strong antibiotic or like substance will be a cure-all when what is needed in many situations is good animal husbandry and may be the correction of an electrolyte imbalance.  There are fine pharmaceutical companies throughout this country and we should duly recognise the part they played in producing some of those substances which are of great importance to the farming community when used properly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>On Second Stage I mentioned this point and I hope the Minister would come forward with an amendment to meet the principle enshrined in the case I was making in regard to appointments of this kind.  I regret the Minister has not taken up my suggestion.  In my contribution on Second Stage I referred to other legislation which passed through the house establishing new bodies, boards and consultative authorities.  The method of appointing people to such organisations has changed in recent years. That reflects a certain maturity on the <Col N="170" /> part of the Members of this House, and particularly Governments of the day in not continuing the old practice that the only people who act on those boards are people whom the Minister personally selects. That is not a good practice.  As we are anxious to ensure that this body acts with the utmost independence in giving advice, it is essential the Minister concedes that the best way he can keep the consultative committee at arm's length from direct political appointment is by asking reputable organisations with a knowledge and experience in this area to forward nominees to him for appointment to the board.</P>
      <P>The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland was established when I was Minister for Energy and at that time I accepted an amendment similar to this. In fact, I went further than the then Opposition spokespersons proposed and ensured as far as possible that appointees to the board would be independent of the Minister and the Department and would be nominees of outside responsible and professional bodies.  The joint amendment tabled here by Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats seeks similar representation on this committee.  I did not expect the Minister would oppose this amendment.  I regret I was a few minutes late arriving here as the debate started earlier than I anticipated.  I understand the Minister stated he is meeting the point by increasing the membership from seven to nine.  That is not a logical argument and does not stand up.  I will be disappointed if that is the Minister's final word on this matter.  I ask him to either accept the amendment today or introduce a more refined one on Report Stage. Nevertheless, I expect an assurance from him that he will examine the matter seriously; otherwise my party will be pressing this to a vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle for this has been enshrined in the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland and in the Act establishing the reconstituted An Bord Pleanála where outside bodies are represented.  It is a retrograde step to believe that only the Minister of the day would have the power to select such <Col N="171" /> people.  Both the Minister and I know the temptation on a person in the Minister's position to appoint people for reasons other than their professional skills and, generally speaking, those persons are well known to the Minister.  The judgement of such people could be questionable in the future.  We are dealing with a matter of great importance here because our beef industry is our major industry and the quality of that product is an essential factor in its success in the marketplace and for the livelihood of our farmers and many other workers.  Our economy depends on the beef industry.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for introducing this Bill and, as he is aware from Second Stage, Members fully support the principle enshrined in it.  We have been crying out for a Bill such as this.  Nevertheless, some of its provisions need to be altered and this is one of them.  I hope I have made my point to the Minister and that we will get a reasoned response from him.  I do not believe the Minister of State, Deputy Hyland, is of the old mould.  He is a fair minded man and I am sure he will see my point.  It has been recognised in previous legislation.  The fact that this House came to the mature decision of allowing outside reputable bodies to make nominees to such boards has been applauded and has worked well. It would not matter then who was in Government as there would be consistency in the quality of advice being made available.  I am not questioning the ability of any professional person who might be asked by the Minister to act in a consultative capacity on this body or stating that his or her advice might or might not be 100 per cent correct. However, the Minister must accept that, in order to remove any shadow of doubt, in all circumstances nominations should be left to the professional bodies.  Such bodies are reputable, the Minister and his Department deal with them on a regular basis and there would be no question of them nominating an unsuitable person. Will the Minister respond to the points made and indicate a change of heart?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated to Deputies that, arising from their contributions on Second Stage, I would carefully note the points raised, including those raised by Deputy Molloy.  I take on board the spirit of the suggestions being made on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>We are talking about a consultative committee.  A consultative committee exists at present and is operating efficiently.  In response to Deputies' requests I agreed to broaden the scope of that committee and to increase its representation from seven to nine.  Deputies can be assured that I will have consultations with the various farming organisations, the chemical industry, the veterinary people and so on, in relation to their nominations and recommendations for appointments to the board.  I assure the House that it is not my intention to become involved in the personal selection of people who will represent the various sectors of the industry on this important consultative committee.  I accept the spirit in which Deputy Molloy made his point.  I am not so foolish as to think one could set up a consultative committee and ignore the established farming interests here.  That will not be the case.  I am not so foolish either to think that in a matter as important as this one could ignore the interests of consumers. I take Deputy McManus's point and I will have consultations with consumer organisations in regard to representation on the board.</P>
      <P>However, organisations and structures can change and groups can emerge with a genuine desire of representing a particular interest in regard to this legislation. At the end of the day Deputies must rely on me to accept their case and they must accept also my commitment to ensure that the interests identified by Deputies will be represented.  There will be that level of consultation to which I referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take on board Deputy McManus's point in relation to consumer interests.  It has been painfully brought home to us at present, that at the end of the day the consumer is the person who decides <Col N="173" /> whether there will be a market for Irish agricultural produce.  At every level we must take steps to ensure that food production is of the highest quality and that it is carefully controlled and monitored. Only when the consumer is satisfied that the agricultural industry is producing quality products will there be a level of commitment to purchase the products of Irish farmers.  Despite bad publicity in respect of some sections of the meat industry during the past few months, by and large the produce of Irish agriculture in the meat area is <i>par excellence</i> and from the consumer point of view the quality of our products is at a very high level.</P>
    <P>I am sure I have the support of the House in relation to this Bill.  We must tighten up every loophole, though it will not be easy, in respect of the importation of illegal substances associated with growth promotion and so on.  We must deal with the source and the people associated with the importation of those substances and ensure that farmers, the producers of our food, fully understand that to use any form of artificial growth promoters, which are available on a limited scale at present, will undermine the industry and in the long term adversely affect farmers' incomes.</P>
    <P>Apart from the consultative committee it is proposed to set up as a result of this legislation, I propose to have consultations with the various farm organisations, the food industry, the veterinary profession and so forth in an effort to tighten up this obnoxious practice.  We must obtain the co-operation of all sectors in respect of the implementation of this Bill.  The House will agree this Bill when enacted will not be worth the paper on which it is written unless there is a concerted effort to root out the people associated with the importation of those substances.  I will leave no stone unturned in order to ensure that the wide-ranging provisions of this Bill will be implemented in the interests of Irish agriculture and individual farmers in respect of protecting their incomes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>We are making some progress, but I would like further clarification <Col N="174" /> from the Minister on some matters. Will the Minister allow those organisations to put forward nominations to him and will he then select the consultative committee from those nominated? How many organisations will be permitted to make nominations to the Minister and what process will take place when the Minister has received those nominations?  Will the Minister confine his nominations to the consultative committee from those put forward by the farming organisations?  Will the farming organisations and other organisations be listed in the amendment to which he is referring?</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister clarified that the meat produced here is <i>par excellence</i> because any other impression given in this debate would be false and it would not be correct to allow that happen.  We have an ideal opportunity here.  We are unique in Europe and in the world in that we can promote naturally produced beef and naturally produced food.  The fact that we have natural grass produced beef should be a great selling factor on the European and world markets.  Anyone who interferes with that cycle of beef production by the use of growth promoters will damage the good name of Irish beef on the European market. Farming organisations are preaching the message that we can greatly enhance the marketability of our produce abroad by being the only country not using any unnatural growth promoting substances and producing beef from natural sources only.  I understand the Minister is accepting the amendment tabled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated that I have some difficulty in relation to outlining the organisations that may be involved because structures may change. However, we will have consultations with the organisations which have been identified. I will ask the organisations to put forward their nominees to the committee and there should not be any great difficulty in that regard.  On Report Stage I will come back with an amendment which will take on board the points made here today once I have considered the structures <Col N="175" /> entitled to representation.  I am somewhat disappointed that Deputies would suggest that I would not consider the existing established representative organisations.  That is not the case.  The reason I do not fully support the amendment is that I want to be sure that representations are not excluded from the consultative committee.  I ask the Deputies on the opposite side that, instead of calling a vote on this amendment, they would accept that I will come back on Report Stage and table an amendment indicating that the committee will be appointed following consultation with bodies which will be named at that stage.  I am not objecting for the sake of objecting or of not wanting to take on board amendments from the opposite side; that is not the case.  I indicated on Committee Stage that I would take on board the spirit of the recommendation and I have done that in terms of increasing the representation from seven to nine.  When I have had an opportunity to obtain a more objective examination of the organisations with which I will have consultation, I will come back on Report Stage with an appropriate amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the slight movement in his position.  The Minister has stated that he has some difficulty in regard to what organisations might be asked to put forward a nomination as proposed in the amendment tabled.  However, the Minister states that he will endeavour to bring forward an amendment on Report Stage which will name organisations with whom he will consult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important for the Minister to realise that the whole intent of the amendment from this side of the House is that those organisations, whoever they may be finally, should have the right to nominate, not that they would be &ldquo;consulted&rdquo;, which is the word the Minister used.  If the Minister is saying to the House he will examine this again and that he will come back on Report Stage with an amendment dealing with how he can <Col N="176" /> determine which organisations will have the right to nominate, I on behalf of my party will be happy to wait until Report Stage to see what the Minister has done.</P>
    <P>May I suggest to the Minister that the procedures are already in place in the existing legislation?  The device that was used in that legislation was to invite organisations wishing to have the right to nominate to indicate that to the Minister. He would then have the right to designate the seven or the nine organisations, who would then be invited to forward their nominations.  There is no difficulty from the point of view of the parliamentary draftsman in deciding how the organisations might be determined.  I accept the point that organisations change over time, but the amendment could be drafted in such a way that would accommodate that situation.  After a certain period had elapsed perhaps eight years, another invitation would be sent to those who wished to be considered for inclusion on the list of nine bodies that will have the right to nominate.  Therefore, there is no difficulty in keeping up to date with changes in the organisations.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister confirm that the amendment will devise a system whereby organisations can be determined who will have the right to nominate, not just to be consulted?  If this is the case, it would be acceptable to me.</P>

      <P>As two previous speakers have stated, I appreciate the fact that the Minister has moved somewhat from his initial stance.  As the last speaker has said, the Minister must state clearly that he intends to accept and place on the record of this House the organisations who will be eligible to nominate.  They may not necessarily be the organisations we are debating today; but the Minister has increased the number of seats and, therefore, one or two additional organisations may be accommodated.  I chaired a European beef and veal committee comprised of people concerned with beef production in Europe, including producers, consumers and butchers.  All the various sectors were involved in that <Col N="177" /> committee.  This type of structure is extremely important as far as producers are concerned.</P>
      <P>I was involved also in the Livestock Meat Board and, as Deputy Molloy said, the structures exist in that group also to indicate that the nominees can come from the relevant bodies concerned.  We are not asking the Minister to introduce a new measure; we are asking him to take on board an idea that is well and truly tried in various organisations and Government bodies.  I ask the Minister to make a commitment to name the organisations and that they would put forward their nominees to the Minister. Of course, the Minister, as in any other board, will have the right to discuss the suitability of any nominee and this should be his prerogative.</P>
      <P>To return to comments made by previous speakers, our meat and dairy industry remains the most important industry in this country, regardless of what is said about other products.  It is an Irish based industry produced in the cleanest, greenest island in the world.  Yet we have this scaremongering statement from Deputy Upton that over 50 per cent of the cattle here are treated with angel dust. That is a totally objectionable and unacceptable statement to make in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>Totally untrue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>A statement was made by a Member of this House on Second Stage of this Bill which was the only part of the debate to receive publicity. Deputies who come here and make totally untrue, unjustified statements are putting not just the livelihood of farmers in the meat industry at risk but the country in general.  That is unforgivable and I hope that when the Minister considers organisations from which nominations will be accepted such organisations will not be associated with the Labour Party. It is extremely serious for any Deputy to make that type of bland statement in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept the comments made by Deputy Moffatt on the issue of drugs in general.  The actions of the dairy industry <Col N="178" /> in regard to the testing procedures and the measures we want to see implemented under this Bill can remedy many of the problems highlighted by the Deputy by proper monitoring and involvement by the veterinary profession. We are all in favour of that. There have been tremendous efforts by farmers and farm organisations to ensure we produce the cleanest, healthiest products. That is the way we should proceed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill must work properly and that is why I return to the issue of whom the Minister will appoint.  I stated on the last day we debated this Bill in the House that the smaller or weaker producers are sometimes those who are pursued from a legal point of view and that the real criminals are not being pursued in this regard.  For that reason it is important that the Minister be above question in regard to the membership of this consultative committee.  They must be people appointed by organisations who have no political connection with any party in government at a particular time. The committee members must be representative of the producers, the industry generally and of the consumer, who is essential to all of us.  I implore the Minister to accept the principle of the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a certain amount of concentration on the beef industry and we should remember that this Bill covers a much wider brief. Indeed, reading the forecasts in relation to the development of technology, I believe we will be regarding growth promoters as very small beer in the near future.  That is one of the reasons we must ensure that when the consultative committee is established it truly reflects the larger community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned his difficulty in relation to organisations changing.  I accept that is a difficulty; but the problem we have is that Ministers change and, while this Minister is clearly committed to the principles we are discussing, there is no guarantee, unless it is written into the Bill, that a later Minister will have <Col N="179" /> the same commitment.  Therefore, it is vital that a formula be found.  I suppose we will have to take it on trust &mdash; and I hope we are not getting a pig in a poke &mdash; but can the Minister assure us that the principle will be established in his amendment that the various sectors which should be represented on this committee will be represented, whether it is the farming community, the consumers, the pharmaceutical industry or whoever? If he can establish that principle in his amendment, the specifics concerning organisations constitute merely a secondary point.  It is a very important principle and simply leaving it to the goodwill of the Minister is not establishing that principle in law.  In view of the changes in the food industry and the changes in technology, this Bill will outlast this Minister. We should acknowledge and take on board in this Bill the fears expressed about the use of angel dust, etc.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny) Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Carlow-Kilkenny</i>): I accept the Minister's point but I should like him to confirm that he will bring forward a similar amendment on Report Stage.  The Minister said he would consult the relevant groups.  However, people can consult without paying attention to what is being said.  The Minister may consult the groups and then submit his own nominations.  Alternatively, he may ask for ten names and select the one which he prefers.  The Minister is shaking his head to indicate he will not do that and I accept his bona fides in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister nominates representatives from the farming and consumer groups he will have the nucleus of a very important committee.  If he includes representatives of the veterinary and pharmaceutical professions he will be assured of having a group with core values, we all know the importance of core values.  The Minister can also nominate representatives from other groups &mdash; I am sure there are three or four more groups which would have a direct involvement.  These groups will nominate people who have the relevant experience in this area.  I would be very happy if <Col N="180" /> the Minister accepted the nominees put forward by these groups.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy McManus, I am not concerned about the changes within organisations &mdash; presidents come and go, they look after certain groups and have certain intentions.  I would be more concerned about a change of Ministers.  I will not have any worries in this regard when Deputy Crawford is Minister.  There is a danger that a Minister may believe in giving jobs to the boys who, unfortunately, may still be boys at heart and not up to the standard expected of experts.  I hope I am right in thinking that the Minister will introduce an amendment on Report Stage giving the names of the organisations who will make the nominations.  I hope the Minister accepts these nominations and does not merely consult organisations before making his own nominations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to respond to the criticisms by the Deputies on the other side of the House about the figure of 50 per cent.  While this may have been a throw-away remark, I was not the first person to refer to this figure.  If I remember correctly, the secretary of a veterinary union first referred to this figure at a conference in Galway some years ago.  I hope I am not misquoting the man but that is my recollection.  Anyone who has any doubts about the validity of this figure has only to peruse the data on the changes in carcase composition and classification in recent years which occurred at the same time as clenbuterol became available to farmers.  Is that a cause and effect relationship or a cause and coincidence relationship?  I cannot think of any reason it should not be regarded as a cause and effect relationship. As a former Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry said, it is nonsense to think that the change in carcase composition and classification was solely a result of changes in animal breeding methods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The abuse of angel dust and other animal drugs in Ireland got very wide coverage in the international press.  I did not have any hand, act of part in this.  I <Col N="181" /> may have been quoted in some of these reports but I certainly did not initiate media interest in this issue.  One has only to look at the large quantities of these drugs which have been seized to realise the extent of the problem.</P>
    <P>There was a reference to the wonderful quality of Irish meat.  We are only fooling ourselves in this regard.  One cannot buy Irish meat in other countries.  We do not have any way of knowing whether meat sold in Sainsburys is Irish, New Zealand or from some other country.</P>

      <P>Deputy Upton is not improving the situation with his remarks. Even though he now appears to be saying that there is little substance to his earlier remarks, he is sticking to what he said. The Deputy should have the grace to withdraw his remarks in this regard.  He is now basing his assertions on reports in the media.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious that the quality of beef produced in Ireland has improved considerably in recent years due to the influx of continental breeds which have replaced the traditional Hereford, Aberdeen Angus and Friesian breeds.  To attribute this improvement to other factors such as the use of illegal drugs is misleading and very damaging to our beef industry.  The Deputy should have the grace to withdraw his remarks in this regard as they have done more damage to the Irish food industry than any abuse of growth promoters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for making their various points.  They are determined to ensure consultation with the various farming organisations about the importance of this legislation and of having the best expertise available on this committee.  I have no difficulty in regard to the core organisation referred to by the Deputies.  However, I am not clear as to the position in relation to the processing sector, with whom we should have consultations and who should be <Col N="182" /> asked to make nominations.  It is possible that the expertise required by the committee may be available outside the existing organisational structures.  Obviously I will have to take this possibility into account in establishing an effective committee.</P>
      <P>I will put down an amendment on Report Stage which will take into account the views expressed by the Deputies and if they are not satisfied with it obviously they will have the opportunity to table their own amendment and call a vote on it.  I ask the Deputies to accept my commitment to establish a consultative committee which will be broadly based and effective.  That is my aim.  On the basis of what I have said, the Deputy might consider withdrawing the amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear although I thought I was. I thought we were moving closer but the Minister must clarify the position before we move on.  We are dealing with legislation, not with any person who happens to hold the office of Minister or Minister of State in the Department. zWhen this Bill is passed the debate that is taking place will be of no consequence. Only the terms of the legislation will have any effect.  The Minister should state clearly what he intends to do instead of saying that he intends to come back with proposals that will achieve a broadly based and effective consultative <Col N="183" /> committee; that would be better.  What the Minister is saying is not specific enough.  I want the Minister to say that he will come back with an amendment which will contain proposals under which the bodies who would have a nominating right could be determined and that it is those bodies who would submit the nominee who would become a member of the consultative committee.</P>
      <P>I accept that if the total membership is to be nine, it is not necessary that all of them should be nominated by organisations and that it would be appropriate for the Minister to reserve the right to nominate two or three appointees out of the nine.  In order to maintain the high degree of independence required in public bodies it is essential that Deputies in Opposition strive at every opportunity to ensure that this principle is enshrined in legislation and to get away from the old practice whereby Ministers made personal appointments.  Under that system Ministers came under pressure to appoint political pals.  There was always a stench about such appointments, a doubt as to whether the best people were appointed and whether they would act independently in the interests of the community, or support the Minister's interest if at any time there was a conflict.</P>
      <P>We want to achieve the highest standards. We want the consultative body's advice to be above reproach and not to have any smell of political patronage attached to it.  Political affiliation should not be a qualification for an appointment to a body such as this.  It is in order to remove that stigma from Irish politics that, on all legislation my party will pursue this issue to ensure that everything is done openly.  Fine speeches from Taoisigh or others about open Government are not enough.  Proposals must be written into the legislation.  The way to achieve that is not by accepting assurances from the Minister who is charged with bringing the legislation before the Dáil, but by having proposals written into the legislation.  If the Minister clarifies that we can move on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty in clarifying the points Deputy Molloy raised.  I thought I had clarified my approach in relation to the various interests I want represented on the consultative committee.  Broadly speaking, I would be consulting with farming organisations, the veterinary profession, pharmaceutical organisations and consumer and processing interests.  I will discuss with them the importance of this committee and I will be asking them to nominate the persons most qualified within their organisations to sit on this committee. If that does not clarify the position for Deputies, I do not know what else I can do.</P>
      <P>I thought I had gone a long way towards meeting Deputies' requirements on Committee Stage by increasing the level of representation and so forth.  I made the point that it may well be that people outside of the scope of established organisations could make their expertise available to us and which will be of assistance in achieving our aim.  The Deputy conceded that by saying he would not have any difficulty if the Minister wanted to nominate two or three people.</P>
      <P>My only interest in relation to the organisations which will be represented, and perhaps people from outside organisations if that emerges as being necessary, is that they will be selected for appointment by the organisations.  If other consultation has to take place it will be purely on the basis of capacity to make a contribution to the strengthening of the consultative committee in giving advice to the Minister.  I have no other interest. I do not have a hidden agenda in relation to the importance of this committee.</P>

That is a perfectly reasonable point.  I am not causing problems for the <Col N="186" /> Minister and I accept his proposal.  I am a very reasonable Member.</P>

I can tell the Deputy that I will keep in it in mind.</P>

      <P>What I am proposing in this amendment is that the consultative committee, when appointed, should be appointed for a period of four years rather than two.  Two years would appear to be a short lifespan for a consultative committee which will be asked to undertake important work and build up expertise in this area.  As we know from experience, a period of two years is exceptionally short and I would like to hear the Minister of State's arguments if he is opposed to the amendment.

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Before you proceed, Sir, we were taking two amendments together.  We have dealt only with amendment No.6; we have not yet dealt with amendment No.8 which reads:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (6), line 6, after &ldquo;procedure&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;for the purpose of considering the matters referred to it by the Minister&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 7 and 8 should be taken together because amendment No. 8 follows on from the change proposed in amendment No. 7, which reads: &ldquo;in page 7, lines 4 and 5, to delete subsection (5)&rdquo;.  That amendment is not before the House but, with your permission, I would like to refer to it.</P>
      <P>In amendment No. 7 I am proposing that subsection (5), which reads &ldquo;that the consultative committee shall meet whenever summoned by the Minister,&rdquo; should be deleted.  If that subsection is deleted there would be a need to alter the wording in line 6 in subsection (6).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill seems to imply that the consultative committee will only be able to meet whenever summoned by the Minister. I expect that matters will be referred to it by the Minister to obtain its advice. Once a matter is referred to it the consultative committee should have the right to decide on its own procedures and how often it should meet to consider that matter before it reports back to the Minister. It is strange that the consultative committee will only be able to meet <Col N="188" /> whenever summoned by the Minister.  It is not practical to ask any important body such as this, comprised of highly qualified experts, to meet only when summoned by the Minister.  If the Minister of State could classify that matter he would meet my point on amendment No. 8.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the House would agree that the Minister should have the power to summon the consultative committee to discuss the way in which certain aspects of the Bill should be implemented.  The Deputy has to bear in mind that we are talking here about a consultative committee which will make itself available to the Minister.  If problems arise within the Department the Minister should be able to convene that committee, to discuss the matter on the agenda and advise him accordingly.  The Acting Chairman has ruled that amendment No. 7 is out of order, but I make this point in response to the point raised by Deputy Molloy.</P>
      <P>Under Deputy Molloy's amendment the consultative committee would have the power to decide its own procedures in considering matters referred to it by the Minister.  I would have no difficulty with this.  Indeed, having been summoned by the Minister, the committee should have freedom to decide its own procedures in dealing with specific matters on the agenda for consideration. Therefore I have no difficulty in accepting the Deputy's amendment, No. 8.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State saying that the purpose of summoning the consultative committee would be to refer a certain matter to it and it would have the right to determine its own procedures and how often it should meet? One could read the Bill in another way, that the consultative committee could not meet unless the Minister summoned it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has the power to convene a meeting of the consultative committee every time he requires guidance and expertise on an aspect of the Bill with which we are dealing. Of course, there is nothing to prevent <Col N="189" /> the consultative committee bringing any particular matter to the attention of the Minister, alerting him to various circumstances which might arise; requesting him, if you like, to convene a meeting for the purpose of discussing a specific matter.  I want to be explicit, the consultative committee will meet, when convened by the Minister, for the purpose of discussing a particular matter and for seeking expert advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, the Minister does not foresee the consultative committee meeting on any other occasion apart from when summoned by the Minister. That is the way I read the provisions and why I tabled my amendment.  I find it very strange that a consultative committee might be appointed, as proposed in the Bill, which the Minister would have the right to summon to inform it of the matter he wished to have considered. Having notified it of that matter, surely the committee should have the right to determine how it fulfils its task?  Surely it would have to meet at other times?  Does the Minister think that the committee, on the day it is summoned, could give its views immediately?  Would there not be an opportunity to meet later to consider the matter put before it?  Can the Minister see the difficulty?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems the committee can meet only when the Minister summons it and must give its advice there and then unless it asks him to summon it again; it seems very strange to me.  I would accept the Minister allowing the committee to make arrangements and devise procedures to facilitate the consideration of a matter he has put before it and authorising it to hold meetings but if he is saying it cannot hold a meeting to consider such matters unless the Minister summons it, that is different.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Molloy's point.  It seems very strange that there is not a proper committee structure. It is possible that this consultative committee <Col N="190" /> will never meet.  It is possible that it could be summoned for one meeting to discuss a particular issue and hold no further meetings.  We must ensure that there is a proper mechanism whereby the committee can get on with its work.  I am satisfied that this committee will have plenty of work to do if it is to be useful. We have spent much time talking about its structure but we need to ensure it can meet.  I am fully aware that financial constraints was the reason for amendment No. 7 being ruled out of order.  Bearing in mind the size of the industry on which this committee will be consulted we should not restrain it from holding whatever number of meetings are necessary to furnish the Minister with proper advice.</P>

      <P>As I have already explained, the purpose of the committee is to advise the Minister.  Obviously there would have to be an item on the agenda for consideration.  Therefore, the Minister would convene a meeting of the committee for the purpose of dealing with a particular or specific matter.  The Minister having convened the meeting, the committee would then organise itself on the basis of Deputy Molloy's amendment which I have accepted.  In relation to that specific item on the agenda, the committee would meet of its own volition, without further convenings by the Minister, until the matter has been dealt with.</P>
      <P>I do not think Members are suggesting that we should establish a consultative committee which would meet on a regular basis, regardless of whether there was a matter to be discussed.  I want to be as clear as I can.  The Minister will convene a meeting of the consultative committee for the purpose of dealing with some specific aspect of animal health.  That committee will deal with the matter until it has provided the Minister with the information and advice he sought.  Indeed the spirit of what I am saying is incorporated in amendment No. 8 in the name of Deputy Molloy which I have accepted and which I hope is satisfactory.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(9) (a) At the end of the twelve month period following the enactment of this Act, and at the end of each subsequent twelve month period, the Consultative Committee shall submit a report to the Minister for Agriculture, which he shall lay before the Dáil.</P>
      <P>(b)  The report shall list the matters on which the Committee was consulted by the Minister, any recommendations it made to the Minister and the basis on which any recommendation was made.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that this amendment is accepted since there is not much point in establishing a committee if its deliberations are known only to the relevant Department and the Minister.  We need a formula whereby each year a report can be provided by the consultative committee <Col N="192" /> to all interested parties.  If one is including representation of the various sectors on this consultative committee, by enabling it to send its representatives to function on that committee, one has already established a principle that these sectors matter, that what they say and do must be heard when decisions are taken. If that is the case, feeding information back to these bodies, or indeed to public representatives in this House, is part and parcel of that process since it is about transparency and providing information. A very simple reporting procedure should be established &mdash; since the information will be recorded anyway &mdash; it is simply a matter of putting it in a form in which it can be submitted to the Minister once a year and laid before the Dáil.  This would mean that whatever information, knowledge and wisdom is garnered from this committee can be availed of and used on a wider base which, again, reflects the fundamental point the Minister made in relation to the establishment of the consultative committee.  If he accepts that principle, as he says he does, he must then accept this amendment to ensure that that kind of process of consultation is guaranteed for the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened attentively to the points made by Deputy McManus.  It is not envisaged that this committee will meet on a regular basis.  In fact its biggest task will be in relation to the establishment of the regulations arising from the implementation of the provisions of this Bill.  The only other time the consultative committee needs to meet would be if and when something took place within the agricultural sector which had a bearing on the animal health aspects of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not envisage this committee reporting to the House.  It is a consultative committee for the purpose of advising the Minister on specific aspects of the provisions of this Bill.  I am not saying that for the purpose of saying it should not be transparent in relation to its findings.  However, I reiterate it is being established merely for the purpose of advising the Minister.  Therefore, I do <Col N="193" /> not think there is scope for a reporting facility back to this House.  Of course, Members are free to table questions in regard to how that committee is performing, or to ask the Minister whether he has received the committee's advice on a specific aspect of the implementation of the provisions of this Bill.  I would not like the House to misunderstand the scope and extent of the committee we are establishing.  It will be an essential committee, performing a crucial task.  It will also be a voluntary committee.  From that point of view we should not overstate its importance within the context of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I find this quite astonishing. I cannot understand why the Minister is fearful of providing basic information.  It is important that we know the advice given to the Minister.  I do not think anybody will be too concerned if the consultative committee does not meet very frequently.  If it meets infrequently we should know there are no major problems that cause it to be convened. However, if there are major problems it is important that we, as public representatives, know what the committee is doing.</P>
      <P>Provision is made in the Bill for the payment of travelling and other expenses and that is perfectly in order.  The Minister needs to be reminded that it is public money that is being spent and the public is at least entitled to know how that money is being spent and what the committee is doing.  I do not think that is an unreasonable request and I am surprised it is causing difficulties.  If we are to have openness in Government &mdash; I include the people in the process &mdash; public representatives, and the Minister, are entitled to receive information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not satisfied that I will have to devise questions to get the right response. I am long enough here to know how the system works and that one has to ask a question in such a way as to winkle out the information one needs.  This requires great dexterity, and a certain amount of imagination.  It is not always possible for an Opposition Member to get it right and <Col N="194" /> one ends up with waffle.  I have had that experience over and again.  It is very easy for a Minister to kick to touch when asked difficult questions.  I do not envisage that there would be many difficult questions but having seen the way the system operates, I do not think Question Time is the occasion to seek the basic information I am asking for in this amendment.</P>
    <P>I do not understand the Minister's fears.  He is to be advised by a consultative committee that represents the larger community and I do not see why that information has to be kept secret.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of keeping anything secret.  I have to restate the role of the consultative committee. This is a committee to advise the Minister on some specific aspect of legislation and on problems that may arise in relation to its implementation.  Very often the matter under investigation could be raised in this House, indeed Members may be the first to bring a specific problem to the Minister's attention and he, in turn will seek the advice of the consultative committee.  That committee will consist of a group of experts from different sectors working on a voluntary basis and willing to give of their time to provide the best possible advice to the Minister. At the end of the day the Minister is answerable to this House.  He is entitled to be questioned on any specific matter on how he has dealt with a problem and whether he has taken the advice of the consultative committee.  I do not see any real merit in having the consultative committee report to this House because I do not envisage that it will meet on a regular basis.  It will meet for a specific purpose as the occasion arises.  I hope the need for this consultative committee to meet will not arise very often because if the Minister needs to consult with the committee, it is an indication of a problem.  I hope that following the passing of the Bill the abuses we are trying to address will be minimised and later eliminated.  I suppose to a great extent that is wishful thinking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am realistic enough to know that we are addressing an extremely difficult problem because of the people involved in smuggling illicit products into the country.</P>
      <P>I do not see this committee having an opportunity to make an annual report because as a consultative committee the Minister will call on it for expert advice on a particular matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>It sounds very grand to talk about an annual report but the Taoiseach lauded the idea of a single page report and I do not see any reason for an elaborate statement or the type of annual report published by State bodies.  I am talking about a record of the activities of the consultative committee and the recommendations it made.  It may well be that what the Minister said will be the position, that it will meet infrequently and there will not be a need for extraordinary meetings, but he could also be very wrong.  For example, no one knows the extent of the abuse of angel dust. Despite all the investigations, there is even a dispute about it today.  It is not necessarily true that the consultative committee will meet rarely, it may and I hope it does because that means that things are working well but whether it meets frequently or rarely there is a need to carry out an annual audit of it.  That is all we are asking for in this amendment. It is a very simple request: it is a matter of putting details on the record so that the people who pay for the committees can know what it is doing.  I cannot understand why the Minister has a difficulty with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The business of the committee will be recorded and to have an annual report laid before the Dáil at the end of each year in line with this amendment should be a simple procedure.  I cannot see any difficulty with this but without it people will ask what is going on.  For example, when the Minister makes a decision people will ask what advice he obtained, whether the consumer association was able to provide him with the information he sought and, if so, why he made the decision contrary to that advice.  We are <Col N="196" /> entitled to this information and I would be very disappointed if at the end of the day we do not get it as a matter of course. It should not be a matter of trying to extract the information from the Minister who may not be in a position to give it or may not be willing to do so.  With all due respect, that is not the way we should proceed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. I am sure the Minister realises that we live in an era where open government is advocated and expected by the community. His party leader on numerous occasions claimed that he would preside over open government.  If we do not make provision in legislation for this openness we will not achieve it.  The Minister has a duty to ensure that the Department carries out its duties but Opposition Deputies see a wider responsibility than what the Department may see as appropriate.  A committee is being asked to undertake important work in support of the objective of all parties in this House, to achieve the highest possible standards for our beef industry.  We want to create internationally a perception of our food produce as of the highest standard.  The procedures are in place to ensure that nothing less than satisfactory happens and that the highest standards are maintained.  The only way we will achieve that is by pulling back the curtains to allow the full light of day to shine in.  The information should be made available to the public, and that is the proclaimed intention of the Government. I am surprised at the necessity to debate this matter at great length.  The qualified people who will act on this committee should have an opportunity to report to the Dáil, the public, the industry, interests abroad and customers as to what they are doing or recommending.  That is part of the openness necessary to achieve the highest standards.  I am surprised the Minister cannot support this amendment. I have not yet heard any strong reasons for the Minister's opposition to the amendment and I hope he seriously considers the matter before rejecting it outright.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="197" /> This is a very important amendment. We would have put down a similar amendment but there was not much point in repeating it.  We indicated in the course of the debate that this amendment is necessary.  Perhaps the Minister may wish to word the amendment in a different way.  It is important that there be an annual report &mdash; it need not be a very long document &mdash; to inform the House and the public of the work the committee has been asked to undertake and the recommendations it makes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I too support this amendment.  It simply proposes that a report be made each year.  We have already discussed the fact that a number of bodies will be involved, all of them for various reasons.  It is important that a report be made by the committee.  It is essential that we are open in this matter. Wild statements have been made in the past that have done no good to the industry or the country.  I ask the Minister, if he is not satisfied with the present wording, to consider rewording the amendment to ensure that a report is made annually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying as best I can to understand what the Deputies wish to achieve while at the same time considering the operations of the committee. I do not envisage that this committee will sit on a regular basis or will have a considerable amount to report.  I take Deputy Molloy's point on transparency. I assure the House it is not my intention to conceal information which would be relevant to the operation of the House or to individual Deputies.  I restate the point that this will be an advisory consultative committee.  The Minister is the person who is answerable to this House and to the nation and he will be guided and advised on specific technical matters governing the Bill.  I cannot understand in what circumstances the opportunity would arise whereby the consultative committee would report to this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matters under consideration would be very much public matters, matters which perhaps Deputy McManus, <Col N="198" /> Deputy Molloy and other Deputies would raise on the Adjournment alerting the Minister to the fact that a problem exists and asking what he will do about it.  To the extent that a problem exists the Minister would consult with the advisory committee and he would be answerable to the House in relation to action taken in that regard.</P>
    <P>I am not being awkward or difficult, but I am trying to see if there is some justification for Deputy McManus's request in the context of the overall structure of this Bill and the role of the consultative committee.  I am not convinced &mdash; I say that as kindly as possible &mdash; there is a role for this committee to report back to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe I can help the Minister.  He is probably forgetting he has conceded that he will be requesting organisations to appoint representatives to the consultative committee.  That in itself makes a qualitative difference in that people will not be on the committee at their own behest but will be representing bodies.  If at any stage in the future a contentious issue arises and the Minister takes a controversial decision, the people representing those organisations would not have an independent system to which to refer.  They would be dependent on the Minister and that would be unfair on them.  If I was representing the Consumers Association, farmers or whatever, I would have a difficulty with that because I would be depending on the goodwill of the Minister. I agree we should all be able to depend on the Minister's goodwill, but it is not necessarily guaranteed.  I have no doubt about the Minister's integrity and credibility; but we are not talking about a Bill that will establish certain principles.  As the principle has been already established that organisations will be represented on the consultative committee, we then have to establish a recording system that is open and transparent, not an elaborate system that will cost money but one that allows people the independence they need in representing large organisations. <Col N="199" /> Otherwise they could end up getting a lot of flak and not having any record to which to refer.</P>
      <P>This is an important matter.  If the Minister does not follow my logic, which to me and to Deputy Molloy is crystal clear, I ask him at least not to oppose the amendment but to take a second look at it.  It is a point about which I feel very strongly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not being repetitious on this matter, but I am anxious to move on.  If we do not reach some of the main provisions in the Bill it is a strange way to do business.  I would point out to the Minister that one of the purposes of this Bill as set out in the explanatory memorandum is to provide for the regulation of the availability, possession and use of animal remedies and for the prescription of maximum permitted residues of animal remedies in foods of animal origin.  Those matters are of extreme importance to the public, farmers, the industry and our customers abroad.  If a consultative committee advised as to the permissibility of levels of residues it is important that the public knows what is being advised.  The Minister is saying he sees no reason to let the public know what advice is being given, but I do not accept that; nor will the public accept it.  The Minister may not have given much consideration to this matter.  He believes this committee will not meet very often and will not have to be referred to very much.  I hope the Minister is right, but I see it as a further assurance to the people that we are striving to ensure that what goes into the food process is of the highest order that we have procedures in operation to achieve the best possible standards and that people have absolute confidence in <Col N="200" /> the produce of the Irish farmer and the Irish meat industry.  We all have a common objective and I cannot understand the reason the Minister does not see the necessity to publish the work of this committee.  Their work could be vital in certain instances if some matters are to be permitted and others are not.  This is all part of the transparency to which the Minister subscribes and the openness we are anxious to achieve.  If the Minister cannot accept the amendment, perhaps he would indicate he is prepared to consider it for Report Stage.  I do not know what Deputy McManus's attitude would be, but if we got an assurance from the Minister we could move on to the next item; otherwise we will have to take a serious stand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I take very seriously the views expressed by both Deputies as I know they are sincere and genuine in relation to the case put forward.  I have explained &mdash; and I do not want to be repetitious &mdash; that I do not see the need for this committee to report to the House on the basis that in the final analysis the Minister has to report to the House. While I cannot recall any body, I am sure there are many voluntary advisory committees within other Government Departments who advise the Minister or Ministers of State in relation to specific aspects of their administration and who do not have to report to the House.  Their role of advising the Minister is merely a consultative role.  To the extent that both Deputies are genuine in the case they are making, I will look at the matter again before Report Stage, if that is acceptable. My personal view, as of now, is as already expressed.  Both Deputies are concerned and perhaps we could discuss with the consultative committee, when established, whether they would wish their advice to the Minister to be discussed in the House.  I will think about it and report back on Report Stage.</P>

While the Minister said he would review the matter, he also said he does not see any necessity for it.  I do not want to be fobbed off and I do not see any point in accepting what the Minister says &mdash; although I would like to &mdash; unless there is a genuine understanding that there is a need for some kind of record of this type.  If he can say he understands the argument and accepts the principle involved, I would be happy to leave it with him.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be as helpful as I can to the Deputy.  I have expressed my judgment in relation to the case put forward by both Deputies.  I am not convinced of the need for the committee to report to the House if the committee is advising the Minister and the Minister is consulting with the committee.  I can think of cases where other committees advise Ministers and do a good job and the Minister benefits considerably from their advice.  I am prepared to examine this question again, bearing in mind the <Col N="202" /> sincerity of the views expressed by Deputies McManus and Molloy, to see whether there is a need for this committee to report; if so, I will come back with something positive.</P>
      <P>I fully subscribe to the idea of transparency, but transparency can be projected through the various organisations which these individuals will represent. The farming organisations would not be slow to highlight some particular aspect of animal health matters if the Minister did not act on the advice given and the same would apply to the other sectors.  I do not think one could even envisage a situation where there would not be transparency in relation to the advice which would be available.  I say that in all sincerity, because the organisations themselves, through their nominees, would create the level of transparency about which the Deputy is concerned.  I will examine the position to see whether there is justification for the committee reporting to the House and consult with the committee with a view to ascertaining whether the public interest would best be served in terms of their openly publishing their advice to the Minister.  I have reservations on it.  I hope the Deputy will not press the amendment, but I am prepared to examine it.</P>

      <P>In page 8, lines 14 to 16, to delete subsection (3).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult to understand why those sections are inserted in the Bill.  Section <Col N="205" /> 4 (3) states that subsection (1) shall not apply to the importation in bulk of an animal remedy otherwise than in the container or outer wrapper in which it is intended to be put on sale.  If we are serious about this matter we need to have total control and it is difficult to understand why this subsection or subsection (5) should be inserted in the Bill.  We must ensure that this Bill can be enforced and we do not want any weakness in it. Perhaps the Minister will explain why those subsections are included.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">

      <P>A large proportion of this Bill deals with the question of identifying illegal substances.  A number of sections deal specifically with the labelling of the commodites concerned.  The difficulty I have in regard to the Deputy's amendment is that the same specific requirements would have to apply to the large bulk importation of products as would apply to the single product when it eventually appears in the chemist shop or when it is administered by a veterinary surgeon.  The Deputy's point in regard to the need to be able to identify clearly the contents of all importations into the country, particularly in this area, deserves further consideration from our point of view.  I am prepared to examine that and report back to the House on Report Stage.  I would like, however, to remind the House that specific regulations govern all imports <i>vis-à-vis</i> customs clearance and so on; but I appreciate that those clearances could never relate to the specific ingredients in various imported items.  This is an important area.  We will give further consideration to it and perhaps we will be in a position to do something about it on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his commitment.  We do not wish to tie anything up in knots, but if we are serious about knowing exactly what is being imported and from where it comes we must ensure that the paperwork and the labelling is as foolproof as possible.  I accept the Minister's commitments to examine it before Report Stage. <Col N="206" /> However, I assure him that if it is not to our satisfaction we will have more to say at that stage.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P>In page 12, subsection (1), line 21, to delete &ldquo;implied&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;express&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We want this Bill to be effective and the <Col N="208" /> use of the word &ldquo;implied&rdquo; in respect of the implied condition on the part of the seller that all reasonable precautions have been taken is very indefinite.  I suggest the word &ldquo;express&rdquo; is absolute and should be substituted for the word &ldquo;implied&rdquo;.  We would not be here today if the law in this area had been more exact.  We would not have to introduce this Bill and we would avoid much anxiety among those who are trying to bring the misusers of animal remedies to justice.  For that reason we want the Bill to be as foolproof as possible.  I am not a lawyer but the advice I have received indicates that the use of the words &ldquo;implied condition&rdquo; is not strong enough. Will the Minister state why the word &ldquo;express&rdquo; should not be used to ensure there is no doubt or ambiguity in regard to the provisions of this Bill?</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>This proposal relates to a provision which would imply certain conditions relating to the correct use, if any, of animal remedies in every contract of sale of an animal. In our view there is no need for such an amendment.  The present wording of the section conforms to the usual wording used in legislation which creates implied contractual obligations &mdash; obligations which are not in writing but implied in contract by law. Substituting the word &ldquo;express&rdquo; would not achieve any extra benefit for the operation of this legislation and would not provide any better <i>de facto</i> control on the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister has stated that it is usual to include the word &ldquo;implied&rdquo; in Bills.  This Bill is before the House because the contents of previous Bills have been usual and not exact.  That is why we have had to introduce this Bill.  The wording here is extremely important.  I ask the Minister to consider this amendment, or to put down an amendment using a different form of wording.  From the information available to me the use of the word &ldquo;implied&rdquo; is not strong enough and could be questioned and perhaps misconstrued. We wish to help the Minister to ensure <Col N="209" /> that this Bill is workable and that we will not have to amend it after some legal case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. Its purpose is to assist the Minister and make the Bill stronger by including words that will leave no doubt as to their meaning.  If it only implied that something might happen, that is not a strong condition.  If that condition were an expressed one, it would have to ensure that something would happen.  The word &ldquo;implied&rdquo; is much weaker than the word proposed in this amendment.  This is an example of the Opposition being willing to assist the Minister by strengthening this legislation to make workable to the fullest extent the controls this Bill seeks to achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>The word &ldquo;implied&rdquo; is an important one in legal terms.  It is used in relation to many contracts in the commercial area, including farming.  To concede to the request in the amendment to use the word &ldquo;express&rdquo; would create enormous difficulties in terms of normal farm trading.  When one uses the word &ldquo;express&rdquo; one would have to have a written contractual arrangement in relation to most transactions.  I am sure the Deputies opposite will appreciate that to proceed down that road would disrupt trading, particularly in relation to agriculture. The word &ldquo;implied&rdquo; is one which is readily understood.  When one buys an agricultural or other product, implied in that transaction is the understanding that the product being purchased is a genuine article and is in accordance with the implied contract for sale.  I do not consider that word creates any problems. To use the word &ldquo;express&rdquo; would create enormous problems if we were to pursue that matter in respect of the provision in the legislation.  While I appreciate the Deputy is trying to be helpful, the amendment would not be operable in respect of all that would be involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two weakneses in the wording as it appears in the Bill.  First, there is the &ldquo;implied&rdquo; condition <Col N="210" /> which we are discussing but there is also the requirement on the seller that all reasonable precautions be taken.  That in itself is not very strong but we are willing to overlook &ldquo;the reasonable precautions&rdquo; because reasonable precautions to one person may not mean the same to another.  The reason for the amendment was to have an express condition inserted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Express&rdquo; is a definitive word which would have to be backed up in terms of a contractual arrangement which would make normal trading, particularly in agriculture, extremely difficult. However, as I said previously, the word &ldquo;implied&rdquo; has always meant that the product purchased is genuine in terms of the sale.  While I understand what the Deputies are saying in relation to the use of the word &ldquo;express&rdquo; I hope they appreciate what would be involved if I went to the Deputy to buy five or six of his Charolais bullocks and requested a written guarantee that they had not been treated with growth promoters; it would cause immense trading difficulties.  On the other hand, in the context of Irish law and what is understood in relation to the word &ldquo;implied&rdquo; it carries a serious contractual agreement in relation to the products being purchased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>That brings us to the second amendment.  The reason they were tabled separately is that if one was accepted the other would not be as important.  However, we have the issue of &ldquo;implied&rdquo; on the one hand and &ldquo;all reasonable precautions have been taken and all due diligence has been exercised to ensure&rdquo; on the other.  Both elements are weak and I hope the Minister will agree there is a necessity, if he is retaining the word &ldquo;implied&rdquo;, to delete the second section.  As an ordinary farmer I want to ensure this Bill is foolproof and the systems workable.  However, we are not implementing this Bill for the ordinary farmer, but to bring criminals to justice. I make no apology for saying that.  The majority of ordinary farmers live within the law and want to produce a quality <Col N="211" /> product.  Some people are caught but could not be pursued because the law was too weak.  We are now trying to ensure that the Bill is debated fully in this House and that difficulties will not arise in the future.  We want to improve the Bill and ensure that it is sound and workable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Crawford's comments are reasonable because we are indicating that in the case of the sale of an animal, it was not treated with an animal remedy.  That is reasonable because any producer of animals should be able to give an express assurance on the sale of their animals that they were not treated with drugs prior to being sold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated earlier the word &ldquo;implied&rdquo; is important and has specific meaning in legal terms.  I do not want to be repetitious but the implementation of the amendment could create serious trading difficulties for the people concerned.</P>
      <P>The other point is in relation to the implementation of the word &ldquo;implied&rdquo;. If one purchases a product, livestock or otherwise, sold under the implied contractual arrangements, it is open to each individual to take legal action if the conditions are not complied with.  At the end of the day, as the Deputy said, we want this legislation to work.  Therefore, we must put workable provisions in this Bill, the use of the word &ldquo;express&rdquo; would create difficulties in relation to specific trading arrangements.</P>

The licensing of wholesalers and retailers who provide animal remedies is absolutely vital.  Much reference has been made to vanmen who have caused extreme damage to the livestock industry. It is very important that these people can be traced.  The Bill proposes that animals which are slaughtered should be free of such substances.  If this is to be achieved we must be able to trace the people who provide these substances and take legal action, if necessary.  I am glad the Minister is nodding his head in agreement on this vitally important issue.</P>

      <P>The provisions in section 8 are wide enough to encompass the type of regulations envisaged by both Deputies.  It is a requirement of Council Directive 81/851, as amended, the licensing and controls should operate on wholesale and retail establishments. Regulations will be made after the Bill comes into force providing for that.  Each of the items referred to by the Deputies can then be taken into consideration.  I hope this meets Deputy Molloy's concerns.</P>

      <P>It is extremely important that the regulations be implemented quickly.  Apart from EC regulations, we must have our own regulations in place and be certain that there is no danger. The issue of the suitability of premises is vital.  I have major anxieties about leaving a weakness in the Bill in relation to who holds licences, the condition of premises and so on.  The Garda and Department officials have had to run around private houses without being sure where goods are kept and where they should be kept.  If the Bill is to be put into operation we need proper premises and proper records.  Our amendment is to try to improve the situation.  I am not altogether satisfied that the Minister has given a sufficient reply and that we will have adequate traceback.  A lot of angel dust was found in cardboard boxes and <Col N="217" /> we were not too sure what it was.  If animal remedies were kept in proper promises and properly controlled, we would be better satisfied that the Minister and his representatives could implement this Bill.

      <P>It is an extraordinary assertion by the Minister that the Attorney General has some statutory role between the passage of this legislation and its signing by the President. The role of the Attorney General, is in the preparation of the Bill before it is presented here and before the Minister accepts the Final Stage.  Would the Minister explain what role the Attorney General would have after the Bill is passed. Will the Minister give me his estimate of how long it will take before these regulations can be implemented?  Obviously, I will not hold the Minister to a specific date, but I would like his estimate.  Is the Minister talking of one, two or three months?</P>

    <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the Government's decision to approve increases in telephone charges of up to 400 per cent for day-time local calls and regrets that the Government's decision failed totally to address the overall cost levels of Telecom Éireann or to encourage greater competition as recommended in the Culliton report.</P>

    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;notes and approves of the action of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications in authorising the implementation of a package of telephone tariffs which will improve competition and assist in job creation in the economy, allow Telecom Éireann to further develop and update our national tele-communications infrastructure and provide incentives for maximising public usage of the telephone system; further approves of the Government's decision to recommend that State and Local Government Agencies <Col N="220" /> maximise the use of freefone facilities and welcomes the decision to establish a Telephone Users' Advisory Group to monitor the impact of the rebalancing of telephone tariffs.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Telephone use by people with mobility and speech impairment has enabled them to combat isolation and play an active part in their communities.  Use of the telephone provides a lifeline.  Implementation of the local charges as announced would greatly increase isolation and force people into more passive roles and cause hardship.</P>
      <P>Bord Telecom has successfully exhorted the public, through its advertising campaigns, to keep in touch by making &ldquo;that call&rdquo;.  I put it to the Minister that they will no longer be able to afford to make that call.  The Minister and Bord Telecom have deprived them of that right.  In this way Bord Telecom has deliberately sought to increase telephone usage as a social medium and it is now asking this most vulnerable group in the community to pay an exorbitant price following this so-called readjustment of charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, Fine Gael is committed to Bord Telecom Éireann.  We believe the question of ownership of Bord Telecom Éireann is not relevant; in our view it should remain in public ownership, but it must become competitive.  The winds of competition are blowing through Europe and Telecom's future will not be guaranteed by trying to hide from these competitive forces but by gearing the <Col N="221" /> company to take on competition in Ireland and to compete for business throughout the European Community and Eastern Europe.  The Minister has not taken the proper approach.  He will not make Bord Telecom Éireann more competitive by imposing this harsh package on the ordinary people of this country, especially the most vulnerable sections of society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been brought to my attention that Telecom Éireann may decide to charge a call-out fee of £30 following the implementation of this package and that thereafter the charge for 15 minutes work would be £32.  I do not know if this is a hidden charge, unannounced by the Minister in his speech, but I would like him to clarify this matter. The total charge for 15 minutes work, between the call-out fee and the fee for work done, would be £62.  If that is the case, are there any other hidden charges?</P>
      <P>Telecom Éireann is a strong company, which can become competitive and economically sound while in public ownership during the next few years and which can compete and avail of opportunities on the European market.  But it is difficult for it to assess the impact this overall package will have.  The Government is entitled to instruct Telecom Éireann to revise this package.  A number of years ago people were refused entry to Croke Park when the Government refused to abolish VAT on hurleys.  In this case a 10 per cent levy which could be absorbed by the Government will be payable by every single individual with telephone equipment. This is an extremely sore point and it could lead to a massive public protest in November when bills are sent out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As people who are politically aware, the Government could say to Telecom Éireann that its overall programme will not lead to the company becoming more competitive and that therefore it should revise its proposals in the public interest. Many elderly people could spend an hour or two on the telephone &mdash; their only link to companions &mdash; and these telephone charges will hit them very hard.  The <Col N="222" /> Minister and the Government should be aware that protest groups are gathering momentum, expressing concern and will play a vital role in the months ahead in convincing the Government that it was wrong to take this action.</P>
    <P>As outlined last night by my colleague, Deputy Noonan, my party believes that Telecom Éireann has an important part to play in the telecommunications business. We also believe that the company should remain in public ownership and avail of opportunities in the European Community.  Further, we appreciate that trained personnel are available to Telecom Éireann but do not expect the Government to rob the poor to subsidise the rich.</P>
    <P>A short time ago people were unable to obtain information on their telephone bills, but from the facts produced by the Minister we now know that up to 70 per cent of calls are under three minutes.  All over the country consumer committees are being set up.  While it is important to be in Government, it is also important that one takes cognisance of the social consequences one's actions may have. The Minister's predecessors refused to implement this package and I think he should do likewise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the day the Culliton report was published it has been abundantly clear that some of the measures contained in it would be difficult and unpalatable.  The changes in Telecom Éireann charges are a necessary part of that process.  The future of the company &mdash; one of the most important in public ownership in Ireland &mdash; is at stake.  It is forgotten perhaps in the controversy that this company employs more than 10,000 people and that an investment of more than a £1 billion has been made by this company in recent years.  The objective <Col N="223" /> of the Government is to keep Telecom Éireann strong and competitive.  If we do not, the employment impact within Telecom Éireann itself and as a result of other knock-on effects will be very severe.</P>
      <P>Contrary to what has been claimed, the amended charges are only one part of the package because there is continuing substantial capital investment by the company, supported by the taxpayer, to improve performance, service and productivity. In fact, I might add that the whole country saw the direct result of some of that investment in the spectacular technical success of last Saturday's night show in Millstreet to which Telecom made a very large contribution.</P>
      <P>There is no escaping the fact that Telecom, as a result of European deregulation, will face stiff competition in the future, especially in respect of longdistance calls.  We cannot expect Telecom to compete with one hand tied behind its back against multinational giants.</P>
      <P>At the same time we have to take the opportunity to allow Telecom maximise its share of business traffic and to provide major reductions in the costs incurred by industrial users of the telephone services.</P>
      <P>Of course, extra charges on any sector of the community are never welcome, especially when some of the announcements surrounding such increases lack sensitivity.  In this regard I have to say &mdash; and I think most Members of this House would agree &mdash; that the misleading and disingenuous advertisements placed by Telecom Éireann were both offensive and unhelpful.  But that does not alter the fact that the principle of change must be accepted.  No matter how painful or difficult, we cannot allow it to be said that this Government is prepared to shirk necessary decisions.  Part of this process, an essential part, is the gearing of our telecommunications network in an efficient and cost-effective way to make the maximum contribution to economic development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The announcement by the Minister last evening that he is examining ways and means of protecting those most likely to <Col N="224" /> be severely affected will be welcomed by most objective commentators.  The same objectivity, if applied to some of the more hysterical outbursts by some of the Opposition, will reveal that cant and hypocrisy for what it is.</P>
    <P>For many years, for example, the privatisation of Telecom Éireann and the dismantling of that major investment on the part of our electorate was a prime policy objective of the Progressive Democrats.  I have no doubt whatever that, were they in Government today, we would be forced to listen to speeches about the operation of free market forces, while job losses and charges in Telecom Éireann mounted.  The privatisation of Telecom Éireann is not on this Government's agenda.  Neither are we prepared to stand by and allow it to be weakened by competition from companies ten or 20 times bigger.</P>
    <P>May I say, in relation to the privatisation of British Telecom &mdash; sometimes suggested as a model for Ireland &mdash; that that resulted in the loss of 30,000 jobs and the highest ever domestic telephone tariffs within the United Kingdom.  That is UK-based data, not Irish data.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I will arrange that. The attitude of the Opposition in this case contrasts sharply with their stated policy of funding assistance to maintain employment and the commercial viability of Aer Lingus.  I want to knock firmly on the head the absurd assertion by the Progressive Democrats that the proposals are contrary to EC law.  That is not only misleading but is the exact opposite of the real position. EC policies and directives in the area of telecommunications all point to the need to have charges based on objective criteria. In general these charges must be costorientated, but that is the ultimate goal. Some cross-subsidisation is permitted <Col N="225" /> under EC law but the cross-subsidisation we have at present &mdash; that is, where local calls are being subsidised by international calls &mdash; is in fact unacceptable to the EC. The EC considers that international calls cost too much relative to local calls.  They consider that, in effect, there is a surcharge on international calls and that that practice must cease, which is exactly what the current set of Telecom Éireann proposals is about.</P>
      <P>As I have said already, the Minister should be congratulated on his announcement last evening that £500,000 of Telecom Éireann's budget will be set aside to meet the telephone costs of voluntary organisations.  It should be reiterated that the vital services of organisations such as the rape crisis centres, The Samaritans and Childline will not be affected by these new telephone charges.</P>
      <P>In the Department of Social Welfare we are concerned to ensure that none of the bona fide services provided by voluntary agencies, many of whom work in the areas of poverty and deprivation, will suffer any disadvantage as a consequence of these charges.  I intend to review carefully the position as it will affect each of them in close consultation with the agencies themselves.  I am carefully examining the position of elderly and disabled people living alone.  There are some 105,000 such people in receipt of free telephone rentals at a current cost to the Exchequer of £18 million.  The purpose of that allowance is twofold: first, to allow elderly and disabled people summon help in emergencies and, second, enable them remain active in the community and keep in touch with relatives and friends.  We will carefully monitor the operation of the new charges to ensure that the objectives of this scheme are not undermined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might add that the Department of Social Welfare is among the top five Telecom Éireann customers, paying £2.7 million this year in addition to the £18 million provided for the free telephone rental scheme.  The Department is also a major recipient of telephone calls, occasioned by the substantial number of queries received.  We will be negotiating with <Col N="226" /> Telecom Éireann on the greater use of Freefone facilities or fixed charge calls to the Department of Social Welfare and to other Government Departments.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party as a whole is committed to an ongoing, through review of the proposed charges so that the overall economic objectives are achieved in a fair and equitable manner.  We hope that the process of review will accomplish two things: first, it should take into account the views of a wide number of user groups before the new charges are introduced in September next; and, second, examine the effects of the charges once they are introduced.  The technology exists to enable Telecom Éireann to be reliable and flexible in the application of charges if circumstances dictate that such flexibility is required.  Because of substantial capital investment Telecom Éireann is very technologically advanced.</P>
    <P>Already the Government has established a telephone users' advisory group which, when fully operational, should facilitate an ongoing review of the position. I can promise this House that the Government will take very seriously indeed any information or representations it receives from that group. Indeed, any recommendations it makes will be made public so that the Government can be judged on its response in due course.</P>
    <P>I might reiterate, particularly to Members of the Opposition, that I think they have stated a case for saving jobs in Aer Lingus.  Well, this Government is determined to ensure that the jobs content of Telecom Éireann is also protected. It is grossly unfair to advance an unbalanced argument which ignores the future of Telecom Éireann and which is essentially a subterfuge argument for privatisation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>We are told, quite correctly, that it is our responsibility to introduce policy which will have the effect of reversing the terrible burden of employment and its costs to this nation.  Tinkering around with the system is no longer sufficient.  There has been a root and branch examination undertaken by <Col N="227" /> Culliton and its methods of implementation examined by Moriarty, with both reports now endorsed by Government.</P>
      <P>When the Culliton report was published the question was often asked when its constituent parts were to be implemented.  In fact, there was a criticism of the Government on its slowness in taking on board its recommendations and media commentators and Opposition Deputies availed of the opportunity on several occasions to call on the Government to implement the suggested reforms without delay.  One of the first such reforms undertaken was the telecommunications tariff re-balancing package announced by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.</P>
      <P>Telecom Éireann has a debt in excess of over £1,000 million which must be repaid to the Exchequer, its shareholder, and it will spend in excess of £100 million this year on maintaining and improving the service available.  We must all acknowledge the huge investment there has been in the telecommunications network, resulting in vastly improved levels of service all round.  We should remember that this network is a national asset which continues to be improved, taking account of new technology and more importantly, competing with overseas forces.  The latter require Telecom Éireann not only to be at the cutting edge of technological change but also to be competitive with its large multinational competitors, who could undermine its profitability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, ATT and MCI, both international giants, have already become more competitive than Telecom Éireann on international routes.  Callers simply apply for a call card which gives them access to an ATT or MCI operator. That operator can connect them to any destination in the United States, Europe, or vitually any other country at cheap local call rates after billing for the initial call.  Already Telecom Éieann is currently losing approximately £15 million from this international competition.  In addition its market share on United <Col N="228" /> States and Australian routes has fallen from 50 per cent to 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>In recent years we have witnessed companies from abroad, particularly from America, setting up here and employing large numbers of workers.  One of their main reasons for doing so was our telecommunications links, which are on a par with any other country worldwide, and a highly educated workforce who are computer literate.  With the reduction in international telephone charges the Industrial Development Authority henceforth can quite properly and forcefully seek other administrative-type companies to locate here.</P>
    <P>As a Deputy from the west I am enormously aware of the many impediments which business tourism and consumer interests had to withstand over many years because of the remoteness of our location <i>vis-à-vis</i> our capital city, where all our main State, semi-State and commercial concerns are located.  For example, every time a person from my constituency telephoned Dublin, Galway or Cork they were penalised due to our peripherality whereas businesses located in Dublin had a competitive advantage. Many people in my constituency who have to use the telephone for business are well used to ensuring their calls are kept to a minimum as invariably calls to our capital city were trunk calls and people could not afford the luxury of an indefinite duration.</P>
    <P>Costs to industry must be reduced.  If companies are to continue to successfully penetrate European markets it is vital that the tariffs imposed on international calls are reduced to levels which allow exporting firms to become more competitive. From September it will cost £1.09 plus VAT for a three minute call to a near European country, the second lowest rate in the EC.  The old rate of £1.83 was the dearest of seven EC states and almost twice the cost of the UK rate. The charges will mean a £60 million pound reduction in the cost of internatonal calls, two thirds of which will accrue to business users.  There will also be £21 million in savings in the cost of certain trunk calls within Ireland which <Col N="229" /> will also be helpful to business.  The reduction in the A rate trunk call for calls up to 56 kilometres is a further improvement. Such calls will be reduced on average by 25 per cent from 1st April 1994.  I note the Minister's commitment to making further reductions as resources permit until Telecom get to a stage where the short trunk rate and local rates merge and there is only one national trunk rate. How often have we heard that the cost of doing business was prohibitively high in Ireland? The Telecom package will go some way towards levelling the playing pitch and improving our competitiveness in international markets.</P>
    <P>Coming from an area whose economy is increasingly dependent on tourism the package contains attractive features, not only for tourism operators, be they small bed and breakfasts or large hoteliers, but also for people from Ireland and overseas who now have an opportunity to visit our tourist resorts in that their telephone charges will be drastically reduced.  Tourism is not an industry that operated from Monday to Friday but, during the season for seven days of the week.  The introduction throughout the entire country including Northern Ireland, on Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays of trunk calls charged at a special rate of ten minutes is an additional boost to users of the telephone system.</P>
    <P>Many private householders who have sons and daughters living in this city will be able to keep in closer contact with their families by intelligently using the cost structures and benefits built into the rebalancing package.  We all know of fathers and mothers in our constituencies who are in receipt of social welfare benefits and who could never enjoy the luxury of telephoning their children who work away from home, unless in emergencies, these people can now feel free to use the telephone at the weekend without wondering about their ability to pay their telephone bill.</P>
    <P>There are many attractive features to the Telecom package.  As has been stated, it now introduces choice where none existed before.  Already more than 100,000 old age pensioners and handicapped <Col N="230" /> people living alone are entitled to free telephone rental.  The Minister has had an analysis carried out of the bills of all old age pensioners and he will have to ensure that no hardship will arise for that general group of customers.  I welcome the changes announced here last night by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I accept in general the figures which have been produced to show the distribution of the share of benefits and costs arising from this package and quite clearly timed local calls will bring in substantial additional revenue.  However this is subject to the proviso that there is little or no change in the pattern of usage in the local call area on timed telephone calls.  Telecom is absorbing £15 million pounds of the savings which are being distributed to both business and residential customers and there is marginally greater savings to business as a result of their use of the international portion of the network.  We are doing no service to the Irish public by creating hysteria and trying to mislead and deceive people as to the overall thrust of this package.</P>
    <P>Telecom has proven to be one of the successes of the semi-State sector.  The last overall increase was in 1986, with Telecom absorbing inflation in the meantime. In January 1992 there was a reduction of 33 per cent in national trunk call charges and, together with this package, that has cost Telecom £65 million. Prices have reduced by 34 per cent in real terms since 1986.  Wild predictions can now be made as to the effect this package will have on residential as well as business customers, but we can be certain of one thing, that if Telecom had not been committed to an investment programme and to reducing its charges to both business and residential customers since 1987, the levels of unemployment would be even greater than they are.</P>
    <P>The Opposition motion refers to the overall cost levels of Telecom Éireann. However, it has to be acknowledged that Telecom Éireann has already shed 5,000 jobs since 1985 and all indications are that further jobs will go within the next few years.  In facing international competition the company will have to continue <Col N="231" /> to increase its productivity, level of service and number of subscribers.  At present there are 1.1 million subscribers and Telecom predict that this figure will rise to 1.36 million over the next five years.  There has been a substantial increase in the use of mobile telephones, and usage is expected to increase by 500 per cent over the next five years with further development in the use of data transmission service.</P>
    <P>Telecom Éireann's original plan was to have been much tougher on the consumer. I commend the Minister for examining all aspects of the proposals put forward to him by Telecom and coming up with a package which is well balanced, which will permit for four out of every five telephone calls to be cheaper than heretofore, which introduces choice for the consumer where no choice existed before, which will permit for greater usage of the telephone system where, heretofore, the cost was prohibitive, especially for long distance calls, and which will allow Telecom Éireann to ward off competition and protect its customer market.  This rebalancing package was not introduced with a view to gaining extra revenue for Telecom &mdash; the company is contributing £15 million from its profits &mdash; but was primarily introduced to ensure that we are not left in five or six years' time with a skeleton of a national telecommunications company that would have to discharge an expensive social mandate on the unprofitable aspects of its business, leaving the more profitable and lucrative business to an increasingly competitive EC communications market. As Damien Kiberd stated in one of the Sunday newspapers &ldquo;The reality is that business customers were heavily crosssubsidising domestic telephone users and losing overseas markets as a consequence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In my constituency there are 18,000 telephone subscribers within the local call area whereas in the Dublin local call area there are 411,000 subscribers.  That gives some idea as to the disadvantages of that system for people in the west.  I commend the Minister for introducing this package.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="232" /> I have no doubt it has many attractive features, not only for businesses but for residential customers who use their telephones intelligently.  I welcome last night's announcements.</P>

      <P>I was surprised at the motion put down by the Progressive Democrats.  Suddenly great emphasis is placed on local calls. Previously people in the west had to pay more for short distance calls.  When I started a campaign seven years ago to ensure that these calls were charged at the same rate applying in Dublin there was silence.  People may say local calls are charged at the same rate throughout the country, but that depends on the definition of &ldquo;local&rdquo;.  Up to four years ago if I made a telephone call from Cornamona to somebody down the valley it was considered a trunk call; if I made a call from Clifden to Galway it was considered a trunk call and if I made a call from Doire Iorrais to Rosmuc, which is three miles away, it was considered a trunk call.  I would have paid 15 times more for these calls than for a local call in Dublin.  The ludicrous situation existed whereby in an area such as Clifden the number of local subscribers was 1,500 compared with 411,000 local subscribers in Dublin.  For too long people in the west have paid a hidden subsidy.  This was a pernicious and expensive system. Those using the telephone in the west had to pay a disproportionate amount for their calls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On foot of the changes brought about four years ago the average bill in the 095 area and the 092 area, in which I live, was reduced by one-third to half the previous cost.  However, we still pay much more for telephone calls than our city counterparts because much more of our short distance calls are considered under the existing system to be trunk calls.  At that time I asked what justification there was for charging 15 times more for a call from Cornamona to Galway than for a call from one part of Dublin to another.  At that time the computers were connected in such a way that, for 11p, people could stay on the telephone for as long as they wished.  Anybody who knows anything <Col N="233" /> about telecommunications knows that there is no cost justification for such a scheme.  The rebalancing a few years ago helped to redress a patently unjust system, but it went only a small way as there are still parts of the country in which there are only 8,000 subscribers in the local call areas.  There are a great many areas in the country, including my own county where a telephone call to the county town, about which we hear all the weeping, is a trunk call.  In some areas it is still a trunk call to ring the local hospital or the local county council office but we heard very little about that from the Opposition spokespersons.  At present somebody in Clifden who wishes to contact the local geriatric home in Loughrea must make a trunk call.  A great many people do not understand the system. They think all calls within the 091 exchange area are local calls but it is broken up into three different areas and if somebody like me who lives in Cornamona has to ring the Teagasc office in Athenry, he has to make a trunk call. Indeed it is a trunk call to ring the psychiatric unit in Ballinasloe.  Members on the Opposition may laugh but these are the realities of life for people in the west.</P>

      <P>All over the country we have to pay trunk rates for what are essentially local calls because it was arbitrarily decided to draw a line on the map. Calls within a designated area are regarded as local while outside it, they are trunk calls. Two things are being done in this package; first, there is a commitment to reduce by 25 per cent the &ldquo;A&rdquo; rate calls, the Minister has gone further and given <Col N="234" /> a clear undertaking that it is his intention, over time, in line with a proposal I made a few years ago, that the &ldquo;A&rdquo; rate charge and the local charge will merge to bring equity to the system and that those living in rural areas would not be permanently penalised for having access to essential services and ringing relatives.</P>

      <P>We must remember that by percentage of population the offspring of people in the west tend to be more scattered than those born in Dublin.  As a consequence of these proposals the Minister has made it possible to contact anyone in Ireland at the weekend for ten minutes for the cost of a local call.  Conveniently, all these things have been skipped over.  When asked questions about this rebalancing exercise, I have stated clearly how I will measure it in practice: by noting if the average telephone bills in the west come down. Obviously someone will have to pay for that although there is a net contribution of £50 million from Telecom Éireann. The west cannot continue to subsidise the east.  The population in the main urban centre will have to bear a more equitable part of the load than they have up to now.  We know they have been loath to do this, indeed they did not object when we had to pay by the minute, not per three minutes, for local calls.  The weak communities in the west could be dismissed out of hand and told they did not count because they did not have the population numbers.</P>

      <P>I see what is happening now as part of a process &mdash; in which I played a big part initially &mdash; to bring <Col N="235" /> equity into the telecommunications system.  I argued that technology should make it possible to call any part of Ireland from another for the cost of a local call. There is no logical reason for setting up arbitrary local call areas because that relates to the days when the telephone lines went along the railway lines and people had to crank the handle to put the call through from one operator to another.</P>
      <P>The Deputies want to preserve the <i>status quo.</i>  Members are concerned about possible adverse effects of the change in duration of local calls.  I would be the first to admit that if I thought it would impose a cost greater than the reduction for the majority of my constituents I would be very concerned because we have already paid more than our fair share for telecommunications services.  I believe that when the jigs and reels are over, we in the west will find there is regional rebalancing and that the basic service is costing the same as those on the east coast.  This has been denied to us for too long and we will not tolerate it any longer.</P>

      <P>I am very glad the Progressive Democrats Party has used its Private Members' time to put this issue on the agenda of the House and given us the opportunity to condemn the Government's decision to increase local telephone charges.  The motion before us rightly condemns the huge increase in local charges but it does not propose any remedy, does not address the savage and avoidable increase in VAT on telephone bills and the wider issue of telecommunications policy.  The contributions of Deputies O'Malley and Cullen last night were over critical of Telecom Éireann and, by implication, its staff.  They placed an undue emphasis of what they consider to be the advantages of competition in the telecommunications industry and, by extension, their ultimate desire to see the privatisation of Telecom.  For these reasons the Democratic Left is proposing an amendment to the motion which calls for a revision of the unacceptable increases in local charges which will hit domestic subscribers and many small businesses; the reversal of the decision to pass on the full VAT rate to subscribers and the production of a comprehensive telecommunications policy setting out its strategy in regard to EC liberalisation of telecommunications and its implications for Telecom Éireann.</P>
      <P>I am making that point at the outset of my contribution because while all the Opposition is united in its rejection of the Government's so-called rebalancing, Democratic Left has a somewhat different perspective on the future of Telecom Éireann and on telecommunications policy from the other Opposition parties. We are committed to Telecom Éireann remaining in public ownership and to the protection of the employment of the staff of Telecom Éireann who have made such a valuable contribution in turning that company around to profitability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the reality is that the vote which will take place in this House at 8.30 p.m. will be on the Government's amendment, which explicitly expresses approval for the action of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, <Col N="237" /> Deputy Cowen, in authorising the new package of telephone tariffs.  We will be voting against the Government amendment. It is strange that those Government Deputies, whether from Fianna Fáil or Labour, who are expressing reservations, as Deputy Ó Cuív did in his aguisín, that there should be a revision of the decision on local charges and who are telling their constituents privately that they are opposed to the Government decision, will have the opportunity of going into one or other lobby at 8.30 p.m. this evening.  Any Government Deputy, from whichever party, who goes into the lobby to support the Government amendment is, in effect, giving the Minister a clap on the back and is voting for the increase in local telephone charges.</P>

      <P>Scripts for the <i>Connacht Tribune</i> are no substitute for a vote here this evening.  The impact of the charges on the domestic consumer and on small businesses has already been well articulated. Indeed, on the Adjournment debate last week I raised the issue with the Minister.  What is most astonishing about the whole issue is the Minister's insistence on representing as pro consumer a decision which the consumers well know will cost them money.  I cannot understand why the Minister does not simply come clean and tell us straight that the so-called rebalancing is a deliberate shift in the national telephone bill in favour of large businesses with a lot of international telephone use which is to be paid for by the domestic user and by small businesses.  The reason for the shift is that Telecom Éireann, as a consequence of EC liberalisation of telecommunications, is facing competition for the international business by multinational telephone companies who have no interest whatever in the domestic consumer, no interest in supplying telephones to Deputy Ó Cuív's constituents in Cornamona or Rosmuc and who are interested only in the plum end of the <Col N="238" /> market &mdash; the international telephone calls.</P>
      <P>It would be possible to disagree but at least to respect such an honest explanation of the so-called rebalancing but what we have had from the Minister has been a deliberate attempt to sell the pass on the public.  This is Government by public relations.  Announcements are made, not to the Parliament where one is accountable, but to a press conference where the message is prepackaged and is intended either to confuse or to mislead. Fortunately, on this occasion the public have seen through the scripts and excuses and recognise the Government's decision for what it is &mdash; an increase in the domestic telephone bill.</P>
      <P>Last evening the Minister declared, and I quote: &ldquo;The facts are that overall telephone charges are being reduced&rdquo;. This is the kind of nonsense that used to tell us that the economy was improving while more and more people were losing their jobs and being driven into poverty. The Minister declared it was a net reduction in the average charge for calls on residential bills.  He must know there is no such thing as an average telephone bill any more than there is an average family of two and three quarters children. Indeed, the average bill he produced is based on an analysis of telephone calls in the most unrepresentative of all months, December.  From that analysis he informs us that the average bill is £7 for local calls, £5.70 for trunk calls and £6.56 for international calls from which he concludes that the average residential customer spends almost as much on international calls as on local calls and therefore that the rebalancing will benefit the customer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does he not realise that because of the holiday season local calls, and especially local business calls, would normally be reduced and that the average domestic subscriber is more likely to telephone a &ldquo;happy Christmas&rdquo; message to an emigrant relative at that time of the year? The analysis on which the Minister's entire case is based rests on a month in which the balance between local and international calls is distorted and, therefore, <Col N="239" /> his conclusion that rebalancing will benefit the consumer is entirely false.</P>
    <P>The public outcry can hardly have come as a major surprise to the Minister, because when announcing the charges last week he took the trouble to circulate his backbenchers with a letter which anticipated the outcry.  The letter stated:</P>
    <P>There will inevitably be an adverse reaction to some aspects of it, particularly those related to the timing and charging for local calls.  Much of the complaints will be based on inaccurate or incomplete information and the purpose of this letter is to enable you to respond to any complaints which may be made to you.</P>
    <P>It was remarkable that he could predict the inaccuracy and incompleteness of a case he had not yet heard.</P>

      <P>Yesterday the Minister came into this House and attempted to defuse public anger.  He offered two olive branches to the angry consumer &mdash; a new telephone users' advisory group and £500,000 of Telecom's own money to fund free Helpline calls.  There is acute irony in the establishment of a telephone users' advisory group after the decision <Col N="240" /> has already been made to increase charges.</P>
      <P>The Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, provided for a Telecommunications Service Users Council of between ten and 20 members whose functions would be to consider complaints and representations on behalf of users and to advise the Minister or the company on any matter relating to its services.  This is the body which should have considered Telecom's position and which should have been asked for advice on the proposed rebalancing of tariffs.  In 1987 the users' council was abolished by the then Minister for Communications, Deputy Ray Burke.  The abolition was given legislative effect by the Restrictive Practices (Amendment) Act, 1987, which repealed sections 48 and 49 of the 1983 Act.  The then Minister, Deputy Ray Burke, justified the abolition of the Telecommunications Service Users Council in a Dáil reply to Deputy De Rossa on 15 October 1987, when he said at column 430 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>The Government as part of their ongoing review of public expenditure, decided to disband the two councils</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the other was the Postal Service Users Council&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>with effect from 4 July 1987.</P>
      <P>He went on to make it clear that his Department had responsibility to ensure that Telecom Éireann provided satisfactory services to the public.  Many of the Deputies, including the Minister who supported the abolition of the Telecommunications Service Users' Council in 1987, are still here.  They will vote for the increases in telephone charges and try to assuage public anger by setting up a new telephone users group after the damage is done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have further news particularly for Deputy Ó Cuív, who has now left the House, that his own Minister is participating in discussions and decisions at European Community level.  A report in the briefing which the Commission circulates to us informs us of an agreement which was reached on 10 May regarding <Col N="241" /> further measures on the liberalisation of telecommunication services.  Deputy Ó Cuív must know that it costs in the order of £20,000 to bring telephone service to many remote parts of his own constituency. When Deputy Ó Cuív experiences the effect of full EC liberalisation and the cost-based tariff structure, he will have less cause to quibble about the charges being imposed on the relative cost of phone calls between Rosmuc and Dublin than on the decisions in which his own Minister is now participating.  They will create a real problem, because when competition comes there will not be many multinational telephone companies interested in supplying telephone services to Rosmuc, they will be interested in getting a bigger slice of the telephone business.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Gilmore for allowing me some of his time.  As far back as 28 February 1991 I had a motion on the Order Paper in which I asked the then Minister not to increase charges because of the effect it would have on the old, the underprivileged, the lonely, the depressed and so on.  On 17 April 1991, when the then Minister introduced time charges, I described them in the following terms: that the decision by the Minister to allow the timing of local calls was the thin end of the wedge.  I make a confident prediction that a process has now begun, a recurring feature of which will be announcements of a reduction in the time for local calls.  I take no pleasure in being right in relation to that, but then I was not entirely right, I did make some mistakes. I did not take some matters into consideration.  I did not think at that time that from unlimited time to 15 minutes to three minutes would happen in less than two years.  It took the British 25 years to do that.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have to point out to my constituency colleague that in Government one cannot have it both ways.  One has to accept the responsibility of being in Government, and the Minister is as responsible as Fianna Fáil for these charges.  She went on to say, &ldquo;No matter how painful or difficult, we cannot allow it to be said that this Government is prepared to shirk necessary decisions&rdquo;.  I agree entirely. Governments should not shirk necessary decisions, but they should not take such <Col N="243" /> decisions at the expense of the old, the infirm, the lonely, the depressed, and the most deprived and under-privileged in our community.  That is not a decision for Governments to take, and if they take it they must carry the responsibility for it.</P>

      <P>The so-called Minister for poverty went on to say, &ldquo;In my own Department of Social Welfare we are concerned that none of the bona fide services provided by voluntary agencies will suffer any disadvantage as a consequence of these charges&rdquo;.  Then, instead of going on to announce what measures and additional money she intends to make available in order that people will not suffer she said, &ldquo;I intend to carefully review the situation&rdquo;.  She said: &ldquo;I am carefully examining the situation as regards elderly and disabled people living alone and we in the Labour Party will carefully monitor the operation of the new charges and the Labour Party as a whole is committed to an ongoing review of the proposed charges so that the overall economic objectives are achieved in a fair and equitable fashion.&rdquo; Live horse and you will get grass.  To what is the Labour Party committed?  This is just not good enough and it is particularly not good enough for a Minister for poverty, particularly from my constituency, to express such sentiments.  I challenge the so-called Minister for poverty, my constituency colleague to debate these charges anywhere in our constituency &mdash; and she can select the venue.  Let us debate these charges and let us see whether the people are going to be taken as suckers in regard to some of the things that she said here.  I issue that challenge publicly and I hope she will accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Something had to be done about the cost of international calls.  Due to remoteness from international markets we are more reliant on telecommunications than others and the high cost of telephone calls was obviously costing jobs.  We cannot afford to lose those jobs and something <Col N="244" /> had to be done.  Telecom Éireann is under pressure from the European Community since 1988.  There have been seven anti-monopoly directives and the monopoly days are gone.  Competition has been forced by the European Community not only on our national telecommunications company but on others also.  That was inevitable and something had to be done in the face of that.  Yes, we have had a telecommunications revolution. The use of satellites will allow mobile users to telephone any where in the world.  I thought it was going to take some time yet but I saw Minister Spring pictured on television using a mobile telephone. His monitoring of the situation of the United Nations at the time was being done from a mobile telephone in Spain, so obviously the technology is here. Something had to be done and Culliton told us what had to be done.  Culliton suggested a three year plan to make Telecom Éireann more commercial, the sale of extra capacity in trunk lines, the bringing forward of legislation to enable Telecom Éireann to trade commercially and the offering of consultancy services like the ESB.  There was not one proposal but a number of proposals.  One proposal was taken out of context.</P>
    <P>We have heard a great deal about privatisation. The trade union movement and, when in Opposition, the Labour Party have campaigned against the privatisation of Telecom Éireann.  Fine Gael also believes that Telecom Éireann should remain in public ownership but it must be competitive.  That valued and zealously guarded position of Telecom Éireann is now being menaced by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications and the board of Telecom Éireann.  I have always believed that if there is anything worse than a public monopoly it is a private monopoly, but could a private monopoly have been more uncaring to the needs of the old, the handicapped, the lonely, the depressed and the underprivileged than has been the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications in this whole affair? Could a private monopoly be more insensitive than the Minister has been to the <Col N="245" /> needs of the young for whom the telephone has become an integral part of social intercourse?  Could a private monopoly be more ruthless in the pursuit of greater profit at the expense of local industry and business?  Could a private monopoly have been more economical with the truth in its efforts to cover up its real intentions?</P>
    <P>A real and serious disservice has been done to Telecom Éireann by the Minister and its standing among the ordinary public has been dangerously eroded. Apart from the financial aspects the Minister's decision has serious social consequences. The telephone is no longer a luxury and I object to being patronised by Big Brother Brian when he pontificates to us on its usage.  The way we use the telephone is, in the words of the yarn, part of what we are.  It is not the responsibility of Minister Cowen to force us to be otherwise.  We like to think we are a caring society, putting people before profits. Part of our &ldquo;céad míle fáilte&rdquo; is not to bark stark messages down telephones. We like to think we are a family based society but the inevitable rows, particularly in families with teenage children, will be very disruptive of family life.</P>
    <P>I have not, since my entry into politics here, seen people more angry than over this decision and the patronising and Machiavellian way it has been handled. My advice to those who have expressed their anger to me has been not to get mad but to get even.  When the bell eventually tolls for this Government it may be a telephone bell.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the previous speakers in wholeheartedly condemning the Government <Col N="246" /> for attempting to force such an iniquitous charge on the people.  One cannot blame the general public for becoming cynical about politicians.  This is one of the most serious debates affecting the general public since I became a public representative and all but three out of the 101 Government Deputies are prepared to come in here in half an hour and vote against their conscience to support Telecom Éireann.</P>
    <P>The case has been very eloquently made for a restructuring and a rethink in regard to the charges proposed by Telecom and the Government.  If a company in private hands is to operate a fair system it must have competition, but Telecom Éireann does not have competition.  Telecom Éireann is doing a good job in depending on stool pigeon politicians.  I do not wish to be offensive, but it is deplorable that people can come in here and read scripts, undoubtedly prepared by a senior civil servant with a vested interest in Telecom and the protection of State and semi-State industries.  It is a scandal that we are about to pass a motion penalising old people, the under-privileged and the handicapped in particular, some of whom were protesting outside this building in wheelchairs today.  In many cases, the telephone is their only access to the outside world.  I do not know how Deputy Ó Cuív could say what he did given that he has been nicknamed &ldquo;young Dev&rdquo; and on many occasions has personified the views of his late great-grandfather.  The light will go out on this Government if it continues its present policies.  It is a scandal that any of us should even contemplate voting for these charges.  I am not affiliated to any party, but it must be wrong when the Progressive Democrtats and the Democratic Left are voting together on this issue.  My three minutes must be nearing an end because I hear the pips on the telephone.  I will support the Progressive Democrats' motion and I hope the Government will reconsider this matter on behalf of the old, the underprivileged and others about whom I spoke.</P>

      <P>The local response to this issue has been overwhelming.  Since my election to this House no other issue has got so many people's backs up.  It is important to reflect on the policy behind this issue about which very little has been said.  We are embarking on a process which is, supposedly, about maximising export production and, to that end, complying with an overall trend in EC policy epitomised through the Single European Act and Maastricht.  Apart from the shortfalls in that policy from a Green Party point of view, it is now obvious how its cost will be borne, mainly by people who have the least to say in the matter, the ordinary people who have to endure the extra charges.  If it is not too difficult for people to understand, it will also have to be borne by the earth because increasing local charges and encouraging exports will incur a huge waste of energy.  Profitable exports incur a huge waste of energy in long term travel, to tell people that it is more profitable to drive down the road to have a chat with their neighbours also incurs a huge waste of energy locally.  The old idea of letting your fingers do the walking has gone, it is now your feet or fast car which do the walking.  That is bad for the people, bad for the earth and people who consider those matters important cannot agree with this policy.</P>

    <P>The quality of life is being destroyed. Accountancy is coming into the family and people will have to watch the clock all the time.  This will have adverse effects on people from a mental and financial point of view.  I was on the telephone to the Department of Social Welfare today and after holding on for five minutes I had to leave and call back later.  That is an example of what people will have to do on a regular basis.  People in wheelchairs, local business people, the elderly and people with disabilities protested outside <Col N="248" /> this House today in regard to the increased charges.  Telecom Éireann got it wrong.</P>
    <P>The body which is being set up, very belatedly and almost cynically &mdash; the telephone users' advisory group &mdash; will have to report back quickly because people will suffer from the increases.  Will the Minister state when it will report back? Will it be able to recommend anything binding?  How will we balance the figures without disadvantaging those who can least afford it &mdash; and the earth itself?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Probably in Europe, like yourself.  Deputy O'Malley claimed that cross-subsidisation of international telephone calls, by local telephone calls was being introduced and we also heard him warn that Telecom Éireann could face a substantial fine.  We further heard him advise us that Telecom Éireann could be faced with having to compensate subscribers for the excess moneys charged to these same subscribers, because of the new local charges and timing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to set the record straight for <Col N="249" /> Deputy O'Malley and indeed this House. For many years now highly profitable international telephone traffic has been subsidising the unprofitable local telephone traffic.</P>
    <P>This was a situation, which caused little or no difficulty, when public network operators were State owned monopolies sheltered from the dangers of competition. It was universal, it did not lead to industry in one country having cost advantages, over industry, in another country.</P>
    <P>How was this highly profitable international traffic achieved?  It is not many years ago since there was little international traffic and cable capacity was very low.  To make a telephone call to the USA involved ringing the operator who called back after connecting the call, through maybe five or more operators in Ireland, the UK and the USA.  Advances in technology, such as direct dialling facilities and greater capacity on international cables, have greatly reduced the costs of setting up international calls. Consequent increases in the number of international calls have also led to increased profits.</P>
    <P>The cost reductions achieved, in setting up greater profits received from international calls were not passed on in full to those making international calls. Rather they were used, as a matter of Government policy, both here and elsewhere, as a subsidy, towards the costs of making local telephone calls.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Cowen, said last evening in relation to VAT, that it might have been wiser to pass on taxation to subscribers as it arose.  The same could also be said of the reductions made in the costs of setting up and transmitting international telephone calls.  These reductions are now being passed on.  It is an inevitable consequence of the liberalisation of the telecommunications services and of EC policy, that it should be so.  Similarly it is an inevitable consequence that revenues from international services can no longer be used to subsidise local telephone traffic.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Malley suggested that the new pricing package constituted, at least in part, a differential price structure which was not commercially decided and which had the effect of abusing a dominant position.</P>

We are both responding and adhering to that statement.</P>

      <P>I would like to correct Deputy O'Malley on this point also.  Section 87 (2) (c) of the Act, in relation to the reason for granting an exclusive privilege to Telecom Éireann states:</P>
      <P>the privilege is given to the company, because a viable national telecommunications system, involves subsidisation of some loss-making services, by profit making services.</P>

I can advise the House that throughout the would there are staff reductions in telecommunications operating companies.  AT &amp; T has been mentioned on a number of occasions in this House.  It is obviously a company that is expanding worldwide, with its international services.  It is not so long ago, however, that AT &amp; T announced that it was seeking a 25 per cent reduction in its staffing levels, because of advances made by automation and technology.  This is an inescapable result of development in modern telecommunications technology. Jobs are lost in the operating companies, irrespective or not, be they big or small 3ompanies.

      <P>With regard to my contention last night that these price changes are most likely to be contrary to EC competition law, Article 90 of the Treaty of Rome forbids member states from enacting legislation, or maintaining in force measures which would enable any body to whom &ldquo;special or exclusive right&rdquo; have been given by law to infringe the competition rules of Articles 85 and 86.  Telecom Éireann is unquestionably an undertaking to which Article 90 applies.</P>
      <P>The company now proposes to compate with international telephone undertakings by reducing the cost of international calls and doing so at the expense of customers making domestic calls; in other words by drawing on revenues from the protected domestic sector where Telecom Éireann have a monopoly in order to enable them to compete in the international sector.  I believe this practice is plainly open to challenge as it contravenes Article 90 (1)  of the Treaty of Rome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had the opportunity of listening to and subsequently briefly studying the <Col N="255" /> Minister of State, Deputy Burton's, rather unhappy intervention into this debate.  Her speech was fairly pathetic in its reasoning on this matter where she stated that my suggestion to this effect was absurd.  The Minister went on to explain what she considered European law is on these matters.  She said some cross-subsidisation was permitted under Community law but the cross-subsidisation we have at present where local calls are being subsidised by international calls, is unacceptable to the Community. She said that the Community considers that international calls cost too much relative to local calls.  The community do not think that at all.  The community do not care what is charged for international calls because competition exists but they care a great deal about the charges in the domestic sphere where there is monopoly and no competition and where competition is not allowed under Irish law. The truth is the direct opposite from what the Minister of State, Deputy Burton said and to what the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy said.  The latter rushed in here at a great gallop to try to rectify some of the errors made in the course of the debate so far.</P>

      <P>The case that has now arisen here is clearly covered by the Port of Genoa decision 1991.  It is on all fours with the Belgian RTT case in respect of which the Advocate General of the Court of Justice has expressed his opinion in recent weeks.  Because it is on all fours <Col N="256" /> with it, what happens in the Belgian RTT case is absolutely essential so far as we are concerned.  The Advocate General has said that what the Belgian RTT is doing, which is exactly akin to what Telecom Éireann is purporting to do, is illegal under Article 90 and he has recommended it be struck down.  I understand it is regarded by everybody in the court in Luxembourg as almost a certainty that the court will follow his opinion in this regard.</P>

      <P>Culliton never recommended that what has been done should be done.  On the contrary, he recommended that totally uncompetitive international calls be reduced and that this be paid for primarily by Telecom Éireann reducing its grossly excessive costs.  He called for downward pressure on all pricing and for greater competition.</P>
      <P>In case we were under the impression that the Government had stopped blaming Culliton, it is interesting to examine the first paragraph of Minister of State Burton's speech tonight in which she said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the day the Culliton report was published it has been abundantly clear that some of the measures contained in it would be difficult and unpalatable. <Col N="257" /> The changes in Telecom charges are a necessary part of that process.</P>
    <P>That is total nonsense.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Culliton further called for the resale of leased lines, for a more systematic regulatory framework so that monopoly services would be provided only at cost based tariffs, and that there should be penalties on Telecom for failure to meet quality requirements in service contracts with its customers.  None of these measures has been implemented by the Government.</P>
      <P>Prior to Minister of State Burton's justification on television the other night of the Government's actions by reference to Culliton, another Minister has had an authoritive reminder, I understand, that what the Government is doing is flying in the face of Culliton gives in relation to our telecommunications service is the fact that Telecom Éireann's revenue amounts to 2.7 per cent of our GDP whereas the revenue of every other Telecom in the European Community varies between 1.3 per cent and 1.8 per cent of GDP.  This is despite the fact that telephone usage in this country is lower than in most other countries.  It is obvious from this figure hat Telecom Éireann's costs are totally out of line by comparison with other member states and that the average annual subscriber's bill here, whether business or residential, is higher than the average bill elsewhere in the Community.  As I said last night, I know of no country where the costs per line are higher than they are in Ireland.</P>
      <P>One of the features of the speech of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications last night was that he made various assertions in the text of his speech and then appended to it two tables which he circulated for the Official Report.  The remarkable aspect is that the tables contradict much of what he said in his oral assertions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>For example, almost half of the 727,000 residential or private telephone subscribers in the State will be worse off as a result of the changes in the cost of telephone charges, and that is official.  This sobering information, which contrasts starkly with the claims by the Minister and Telecom Éireann that the cost of the vast bulk of calls is coming down, is contained in a tabulated analysis of all these bills for last December, which the Minister disclosed last night by circulating the particular table.  This analysis of all of the 727,000 residential telephone bills for December last confirms that 44 per cent of them will increase when the price and VAT rises are taken into account.</P>
      <P>The will be very sigificant rises for people who make local calls only.  Their average bill will rise by 16 per cent. A further 34 per cent of residential telephone users who make only local and trunk calls will see their bills rise by an average of over 12 per cent.  Overall there in no change for the remaining 56 per cent of customers who will see the cut in overseas calls cancel out the price increase of their local calls.  This gives the lie to so much of the bamboozling statistics which the Minister was throwing around in his speech, as he and Telecom have been doing for the past week, to claim that the cost of the vast majority of calls will come down.</P>

      <P>Of course, it is not just my view that misleading information was given.  I see that view was also held by my old friend, Minister of State Burton, who said that the announcements surrounding these increases lacked sensitivity, and she stood beside the Minister when saying that.  She went on to say:</P>
      <P>.... I think most Members of this House would agree [I am sure they would] that the misleading and disingenuous advertisements placed by Telecom Éireann were both offensive and unhelpful.</P>

But the second table provided by the Minister concerning the telephone bills of 102,000 old age pensioners is also of interest.

      <P>There is an extraordinary irony also running through the Minister's speech last night that is worth noting.  When he deals with the reduction in the cost of overseas calls he refers repeatedly to competitive pricing and how vital it is.  He listed a number of sectors of industry, where, incidentally, most of the use of the telephone is on a lease line basis so that they are not affected by the charges per call on a public system.  He said that the importance of competitive international tariffs is obvious.  I and my party certainly agree with the Minister on that, but what about the importance of competitive, reasonably priced telephone services for domestic <Col N="260" /> users and for our business and services sectors in particular?</P>

      <P>The Minister seems to assume that the level of costs they have to bear will have no bearing on their competitiveness, whether on the home or foreign markets.  Of course, that is absolute nonsense.</P>
      <P>One travel agent has been in touch with me today to say that he calculates &mdash; and Telecom Éireann agrees with his calculation, because he rang them up and asked them to do it - that his present annual telephone bill of £24,000, 75 per cent of which is represented by local calls, will more than double.  He finds this an intolerable burden and can only stay in business by letting go some of his staff. A lady who owns a telesales company informed me that she has decided to go out of business in September, when these increased charges come in, because she has no other option.</P>
      <P>I would like to endorse the protests of the Irish Wheelchair Association, who demonstrated outside this House today to highlight the dreadful human price that mobility impaired people will have to pay for these major telephone price increases.</P>
      <P>We are entitled to ask whether any independent analysis was done in relation to the proposed rates and Telecom's costs.  Was the analysis done only by Telecom Éireann?  In that event, why should the public believe it is anything other than a self-serving analysis to benefit its monopolist authors?  What is now proposed is a telephone users advisory group to monitor the impact of the increased charges after they have been brought in; and, of course, that group will have no statutory powers or recognition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is this not the appropriate time to reconsider the sale of a large part of the RTE holding in Cablelink to Telecom Éireann and for the Government to order Telecom transfer their holding in Cablelink <Col N="261" /> to another company which would be in a position to provide alternative telecommunications services and to enter into competition with Telecom in order to force it to reduce its costs and tariffs? Is it not also the time to consider the establishment of an office such as Offtel to monitor and regulate closely the monopoly operations of Telecom?</P>
    <P>I find it frightening that the Labour Party should have decided to take the view it has taken.  The Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, Deputy Burton, said that the privatisation of Telecom Éireann was not on the Government's agenda; neither was it prepared to stand by and allow the company to be weakened by competition from companies ten or 20 times bigger. Nobody who spoke in this debate suggested that Telecom should be privatised. It is a red herring which has been dragged into the debate to try to gain support for the untenable position in which the <Col N="262" /> Labour Party finds itself.  It is remarkable that the Government will not allow Telecom to be weakened by competition from other companies.  This may well be the view of the Labour Party, but I wish to remind it that we live in a European Community which has a very different attitude to this matter.  Whether or not the Labour Party or anyone else likes it, they will have to learn to live with competition.  They will also have to learn to live with a situation where they will not get away with the monopolistic practices it was possible to get away with before Article 90 of the Treaty of Rome began to be interpreted in the way it is now interpreted, which is for the benefit of all people in the Community and, in particular, Irish people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for the opportunity to raise this important matter for tens of thousands of Irish women.  The implementation of European Community regulations on equalisation of social welfare is complex and it has been the subject of several court cases in both the Irish courts and the European Court.  The Department of Social Welfare is now using that complexity in an attempt to deprive tens of thousands of women of substantial payments to which they are entitled under EC rules.  The action of the Department is forcing many women to employ solicitors to secure their rights and allowing the legal profession to earn fat fees in the process. The Department of Social Welfare is implementing some of the findings of the European Court on this issue and is making payments of arrears of certain benefits to women in three phases for the period December 1984 to November 1986 and has made a reasonable effort to alert women who qualify for these benefits.  These payments are not the issue and the Department is trying to use those payments to convince the public that all of the requirements of equalisation are being met.  This is not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A separate case was taken on behalf of two Irish women, Anne Cotter and Nora McDermott, claiming that they were also entitled to the alleviation payments which had been operated between 1986 and 1992 but which had been paid to men only.  The matter was referred by the Irish courts to the European Court, which <Col N="265" /> found is favour of the two women in a judgment on 13 March 1991.  It referred the matter back to the Supreme Court, but the Government settled the case on 6 June of that year before the Supreme Court could consider it and paid the two women in question.</P>
    <P>It clearly follows that if Anne Cotter and Nora McDermott had a valid case and were entitled to alleviation payments, tens of thousands of women in similar circumstances are also entitled to these payments.  However, since then the Department had done nothing to make other women in similar circumstances aware that they may qualify for these payments and has done everything possible to withhold information.  The Department is only paying up where solicitors acting on behalf of qualifying women threaten or initiate legal action. I understand hat around 2,000 women in Dublin and 800 in Cork have already received arrear payments where solicitors have intervened on their behalf. In some cases he payments are reported to have been as much as £6,000, but information is hard to come by as a condition of the payment has been that women will not disclose the amount paid.</P>
    <P>Earlier this week I pointed out that what amounted to a mini-industry for the legal profession had grown up around the claims with solicitors from Dublin and Cork advertising regularly in the evening newspapers offering to take cases on behalf of women who qualify for the arrears.  Let me give one example from the <i>Evening Herald</i> last week headed &ldquo;Equality Payments&rdquo; which stated that married women in receipt of social welfare benefits between 1984 and 1992 should seek legal advice on their entitlements. It listed a free telephone number to contact.</P>
    <P>I am also in possession of a letter from a firm of solicitors to a woman who responded to one of these advertisements. The letter asks the women to sign an authorisation allowing it to act on her behalf and states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="266" /> In the event of our being successful we will be looking for fees based on the amount we collect.  If we collect £2,000 we will be looking for £200 plus VAT at 21 per cent.  If it was £4,000 we would be looking for twice that.  In the unlikely event that we were not successful we would not be looking for any fees.</P>
    <P>The veil of secrecy which the Minister for Social Welfare has attempted to draw over the payments makes a mockery of the commitments given in the Programme openness&rdquo; and &ldquo;improving public accountability, transparency and trust&rdquo;.  It is not just women who may qualify for arrears who have been denied information, Members of this House have also been denied it.  For instance, when my cloleague, Deputy McManus, tabled a detailed question on 12 May last asking for the number of women who had applied for and received payments - and the average amounts paid - the Minister failed to supply the information.  Again, as a public representative and a Member of Dáil Éireann, I demand to know how many women have applied for and received alleviation payments due to them and the average amount paid in each case.</P>
    <P>The treatment of women entitled to these arrears, particularly the attempts to keep them in the dark, is an outrage. What is the value of having a Minister for Equality and Law Reform if he turns a blind eye to women still being treated as second class citizens?  Is this the best that the Labour Party can achieve in Government, especially when it has a Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare who claims to be particularly committed to the rights to women?</P>
    <P>The attempts to effectively defraud women of their entitlements are failing. More and more are discovering that they Council for the Status of Women yesterday followed my radio and television <Col N="267" /> interviews with a statement demanding that the Department pays up.  The Minister should now accept that he will not get away with it.  He should be honest, live up to our commitments as a member of the European Community and start paying.  Failure to do so would only make more money for solicitors and may even leave this country open to further embarrassment at European level.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed to a programme of equality which it is proceeding to implement.  It is ironic that Deputy De Rossa expresses concern for this matter when he is campaigning for the reinstatement of the alleviating payments which have been found discriminatory by the European Court of Justice.</P>
      <P>I want to respond at he outset to the allegation by Deputy De Rossa that people who take legal action against my Department will receive payments to which they are not entitled under the equal treatment legisation.  This is not the case and anyone who takes proceedings on the basis of the Deputy's comments will find that my Department will defend any such proceedings in the courts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy rightly said this is a highly complex issue.  As Deputies will be aware, the problem in relation to equal treatment arose as a consequence of a delay in implementing the Equality Directive.  Proceedings were initiated by a number of married women and when the various legal issues were clarified by the European Court at the request of the Irish courts, retrospective legislation was introduced in June 1992. These measures, which are contained in the European Communities (Social Welfare) Regulations, 1992, provide for equality of treatment in respect of the period of delay.  Specifically, they provide for payment of: the increased rate of benefits; the extra three months unemployment benefit; increases for adult and child dependants in the form of a household supplement; and unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>The suggestion that my Department is trying to avoid making payments to the married wormen concerned is nonsense. The Department made extensive efforts at the time to identify all potential beneficiaries by trawling through records of married women who were getting a social welfare payment at the time.  It was not even necessary for women t seek a claim form because we issued a personalised claim form to all those involved.  At the same time, in order to ensure that everyone had been identified, and extensive advertising campaign was undertaken in the newspapers and on radio.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following these efforts by the Department, about 85,000 claims have been received and these are currently being <Col N="269" /> processed in accordance with the provisions of the retrospective legislation. As I said proceedings were initiated before the retrospective legislation came into force arising from the delay in implementing the directive.  In some cases, these proceedings were initiated as far back as 1985.  As the Department has already made known, settlements were made in such cases but we have now provided for equality of treatment in respect of the period of delay.  By any objective criteria, the provisions for paying arrears have to be regarded as being fair and equitable to all concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa specifically referred to the alleviation payments.  A I said, he is campaigning for their reintroduction. As the Deputy well knows, these payments were introduced to cushion families dependent on social welfare who would otherwise have suffered a reduction in their weekly payments on the introduction of the new dependency arrangements in November 1986.  Many families would obviously have entered into financial commitments on the basis of the payments which they were getting at the time and the alleviation payments were introduced to protect the position of those families.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is proposing that we should pay families twice and pay families who not only did not suffer any reduction in payment but whose payments actually increased at the time.  The Deputy may think that this is the most effective way to spend money in the social welfare area but I disagree.  We have allocated almost £60 million to make good the delay in implementing the directive and I see no reason to provide further resources and make double payments.</P>

      <P>Our approach is to target resources effectively.  The cost of the improvements in the social welfare area announced in the budget this year is over <Col N="270" /> £75 million in 1993 and over £180 million in a full year.  In addition to maintaining the value of social welfare payments in real terms, we provided increases well ahead of inflation to those on the lower rates of payment.  Among the many improvements made this year, we provided a substantial increase in the rate of child benefit, increased the rate of carer's allowance by £6.20 per week and significantly improved the position of low paid workers by allocating additional resources for the family income supplement scheme.</P>
      <P>The suggestion by Deputy De Rossa that we pay certain families twice and make payments to families who actually gained from the introduction of equal treatment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure I will be entitled to some injury time because of the altercations between Dublin Deputies.</P>
      <P>The background to my requesting this debate is the discrimination long suffered by the east and south east in regard to harbour development and of coastal erosion protection works.  West of Helvic Head, which is in Waterford, local authority harbours enjoy 75 per cent grant aid from the Exchequer whereas, in the east and south east, grant aid of 50 per cent must suffice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The economic overview in the south east is this: Wexford suffers from the second highest rate of unemployment in any county.  Within this economic black hole the highest levels of deprivation are concentrated on the port and harbour towns of New Ross, Duncannon and Kilmore Quay.  These communities are afflicted by unemployment and depopulation on an appalling scale. Such is the depth of the crisis that both a combat poverty programme and a <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> partnership programme are in operation there.  The key to economic recovery lies in the area's ports and harbours. <Col N="272" /> I have a very simple question to post to the Minister this evening: will he develop the ports of Wexford or allow them to die?  Incisive and urgent action versus irreversible stagnation is the stark choice.</P>
    <P>New Ross harbour is the key to industrial development for south west Wexford. My representations in relation to nrcessary works to the Barrow Bridge and other developments are well known to the Minister.  This debate has been called to focus attention on the fishing ports of Kilmore Quay and Duncannon. I might add that the Minister for the Marine, Deputy Andrews, gave me a personal commitment to visit these parts with me.  The people of south west Wexford, to whom he represents their last and best hope, are still waiting.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan, to renew the promise this evening.  After all, these people deserve and desperately need to have their case examined from the bottom up rather than from the top down.  The Minister of State has shown a genuine interest in the people's plight.</P>
    <P>In reply to a parliamentary question tabled by Deputy Doyle on 5 May there was a promise given that major works would begin at Kilmore Quay this year. I have it on good authority that, to date, no consultations have been appointed. Should this be true the stated timetable must be in grave doubt.  Will the Minister of State put on the record this evening the exact position regarding the promised works for Kilmore Quay?</P>
    <P>The ongoing development of our harbours, in addition to the vital work of protecting our coasts, is chronically hindered by having to pay a 25 per cent premium above what must be paid for such development in the west.  This means an impossible burden is placed on a local authority whose rate base has already been decimated.  Present policy puts Wexford into a vicious, downward spiral.</P>
    <P>I have been representing Wexford in this House for 12 years.  I have yet to hear <Col N="273" /> any justification for the preferential grant rates given west of Helvic Head.  This affair is an example of pork barrel politics at its worst.  Duncannon is an example of what could be done where most desperately needed.  It was the only harbour not damaged in the south-east in the 1990 hurricane.  Furthermore, it is located very close to the shipping lanes into Waterford and New Ross, which fact underlines its development potential.  It is a harbour providing good shelter with access to deep water.  Indeed, frequently vessels from Dunmore East and Kilmore Quay take shelter there.  For all its natural advantages, Duncannon is a harbour whose potential has been stifled.  Extra berthage is needed urgently there and its landing facilities bear no relation to its real potential.</P>
    <P>In Wexford we are not looking for preferential treatment; rather we are seeking equal treatment.  I challenge the Minister to treat all parts of Wexford in the same way as other regions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome Deputy Byrne raising this important issue.</P>
      <P>Under a long standing policy the maximum grant-aid provided to non-State-owned harbours for development works in the fisheries interest has been 50 per cent or 75 per cent depending on geographic location.  All development projects undertaken to the east of a line drawn from Lough Foyle to the Old Head of Kinsale receive a maximum of 50 per cent grant-aid and those to the west receive a maximum of 75 per cent grant-aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation with regard to grant-aid for coastal protection projects is that <Col N="274" /> there is no fixed aid level applied to the east or west of the Old Head of Kinsale. Aid levels are determined by the nature and cost of a particular project and the availability of funds for such works. However, section 7 (e) of the Coast Protection Act, 1963, does stipulate that the level of State assistance shall not exceed 80 per cent.</P>
    <P>In recent years difficulties have been encountered in the carrying out of development projects, identified by the Department of the Marine following consultation with maritime local authorities, as local authorities have experienced severe problems in financial their contribution to development project costs.</P>
    <P>I realist that the local contribution requirement can create difficulties for many local authorities, especially in areas where the maximum grant-aid is 50 per cent.  For this reason the matter is being received with a view to, perhaps, standardising the aid rate, for all areas at a reasonable level.  These rates of contribution were introduced at a time when the internal revenue base of local authorities was substantially stronger than it is today and prior to the introduction of the European Regional Development Fund-financing.  Given the present financing structure of local authorities their ability to raise the present level of contribution from own resources is significantly less than in the past.</P>
    <P>Strong representations have been received from many local authorities on this matter.  As part of the review, discussions have already taken place at official level between the Departments of the Marine, Environment and Finance.  I would hope to be in a position to bring forward proposals very shortly for a revised system of contributions.</P>
    <P>In so far as commercial harbours are concerned, Government policy is that each harbour authority should be financially self-supporting.  State grants are given in exceptional circumstances only where improvements are essential to meet well-defined needs.  The level of <Col N="275" /> grant-aid given in these cases depends on the circumstances of the relevant harbour authority.</P>
    <P>I recently addressed the Irish Planning Institute's national planning conference whose theme this year was the planning of coastal areas and inland waterways.  In the course of my address I made a number of references to emerging policythinking in relation to management of the coastline.  A Cheann-Comhairle, perhaps you will allow me to elaborate on what I said on that occasion.</P>
    <P>Coastal erosion is a serious and growing problem.  The Department of the Marine is currently reviewing its approaches to this problem.  In this regard the way to proceed in the future is to took beyond individual projects and embrace the concept of coastal zone management which gives a comprehensive overview.  I am glad of this opportunity to record in the House that there is close co-operation between the Department of the Marine and maritime local authorities, who have primary responsibility for coastal protection.  This interplay and co-operation is essential in the planning of all coastal protection works.  Indeed, this close co-operation is important to the planning and management of all aspects of the coastal zone.</P>
    <P>Close co-operation with maritime local authorities is also a feature of the planning system for the State foreshore. Present practice involves extensive consultation with the planning authorities who have an interest in any foreshore development which will impart on their services and infrastructure and on the quality of that part of our environmental heritage under their control.</P>
    <P>In summary I would like to assure the Deputy that I am not unaware of the problems of local authority funding of coastal projects, I will do all in my power to rationalise the system and to ease the burden on local charges within the principle of having beneficiaries make a fair contribution to funding or for all local projects. <Col N="276" /> I can assure deputy Byrne I will take Kilmore Quay into consideration in doing so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>There is now a huge sense of outrage and grievance in the south west Cork area because community television has either been taken off the air or threats have been made to do so. The people of Bandon, Clonakilty and Kinsale, and many other towns and villages, have enjoyed multi-channel television programmes for many years solely from community television.  There had been no rental, no connection fee and no hidden extras.  A voluntary contribution of pounds 30 annually is made to cover outgoings. Essentially, the people were fully satisfied with the service provided at the cost of a box of matches per day.</P>
      <P>It is alleged that this service is illegal. I totally reject this approach.  What is available in south west Cork is the same service which is available on overspill in the eastern parts of the country.  Is the suggestion being made that what is legal on the east coast is illegal on the west coast?  Furthermore, why is there so much pressure in particular being exerted on Cork? Deflector systems are operating all along the west coast.  One gets the impression that Cork has been singled out to be put off the air.  I am interested in the situation in Galway, in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no objection to the MMDS system offered by Cork multi-channel TV, being allowed to operate side by side with Community TV.  The old saying is that competition is the life of trade.  I do seriously object to any question of a monopoly.  If the MMDS system is as <Col N="277" /> good as is suggested, why does it not compete with Community TV?</P>
    <P>There is of course the question of cost. A voluntary subscription of pounds 30 a year is in sharp contrast to installation fees for MMDS of £130-£160 and the annual fee of £140-£160.  In addition, I understand that there is a further £95 charge for a movie channel and a £73 a year charge for Sky Sports.  The contrast on cost is enormous, but it is a matter for the private commercial organisation in charge of Cork Multi Channel to justify these charges.  I regard it as entirely unacceptable that people should be forced to pay these charges.  This will have the effect of putting Community TV off the air.</P>
    <P>The further effect of course is that there are many elderly people and others living in deprived circumstances who have come to rely on Community TV over the years and who now just will not be able to afford the other system.  For them the result of the shutdown is that multi-channel viewing will be finished as far as they are concerned.</P>
    <P>Is this what the Minister wants? Is this what the Government had in mind when the original licence was granted to Cork Multi-Channel in 1989 by the then Minister, Deputy R. Burke, to cover Cork county and Waterford?  Is it that some form of monopoly was provided for by the 1989 agreement and that the payment was the paltry sum of £20,000 pounds plus 5 per cent royalties?  Various commitments were made prior to the election by both Fianna Fáil and Labour.  The then Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, now Minister for Jusice, Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, was fully understanding of the concerns of the National Community TV Association and was going to arrange for the examination of the monopoly position of MMDS operators under competition legislation.  She was also going to examine the role of deflector systems in the provision of multi-channel services.</P>
    <P>Members of the Labour Party were <Col N="278" /> even more forthcoming.  Specific promises to introduce amending legislation were made by some of them.  Even since the election the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy M. Higgins, in Cork on 5 February committed himself to conducting an &ldquo;extensive and thorough review of community TV policy&rdquo;.  he also said he would be looking at ways in which community broadcasting could be advanced.  However, every effort to get him to respond to parliamentary questions on the issue has been evaded so far in that he has refused to answer any question on this commitment. Such questions have been tranferred to the Minister for Transport. Energy and Communications.  The worth of all those commitments given by Fianna Fáil and Labour Ministers, TDs and Senators must now be open to major question.  If it was possible before the election to look at the issue of further licences to relay or rebroadcast TB channels, surely it can be done now.  I am asking the Minister to give an unequivocal commitment to do just that so as to ensure that viewers in the south west Cork area can continue in the future to receive TV channels at a reasonable cost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me impress on the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications the serious situation throughout the entire Cork South-West constituency where thousnds of residents who enjoyed the benefits of the South Coast TV network are subjected to relentless pressure and threats of legal action by agents of the Cork MMDS organisation, who seem to be imposing their monopoly in relaying a multi-channel television service throughout County Cork and west Waterford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present shut down of the system in west Cork is a direct result of the relent less pressure brought to bear by that organisation.  Local residents are frustrated that the MMDS system has been given the monopoly by the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications. <Col N="279" /> The people are highly critical of MMDS.  Will the Minister explain why it is perfectly acceptable for MMDS to operate without hindrance alongside deflector systems in Galway, Sligo, Waterford and many other counties, but is not to be permissible in west Cork? Why treat the people of my area with such contempt?  Why is the Minister so uncharitable as to give this monopoly to one group, thereby preventing the weakest section of the community &mdash; the old, the infirm and the unemployed &mdash; from enjoying the same facility as their counterparts in other parts of the country? Will the Minister explain why open competition is allowed along the east coast and parts of the west when citizens in the south and south west are denied this facility.  Moreover, people are afraid that the MMDS system, which is a microwave system, could be, and perhaps is highly dangerous to the health of all those who live in the area where it is in operation.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, may I remind the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications that his counterpart, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy M. Higgins, promised that an extensive survey into community TB will be carried out in the very near future.  Furthermore, the Fianna Fáil and Labour Parties gave a commitment to review the position on national community TV.  Why are the parties which comprise the partnership Government now reneging on their promises?  I call on the Minister to let commonsense prevail and allow South Coast Community TV to operate as usual in the areas where it has given such a successful service over the past seven years at a minimal cost by re-beaming the signal, something which involves no health hazards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised to find this issue raised again in the Chamber so <Col N="280" /> soon after our last debate, as my colleague the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications Deputy Cowen, explained, this issue in some detail to the Deputies on 10 February last.  It has been Government policy for some time now that the legal means of bringing mullti-channel choice to the noncabled public, is through fully licensed MMDS systems.  There are no plans to review this policy issue at the moment. It is not the case that viewers in Cork South-West are denied the privilege of multi-channel viewing by our refusal to grant a licence to illegal deflector operators for the transmission of such services in the area.  The simple truth of the matter is that under the Wireless Telegraphy (Wired Broadcast Relay Licence) Regulations, 1989, Cork Communications Ltd. has been granted an exclusive licence to retransmit television programmes services to homes in County Cork and West Waterford.</P>
      <P>Due to the constraints of good frequency management, the licence is exclusive and was issued only after an open competition for the franchise &mdash; a competition open even to the operators of the illegal deflector systems.</P>
      <P>We are aware that private actions, and the threat of action taken under the Planning Acts and before the High Court, have resulted in the closure of a number of illegal transmitters in the Cork region recently.  Our information is that the MMDS multi-channel service is available to all those homes in the Cork region which were receiving illegal services until recently and this fact has been advertised extensively in the local press throughout Cork.  The contention, therefore, that multi-channel services are not available is far from accurate.</P>
      <P>I hope Deputies are not suggesting that what is illegal in Cork is legal in the east.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Due to frequency management, United Kingdom terrestrial services are available off air in certain eastern areas through sheer proximity to UK broadcasting transmitters.  In Cork, however, <Col N="281" /> these signals are picked up by illegal operators, boosted and retransmitted by them n unlicensed wireless telegraphy equipment in breach of the Wireless Telegraphy Acts of 1926 and 1988.</P>
    <P>These services are available and are being provided in an orderly and legal fashion in a part of the radio frequency spectrum which will not prevent or hinder the development of our own national television services in the future, be it RTE, Teilifís na Gaeilge and any future national television service independent of RTE services.</P>
    <P>Successive Governments, including those in which the Deputies opposite participated have examined this problem a number of times at length and have concluded without exception that it would be neither practical nor in the national interest to licence the illegal rebroadalluded to by the Deputies.</P>
    <P>As was explained here on 10 February last, the basic problem with the deflector systems is that they operate in a part of the UHF frequency band which is governed by an international treaty.  Under the treaty there are simply not enough frequencies available to Ireland to enable a nationwide network of deflector  transmitters to be established and at the same time meet other national requirements, such as RTE's frequency requirements.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that if the noncabled public want multi-channel television &mdash; and all the evidence is that the vast majority of them do &mdash; then MMDS is the only practicable option open to us at present to provide it.  The technical and international binding constraints on us with regard to the use of the radio frequency spectrum. and particularly that part of it used by deflector systems, are such that we believe it is not possible to legalise them.</P>
    <P>The plain truth of the matter is that we simply do not have access to sufficient frequencies, first, to allow country-wide operation of community or deflector systems and secondly, to give viewers in <Col N="282" /> non-cabled areas something approaching the choice of television programmes which are available in cabled areas and still conserve frequency spectrum to meet foreseeable developments in Irish broadcasting.</P>
    <P>Much is often made of the supposed cost differential between services provided by the properly licensed companies, such as Cork Communications Ltd., and those provided by the illegal deflector services. Unfailingly, such comparisons do not compare like with like. The transmission facility per MMDS cell can cost up to £250,000.  There will be up to 29 cells throughout the country.  Up to £250-£300 worth of equipment has to be installed in each subscriber's premises.</P>
    <P>Deputies can readily appreciate,  therefore, that the investment required is sizeable by any standards.  The annual cost to an MMDS subscriber will approximate to the subscriber charge for the more modern cable systems installed in recent years, i.e.  around £100-£124 rental per annum.  While the costs are dearer than &ldquo;deflectors&rdquo; the comparisons made are invalid.  The MMDS system is an 11-channel service and MMDS operators must pay licence fees &mdash;  £20,000 in advance and 5 per cent of annual rental &mdash; VAT and copyright fees , obligations avoided by the &ldquo;deflectors&rdquo;, because  of their illegal status.  Many people complain about the installation charge of around £100 to £125 for MMDS, but forget that every deflector subscriber had to have a UHF aerial installed which we believe in many instances cost £100 or more. In its franchise area, Cork Communications Ltd.  has spent in the region of £3 million on its MMDS infrastructure to date and plants to spend £12 million in total. Added to that is the very significant employment being generated in the  region.  The number of people employed by Cork Communications Ltd.  has grown from 60 to 120 with the advent of MMDS and I understand that the company has plans to employ even more in the future.</P>
    <P>To conclude, I would say that I am not <Col N="283" /> unappreciative of the fact that there has been some controversy about the introduction of MMDS.  I sympathise with those, who have become accustomed to the illegal deflector services.  Nevertheless, I would counsel caution against those who pretend that there are easy solutions to this problem.  MMDS provides the possibility of a professional, high quality multi-channel service on a countrywide basis at a reasonable cost. The service is now available in counties Dublin, Kildare, Louth-Meath, Wexford, Cork, Kerry, Clare, Galway, Sligo, Roscommon and Offaly, and I understand that there are in excess of 28,500 subscribers, of which 3.500 are in the Cork region.  I trust that these facts put the matter in context for the Cork Deputies and that they will communicate the position to their very fine constituents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenahan</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I wish to express my disappointment that the Minister for Health is not in the House to reply to this matter. The provision of a kidney dialysis unit at Tralee General Hospital has been on the agenda since 1985.  On 15 April of that year a deputation from the Kerry branch of the Irish Kideny Association was received by the health committee of Kerry County Council Whose members gave the association its unanimous support for the provision of a dialysis unit at Tralee General Hospital.  In July 1986 a deputation form the Irish kidney Association attended a meeting of  the General Hospitals committee. At that meeting the deputation <Col N="284" /> gave a commitment that if a decision was made to go ahead with a satellite unit at Tralee General Hospital it would collect further funds for a water filtration system and would be willing to provide money through fund-raising for replacement of equipment.</P>
      <P>The Kerry branch of the Irish Kidney Association was established in October 1984 and collected £90,000 within a few months.  In response to the meeting of July 1986 Mr. Christy Walsh, then programme manager of the Southern Health Board, informed the branch in March 1987 that the Department of Health had indicated that it would not be in a position to provide funds towards the running of the proposed dialysis unit.  Before the 1987 general election definite commitments were made by public representatives in Kerry that a dialysis unit would be provided  if Fianna Fáil was returned to power.</P>
      <P>In April 1989 the Kerry branch of the Irish Kidney Association was received by the Southern Health Board in Cork where it was given further assurances and commitments regarding the provision of the dialysis unit.  In June 1992 in reply to a motion at the Southern Health Board meeting, Mr. Pat Madden, acting programme manager, replied that the Department of Health had approved the setting up of a protocol team to discuss the funding  of such a unit.  The report of this committee , when completed, was circulated to health board members.  It detailed the costs and setting up of the unit in the Ratoo Ward in Tralee General Hospital.  The Protocol team estimated that the start up cost would be £351,000. Therefore, the total first year cost would be in the region of £540,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In July 1992 the Kerry branch of the Irish Kidney Association was requested by Mr. Pat Madden to raise a further £84,000 to cover the cost of the water treatment unit, to which the branch agreed. They are actively fund-raising at <Col N="285" /> present and hope to make a further £20,000 from a golf classic in Dun an Óir in June.</P>
    <P>In early November 1992 Dr. John O'Connell, then Minister for Health, gave Senator Tom Fitzgerald a verbal commitment that he would provide £140,000 in the 1993 subvention to the Southern Health Board to fund the unit. Before the November general election Dr. John O'Connell informed Deputy John O'Donoghue that the development of a dialysis service at Tralee  General Hospital was included in developments for consideration for funding in the 1993 Health Estimates.</P>
    <P>On 7 April last in this House the present Minister for Health, Deputy Brendan Howlin, in reply to a matter I raised with him, stated that his Department is currently discussing with the Southern Health Board the provision  of a dialysis unit at Tralee in the context of the board's 1993 service development plans.  I ask what developments have taken place since 7 April? Will the Minister indicate tonight whether the necessary funding will be provided in 1993? How long more must unfortunate dialysis patients in County Kerry wait for a service in Tralee? For many of them it is a matter of life, and death.  Six patients have to travel to Cork for dialysis on a weekly basis and five patients are on home dialysis. These five patients would use the unit in Tralee if it was provided.  Dialysis patients in Kerry who have to travel to devote their entire lives to dialysis, leaving home a 6 a.m. and returning at 8 p.m. or 9 p.m. three days a week, with rest days in between. This situation could be changed dramatically with the provision of a unit in Tralee. Units were opened in Sligo and Letterkenny with two patients and these numbers have since grown.</P>
    <P>Dr. Murnaghen of Cork Regional Hospital has suggested that medical cover could be arranged in co-operation with Dr. D'Arcy of Tralee General Hospital.  The appointment of a nephrology <Col N="286" /> senior registrar at Cork Regional Hospital would enable this to be done with supervision, with a monthly nephrology clinic at Tralee General Hospital as being part of his duties.</P>
    <P>The Kerry branch of the Irish kidney Association has received verbal support form all public representatives in Kerry as well as  written support of two  Ministers for the provision of a kidney dialysis unit at Tralee. Kerry patients need this facility to stay alive.  It is most unfair that they be subjected to the long journey to Cork. The Kerry branch of the Irish Kidney Association has £115,000 in the bank.  They are prepared to provide £140,000.  Surely this should be possible. I acknowledge the work of the Kerry branch of the Irish Kidney Association who has been heroic in its commitment to providing funds.  It is an example to all voluntary groups throughout Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Dea) Willie O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to make it clear that both the Minister and myself are very conscious of the needs of dialysis patients in Kerry and elsewhere in the country.  The Minister is especially conscious of the difficulties encountered by patients who must travel long distances for dialysis services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the provision of services at Tralee General Hospital is a matter for the Southern Health Board in the first instance. Proposals for the establishment of a satellite dialysis  service at Tralee General Hospital have to looked at by the board in the context of its overall service priorities, and the resources  available to meet them.  The 1993 level of non-capital expenditure approved for the Southern Health Board is £185.169 million.  This includes a provision of £1.825 million in respect of the 1993 costs of approved service developments at Tralee General <Col N="287" /> and Cork Regional hospitals, service developments indentified by the board as priorities in previous years.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will agree that these figures represent considerable State investment in the provision of health services in Cork and Kerry.  Earlier today the Minister launched a £20 million action programme to tackle hospital waiting lists, including waiting lists in the Southern Health Board area.  Officials of the Department of Health will be in touch with the health board authorities over the next few days notifying them of their allocations from the waiting list fund. As the Deputy knows, the reduction of waiting times in problem specialities has been a health priority for some time.</P>
    <P>9The Minister is aware that the Kerry branch of the Irish Kidney Association has raised funds for the purchase of <Col N="288" /> equipment for a dialysis unit at Tralee General Hospital.  The Minister and I applaud their commitment to dialysis patients and the generosity shown by the people of Kerry.  The Deputy will agree, however, that the provision of dialysis facilities is a complex matter.  Appropriate medical supervision is essential. There are also considerable ongoing revenue costs involved.</P>
    <P>While no specific funding was provided in the 1993 Estimates in respect of the establishment  of a kidney dialysis service at Tralee General Hospital, I wish to assure the Deputy of the Minister's continuning interest in this matter and that we hope to see the establishments of a dialysis unit at Tralee General Hospital as soon as resources allow.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 20 May 1993.</P>

      <P>, <i>Wexford</i>): The polluter pays principle is a fundamental tenet of both national and EC environment policy and has been explicitly incorporated into the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992. The principle is also established in existing Irish law and policy on waste which provides that waste producers are primarily <Col N="112" /> responsible for disposing of their wastes.</P>
      <P>There is, however, considerable scope for greater application of the polluter pays principle in the waste area through pricing and other economic instruments. In this connection, the recently published recycling strategy study examines a wide range of options, including policy instruments employed with varying degrees of success in other countries.  It identifies some 14 possible policy instruments, including product and raw material taxes, together with an analysis of advantages and disadvantages.</P>
      <P>The issues raised by the study, including that of the incidence of cost, are complex ones and I have asked industrial, local authority, consumer and environmental interests for their views as a first step in the formulation of a comprehensive national strategy for recycling.</P>

      <P>Over the last two years or so, the number of driving test applications on hands has been reduced by some 60 per cent and waiting times have been reduced very substantially.  At present, most applicants for tests are notified of an appointment within three weeks of applying and can be tested within a further five weeks.  Experience has shown that these periods are about the minimum necessary for effective administration and, in particular, that shorter periods result in very high cancellation rates and difficulty in filling cancelled appointments.</P>
      <P>The average waiting period at present (7.1 weeks) is the lowest ever achieved. In the case of the three test centres in Cork, the waiting time is now seven weeks, approximately.</P>
      <P>Of the total of 27,500 applicants as at 23 April, 1993, some 22,000 had been given test appointments.  However, 9,700 of these had either cancelled the appointment or indicated that they do not want a test as yet.  The remaining 5,500 applicants, who were awaiting appointments as at 23 April represent the intake of the previous two-three weeks.</P>
      <P>The operation of the driver testing service is monitored on a monthly basis and every effort is made to ensure that waiting times in all areas are maintained at the lower possible levels.  In addition, arrangements can readily be made to provide tests urgently for applicants who require them because of employment or other considerations.  In these circumstances, I have no proposals for further increases in the corps of driving testers.</P>

      <P>Incineration is widely used internationally as a means both of disposing of different kinds of waste and of industrial and energy production.  Incineration of waste and industrial/energy incineration are licensable processes or activities under the Air Pollution Act, 1987, and the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992.  Licensing would embody appropriate conditions to prevent and limit pollution and must, <i>inter alia</i>, be based on use of best practicable means or of best available technology not entailing excessive costs.</P>
      <P>EC legislation also sanctions the use of incineration on the basis of strict controls designed to ensure the protection of health and the environment.  Council Directive 89/369/EEC provides for emission standards and other controls to prevent and limit air pollution from municipal waste incineration plants.  A draft Directive providing for control of hazardous waste incineration is currently being examined by COREPER.  EC directives also provide for specific limits on emissions arising from large combustion plants and plants which burn waste oils as fuel.</P>

      <P>While there is a reduction of £162,000 in the discretionary element of the 1993 road grant allocation to Roscommon County Council compared with 1992, the overall level of grants allocated to the council for the maintenance and improvement of regional and county roads is higher this year due to an increased provision for special works, including repairs to Athleague Bridge. The special needs of the county have been recognised to the extent that resources and competing demands permit by the provision of a supplementary discretionary grant of £200,000 to the council this year as in 1992.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The final determination of areas to be covered under INTERREG was a matter <Col N="131" /> for the EC Commission.  The Commission used the NUTS III regional classification for the purposes of defining the eligible area.  In the case of Ireland and NUTS III level regions are the former planning regions, and those adjacent to the Border were included. These were Donegal, the North East, Cavan, Monaghan, Louth, and the North West, Sligo, Leitrim.  Under paragraphs 9 and 10 of the INTERREG guidelines some flexibility was allowed in respect of a limited number of measures such as co-operation networks and road infrastructures. This allowed for the inclusion of some suitable projects in areas outside but contiguous to the eligible area, that is parts of Meath, Roscommon and Longford.</P>

      <P>The measures identified by the former Inter-Ministerial Group on Motor Insurance (IMG) designed to improve the cost environment for insurance addressed the <Col N="134" /> problems of the high claims frequency and the costs, mainly legal costs, associated with the settlement of personal injury claims.</P>
      <P>Thus, the measures were aimed at reducing the road accident rate, the incidence of dangerous, drunken and uninsured driving and the effectiveness and the efficiency of the legal system in the settling of personal injury actions in the Courts.  Responsibility for the implementation of the measures, whether by legislation or otherwise, rests with the Ministers for the Environment and Justice.</P>
      <P>A comprehensive list of the measures identified by the IMG were given in this House, most notably on 2nd and 3rd of July, 1991.  The main items identified by the IMG include a number of positive proposals by the Minister for Justice, in relation to strict and sustained enforcement of existing road traffic legislation (via the Gardaí), the Courts (No. 2) Act which increased the jurisdiction of the lower courts and the proposed Court and Court Officers Bill which is designed to further improve the operation of the courts.  In addition the Minister for the Environment proposes amendments to the Road Traffic Acts designed to reduce the accident rate and a new Road Traffic Bill which will introduce harsher penalties for dangerous, drunken and uninsured driving, including the impounding of uninsured vehicles.</P>
      <P>Despite the relative success of a number of measures identified by the former IMG, I am convinced that we will not get a substantial reduction in premiums unless we cap awards for pain and suffering in insurance cases.  I am not suggesting at all that people should not be compensated fully for medical, hospital bills and loss of earnings after an accident, but the balance of the award (the pain and suffering element) is totally out of proportion with the rest of the EC with average awards in Ireland almost 50 per cent higher than the UK and over 70 per cent higher than the EC average.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IMG is being re-activated to continue to provide a focus for the identification and consideration of further <Col N="135" /> measures having the objective of reducing insurance costs.</P>
    <P>Clearly the benefits to motorists in terms of motor insurance premia will ultimately depend on the timing and the extent of their implementation and most importantly the attitude of the insurance industry, the legal profession, other professionals including doctors, and the general public including business and road users.</P>

      <P>Tree Preservation Orders are provided for in section 45 of the Local <Col N="138" /> Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, as amended.  If it appears to the planning authority that it is expedient in the interests of amenity to make provision for the preservation of any tree, trees, groups of trees or woodlands, they may make a Tree Preservation Order prohibiting the cutting down, topping, looping or wilful destruction of a tree, trees, group of trees or woodlands specified in the order except with the consent of the planning authority. A Tree Preservation Order (TPO) is a legally enforceable instrument and any person found guilty of contravening its provisions is liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding £1,000.</P>

      <P>I am aware of concern expressed by retailers about the operation of ESB's retailing activities.</P>
      <P>Steps were taken last year to ensure that ESB's retailing business operates on a more arms length basis from the monopoly electricity business.  Since the September/October 1992 billing period customers making instalment payments for goods bought in ESB shops receive a new style invoice.  This new format distinguishes clearly between payments for electricity supply and instalment payments for electrical appliances and states that supplies will not be cut off for failure to make repayments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider that the change to the billing system has addressed concerns about <Col N="154" /> ESB's retailing business and in particular the allegation that ESB may have been abusing its monopoly position by threatening to cut off supplies to customers who fell behind in appliance repayments.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 119 and 120 together.</P>
      <P>Research is being undertaken, primarily by Teagasc, on the possibilities of converting agricultural crops to transport fuels.  The potential for alternative fuel use in transport is of interest to my Department and is the subject of a seminar which is being organised by EOLAS for 10 June next.</P>
      <P>The potential for energy use of biomass generally is also being considered by a committee set up by the Minister of State at my Department.</P>

      <P>The General Medical Services scheme provides, without charge, general practitioner <Col N="155" /> services, drugs, medicines and appliances to persons with full eligibility.</P>
      <P>General practitioners participating in the GMS are required to provide all proper and necessary treatment of a kind usually undertaken by a general practitioner and not requiring special skill or experience of a degree or kind which general practitioners cannot reasonably be expected to possess.</P>
      <P>Drugs and medicines which are considered necessary for any person receiving services under the scheme must be covered by a product authorisation and must be examined and accredited by the national Drugs Advisory Board.  Alternative medicines and treatments are not eligible for reimbursement under the GMS scheme.</P>

      <P>In common with all Cheshire Homes, the Home referred to by the Deputy is an independent voluntary body over which my Department has no direct control. Neither the health boards nor my Department are involved in the recruitment, pay or conditions of employees in any of the Cheshire Homes.  This is entirely a matter <Col N="156" /> for the management of the Homes concerned.</P>
      <P>I am, however, aware of the financial difficulties being experienced by some Cheshire Homes, including the Home referred to by the Deputy.  I would hope to be able to provide some additional funding in the current year to enable health boards increase their grants to the homes.</P>
      <P>I understand that the staff of the Home referred to by the Deputy have submitted a claim for parity with health board rates to the management of the Home.  Negotiations on this claim which has been referred to the Labour Court are progressing at the moment.  It would be inappropriate for my Department to intervene during the course of these negotiations.</P>
