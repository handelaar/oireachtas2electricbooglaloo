      <P>In view of the fact that the Government was in a great hurry to publish the Glackin report on the same evening as it lost two of its Deputies, is the reason for such so that the Dáil will have an opportunity to discuss that report before the summer recess?  If so, when will discussion take place on the report in view of its implications for legislation for which this House is responsible?</P>

      <P>As Whip of the largest growing group in the House, may I ask the Taoiseach, notwithstanding what he said, whether he agrees that this report, which shows up the parasitic face of Irish business, should be debated here before the summer recess, specifically in view of the fact that a State company paid more than £9 million for a site that was worth only a fraction of that amount?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section gives effect to a decision taken at the Edinburgh Summit amending the Treaties involving the European Investment Bank, to enable the establishment of a new European investment fund designed to deal with unemployment and encourage the growth initiative discussed in Edinburgh and expanded at the recent Copenhagen Summit.  We welcome this new fund primarily designed to facilitate the private sector in undertaking infrastructural and other major products.  The fund is to act as a valuable interface in raising the level of investment when taken in conjunction with the Structural and Cohesion Funds also envisaged at the Edinburgh Summit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1754" /> I will refer to a matter that was given some airing here a few moments ago by Deputy Bruton and that is the question of leaks emanating from the European Commission which are being used by the British media to undermine the Commission, the President of the Commission and Community policies generally.  It is no secret that the British approach over the years has been guided by an attitude which puts British national interest above European Community interests.  The British consistently denigrate and undermine the Commission and its President, but it is part of our national policy to support the Commission and its President as the guardians of the rights of the Community and particularly of the smaller countries in the Community.  The Commission, through President Delors, has been consistently helpful to us in our very valid requirement of fund transfers from the centre to the periphery in order to maintain equality of growth throughout the Community.  That is the whole purpose of the Structural and Cohesion Funds.</P>
    <P>I was in Brussels at the various Council meetings in 1988 when we negotiated the first tranche of Structural Funds for Ireland, amounting to £4 billion, and I know the kind of opposition that came from the UK Government at that time. Through official British Government action, through their contacts in Brussels and through their utilisation of the media, the London based media particularly, the British seek to undermine the Commission.  <i>The Irish Times</i> today reports President Delors speaking at yesterday's Commission meeting saying that he took grave exception to a <i>Financial Times</i> report which cast doubt on whether or not there were funds to meet the £7.5 billion offered to Ireland.  Mr. Delors told Commissioners that this leaking from Commission officials would have to stop.</P>
    <P>The report, which was compiled by Mr. Sean Flynn in Brussels, goes on to state that at the end of the meeting Mr. Delors was given the go-ahead by his fellow Commissioners to resolve the Structural Funds dispute with the Government and <Col N="1755" /> the necessary flexibility that he needed to resolve it.  That is as it should be.  It is the duty and responsibility of the Commission under the treaties we are discussing to take the initiative in this area and, following debate at Council of Ministers and summit level, to make recommendations to resolve issues.</P>
    <P>Since the Edinburgh Summit we have been involved in the negotiations process at various levels with the European Community. It is time that all Deputies and the media faced reality; if one does not pitch one's demands at the required level one will not secure anything near it.  It was the duty of the Taoiseach, as the leader of the Irish delegation at the Edinburgh Summit, to set the figure at £8 billion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>He should have sought £10 billion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the procedure adopted in the negotiations process.  It is ridiculous for Opposition Deputies to suggest that there is anything wrong or unseemly about this; there is a need for strong and hard political negotiations in Brussels.</P>
      <P>During the Maastricht Treaty referendum campaign the figure advanced was £6 billion.  The Progressive Democrats suggested that it was doubtful if that was a realistic figure and mentioned that a figure of between £4 billion to £5 billion would be more realistic.  In any event, the figure of £6 billion was discounted by the Government's critics at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because he adopted a courageous stance at the Edinburgh Summit, the Taoiseach managed to have this figure raised to £8 billion.  That is the right way to do business within the European Community and it is time the media understood this.  I am surprised also that some Opposition Deputies do not understand this.  When a conclusion is reached we can have a full debate in the House and in the media to decide whether the Government adopted the right approach and the figure agreed was the right one but it would be unwise to <Col N="1756" /> engage in speculation while the negotiations are taking place.</P>

      <P>According to reports in the newspapers this morning President Delors is now firmly in charge.</P>
      <P>The following headline appeared in the <i>Irish Independent:</i>&ldquo;£8 Billion Deadlock: Dust-up over EC Gibe at Reynolds&rdquo;. That scare headline was derived directly from London media sources which, in turn, took it from British interests within the Commission and Community institutions in Brussels.  However, these should be discounted by a major national newspaper in this country and not adopted by Opposition spokespersons to denigrate Ireland's case at a time when the negotiations have reached a sensitive stage.  It is important that we secure the maximum amount in Structural and Cohesion Funds.</P>
      <P>We are also aware of the difficulties facing Europe given that it is proposed to enlarge the Community to include central and eastern European countries and the commitments this will entail in terms of European Community funding in the future.  As this is our last opportunity to secure a substantial sum, it is important that we secure the maximum amount possible.  Now that President Delors is in command he will proceed to negotiate with the Taoiseach, the Government and with our European Community partners to finalise the matter.  At that stage we can have a full debate on whether the figure agreed is the right one.  We must remember that the figure which was set at £6 billion prior to the Maastricht Treaty referendum campaign has now been increased to £8 billion.  This would be of enormous benefit to the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taken together, grant and loan funding by way of the European Investment Fund represent the European Community's contribution to the development required here during the next five to seven years to resolve our serious infrastructural and unemployment problems. These can be addressed if we secure <Col N="1757" /> the maximum amount in Structural and Cohesion Funds and utilise them to maximum effect.  We also need to make full use of the European Investment Fund as a loan facility.  Hitherto this was not available but is now being made available to this and other European Community countries to increase employment as envisaged at the Edinburgh Summit.</P>

      <P>I am delighted Deputy Lenihan referred to the controversy surrounding the amount of EC Structural Funds that is being negotiated at present.

      <P>The Taoiseach has tried to misrepresent the position in regard to the stance he took last December.  Deputy Lenihan is a past master when it comes to negotiating skills and coming home with agreements.  I recall, when I was a young politician, the great controversy that surrounded the proposed 50 mile fishing limit.  Deputy Lenihan, who was then Minister for Fisheries, proposed that we should seek such a limit under the European Community treaties.  It would seem that he was quite generous from an Irish point of view as the limit was subsequently set at 12 miles; yet this was considered to be a great achievement at the time.</P>
      <P>I also recall that a promise was given during a Galway East by-election campaign following the death of former Deputy Callanan, that headage payments would be increased four fold but subsequently the Government failed to deliver on this promise.  The same applies in respect of the promise to provide shrubbery in Dublin West&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am making is that Deputy Lenihan's efforts to support the Taoiseach in his endeavours to secure this £8 billion for Ireland are far from satisfactory in view of his past record and experience in these matters.  He has also sought to misrepresent the amount of money we are likely to receive.  A sum of £6 billion over five years is completely different from a sum of £8 billion over seven years.  It is fair to say that this is a typical Fianna Fáil tactic.</P>
      <P>It is disingenuous of Deputy Lenihan to blame London newspaper and media sources for the embarrassing position in which the Taoiseach finds himself.  When the Taoiseach came home from the Edinburgh Summit the money was supposed to be in the bank.  Securing this money was regarded as his greatest achievement as Taoiseach.  He needed some good news to help him form a Government with the Labour Party and save his own political skin as Leader of Fianna Fáil. Unfortunately we now know that nothing was agreed on the amount of the funding. Every Member of this House hopes that the Government will be successful in retaining the 13.5 per cent share of Structural Funds Ireland received in the 1989-93 tranche.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Negotiating for resources on the basis that they were agreed seven months ago seems to be completely different from the negotiation process referred to by Deputy Lenihan.  The Taoiseach came home from the Edinburgh Summit in December 1992 claiming agreement on the level of funding Ireland would <Col N="1759" /> receive.  However, Ireland is now holding to ransom the workings of the European Community in respect of EC Structural and Cohesion Funding because we got it so wrong at the Edinburgh Summit.  No country promoted the need for increased Community financing or outlined the difficulties of peripherality and the problems of unemployment better than Spain. We were rightly happy to hold on to the coat tails of the Spanish in those negotiations and seek an increase in funding for Ireland.</P>
    <P>I wish to avail of this opportunity to ask the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, who has direct responsibility for the National Development Plan, to indicate clearly the present state of play of the negotiations, the likely outcome and whether the wishes and aspirations for the National Development Plan which she has enunciated so eloquently both inside and outside this House will be achieved.  What reductions in expenditure in the various Government Departments will be implemented if we do not get the full amount we originally anticipated?</P>
    <P>There is no point in reaching a successful conclusion to the negotiations if there is no change in national policy.  We can continue, as we have done so often in the past, to throw money at problems but we will not solve any of these problems if we do not create lasting and permanent employment by investing in projects which will create this type of employment.  This is probably the last great opportunity Ireland will have to create permanent employment.  We should not let this opportunity pass without mentioning this fact.  I hope the Minister of State will avail of this opportunity to clarify the position on these matters.</P>

      <P>This section provides for the ratification by the State of an agreement amending the Protocol to the EC Treaty on the statute of the European Investment Bank and will enable the governors of the bank to establish a European Investment Fund which will be added to the list of Treaties governing the European Community.  That is a useful <Col N="1760" /> development.  I am not convinced that the size of the fund being talked about will have any significant effect on the economy of the European Community generally or on the Irish economy specifically.  It strikes me as being somewhat similar to the principle which Bill Clinton knocked so effectively in his election campaign, the principle of trickle down economics where if one creates a fund for investment and development the effects of the investment and development will trickle down to those who need it.  We know from our sad experience that that does not work.  We receive Structural Funds from the European Community to make up for the fact that there is a fundamental contradiction in the objectives of the European Community in terms of letting the market rip and at the same time hoping that that will improve the lot of the 50 million people of the European Community who are living below the poverty line and the 17 million people who are unemployed.  We know this system does not work.  It is time Ireland started to point out within the councils of the European Community that this approach to the European economy is a disaster for the people of the Community.</P>
      <P>The main problem with Structural Funds is that they are the result of horse trading.  We see the problems which can arise from that kind of approach to the development of the European Community when we look at the promises the Taoiseach thought he had wrapped up and in the bag but which were not really there at all.  Deputy Hogan referred to the £6 billion over five years we were promised in the Maastricht Treaty debate and the alleged £8 billion over seven years which the Taoiseach claimed he got in Edinburgh.  This means, in effect, that the £6 billion promise of Maastricht was not kept either.  Therefore we have two broken promises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have serious reservations about the way in which the European Community goes about assisting the peripheral regions of the Community which are marginalised. I do not think it is appropriate for a Community which is seeking to <Col N="1761" /> develop a union and to become a major player on the world stage to allow for development purely on the basis of horse dealing at various summits as the time arises.  Depending on how powerful you are or how well got you are with the President of the Commission or the paymasters of the European Community, the Germans etc., you will either get a good deal or you will not.  That is not the way to develop the European Community.  It is not the way to bring Spain, Ireland, the southern part of Italy or the länder in East Germany up to par with the rest of the Community.  We have to establish a more federal type of approach to the allocation and distribution of resources within the European Community whereby transfers of resources would be automatic on the basis of the needs of the various regions and would be based on established criteria.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

      <P>Yes, and it is time we as a country started to argue for such an approach.  Unfortunately, the system we have been happy to operate and which worked well for us &mdash; presumably that is the reason we did not want to move away from it &mdash; is beginning to become unstuck.  It seems that the Taoiseach now finds himself in a hole.  When that happens, the advice of old is to stop digging and that is something he should bear in mind.  I do not think he can argue logically that a firm promise was made to him, in Edinburgh when it was not minuted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no wish to interfere in the negotiations in which the Tánaiste and he are engaged.  Obviously I want to see the greatest possible transfer of resources to this country, as does everybody else, but this is a signal that we cannot continue to expect a transfer of resources simply on the basis that we are good Europeans or that we have the ear of the powerful in the European Community.  We have to argue for change in the way resources are allocated, as well as arguing for a commitment to a much larger budget for <Col N="1762" /> Europe.  Otherwise the European union project will become unstuck very quickly.</P>

      <P>In page 5, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1763" />&ldquo;(3) All European Communities directives and regulations shall be referred to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs for approval before implementation.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am proposing to insert two new subsections in section 6.  I have been concerned for a considerable time at the inadequacy of the scrutiny of the vast majority of EC directives.  I submit that the Meagher case on angel dust, successfully brought against the State in respect of European directives clearly shows that the Legislature has given inadequate thought to how the directives should be implemented in practice. Although Ministers agree to the draft directives before they are passed, the Members of the Oireachtas do not get the opportunity to discuss them in the forum to which the Ministers are responsible in order to clarify the reasons Ministers agree to directives that subsequently are transposed into Irish law by ministerial order.  We have been brought before the European Court on a number of occasions because we have been unable to transpose directives into law.  Directives that date as far back as June 1991 have to be brought before the House and transposed into Irish law.</P>
    <P>Members who have an interest in a specific matter should have the opportunity to tease out the practical implications of the implementation of the various EC Directives.  This has been brought home forcibly to me as a result of the heat generated by the proposal to implement the EC food hygiene regulations. Some people are claiming that if the regulations are enforced to the strict letter they will be put out of business. There is a general lack of understanding among the general public and Members have not been given adequate information to answer questions and criticisms on the implementation of this EC Directive. It does not do justice to the Houses of the Oireachtas that Members are not able to deal adequately with the queries that their constitutents raise on directives <Col N="1764" /> agreed at Government level but which we have failed to discuss in the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I take the point Deputy Michael McDowell made on Second Stage that the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs may not be the proper forum to discuss this matter.  I understand his reservations because we have a great deal of work to do on that committee.  Technical measures such as EC Directives should not take up the time of all Members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs. I do not anticipate that happening but I believe that some Members on the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs should at least have an opportunity to peruse the various directives that have been agreed by the Irish Government at EC level.  I propose that we have experts explain the directives to us and then we can tease out the implications of the directives.  Deputy McDowell said there would be insufficient expertise available to the committee and the committee itself would not have the expertise to deal with those technical measures.</P>
    <P>I was a Member of the Statutory Instruments sub-committee of the former Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation and officials from the Departments involved always gave an explanation as to the effects of a directive.  The product liability directive was first discussed by the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation and was subsequently brought to the House by the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy O'Rourke.  The fact that Members of that committee had a good understanding of the directive made for an informed debate.  That is the reason I am anxious to put in place a mechanism to allow directives to be analysed by the Houses of the Oireachtas, for example by a sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs or a sub-committee of the House.  I would like to hear the Minister's view on how she envisages more information and technical expertise being given to the Houses of the Oireachtas on EC regulations and EC Directives, now going through on the nod, because we do not have sufficient time to discuss them or that they are <Col N="1765" /> merely historical on the basis of being agreed so long ago that it makes no difference. We do not have an opportunity to make an input to how those directives should be put in place or to influence the decision which the Government will subsequently make in implementing that directive.  At the end of the day the Houses of the Oireachtas will suffer and the general public will feel great alienation from Europe generally because of inadequate information given to them.</P>
    <P>The principles of transparency and subsidiarity could be brought into play in this matter if we could find some mechanism or forum by which to address this important information and comprehension deficit &mdash;&ldquo;comprehensions deficit&rdquo; are the words used in the Institute of European Affairs.  We have much information but I am trying to find a forum by which we can understand it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, indicated that he was sympathetic towards the drift of what Deputy Hogan and I said about the desirability of having a pre-emptive function for whatever committee is established by this House to monitor European secondary legislation.  He indicated he would come back to that during today's debate.  It occurs to me that we should take a number of things on board in this respect.  First, the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, under Deputy Lenihan's chairmanship, is working well. It is not that I think the Members are untalented or lacking in understanding or capacity to understand issues, it is just that I do not see any necessary nexus between a foreign affairs committee and the process of monitoring European Community regulations and directives and their implementation here.  I see a huge difference in function between the two.  As I said last night, if angel dust regulations are to be considered by a committee of this kind I do not see why <Col N="1766" /> it should not be done by the committee of this House which is charged with overall responsibility in respect of agriculture rather than through a foreign affairs committee. In so far as it is a self selection process &mdash; let us forget about Deputy Shatter's fate for a second&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>At least in all that process the people who volunteer and who sought membership of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs did not tell their party leaders that they were omniscient and could deal with everything that would come up under an EC regulation.  I do not see the logical connection with the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs although I can see that this House has limited resources and that some committee has to do the work.</P>
      <P>I have a grave doubt as to whether it is sufficient simply to look at directives and regulations when they are handed down from Europe.  It is more important to get in when they are at the draft stage. As our treaty obligations require us to implement directives, and regulations have direct effect in Ireland, there is not much point in considering regulations after they have been made since we are bound by them at that stage.  It is much more important to deal with the draft regulations when they are on the table and in the negotiations process at Brussels level.  If the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, chaired by Deputy Lenihan, is to be the vehicle for considering such regulations and obviously somebody somewhere must ordain it &mdash; we will not change that today &mdash; then the sub-committee of the foreign affairs committee which will deal with this territory should get the co-operation of Government on this issue, and take to itself the function of looking at draft regulations and directives to see how they will impinge on Ireland when they are adopted at European Community level.  That sounds like a massive workload but at least it would have a genuine effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present process of monitoring in <Col N="1767" /> retrospect reminds me of a financial scam in my own constituency where an individual involved in an investment fraud announced he was bonding in arrears. Monitoring in arrears is how we proceed in this House in respect of European regulations and it does not work.  I ask Deputy Lenihan to consider this.  I am not suggesting it should be done lightly. We should change the focus of what the foreign affairs committee proposes to do on that front and say we will be prospective in future, that we are not interested in reviewing what happened. We would like to see what will happen and whether Ireland should influence it.</P>
    <P>If the legislators in this House are bound, as we are, by the treaty and the method adopted by the 1972 Act to implement, often by Statutory Instrument &mdash; delegated legislation &mdash; directives from the European Communities then the responsible approach to this matter is to seek to influence the directive before it is made rather than querying its implementation when the decision has been taken.</P>
    <P>There is nothing wrong with this House taking a prospective view of the matter and looking around corners as is done in Denmark.</P>
    <P>In relation to section 6, Deputy Hogan suggested that regulations should be referred for approval before implementation. As I understand European Community law &mdash; I may be wrong &mdash; regulations in general have a direct effect.  The question of referring them to a committee before implementation simply does not arise.  I do not know the shelf life of this measure but hints from the Minister's amendments suggest that this has been around for some time and has only now been produced.  Section 6 (2) states:</P>
    <P>An order shall not be made under subsection (1) of this section before the establishment by both Houses of the Oireachtas of a Joint Committee to be known as the &ldquo;Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That subsection is redundant as we have <Col N="1768" /> gone past that stage and it could properly be deleted from the section.  The committee should now take the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring at his word when he said yesterday he was interested in the committee becoming involved in pre-emptive examination of draft regulations and draft directives rather than simply confining ourselves to examining on an historical basis what has happened.  In the ordinary course of events I suggest that when a draft regulation on, for example thryostatic substances or whatever angel dust is called comes before the committee, a brief memo should be prepared and submitted to other Deputies who may be interested in it, such as party spokesmen on agriculture.  If a committee of this House deals with agriculture it should be sent to that committee asking for its observations.  As this issue will eventually be dealt with why not deal with it now?</P>
    <P>The last issue I should like to raise is one which arises in the context of the Meagher case.  In many cases a choice has to be made as to whether it is appropriate to legislate or to regulate under the 1972 Act.  That choice must be given some consideration by this House in advance of a decision being made.  For example, the Government in the name of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, agreed to use the trade marks Bill which I introduced in this House as a model in implementing the EC Trade Mark Directive. For more than a year we have been debating whether this matter should be dealt with by regulation or statute.</P>
    <P>There are many worthwhile reasons it should be dealt with by way of a statute, but this House was never consulted on the matter.  The decision will be made by the Executive of the State without reference to this House.  That may be irrelevant in most legislation but on major issues of principle in this regard the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs should be able to recommend that certain directives can be dealt with by regulation or by statute.  The House should be notified in advance that people on its behalf &mdash;legislators as opposed to the Executive <Col N="1769" /> of the State &mdash; have made a fundamental choice and a recommendation in that respect.  We could then take some responsibility for decisions made in our name.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to regulations and how they are dealt with in this House, we are touching on what is a basic problem for societies generally in which representative democracies operate.  In such societies there is a general explosion in the range of matters for which governments have responsibility while at the same time a growing alienation among people from the system of representative democracy because they do not see it having power or relevance to their daily lives.  That is particularly true in the case of the less well off in society.  In constituencies here where there are high levels of unemployment there is usually a low turn-out of people at election time. Those who are poor, who have been unemployed for a long time or have dropped out of the education system believe that the political system is of little relevance to them other than for making representations to have their tap fixed in the bathroom, or their roof or light fitting mended.  While we are attempting to effect some reform in this House to cope with the levels of work and legislation with which we have to deal, we are not addressing the fundamental issues of how a representative democracy copes with the type of alienation which exists in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of this House approving regulations and implementing directives should be given careful consideration. The buzz word nowadays is &ldquo;transparency&rdquo;, people must know what is being done.  That is a basis of democracy, knowledge improves people's capacity to influence decisions.  However, a principle which is at least as important relates to participation and that is where this House and similar systems fail.  People outside this House do not feel they are involved in the decision-making process.  They may be aware of what is taking place but feel powerless to influence it.  That is a common reaction among my constituents <Col N="1770" /> to the European Community who believe the European Community is about farmers.  Every time they turn on their radios a discussion is taking place about farmers, headage payments, the Green £ and so on.  People are aware that farmers are getting the biggest share of the Structural Funds and the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to enter into a debate on farmers, but there is a perception in society that the more powerful a lobby the more influence it has, particularly behind the scenes.  Obviously, Deputies from rural areas will be lobbied by farmers, but the urban population of this State now outnumbers that of the rural population. Yet, far more attention is paid to agricultural issues in this House than to urban issues.  I am not merely referring to Dublin as an urban area; there are many urban areas, large and small, outside Dublin city which are commonly referred to as rural areas.  The small towns of this country are urban areas and are as badly hit by the unfair manner in which resources are shared out as any poor urban area in Dublin city.</P>
    <P>The matter of regulations and the manner in which they are dealt with in this House is important and I am concerned that the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs might not be capable of coping with the volume of work involved. I do not believe that the 30 Members of that committee have any less expertise than Members of any other body of people in terms of their capacity to deal with a range of issues.  We all have a passing knowledge of most subjects because of our role as public representatives. To an extent, we are Jacks of all trades and masters of none, but that is acceptable.  It would be a bad day for this country if this House was made up of experts and professionals who would pursue a narrow focus in regard to certain issues.</P>
    <P>We accepted the replacement of the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs far too easily.  The work of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs indicates clearly that there is a need for such <Col N="1771" /> a committee.  That has been demonstrated by the range of issues that committee addressed since its establishement a few months ago.  The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs has already established a European sub-committee made up of ten Members which presumably will deal with most of the regulations referred to it.  The most effective way the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs can operate is to get in at the beginning when the Commission or the Council make a proposal for a regulation or produces a White Paper or a Green Paper.  I understand the Commission intends to produce far more discussion documents before putting pen to paper in making proposals for regulations.  At that point the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, through the European sub-committee, can have most influence.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell's suggestion in regard to expertise and referral of agricultural matters to a committee could be implemented, even under the provisions as they stand, if we take into account the procedure that operates in the European Parliament.  When a proposal comes before the Parliament for a regulation it is referred to the committee with responsibility for that area but then opinions are sought from all the other committees that might have an interest in that issue.  That is a system that the Foreign Affairs Committee could perhaps operate.  To take Deputy McDowell's example, if something relating to angel dust comes before the Foreign Affairs Committee it can be referred to the other committees for their opinions and that would be a worthwhile way of dealing with it.  It does not mean the other committees would make decisions on it. They would simply present a wider perspective than might be available on the Foreign Affairs Committee or the European subcommittee.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of how we deal with matters European is the issue of transparency and participation by the public. It would be a useful initiative to have public hearings on issues of importance although it would not be feasible to do <Col N="1772" /> so in relation to every proposal coming forward.  I have in mind that by 1996 the Maastricht Treaty will have to be reviewed and in the meantime there will be a number of new member states. Hopefully, the EFTA countries will be in the European Community by then.  The question of enlargement of the Community, reviewing the Maastricht Treaty, the evolution of common and foreign security policy, proposals for a common defence policy and the possibility of common defence itself are all major issues that the Foreign Affairs Committee is going to have to deal with and promptly, because the world goes on.  It will not wait for us to get our act together. This review is already under way, looking at institutions and how they are to evolve and develop.  The Foreign Affairs Committee does have a major task, as does the European sub-Committee in tandem with it.  It would therefore be useful to initiate public hearings on those issues. How they may be organised is something that can be discussed, but it would provide for a feeling among the public that they are being brought into the decision-making process and will not be presented in 1996 or 1997 with a new treaty which they have only vaguely heard about because the Foreign Affairs Committee has been talking about it.  There would be a very positive response from various public and voluntary organisations to such an initiative.</P>
    <P>Although I do not disagree in principle with what Deputy Hogan is saying, his proposals come in at the tail end of a process which can take up to two years in terms of preparing regulations for final agreement and it is at the early stages that we need to get in on the act.  Given the terms of reference of the Foreign Affairs Committee, we can use a bit of creativity and initiative to develop the role of this House and, working in partnership with the public outside this House, develop a greater understanding of what the European Community is and what its objectives are, so that when the next referendum is held we can have a rational debate about the differences we <Col N="1773" /> have on how Europe should grow and evolve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that there should be more effective scrutiny by the House and the Committee of the secondary legislation of the European Communities.  We had very effective scrutiny of such legislation in the past under the old committee which was extremely active.  The Foreign Affairs Committee has been established relatively recently, as has its sub-committee on European Affairs, so to some extent we are breaking new ground. Some of the matters referred to can be reviewed after a period of operation.</P>
      <P>I take on board the point made in regard to scrutiny of draft directives at an early stage and the role the Foreign Affairs Committee could play in that area.  That would be helpful in getting the views of Members on various issues before they are decided because, as has been pointed out, once a decision is made in Brussels, it is too late.  The Department of Foreign Affairs will certainly be very glad to facilitate Members of the Foreign Affairs Committee in that area.</P>
      <P>On the procedures to be adopted in relation to existing directives and how they are to be brought into force in Irish legislation, at this stage the Government is not anxious to accept Deputy Hogan's amendments but rather to proceed on the basis of putting the Foreign Affairs Committee in place of the old Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities.  Let us see how that runs and review the situation at a later date.  Because the committee has not got its teeth into this area yet it would be premature to change a system which has served us well in the past.  A more effective change would be for the Foreign Affairs Committee to take the opportunity of looking at directives which are in preparation with the assistance of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I am sure the chairperson of that committee will be glad to get involved in that process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McDowell suggested that an <Col N="1774" /> agriculture committee rather than the Foreign Affairs Committee should look at issues like angel dust.  Deputy De Rossa's point on that was well made.  In terms of legislation we have to specify which committee of this House is to be responsible because we cannot have uncertainly about which committee should deal with certain issues.  The consultation process is one that the committee will avail of in looking at specific areas and the advice of officials in the relevant Government Departments will be available.  That will be helpful.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa made much wider comments in regard to information generally, the sense of alienation from the process in Europe that people feel and the issue of the information glut.  That is a very real issue and something that was well articulated during the debate on the Maastricht referendum.  The sheer volume of information emanating from Brussells leaves us all a bit bewildered. Government generally has a major role to play in improving the quality of information available to the public.  In my Department we are examining at the moment, and will be doing so during the summer and autumn, the whole issue of freedom of information legislation and, related to that, the question of opening up the process of information giving.  It is not only about a &ldquo;Woodward and Bernstein&rdquo; type of investigation, but about a culture of volunteering information and presenting it to the public in a form that is easily digestible and readily understood.  We are considering this matter on a broader front. The provision of information is a specific problem in relation to Europe having regard to the volume of information emanating from it.  We also need to address the provision of information in our administrative structures and in society.</P>
    <P>The Government is negotiating firmly to obtain the share of EC Structural Funds it considers justified under the Conclusions of the Edinburgh Summit. The Government took a firm stand in rejecting the £7.5 billion on offer last week as it does not adequately represent <Col N="1775" /> the Conclusions of that Summit, nor the legitimate expectations arising from it. The Government will be firm in pursuing what is best in the national interest in regard to this issue.  I support Deputy Hogan's point regarding the use of the funds and ensuring they are spent wisely on permanent jobs.  Deputies on all sides have made the point that this round of Structural Funds will be the last opportunity to receive funding on this scale.  It is essential that those funds are spent wisely in the national interest.</P>
    <P>In that context Deputy De Rossa referred to trickle down economics, growth initiative and the role of the European Investment Bank.  The level of economic activity in Europe must be considered. It is worrying that economic growth in European economies is forecast to fall by 0.5 per cent in the coming year.  We export 70 per cent of what we produce to our major market in Europe and the prospect of a slump in that market is worrying having regard to the effects it would have on our employment levels.  We need to apply macroeconomic policies at European level to address the issue of economic growth.  We cannot discuss macroeconomic policies in the absence of other activities because such policies do not benefit the poorer sections of the community and the disadvantaged. Under our negotiations on the Structural Funds a detailed programme is being prepared to address this issue.  Unless there is specific targeted action at disadvantaged communities there is a danger that the programme will not address their needs.  Special intervention is necessary in areas which have become unemployment black spots.  Disadvantaged areas and the unemployed must be targeted.  A general increase in economic activity will not provide for the needs of disadvantaged areas unless specific measures are taken to reintegrate communities, where there is great unemployment, back into the economic mainstream. Deputies can be assured that a programme on those lines will form a central feature of the Government's national development plan.  It is not sufficient <Col N="1776" /> to rely on trickle down macroeconomic effects to provide for those people.</P>
    <P>Specific measures must be taken to provide for communities which have been blighted by long term unemployment. Necessary measures must be taken to break the cycle of unemployment and ensure that the long term unemployed and their families get a reasonable share of jobs which will become available from any expansion in economic activity.  Such a change does not happen by accident and the work undertaken under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and area based partnerships is evidence that these areas must be specially provided for. Very few employers will fill vacancies with the long term unemployed.  Job opportunities will not trickle down to the unemployed unless specific measures are taken.  Good work has been undertaken by the inner city partnership in relation to jobs in Dublin.  It identified jobs coming on stream and the long term unemployed who would be interested in those jobs.  It tailored training programmes to place people in those jobs. We need to take such an approach to ensure that the disadvantaged in communities obtain a reasonable share of benefits.  Those benefits do not just trickle down from economic policy.</P>
    <P>There is a link between educational opportunities and unemployment.  There is a danger that the problem of unemployment and consequent disadvantage may be transmitted from one generation to another.  Children whose parents are out of work lose hope in respect of their job opportunities.  They may not perform well at school and consequently face life of long term unemployment.  Successive surveys of school leavers undertaken by the Department of Labour show a direct link between the level of education and the chances of securing employment. Children who leave school early without formal qualifications are likely to face long term unemployment.  Therefore, early intervention through investment in education is necessary to provide for those in disadvantaged areas of long term <Col N="1777" /> unemployment.  It is important not to rely on trickle down economics to provide for the disadvantaged but to invest in training the unemployed to prepare them to compete for the jobs coming on stream and provide them with hope for the future.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell referred to the shelf life of the Bill.  The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs has now been established. Subsection (2) of section 6 may now be superfluous but it need not be amended because the section as it stands will be effective.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The section need not be amended and I commend it to the House.  The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs should encourage openness in addressing issues.  Consideration will be given as to how that committee can make a genuine input to Community legislation by its early involvement in relation to future negotiations.  That position will become clearer as its work evolves, particularly in regard to the work of the European sub-committee.  I cannot accept Deputy Hogan's amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the views of the Minister and my colleagues in regard to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  The committee should examine draft directives and regulations before such measures are formulated.  I have had discussions with officials of the EC office in Dublin and, if necessary, they may be invited to attend meetings of the committee. It is important to ensure that the committee examines proposed draft directives and regulations before they are implemented.  The committee must establish a process for achieving this through the European sub-committee.  I welcome the views expressed in that regard and I am pleased that the Minister and the Department of Foreign Affairs supports it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As chairman of the committee I thank the Department of Foreign Affairs in particular for the forthcoming manner in <Col N="1778" /> which we were met by its officials.  This further extension of the committee's work into a type of pre-examination of directives and regulations is supported by the Department and is in line with what European affairs committees in other Community parliaments do.  The democratic comprehension deficit, as described by Deputy Hogan, can be best addressed through the national parliaments and their committees, whether foreign or European affairs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise this is not a universally held view, there are people who would wish to see the European Parliament strengthened to a greater degree, and I would agree with that.  However, the European Parliament, particularly with its enlargement, will become more cumbersome as a parliament. In that context, if the principle of subsidiarity or regional devolution in regard to decision-making is to be established in a parliamentary sense, this must be done via the national parliaments. That is the reality.  This would involve strengthening the foreign affairs or the European affairs committees of the national parliaments to allow them become involved in the discussion of policy matters pertaining to regulations and directives before they are formalised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to now we have had <i>post-factum</i> examinations only which, while appropriate, did not provide for a constructive democratic contribution on the part of parliamentarians.  The way to canalise our constructive input is by seeing these regulations and directives in draft form, expressing our opinions on them and establishing the process to do that.  I propose to do this now that we are given the green light by the Minister.  As chairman of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs I will arrange to have Commission officials, in particular, before us shortly for discussions.  It is through those officials that we can establish the practical <Col N="1779" /> channels so that this submission can be made available to our subcommittee.</P>
    <P>The subcommittee on European legislation has been established and will be meeting next Wednesday to appoint a chairman and to structure its future work. It is desirable that the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs should proceed on the basis of establishing subcommittees to deal with particular areas.  It has already decided on two areas of obvious interest, namely, that of European legislation on which a subcommittee has been established, and the area in respect of development aid.  Those two subcommittees will hold their first meeting next Wednesday.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister refer to the utilisation of the Structural and Cohesion Funds.  This is very important because, whatever the figure, it will represent a major tranche.  There will be difficulties in obtaining a similar figure in future years due to the various complications that will exist in the Community and in eastern and central Europe by that time.  It is vital that we apply ourselves to the utilisation of those funds with wisdom and care.  There are many reports to hand and one I recommend to the Minister is that from the North Clondalkin Project &mdash; I understand it is before the Government.  Clondalkin was chosen as a pilot area for the expenditure of such funds to address the problems of real deprivation and unemployment.</P>
    <P>I realise I have deviated slightly from the main issue but my comments are relevant to this debate.  I thank the Chair for his indulgence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry this debate is straying from the important constitutional and parliamentary point that is at the heart of these amendments.  I can only regard the introduction of references to the Structural Funds as an attempt by the Minister to distract attention from a very serious issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, and the House, must take their responsibilities as elected representatives very seriously in this matter. The High Court has found that certain actions taken by an Irish Administration <Col N="1780" /> were invalid because they had not been properly approved in this House.  The Fine Gael amendment is designed to ensure in law that this House, by its own authority in passing this amendment, must be brought into the process. Instead, Deputies such as Deputy Lenihan are willing to accept administrative concession from the Executive that, with grace and favour, it will refer directives to his committee.  Deputy Lenihan should not accept that.  It is a matter for this House to establish its rights in this issue separate from the Executive.  It should be the law of this land that this House has a right, not a concession, to approve laws being made in our name. That is not happening and, because it did not happen in the previous case, the High Court found that the &ldquo;angel dust&rdquo; regulation was invalid.  In other words, the High Court was willing to stand up for the privileges of this House but the Members of it are not.  That is a disgraceful situation.</P>
    <P>I have been a Member of this House for many years.  I do not normally intervene in Committee Stage debates but I regard this as a matter of fundamental importance.  Nobody has the right to make law here other than the Oireachtas. No Minister and no official making regulations can make law.  This House makes law and it is wrong, therefore, that this amendment should not be accepted.  I deplore the Minister's attitude in this regard, particularly in view of the fact that the Tánaiste gave an indication last-night that he was favourably disposed towards these amendments.</P>
    <P>I am unwilling to accept some concession from the Minister that if we are all nice she will refer these regulations to the committee.  That is not a matter for her to concede.  The courts have found that this House as of right should be involved and it should not be a matter of administrative concession for the Minister to send documents &mdash; if she receives them in time &mdash; to Deputy Lenihan's committee.  Deputy Lenihan's committee should be given the right, by this House and not by the Minister, to have sight of those documents.  This should be governed <Col N="1781" /> by law and not by administrative concession.</P>
    <P>I regard this as a matter of considerable importance particularly in view of the fact that the Executive has adopted an <i>á la carte</i> approach over the years to the implementation of EC law.  They have abused the concessions given to them in this House under the European Communities Act, 1972 to make laws under the guise of EC directives that stretch beyond what is required by those directies. They have also taken unto themselves the right not to implement certain other directives when required to do so. For example, since the beginning of this year we are under a legal obligation as a State to outlaw money laundering.  The Executive has decided not to act on that. On the other hand, they have decided to act on other EC directives.  The decision to implement one directive and not another is a legislative decision and the Executive has no right to make that decision, that is a matter for this House. The choice not to act on money laundering but to act on some other directive is a legislative choice.  It is a political choice, not an administrative one and is a choice that should be made by this House.  All directives and regulations which are required to be incorporated into Irish law should be referred to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs so that politicians on all sides of the House can have an opportunity to air their views on whether a particular directive or regulation should be implemented.</P>
    <P>In recent days I received a long list of directives that have not been transposed into Irish law by the Irish Administration. It is an appalling catalogue of inefficiency and ineptitude that our Executive has failed to implement laws which confer rights on our people.  It was the intention of the European Community that these laws would come into effect but, because of administrative inertia or administrative choice &mdash; some Ministers may not even be aware in some cases that they have not acted in accordance with their legal obligations under the Treaty &mdash; they have not been incorporated into our law. I mentioned one such Act dealing with <Col N="1782" /> money laundering but I have a computer print-out of about 100 directives that have not been transposed into Irish law which I can supply to the Minister, if it is of interest to her.</P>
    <P>This matter is of particular importance for another reason.  Under the Francowich judgment recently reached by the European Court, it is open to any Irish citizen who feels their interests have been prejudiced in any way by the failure of the Irish Government to fulfil its legal obligations and transpose into Irish law an EC directive, to sue the Government for the loss they have suffered.  The Exchequer is now in jeopardy of incurring substantial legal costs because of the failure of the Irish administration to implement particular directives &mdash; they are implemented <i>a la carte</i> with the Government choosing which they will implement.</P>
    <P>The best enemy of that abuse of administrative discretion is a large dose of fresh air in the form of scrutiny as of right by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs of all directives on which we are required to act.  This should be done not as an administrative concession by the Minister, gratefully accepted as promised from the ministerial table, but as of right. As a self-respecting Legislature we should decide that this is an obligation on the Executive imposed by the Legislature in regard to a legislative function. I strongly urge the Minister to change her mind and accept the amendments in the name of Deputy Philip Hogan because they enshrine a very important constitutional principle about the separation of powers to the effect that the rights of the Legislature should be protected by the Legislature and should not be the subject of grace and favour concessions from any Executive.</P>
    <P>The Minister's politics do not prompt me to say this.  Successive Governments, including Governments of which Fine Gael was part, probably have abused their powers in either going further than the directives provide or failing to implement directives.  It is not a political matter; it is a matter of the rights of the Legislature as against those of the <Col N="1783" /> Executive.  Deputy Hogan's amendment seeks to vindicate the rights of the Legislature in this matter and I urge the Minister to reconsider her rejection of the amendment.  I particularly urge Deputy Lenihan, who has longer service in this House than I have, to assert the rights of the committee of which he is chairman rather than simply be willing to accept concessions from the Executive in a matter that is our proper province, not that of the Executive.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Bruton that the 1972 procedure, as amended, is unsatisfactory.  It was ameded to allow regulations to be brought before the House and, subject to agreement of this House, to be annulled, but as pointed out last night and today, that is an illusory right and does not amount to proper scrutiny. I agree with the general philosophical underpinnings of Deputy Bruton's comments.  The only aspect on which I differ is that I do not believe the Government will concede the point.  I am addressing practical improvements that could be made in the event of the Government not conceding that point.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lenihan, Deputy De Rossa, Deputy Hogan and I are not seeking a concession from the Executive.  We believe we have the absolute right on the committee to go anywhere in Europe to get any material and to call people before us to question them about any matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>In that context two matters concern me.  This job involves a huge workload, and the Tánaiste has frequently said the committee will have resources.  Complex directives or sets of regulations such as the USCITS Directive passed a number of years ago must be read through, and resources are necessary to provide assistance to the committee for this purposes, to point out what is relevant and to elicit comment on matters from other bodies.  That job will not be done on a voluntary basis by Deputies in their spare time.  Resources are necessary if we are to take that task seriously.  We will have to call on the blank cheque the Tánaiste gave us when he said resources should be made available to the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What Deputy De Rossa said is particularly apt and stimulating, that is, that outside bodies should have an input in the process of inspecting in advance draft regulations and directives.  It seems <Col N="1785" /> Deputy Lenihan will have to look for money to put advertisements in newspapers to make the public aware of committee meetings so that they have an opportunity to make submissions.  That is the way to deal with the information deficit referred to earlier.  I am very supportive of Deputy Lenihan in everything he is doing on the committee, but in this case there will have to be a complete change in terms of the committee's resources and the financial implications of our role.  I am not prepared, and I do not think any other Member of the committee would be prepared to participate in a sham whereby we pretend to carry out a supervisory role.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already put on record that in principle I support Deputy Hogan's amendments.  I do not propose to get into crossfire with Deputy Bruton in regard to his points.  It seems the 1972 Act already provides for review of all regulations by the joint committee, and perhaps the amendments proposed by Deputy Hogan will strengthen that position.  I have no problem in principle with this matter, but we must be more far-reaching than that.  When the Government makes regulations the die is cast.  We need to consider the process before the European Community decides to make Regulations because there are two distinct things &mdash; the regulation the Government makes to implement a Directive already decided at European level in the context of Irish conditions and Irish law, and the proposal by the European Community in a global sense.  We need to be capable of dealing with those two distinct matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee must look at proposals for regulation by the Government because clearly the Government can decide to implement a directive in a way which may not be acceptable to Members of the House or sections of the community. I need only refer to regulations made last year by the Minister for Social Welfare with regard to the European Court's decision on women's rights to alleviation payments, when the Department of Social Welfare made regulations <Col N="1786" /> simply wiping out women's rights to those alleviation payments.  I had fairly robust debates with the Minister, Deputy Woods, on that issue.  I would have liked a committee of this House to look at those regulations before the Minister put them into effect.  We must distinguish between looking at the issue when the European Community are deciding on their regulations and directives and having an input on how they evolve, and having an input into what the Government decides on how those directives and regulations should be implemented.</P>
    <P>We should not forget the important role MEPs can have in the discussion and consultation process.  We have 15 MEPs in the Republic and three in Northern Ireland who are Members of the Foreign Affairs Committee whose full-time work involves looking at what the European Commission and the Council are doing and so on.  They would have a fund of knowledge and information on which we should draw as, indeed, we should draw from the European Parliament and Commission offices in Dublin and from the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>The Foreign Affairs Committee should have a role in relation to what the Government is doing at Council meetings in Brussels.  There should be some procedure whereby Ministers would brief the committee, tell them what they propose to do, tell them before going to Brussels about upcoming issues.  This would give us an opportunity to express our views on what approach should be taken.  The Danish procedure is a lot more direct in that the Danish committee on European affairs actively directs their Minister in regard to what he may and may not do. I understand that if a Danish Minister is not getting his way at Council level and he wants to compromise, he must consult with the Danish committee before he can change the position they have given him. That is a much tighter procedure.  I am not sure that we would ever get that here but it might have been better had we had that clout in relation to the Taoiseach in Edinburgh, but that is for another debate.  The Foreign Affairs Committee <Col N="1787" /> gives us an opening for doing a lot more in relation to how we run our business in this country.  It is an important initiative, one which will benefit politics generally in the long run.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions on the amendments but I am disappointed that the Minister of State did not produce any proposal in order to underpin the goodwill which I thought I was getting from the Minister for Foreign Affairs on this matter last evening.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton made the important point that this House has a right to scrutinise various directives that are coming into force.  On foot of the High Court case which the Government lost, it is important that various directives that have been implemented since 1972 are validated.  It is important to ensure that we have proper scrutiny of future EC directives.  The Minister referred to availability of information on how directives will affect ordinary people and on how they will be implemented.  I am touched by the Minister's genuflection to the concept of freedom of access to information. The Minister has enshrined her views in the Bill which will come before us in the autumn and is trying to find a way in which European information should be disseminated to the ordinary people.  It was difficult to get from her an ESRI report on the National Development Plan and how we fared in the last round of Structural Funds.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance indicated to the House in a written reply that that report was merely a document to advise the Government on how the national plan should be formulated and that it was not going to be published. Under pressure, the Minister of State had to come into this House to give an executive summary of that report on how funds were spent, on how we in this House could benefit from an input detailing <Col N="1788" /> how we felt funds could be better spent to benefit the country in the next round and in devising the national development plan.</P>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa made a valid point about the role of MEPs.  The knowledge and information at their disposal should be used by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  Information and officials should be made available to the joint committee as was the case with the old Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities. Committee Members should have an opportunity to make a case on how directives should be implemented.  The fact that Deputy Bruton referred to 92 directives which have not been implemented clearly points to the casual approach of the Government to transposing EC directives into domestic law.</P>
      <P>This House should be able to debate issues in an organised way.  I am disappointed that the Minister has not come in here to give a clear direction on how the Government would like us to scrutinise EC directives and implement the spirit of the High Court case.  Perhaps the Government feels it can win the Supreme Court case.  I am not an expert and I bow to my colleague, Deputy Michael McDowell, on all these legal issues.  My fundamental point is that the House should have an opportunity to scrutinise and validate EC directives and we should have an input before such laws are enacted.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I do not know if any Member has referred to Ronald Reagan but, as I remember it, he made his reputation of being a tough cookie when, as President he not only sacked but replaced the US air traffic controllers.  Thereafter all other sectors of the American public service were in awe of the said Mr. Reagan.</P>
      <P>This Bill does not seek to do anything so draconian, but nevertheless leaves many questions unanswered.  I should like the Minister to be more specific in his reply than he was in his introduction. It is unprecedented for people who are being transferred from the Civil Service to a semi-State body not to be guaranteed continuity of employment or pension rights.  It seems extraordinary that a Government, a large segment of which is made up of the Labour Party, would agree to a proposal which does not guarantee continuity of employment or pension rights.  This matter needs to be clarified.  As I understand from the Minister's statement, the 580 staff of ANSO will continue to be civil servants until 1 January next and their employment will not be guaranteed after that.  I would greatly appreciate if the Minister could clarify that aspect of the Bill.</P>
      <P>It is not normal for safety and air traffic control to be made the responsibility of one body.  They are generally regarded as two separate items and have two separate controlling bodies.  That is the norm in western Europe and throughout the world.  There has to be a good reason for keeping these functions separate.  For example, it may not be desirable to have these two entirely different concepts amalgamated under the one body.  Will the Minister explain why these functions are being amalgamated rather than separated?</P>
      <P>There is a great need for a civil aviation authority which will plan and co-ordinate air services throughout the State.  The Shannon stop-over episode illustrated the need for this this type of co-ordination. I note that in the past few days the Cork airport authority sent out distress signals stating that the elimination of the Shannon stop-over will mean Shannon will get preferential treatment and subsidisation and Cork Airport will suffer as a result.  I would like to think that all airports, like all citizens, would be treated equally.  I am not here to plough a furrow for Shannon, in particular, but to raise the question of airports in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can the Minister, as the representative of the Government, explain the distribution of the present tranche, that is the 1989-93 tranche of EC Structural Funds and why one regional airport is getting £12 million &mdash; I am referring specifically to Kerry Regional Airport &mdash; while the other regional airports are getting virtually nothing?  Is it true that this airport is getting a subvention of £12 million from Europe and that regional airports, such as Waterford which is every bit as deserving and important in the aviation infrastructure of the country, is not getting any of this money?  If this is <Col N="1793" /> true, how does the Minister explain it? Indeed, how can we explain it to our constituents?  Is there gross favouritism to certain Ministers' constituencies and gross discrimination against certain constituencies, such as mine which does not have a senior Government Minister?</P>
    <P>It would be alarming to think that this country was being run on the basis of favouritism, bias or cronyism &mdash; as a former Fianna Fáil Taoiseach described certain appointments in this House.  I would hate to think that favouritism of that kind was taking place.  It would be alarming if this could not be explained logically.  I do not believe there is a logical explanation, instead there is blatant favouritism.</P>
    <P>It does not make sense that £12 million would go to Kerry Regional Airport and nothing to Waterford Regional Airport, Galway Regional Airport, the Castlefin Airport in Donegal, Sligo Airport or Castlebar Airport.  I am aware that a Supplementary Estimate was passed in the House last week for £1.5 million to be used for promotional purposes for airports here.  How will that money be distributed?  I suspect that certain airports will get much more than others and, perhaps, Waterford will get the least of all although it is probably one of the most important, if not the most important, regional airport.  Will the Minister give a breakdown of the figure setting out the exact amounts to be allocated to the different airports?</P>
    <P>We could do a great deal for tourism in the south-east if the runway at Waterford Regional Airport was extended to accommodate passenger carrying jet aircraft. This would help generate employment as well as boost the tourist industry. Even if we were given only half the £12 million which was allocated to Kerry Regional Airport, we could generate a great deal of tourist activity.  In addition to the extension of the runway we need to provide additional services such as proper access roads.  There is a strong feeling that all airports, except one, are discriminated against.  I make no apologies for making the case for Waterford Regional Airport.  I hope that my constituency <Col N="1794" /> colleagues will support me in making that case.  If the Government has to be embarrassed into admitting that it supports one airport at the expense of the others, because of political pressure that that should happen, we should be given an answer in this House.</P>
    <P>Many questions remain to be answered.  We were not given an explanation in the Minister's speech.  The 580 staff must be uneasy about their future. They are entitled to know what will become of them: if they are to be retained or if there will be a rationalisation programme with considerable job shedding. Perhaps the Minister will satisfy us when replying to the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill which comes at a time of crisis for the Irish aviation industry.  The Minister could not have introduced the Bill at a more opportune time since, with the current crisis in Aer Lingus and the ongoing debate on the Shannon stop-over, air transport is on everybody's mind.  To say that Irish aviation is going through turbulence at present is an understatement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must put the matter in context. Ireland is not unique as the aviation industry throughout the world is experiencing very trying and testing times.  All airlines are facing difficulties.  I hope the debate on this Bill will enlighten us about the Irish aviation industry.  I welcome the establishment of an Irish Aviation Authority.  The Authority will provide Irish air traffic control services as well as regulate Irish aviation standards.  It will take over the Air Navigation Service Office, ANSO, which provides air traffic control at State airports and is also responsible for the licensing of pilots and the issuing of air worthiness certificates for Irish aircraft.  ANSO employs almost 600 staff about half of whom are attached to stations in the Shannon area.  These are mainly air traffic controllers, electronics engineers, radio officers, flight operators and air worthiness experts together with a small number of administrative staff. Irish safety standards apply to 500 aircraft on our national register; 2,000 licensed <Col N="1795" /> pilots; 3,000 certified aircraft maintenance personnel; 12 aircraft operating companies and 75 maintenance organisations. Of the 500 aircraft on the register more than 110 are large public transport aircraft.  Approximately half of the fleet are comprised of GPA aircraft, most of which operate in countries spread across the globe from South America to Asia.  Presently, there are more than 300 aircraft using Irish air space annually that must pay for the use of Irish facilities.</P>
    <P>The proposed authority will operate as a commercial semi-State body.  The former Air Navigation Service Office had a turnover of £40 million in 1992 with an operating surplus of £1.7 million.  Taking these figures into account, we must improve our business prospects in the aviation field.  The Authority must have a vigorous commercial profile to win overseas business in aviation training and consultancy services.  In taking over ANSO the Irish Aviation Authority will be taking over a business with more than 80 per cent of its revenue, in excess of £36 million, coming from foreign airlines. Aer Lingus and Ryanair account for less than 10 per cent of the Authority's business, which is very small when compared with the contribution of other airlines. The Irish Aviation Authority will operate as a going concern from its inception. ANSO's charges for the use of Irish air space were among the lowest in Europe and one-third only of the charge in other north European countries.</P>
    <P>I will deviate for a moment to refer to the current Aer Lingus crisis.  I welcome the injection of £175 million capital to Aer Lingus. Recognition must be given to the Government contribution in trying to rescue Aer Lingus.  We can compare that to the loss a number of years ago of Irish Shipping which was liquidated. Both were on a par because Aer Lingus is practically on its knees with a borrowing excess of £0.5 billion and a substantial interest bill.  I understand that some banks are saying there is no further capital available to offer business on a day to day service.  That is a frightening <Col N="1796" /> thought because I understand that a large conglomeration of banks, native and foreign, is financing the business.  While banking personnel by and large are panicky and nervous they realise, at recessionary times in the aircraft industry as in every other industry, that it is important to stay with it.  I understand that those involved in the present banking scene in relation to Aer Lingus realise they will be in very serious difficulty if the proposed plan is not put in place.  I welcome the Government's endeavours in taking the matter in hand, proving that the problem can be ameliorated and that we can have an airline.</P>
    <P>In the modern aviation scene while airlines have become very competitive and more and more space is available for passengers and cargo, Aer Lingus need a partner.  I said this yesterday and I do not care who quotes me.  At least ten years ago it was thought we should have a link up with Lufthansa, a German airline. More recently we have seen the very successful privatisation of British Airways, which proves that privatisation is the way forward.  I fully support that concept. If we are to be successful in the semi-State sector, which has now developed fully, there will have to be more privatisation.  A link with British Airways is the opportune way for Aer Lingus to proceed.  We have only to look at our small number of airlines in comparison with it, it practically controls the skies.  When we look at its service we can see there is no future for us unless we move in that direction.  Many people may abhor what I have said but, in the commercial environment if we are not prepared to go down that road, in a few short years I foresee more difficulties in Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>I have never believed that the Shannon stop-over should have been compulsory. I believe it has caused much economic damage to the south east and to the south west of the country where I live.  Millions of pounds have been spent on updating Cork Airport to category III status in the last number of years and we now have centre line lighting.  Fog had been a problem, landings had to be made at other <Col N="1797" /> airports and sometimes flights had to return to London.  That has all been overcome.  If the south east and south west regions are to be developed we must have a transatlantic flight to Cork twice a week.  We have to look at the economic value of this to the area. We can look to the mid west or SFADCo region where the transatlantic service is compulsory, where there has been a fair development of American industry and an increase in American visitors. I do not know any businessman who would fly Dublin-Shannon, Shannon-New York or Shannon-Chicago or Los Angeles because of the delays involved.  It is ridiculous to take off at Dublin, land at Shannon and take off again a few hours later.</P>
    <P>Last year business people &mdash; second generation Irish &mdash; from Oregon who used to fly from New York to Shannon flew from Washington to Manchester and came down to London.  They took two weeks holidays in this country and four days in Britain which were lost to this country in terms of buying goods and touring the area.  This would never have happened if there had been a direct service to Dublin where they wanted to go. Their travel agent abroad advised them of the consequences, delays and so on. There is a definite major loss to this country because of our parochial approach. Last January I made a statement to that effect and all hell broke loose.  I am never afraid to make a statement or a challenge like my colleague, Deputy Deasy, who never fails to bite the bullet on any issue.  I will never forget the number of letters and phone calls I received but the chickens have come home to roost and I have been proved right.  I have criticised all Governments over the years who supported the Shannon stop-over, at a substantial cost to Aer Lingus, which has never been quantified.  We never asked any business organisation to investigate the cost apart from the loss to industry, the loss of travel and so on.</P>

      <P>I urge the Minister to commit the Government to upgrading the south east and south west regions at Farranfore and Waterford airports. I see Cork offering a feeder service to Waterford and Farranfore airports. We need a new aviation policy because of the present climate.  A further Bill will have to be enacted to put the transatlantic routes in place following the completion of negotiations with American and other airlines.  Cork Airport must get recognition as the gateway to the south east and to the US.  That means further upgrading will be needed and perhaps a small capital requirement.</P>
      <P>Cork Airport has shown it can operate in an effective and efficient manner.  Cork has suffered the loss of potential industrial development because of the lack of transatlantic services.  This airport would serve not only Cork but the Limerick and Kerry regions.  The number of business people travelling has almost doubled in the past five years yet Cork gets only a small portion of this business.  There has been much political posturing about Aer Lingus in the past few days.  We watched some Deputies from other parties seeking media attention.  Rather than vying for media coverage these Deputies should act in a responsible manner. Everyone realises that tough decisions must be taken to save Aer Lingus, without them we will not have an airline. We all welcome constructive criticism but crying wolf must stop.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this Bill.  It is a Bill on which I have some knowledge as I was involved in it during my brief term as Minister of State at the then Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications.  It is good legislation. As other speakers said, there has been much discussion during the past few days on aviation matters.  The crisis in Aer Lingus is very real and demands serious action if the future of our national airline is to be viable and long term.  These decisions are not easy.  It is inevitable that there will be disappointment and dismay, but at the end of the day we must be <Col N="1799" /> concerned with the overall future of Aer Lingus.  That is of paramount importance.</P>
      <P>In terms of my contribution I would like to move beyond the issue of Aer Lingus.  There has already been much debate on its future and this debate will no doubt continue for the forseeable future.  Instead I would like to focus on the broader issue of aviation policy itself.</P>
      <P>The nature of aviation around the world is changing rapidly.  The old order no longer pertains &mdash; we have already seen the collapse of Pan Am in America, once one of the most powerful airlines in the world.  Liberalisation is shaking major aviation companies to their very foundations.  This problem has been noticeable for a number of years.  This has also been exacerbated in recent times and for the first six months of this year airlines around the world were digging into their cost base as never before.</P>
      <P>Another important factor must be taken into account.  Increasingly there is a movement towards the EC taking over competence in the area of air agreements rather than individual member states.  It is also the stated intention of the United States to negotiate with the EC on air agreements rather than deal with individual member states.  However, if that is to happen then we would be foregoing the flexibility that is necessary to deal with amendments to existing bilateral agreements with the US.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has stated that we are not prepared to do this and proposed that we take a hands-on approach to manage the necessary change rather than have a unilateral and abrupt change thrust on us.  It is better that we have control of our negotiating destiny than accept what comes out of EC negotiations over which we have significantly less control.  I hope there will be a response from the airlines here to do that because at one time it was proposed that Aer Lingus might fly to the west coast of America, but that did not take place. Translift Airways stepped in and are now serving that route successfully.  Time is of the essence here and I am glad to note <Col N="1800" /> the Department will be starting this process of negotiations with the US authorities as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>In such a volatile position anything can happen and the old law of business, adapt or die, comes into play.  In order to survive and, ultimately, prosper, it is important to examine national aviation policy overall.  It is evident from the Minister's statement that the Government has every intention of doing so.  The last thing we can do in these circumstances is turn the clock back.  Times have changed and we must change with them.</P>
    <P>The last thing an aviation policy can afford to do is not evolve with and adapt to changing circumstances.  We now live in a post-liberalisation era in Europe and elsewhere.  The post war era which assured route exclusivity to national airlines is over.  Predictable stability no longer exists.  We are now faced with the challenge of ongoing change, an unavoidable fact of life.  To pretend otherwise or to hanker back to some cosy past is an act of political folly.  Opposition parties cannot pretend that this is not the new reality.</P>
    <P>Liberalisation is inevitable.  It is also a double edged sword.  The negative aspect is that liberalisation means greater competition in our domestic market.  There is, however, a positive aspect.  It also offers us the opportunity to explore and exploit new international markets.  The ultimate aim of any national aviation policy should be to gain access for Irish operators to as many international markets as possible and ensure that they can compete on a level pitch with competitors in other markets.</P>
    <P>This applies not alone to air services but covers the whole spectrum of aviation activities in which Irish operators are involved.  Regarding this latter point, the Bill under discussion is particularly relevant.  I will refer to that in great detail later.</P>
    <P>It is clear the Government has already made strenuous efforts in this regard.  Its plans and policies for Irish aviation have already been unreservedly endorsed by both the Culliton and Moriarty committees. I have no doubt that these <Col N="1801" /> endorsements are due to the fact that such policies will bring significant benefits for Ireland, in terms of wealth and employment creation.</P>
    <P>The Bill has an important role to play in the development of a national aviation policy.  It sets out to establish the Irish Aviation Authority to provide Irish air traffic control services and regulate Irish aviation safety standards, which will take over from the Air Navigation Service Office, ANSO.  This involves the transfer of 600 civil servants from the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications. At present ANSO provides air traffic control at the State airports and is responsible for licensing pilots and certifying the airworthiness of Irish aircraft. There are at present more than 300,000 aircraft movements in Irish airspace annually all of which must pay for the use of Irish facilities.  It is clear that there will be a considerable weight of responsibility on the new authority.</P>
    <P>However, the Irish Aviation Authority differs from its predecessor in significant respects.  One of its prime objectives is to greatly improve the business prospects of the Irish aviation business.  The new authority will have a vigorous commercial profile in order to win valuable overseas business in aviation training and consultancy services.  This new body will have a £40 million turnover with highly trained staff and will be of significant benefit to the Exchequer in future years. The commercial benefit of the new authority is evident.  Some Opposition Deputies may not realise that tremendous commercial benefits exists downstream.</P>
    <P>The authority will operate to the highest safety standards.  This confirms the Government's commitment to a strong, competitive and commercially vibrant aviation industry.  In taking over the business of ANSO, the new Irish Aviation Authority will be taking over a business with more than 80 per cent of its revenues &mdash; approximately £36 million &mdash; coming from foreign airlines.  For example, Aer Lingus and Ryanair account for less than 10 per cent of the authority's business.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1802" /> A number of speakers yesterday were concerned about civil servants moving from a Civil Service status to the new authority.  I welcome that move because it is important that there is continuity of staff in this field.  This is a specialised area and the staff running the authority should have the expertise to do so.  At present a civil servant can be transferred from one Department to another, but we do not want that in this case because modern technological advances and growth in air traffic need a staff trained in that area. From the air traffic controller down to the person filing up-to-date regulations and technical data, there must be continuity of staff and I am delighted that is to be the case.</P>
    <P>In introducing this Bill, we are preparing the ground not only for a better air navigation service but also for one that is more efficient and responsive to the ever-changing demands of user airlines. All of this will be achieved without any undermining of the high standard of safety currently implemented by the Air Navigation Services Office.</P>
    <P>Today Irish aviation is a large, diverse industrial sector, making a major contribution to the Irish economy, in terms of GNP activity and employment. Indeed, the industry is one which stretches from world class companies to small niche aircraft and airfield operators.</P>
    <P>Fundamental to the success and continued development of Irish aviation are high safety and operating standards. Confidence in our safety and operating systems is the cornerstone on which the success of the aviation industry depends. As the industry expands, so too must our capacity to safely and efficiently manage and exploit our airspace.  The purpose of this Bill is to set up an organisational structure which will continue to provide for safe management of our airspace and exploit opportunities to improve efficiency.</P>
    <P>I know that the Air Navigation Services Office is well prepared to assume the responsibilities of a semi-State body, providing essential services for the Irish aviation sector.  In recent years it has been developing its managerial and technical <Col N="1803" /> skills to a point at which its operation is as good as any of our European neighbours.  In fact, on the technical side, following a five year national £30 million re-equipment programme, ANSO has state-of-the-art equipment and systems.</P>
    <P>However, this does not mean that investment can cease.  Most of the deficiencies in the air traffic system in the mid-eighties were direct consequences of low investment policies over previous years.  This must not be let happen again. Removing ANSO from the restrictions of Exchequer funding will ensure that investment, to maintain and expand the capacity of our air traffic control system, can and will be made at the most appropriate time.</P>
    <P>On this point I would like to mention the fact that, despite the congestion problems being experienced in Europe, delay resulting from deficiencies in Irish airspace is now a thing of the past.  Ireland has set a high standard for other states to follow.</P>
    <P>I would like to stress again the emphasis which we are placing on safety.  It is extremely important that, with improved efficiency in air navigation services, the safety aspect is not undermined in any way.</P>
    <P>Section 32 obliges the new company to report to the Minister on the technical and safety standards that it applies, and also provides for a technical and safety audit of the company every three years. This will ensure the safety priority in the new organisation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy referred to regional airports. I agree with him that Waterford is forgotten when funding for regional airports is being handed out.  Deputy Deasy also mentioned jet aircraft.  Due to improvements at Waterford Regional Airport a jet aircraft landed at the airport bringing in a party of golfers.  That was the first movement of any jet in any regional airport in the country.  However, there is a need for further funding.</P>
    <P>The Bill has implications for regional airports.  If my reading of it is correct section 43 proposes to charge regional airports for terminal services which were <Col N="1804" /> free or at a reduced charge up to now. Most of these airports are barely surviving and I wonder if these charges will be prohibitive in the future.  These costs will ultimately be passed on to the consumer and damage the regional airports. Perhaps the Minister could use the power under section 45 to exempt regional airports from this charge.</P>
    <P>I wonder also where air training schools fit in.  An air training school in Cork closed down last year.  At the moment there is an air training school operating in Waterford and I wonder if that will be affected in some way.</P>
    <P>One key commercial objective that should be to the forefront of the new authority's activities is exploring and exploiting new markets for training and markets for specialised aviation consultancy projects.  There is a depth of expertise and dedication in the Irish aviation sector that is second to none.  This expertise can be put to effective use in seeking out these new markets and establishing the Irish Aviation Authority as a world leader in this important commercial area.  Already important new markets have opened up in Asia and in Eastern Europe.  The new authority should mount a marketing campaign in these areas as soon as possible with a view to promoting its skills and securing these valuable contracts.</P>
    <P>There has been much pessimism in recent times concerning the future of Irish aviation.  That is understandable given the nature of the crisis facing Aer Lingus and the job losses that this entails. However, I am concerned that amidst all this doom and gloom the good news regarding the establishment of this new authority will slip through the net.  I hope that this will not be the case.  The setting up of this authority marks an important strand of the Government's aviation policy.  It offers the prospect of generating economic growth and, most importantly, of creating employment.  It is one more step towards establishing a vibrant and commercial aviation policy and should be welcomed as such.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise a concern <Col N="1805" /> about section 43 (3) (b), in regard to the Irish Meteorological Service.  That service, the sole provider of meteorological services to the aviation industry, runs a network of 15 collecting and three distribution centres throughout the country. A very considerable portion of the cost of maintaining this network is derived from charges levied by the Civil Aviation Authority, currently ANSO and, under this Bill, to be the new IAA company.</P>
      <P>The apportionment of the meteorological services' share of these funds is currently decided by the Minister and decisions relating to the amount, in the past, have been contentious.  This revenue is obviously a vital part of the overall budget for the meteorological service and any negative changes in it would have a very profound effect on the capacity of this very small service.  It has an annual cost of £9 million and a total staff of 350.</P>
      <P>Concerns about this were raised with the Minister by members of staff in the Meteorological Service recently and it was their understanding that there was no intention at present to change the traditional relationship between the Meteorological Service and the aviation industry. However, to do that it will be necessary to amend section 43 (3) (b) to provide that it is the Minister and not the company who determines the charges in question. In this way we should remove the certain likelihood of endless wrangling between the IAA and the Minister over the cost of meteorological services.  I would be obliged if the Minister would take that point on board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>I too am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this debate on a very important Bill.  Aviation policy is not something that should be taken as an optional extra in this House or something to be sidelined.  It should be a central policy of any Government.  As a nation with a small population on the periphery of Europe, communications and transport are vitally important, a lifeline for us and as a gateway to the world. It is only right that we should plan our national aviation policy in a practical, <Col N="1806" /> intelligent way and look after our interests.  That is the fundamental purpose of this Bill.  If we do not look after our interests nobody else will.  We have learned that the hard way.  This is not a time for whimsical observations or for sentimentality or nostalgia.  It is a time for cool, practical, clear-headed policy making by all parties in this House.</P>
      <P>This issue should not be left just to the politicians because we have very few experts.  There are many experts who can afterwards tell us what went wrong but in the past three years when Aer Lingus was going down the tubes there were very few people to say how to correct matters. Everybody could do that afterwards, including the economists who are very good at that.  However, they are not so good at finding remedies when things are going wrong.</P>
      <P>It is important for Deputies to reach a consensus and look after our interests throughout the world.  We are a small country and Aer Lingus is a small player in a large, volatile, competitive aviation world.  We should not forget about our achievements because it is also important to see where we have come from and what we have done when we are facing difficulties.  It is important to stress the good times of Aer Lingus as well as the bad, to point to what the company achieved as a small carrier.  We are all very proud of its record and achievements. However, we are living in a changing world and aviation is one of the fastest changing industries in that world. It is important, therefore, that Aer Lingus should catch up quickly and not be left behind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ned O'Keeffe is not noted as an aviation expert; his contributions in this House largely concern the agricultural sector.  However, there is nothing wrong in him contributing to a debate on aviation because &ldquo;Jack is certainly as good as his master&rdquo;.  The Deputy is entitled to make his opinions known here.  However, I was surprised at some of his observations.  I was also surprised by his intervention in the debate on the Shannon status some time ago.  I had a feeling that he was put up to it, that he <Col N="1807" /> did not prepare what he said, but was reading a script drafted by somebody else.</P>
    <P>I do not think he understood the implications of what he was saying then, nor did he understand the implications of what he said today.  He was put up to reading that script also today by somebody with a vested interest in the business. First, he promoted the concept of privatisation, irrespective of its merits or demerits.  He has no factual information to support how privatisation would assist the aviation industry or bring success to Aer Lingus; the Deputy made that statement without any information to back it.  He also proposed a link between Aer Lingus and British Airways.  It is not good policy to make such statements without having undertaken the necessary groundwork and arguments to buttress such a case.</P>
    <P>It is too early to make such a proposal. There are many players in the aviation world but none will consider investing in Aer Lingus until it is a viable company and has the appetite and desire to make its way in a hostile environment. Delta Airlines, which has a good record in aviation, had an interest in a joint venture with Aer Lingus some years ago, but did not pursue it because of Aer Lingus's financial plight.  I do not favour Aer Lingus merging with British Airways, as proposed by Deputy O'Keeffe. Many airlines have gone to the wall, competing in the industry is like jungle warfare, the fittest survive.  Some airlines have come on stream through such competition and have been successful.  It may not be fashionable to mention Virgin Airlines but Mr. Branson's airine has had remarkable success in competing with British Airways in spite of the latter's dirty tricks policies.  I would not favour a proposed merger or joint venture with any company.  The future of Aer Lingus must be considered carefully.  The aviation industry is a specialised one involving high costs.  It is an industry on which we must have detailed discussions at national level.  We have to deal with scarce resources and this must be taken <Col N="1808" /> into account by workers, trade unions, taxpayers and politicians.  Our resources must be used carefully and efficiently in the national interest.</P>
    <P>I could be pessimistic about the future of Shannon and the Shannon region but I am not because as a politician I must be optimistic, otherwise I would not remain in politics.  We have encountered and overcome great difficulties in the past.  We must have courage, be practical and have a vision for the future.  Whingeing will get us nowhere.  The Shannon region has much to offer to any investor.  I am not referring just to Shannon Airport but to Plassey technological park, the University of Limerick and many local, national and multi-national industries located in Limerick and the mid-west region in the past three decades.  I am hopeful that a world aviation park will be developed at Shannon Airport.  Shannon aerospace developed successfully in times of recession.  It is a good example of development at an airport and there is room for expansion in regard to Shannon aerospace.</P>
    <P>It may not be fashionable to speak highly of GPA but I do not take any pleasure in seeing a company in difficulty. Its problems did not augur well for the Labour Party or the mid-west region.  I was disappointed GPA made the mistake of delaying its public flotation on the stock market.  With the benefit of hindsight, if it had floated its shares a year earlier it would have been successful and its standing in the past two years would have been different.  Instead it took a wrong option, delayed its flotation and the story of its decline is well known. However, despite its mistake, there is hope for its future success.  I am not a doleful prophet knocking GPA.  I recognise its good work and intelligent work-force who have a great deal of practical experience in aircraft leasing, something about which many of us know nothing. It is a difficult and competitive field but many good people have been employed in that company and their expertise should be used in the interest of national aviation policy.  I am pleased the company has survived and wish it well in <Col N="1809" /> the future.  There is no reason it cannot continue to serve the Shannon and mid-west region.</P>
    <P>Last night in my contribution on the Private Members' motion I stated that Dr. Brendan O'Regan, the founding father of Shannon Airport, is not pessimistic. He is prepared to let bygones be bygones in relation to the change in the status of Shannon Airport.  He is also optimistic that Shannon Airport can survive and diversify and that its future will be as bright at its recent past.  I take hope from Dr. O'Regan's view.  He had great courage, like Sean Lemass, who developed the original Shannon concept. I hope there will be a new enhanced role for the Shannon development company to pull together a number of strands to work with Shannon aerospace, Shannon technological park, to develop a concept of a world aviation in Shannon and to link up with Dr. Walsh, the president of the University of Limerick.  While I do not agree with Dr. Walsh's views on the status of Shannon Airport and other issues, I recognise the good values and standards he has imposed on the University of Limerick and the good practices he set in achieving standards of excellence, not only in the academic area but in the environment in Plassey.  I hope links can be developed between the bodies to which I refer and that they will help in future plans for Shannon.  Despite GPA having been discredited by its failure on the commercial market it could do good work in the Limerick region.  All the groups to which I referred should be brought together.  The task force established by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Cowen, should be used efficiently.  It should be augmented by inviting people who have more specialised knowledge than members of the task force to assist in projects to benefit the region.  We should not retreat into a corner and be frightened, we should be optimistic and look to the future.</P>
    <P>I am interested in Deputy Deasy's view on regional airports which are entitled to their place on the agenda.  No one can foresee the change in aviation in the next <Col N="1810" /> decade.  There must be a role for regional airports which can offer cheaper flights by providing transport in smaller aeroplanes and in that way providing more efficient carriers.  The Deputy is right to question our policy on regional airports as it must be coherent in this area.  One airport cannot be selected and promoted at the expense of others, that is not satisfactory. There must be some rationale in regard to policy and an objective approach in regard to developing regional airports.  The Government must tell Deputies its plans for the development of regional airports.  The Deputy referred to the figure of £12.5 million for Farranfore Airport.  I passed that airport last Friday on the way to Castletownbere, when that figure came to mind.  I have been embarrassed by reference to that figure at many meetings of Limerick City Council where people have tabled questions to discover my attitude in this regard. Deputy Deasy is entitled to raise that question and I would not favour a lobsided development in regard to regional airports.  Decisions on such important issues cannot be made in a cloak and dagger way.  I favour logical planning and investment in airports which will benefit the economy and, in turn, our people.  I do not approve of narrow, hole in the corner measures.  They are not satisfactory.  The aviation industry is far too important to be handled in such a fashion.  Aviation policies must be transparent and open. All Deputies should be aware of the Government's aviation policy, not alone in relation to our major airports of Dublin and Shannon but also in relation to Farranfore Airport, referred to by Deputy Deasy.  I hope the Minister will respond to this point and that it can be referred to again.</P>
    <P>I will not cry over spilt milk in regard to the status of Shannon Airport.  We must be optimistic and courageous.  It is time for vision and for planning our aviation policy with one objective, that is, in the interests of the people.  We must utilise our scarce resources to obtain the maximum result for our people.  Our aviation policy should help the return of industry to this country and attract <Col N="1811" /> tourists.  If we could solve many of our problems, our tourist numbers would double overnight.  Our image in relation to Northern Ireland is that of a troubled strife-torn country.  Too many people here and throughout the world have a concept of Ireland as war torn, where people are being killed daily.  If we can work towards a resolution of the Northern Ireland problem it would transform our economy.</P>
    <P>I was amazed to hear the Minister for Defence, Deputy Andrews, say that our security costs amount to £133 million.  If one adds to that the loss of industry and tourist revenue it is obvious that millions of pounds have been lost to our economy because of the image of Northern Ireland.  We must double our efforts to achieve dialogue in this regard because, if there is dialogue between the parties, it may help to find a solution to the problem.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity of contributing to the debate.  I look forward to increased dialogue between the Government and the Opposition on this matter because we are now at a crossroads in relation to our aviation policy and must find the way forward.  Only time will tell whether Aer Lingus will survive.  Nobody knows that but the company is entitled to a fresh start and the best assistance we can give.  I hope that all interests in the company, management, the workers and the Government can work together to ensure the survival of Aer Lingus in the hostile environment in which it must compete. Shannon also can diversify and make up for any losses that will follow from the changing of its status.  There is no reason Shannon could not also survive.</P>
    <P>We face many problems but we must sort them out ourselves.  There is no panacea to helping us find the way forward. We must do this using our resources, intelligence and with the benefit of our experience.  I hope that this area of aviation will help us to learn from our mistakes of the past and find a way forward in the future.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank all the Deputies who contributed to what has been a most interesting, useful and informative debate.  I wish to pay a special tribute to my colleague, Deputy Kenneally, who, as my predecessor, made a major contribution in progressing this important Bill.  There were a number of points raised to which I would like to respond now and other points with which I will deal in further detail <Col N="1813" /> on Committee Stage.  A number of points were made concerning problems in Aer Lingus and elsewhere which are not relevant to this Bill and I do not intend to respond to them in detail.</P>
      <P>The aviation industry in Ireland covers a very wide spectrum.  Perhaps it was inevitable, therefore, that some contributions strayed into areas not really related to this Bill.  I am referring in particular to such issues as Aer Lingus, the Shannon stopover, and the question of general aviation policy, including EC liberalisation.  These have been dealt with in other debates and, as I have said, I do not propose to address them in any futher detail, at this stage.</P>
      <P>It particularly concerns me that Members of the House persist with the myth that this Government has no aviation policy.  I do not want to labour the point, but our approach is based on an aviation policy which is designed to promote jobs and wealth creation in the aviation industry, improve the competitiveness of all our aviation products, sustain a domestically based and financially viable national airline, ensure an equitable regional distribution of air traffic and that we have the aviation infrastructure to meet the needs of the industry.</P>
      <P>The Irish Aviation Authority Bill is fully in line with that policy.  This Bill is putting in place a semi-state body framework to ensure that we have the regulatory systems and airspace management organisation necessary to meet our present and projected requirements.</P>
      <P>I was pleased with the many tributes which Members of the House rightly paid to ANSO staff.  They are, as stated by myself and many others, a highly competent and dedicated team.  I noted also the many remarks and concerns expressed across the House in relation to staff issues, such as their security of tenure and superannuation arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very aware of the concerns expressed by ANSO staff concerning their transfer to the new organisation. Having personally met the trade unions and staff associations, I have fully recognised <Col N="1814" /> those concerns and on Committee Stage I will be moving a number of amendments to this Bill which will confirm the clarifications already given to staff in relation to these matters.  These clarifications will ensure that their conditions of employment will be protected and not reduced and I am confident that the staff will be satisfied with the changes which we propose to make.</P>
    <P>As pointed out from all sides of the House, the transformation of Civil Service organisations to semi-State status has become a relatively straight forward affair.  While we generally wish to use tried and tested formulae for these matters, different circumstances require different arrangements.  One prime example of this is in relation to section 41, which deals with superannuation.  This section provides for the payments of superannuation to the fund by the Minister for Finance to meet accrued pension liabilities.  These provisions recognise the payments made by ANSO's users over the years for the pensions of ANSO staff.</P>
    <P>Despite the impression given by some contributions, there have been considerable discussions between the staff and official sides in our Department concerning the transfer of ANSO staff to the new Authority.  As I said, I have met the unions, I am aware of the staff concerns, these will be dealt with on Committee Stage and our proposals should be acceptable to the staff.  However, I have no doubt that this Bill will provide the framework within which the necessary discussions on all these issues can be satisfactorily concluded by vesting day on 1 January next.</P>
    <P>I noted with particular concern the interpretations placed on the provision in section 71 of the Bill which excludes the Authority from the ambit of the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act.  In this connection, and in the light of the inferences drawn from that about a lack of trust in ANSO staff, an adjustment to section 17, will meet the case appropriately.</P>
    <P>On the more general issue, a number of Members questioned the motivation for moving ANSO out of the Civil Service <Col N="1815" /> when, by common consensus, ANSO is doing a very good job.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in my opening speech, it has been the general trend of policy for all Governments over the past 20 years to separate what are described as policy and executive functions.  This is also desirable in the case of ANSO because it is clearly an Executive organisation and is also one with proven commercial capability and potential.</P>
    <P>That was not always so.  In the mid 1980s ANSO had poor equipment, was seriously under-invested and was not performing as well as at present.  This good performance by ANSO belies continuing difficulties across a range of areas, including staffing, where ANSO operates within the constraints of Civil Service staffing restrictions.</P>
    <P>Let me give an example of this.  In 1989-90, though staffing was very short, it took ANSO 18 months to recruit staff through the Civil Service channels.  The reasons for the delay can be readily justified, explained and understood in the context of broader public service constraints. However, to the aviation industry, which pays for ANSO services, unreasonable delays in meeting their requirements are unacceptable, no matter how justified they might be.</P>
    <P>As air traffic increases we must commensurately increase capacity to handle it as it arises, not 18 months afterwards. In 1990 Aer Rianta saved the day by providing ANSO with temporary staff within six weeks.  In short, with reasonable freedom as a semi-State body, the new Authority will have the capacity to respond, as the industry requires, with staffing and investment strategies to meet its needs in a timely way.</P>
    <P>I must also mention that across all the consultative mechanisms which our Department has with the aviation industry, there is universal support for the creation of this new Authority.</P>
    <P>One Deputy referred to the fact that we have had to go outside Ireland to recruit staff.  This is true; fortunately, all but two of those recruited are Irish &mdash; in short, we are bringing them all back <Col N="1816" /> home.  We had to recruit trained controllers because of previous constraints on recruitment and because of the danger that our training and replacement programmes were falling too far behind our vital requirements.</P>
    <P>On the wider front, ANSO has been offered a range of consultancies and training contracts and, unfortunately, it has to forego most of these very important opportunities.</P>
    <P>At present ANSO has neither the spare staff, nor the authority to recruit new staff, to provide these valuable and profitable services.</P>
    <P>These are a few brief examples of the type of Civil Service constraints that need to be eliminated.  We are eliminating them by transforming ANSO into a vibrant commercial semi-state body which, as I said, is in line with the general trend of Government strategy to separate policy and executive functions.  Another major issue which I was first to raise and which the Deputies quickly picked up was the whole question of combining the regulatory and operational roles in the new authority.  I was pleased that Deputies rightly share my concern about this matter.  However, as I said in my opening speech, having two separate organisations is not the solution.</P>
    <P>Contrary to what Deputies may believe, the fact is that many international administrations combine both regulatory and operational functions in the one organisation.</P>
    <P>Examples of this can be found in the Civil Aviation Authority &mdash; the CAA &mdash; in Britain, in the Federal Aviation Administration &mdash; the FAA &mdash; in the USA and in the German and Danish Administrations.</P>
    <P>I raised this issue because I wanted to highlight to this House that, like the situation in the countries which I mentioned, the responsibility for accident investigation lies with independent statutory bodies such as the National Transportation Safety Board in the USA.  In our case the Minister will be retaining responsibility for accident investigation.</P>
    <P>However &mdash; this is the unique feature &mdash; we have built into this Bill in sections <Col N="1817" /> 32 and 36 special provisions that will enable the Minister of the day to remain appraised of the policy issues in relation to safety matters.  We have done this because we believe in all prudence the Minister should monitor the standards of the organisation.  I must emphasise that this prudence is in no way a reflection on the competence or integrity of the board, management or staff of the new authority.</P>
    <P>Far from showing uncertainty or lack of sure-footedness these provisions underwrite the Government's very strong commitment to safety.  It is part of the concept that we should not alone have the highest safety standards, but should be seen to have them.</P>
    <P>In the unfortunate event of a major aviation accident, the responsibility of the Irish Aviation Authority, as of ANSO, is to initiate the implementation of the major accident plan.  Further participation by the authority would be through the provision of sevices as defined by that plan.  Subsequently it is the responsibility of the Minister to have the accident investigated in so far as aircraft are involved.  The statutory requirement of the Minister is to investigate and, where possible, determine the cause of the accident and not to apportion blame. This is a well accepted international practice in all navigation matters.  The EC is considering a directive in this matter which will ensure the standardisation of this process within the Community.</P>
    <P>On the issue of profitability, which was also raised by a number of Deputies, let there is no doubt the Irish Aviation Authority is being established with a clear commercial mandate.  However, there are certain key services under international convention, which must be provided on a non-profit basis.  There is nothing unusual about this.  The ESB operates on the same basis.  The ESB mandate on its core business is to break even, taking one year's operations with another.  It can, however, operate on a profitable basis on its non-core activities such as consultancies and training.  The same general approach will be adopted by the Irish Aviation Authority.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1818" /> There is a large and growing potential market for consultancy and training services in every aspect of modern life and commercial actitivy.  It is important that the Authority be established quickly so that it can assign people to chase up the business and opportunities that currently exist and which will generate new income, profitability and employment.</P>
    <P>On the general question of commercial operations there is a further point. ANSO, as part of the departmental and Government accounting arrangements, gets services from other Government agencies on a non-repayment basis. These services include obvious ones like legal advice from the Attorney General's office and not so obvious ones like interest on working capital.  All of these are costs borne by the taxpayer, but not directly by ANSO.</P>
    <P>The best ANSO can do to recoup these hidden costs is to make broad guesstimates of the amounts involved and recoup them from the users.  I need hardly say that this is an unsatisfactory arrangement for all concerned &mdash; Government, ANSO and its many users. I am pleased to say therefore that this unsatisfactory aspect will be rectified when the new authority is established. It is important that users are properly charged for the services which they receive and those charges are fully transparent.</P>
    <P>Another aspect on which I wish to reassure the House is in relation to the question of privatisation.  There is no hidden agenda here.  There is no question of the Irish Aviation Authority being some kind of halfway house to privatisation. In this connection I reiterate what I said in my opening speech; if in the future any of the core functions of the new authority were to be privatised, the whole question would have to be brought back to the Oireachtas for both debate and ultimate decision.  This is surely democracy at its best.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to an issue which interested Deputies on all sides of the House, the whole question of military aircraft.  I have generally used the term Irish airspace in its broadest sense &mdash; that <Col N="1819" /> is the area which we actually control. However, that area includes international airspace over the north Atlantic and airspace off the south coast in which control functions have been delegated to us by international agreement.  When I refer to Irish airspace, I am also including, of course, Irish sovereign airspace.</P>
    <P>Of the 320,000 flight movements that came under Irish control in 1992, 4,627, or approximately 1.5 per cent were military flights.  For comparison purposes there were more than 8,000 military flights in 1991, that is about 2.8 per cent of the overall total and includes the flights operated under UN resolutions in connection with the Gulf War.  Approximately half of the military flights operate through Irish sovereign airspace.</P>
    <P>In this connection I must make it absolutely clear that we fully observe the terms of Article 35 of the Chicago Convention which provides that &ldquo;No munitions of war, or implements of war may be carried in, or above the territory of a State, engaged in international navigation, except by permission of such State&rdquo;.  I can assure the House that the Irish Aviation Authority will continue to observe this very important requirement.  Under the Eurocontrol En-Route Charging System neither we nor the other states directly charge the military authorities for the costs involved.  They are borne directly by each administration on a reciprocal basis.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies mentioned the problems posed by air traffic congestion in Europe that the EATCHIP Programme is designed to solve.  The upsurge in air traffic in the 1980s was acutely felt in Europe through the necessity to impose long and widespread restrictions on flights.  The result led to delays, losses and inconvenience suffered by travellers and business people.  During 1989 and 1990 we had difficulties ourselves, but nothing compared to those of our European partners.</P>
    <P>The difficulties in the 1980s were a compound of the relatively sudden and unforeseen nature of the upsurge in traffic combined with inadequate investment <Col N="1820" /> systems and people.  In response to this crisis, like many other administrations, we in Ireland are giving the required commercial autonomy to those providing air navigation services.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, in 1988 the European Ministers for Transport devised a broad strategy to deal with delays.  The success of that strategy depends on many factors, not least of which are ensuring compatible equipment and systems being used in each state.  There are also factors such as national concerns about sovereignty, military airspace areas and other similarly contentious issues.</P>
    <P>Though progress in resolving the European air traffic problem is being made through the EATCHIP Programme, that progress is slow.  It is little comfort to us or to our airlines, that we do not have the kind of problems here that exist in European airspace.  The European problems occur mainly in the central regions over Germany, Belgium, Switzerland and northern Italy.</P>
    <P>We are aware of the pressure that exists in certain quarters for an integrated European air traffic control system.  It is a practicable concept &mdash; after all the USA has a similar single system.  Ireland, as a partner in the Eurocontrol EATCHIP Programme, is well placed to exploit opportunities for expansions and development of air traffic services.</P>
    <P>We have a modern, flexible and cost effective system on which the new aviation authority can build and broaden its future strategy.</P>
    <P>If the European system or even a major part of it were to be located here we would have no objection. Indeed, if the issue arises, the Government and the new authority, would certainly press very strongly for it.  However, such possibilities are speculative at this stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carey picked up the reference to Prestwick, Scotland, in my opening remarks.  However, I was referring to the Prestwick Air Traffic Control Centre and not to the airport.  Prestwick, in conjunction with our aeronautical radio communications station at Ballygirreen, is the main air traffic control centre for <Col N="1821" /> the North Atlantic on this side of the ocean.  However, the importance of the Prestwick Air Traffic Control Centre has had no bearing on the fate of Prestwick Airport.</P>
    <P>In the Shannon context, I assure the House that our Shannon air traffic control centre will continue to be our main en-route upper airspace control centre. Our strategy for the Shannon air traffic control centre must be to maintain and operate our existing airspace with the maximum effectiveness and efficiency. Our policy will be to endeavour to extend the operational functions and responsibilities of the Shannon centre.  Indeed, investments now in hands will further increase and enhance the capacity of the Shannon centre.</P>
    <P>With regard to the reference made by Deputy Kenneally to the ECA pilot training school in Cork, in the mid-1980s after a period of relative stagnation the world aviation industry entered a period of rapid substantial growth characterised by many factors, including air traffic congestion, expansion of airline fleets and the need for more airline pilots.  The European College of Aeronautics, a private limited company, was established in 1989 whose purpose was to provide approved flying training for pilots to commercial licence and eventually airline transport licence standard. The success of the school obviously depended on having sufficient pupils. However, it was also important that the schools courses be officially recognised as being of the standards set and monitored by ANSO in our Department.  In 1991 ANSO approved the college's course for integrated training for pilots to commercial pilot licence standard.</P>
    <P>All Ministers encourage as far as possible ventures such as the European College of Aeronautics.  However, such ventures must, as private sector enterprises, stand or fall by their own commercial standards.  Sadly the Cork venture failed.  This was not because of the initiative in Waterford, and I wish that project every success.  Following the failure in Cork a task force was established to consider the potential for pilot <Col N="1822" /> training.  The task force has not yet finalised its report and it would be presumptuous of me to prejudice the outcome.  Beyond its normal regulatory functions I see little role for the aviation authority in relation to such a school.</P>
    <P>I noted the concern expressed by Deputy Shortall about the cost of meteorological services supplied to the authority.  I will have that examined and will report on it on Committee Stage. The Deputy, and the meteorological staff who have expressed such concerns, do not put sufficient weight on the Minister's role in this matter.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I reiterate that the Bill is entirely compatible with the Government's policy to ensure that the aviation industry has an effective, efficient and enabling infrastructure and regulatory environment.  I thank the House for its consideration and contributions on this Bill and look forward to participating in the Committee Stage, on Tuesday July 13, with the Members of the new Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Shortly after coming into office, I made arrangements to relieve the pressure on <Col N="1823" /> acute hospitals.  I provided £500,000 which resulted in the transfer of patients who were inappropriately placed in acute hospitals to more suitable accommodation. This resulted in a reduction in the pressure on the acute hospitals.</P>
      <P>From information available to me for the first quarter of 1993, overall activity is broadly in line with the activity for the same period in 1992.  I am aware that the pressure of medical admissions continued for a longer period this year than heretofore and, in fact, this pressure only eased quite recently.</P>
      <P>The allocation of £4 million in 1993 towards the phased implementation of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 will also contribute towards alleviating pressure on the acute hospitals sector by ensuring that people no longer in need of acute hospital care can be nursed in appropriate step-down facilities.  I can assure the Deputy that it has been Government policy to maintain 12,000 beds in the acute hospitals sector, thus ensuring the adequacy of patient care.</P>
      <P>My Department, in conjunction with the health boards, will continue to monitor the effect of accident and emergency admissions on the hospitals and I can assure the Deputy that appropriate action will be taken to maintain adequate hospital services.  I am satisfied that, where urgent treatment is required, it will be provided.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I would like to approach this issue from a different angle.  Would the Minister accept that, in a new trend, people who are dying are being sent home from acute hospitals?  I am aware of four cases where the people concerned survived just two days, three days, four days and five days respectively.  Their families were put under pressure to take them home.  Each of them was admitted to a district hospital.  Have we reached the point at which it is no longer possible to die with dignity because of the pressure on beds? I appreciate the difficulties that hospitals face.</P>

      <P>I am loath to comment on clinical decision, as it is a matter for the doctor and consultant directly concerned to decide whether a patient should be sent home, but I am anxious to ensure that a range of beds is available.  Every patient does not need an acute hospital bed.  I hope that whatever is considered to be the most appropriate bed required, be it a less expensive non-acute hospital bed, an acute hospital bed or a hospice bed, will be made available in the health system.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Would the Minister accept that, because of the pressure on hospitals to make beds available, they are putting too much pressure on families, almost to the point of intimidation, to take the patient home?

      <P>The survey to which the Deputy is referring, <i>The Experience of Stress Amongst Irish Nurses</i>, was commissioned by the Irish Nurses' Organisation and was published on Wednesday, 30 June 1993.  My Department received a summary of the report on the date of publication.  Copies of the full report <Col N="1825" /> were ordered from the Irish Nurses Organisation and were received in the last couple of days.  The contents of this report will be considered by my Department, as is the case with all reports pertaining to the health service, and it would be inappropriate for me to offer any comment either on the survey or its context until that process has been completed.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> In view of the fact that the Minister is not prepared to comment, any comment I would make would be superfluous.  It is stated that the survey confirms that nursing is in a state of crisis.  In view of this, would the Minister not accept that he should deal with the matter as a matter of urgency?  It is mentioned in the survey that nurses have to work a 12-hour shift which in this day and age is beyond reason and that 46 per cent of nurses surveyed said that they had been assaulted.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Health</askee>
      <Quest>the specific measures, if any, that have been introduced in the health boards to give effect to the recommendations of the report of the Kilkenny Incest Inquiry since the publication of that report in April 1993.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should point out that the report of the Kilkenny Incest Investigation was published on 25 May last, not in April as suggested in the Deputy's question.</P>
      <P>Since then a great deal of time and attention has been devoted, both within my Department and in the health boards, to follow-up on the many recommendations made in the report.  The central recommendation in the report relates to the implementation of the Child Care Act and, in particular, those provisions which deal with the taking of children into care and which stengthen the powers of health boards, the gardaí and the courts in relation to children at risk.</P>
      <P>As I have previously informed the House, the Government has accepted this recommendation and is committed to the full implementation of the Act by the end of 1996.  A sum of £5 million has been set aside this year so that we can begin the task of putting in place the necessary staff, structures, services and facilities to operate the new legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The health boards have been working intensively with my Department over the last few weeks to prepare plans for the development of child care and family support <Col N="1827" /> services in the light of the funding now available and the time-scale that has been determined by Government for the full operation of the Act.  Detailed proposals have been submitted to my Department and I expect to be in a position to convey the necessary approvals within a matter of days.  Among the areas that have been targeted for development are: extra community care staff including social workers, child care workers and psychologists, establishment of child psychiatric teams particularly in areas where none exists at present, new residential and therapeutic units, hostels for homeless children, refuges for battered wives, home makers for families under stress, family placements for difficult adolescents, improved financial support for voluntary bodies and expansion of day care services for children at risk.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that the Kilkenny report is being urgently pursued and that the developments now under way will result in a significant improvement in the range and quality of our child care services, particularly those aimed at children who have been or are at risk of being abused and neglected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the Minister's protestations, it is almost two months since the publication of the report on the Kilkenny incest case.  This report was heralded as being a milestone in child care policy development.  It is four months since the details of that case were revealed in the Central Criminal Court and it is two years since the 1991 Act, which was 20 years agrowing, was signed into law.  The Minister has not justified the apparent inaction by his Department in implementing the recommendations of that report.  Would the Minister not agree that nothing has changed in the way child abuse cases are dealt with at the coalface? The practices which were referred to in the Kilkenny incest case are still in place, no extra resources have been provided and management practices have not been changed.  Is the Minister aware that social workers are living with the fear that hundreds of horrific cases of child abuse are <Col N="1828" /> not merely waiting to happen but are waiting to be discovered?  Social workers think that they are expected&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I wish to add another timeframe to the litany of timeframes outlined by the Deputy.  In a few days time I will be six months in office.  Few issues have been addressed as expeditiously as the Kilkenny incest case. I say this to give due credit to the officials in my Department who are charged with responsibility for this area.  During the few weeks since the report was published on 18 May, I have established a child care policy unit within my Department dedicated specifically to this task.  That unit has visited each health board area and discussed with management the new structures required to implement the Act.  It has drawn up a list of priorities for each health board area.  That report has been submitted to me for my decision, which will be made within the next few days.  We have already had discussions with the Garda, the Department of Justice and the Department of Education on a range of issues which covered everything from the stay safe programmes to giving further protection to battered families.  The Deputy's remarks are not a fair reflection of the urgency with which both I and my officials have addressed this issue.  The Deputy and the House can be well pleased with the progress which has been made in the last few weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a special child care advisory committee has not yet been set up in the Eastern Health Board area, the largest health board area in the country?  This relates to section 7 of the Child Care Act which has already been implemented. There are 104 children awaiting child guidance services in the Eastern Health Board area and between 15-20 per cent of these cases relate to child abuse.  I <Col N="1829" /> accept that the Minister is moving as speedily as he can on the issue, but committees sitting around tables in his Department will not change the position at the coalface.  I am not happy that sufficient support has been put in place for social workers who are charged with the responsibility of looking after child abuse cases.</P>

It will be the best resourced health board subsequent to the Government decision to allocate it an additional £5 million.  As I have said from day one, I do not intend simply to implement the Act.  I want to provide the resources on the ground, for example, personnel, structural resources and a legislative framework.  All these measures need to be put in place before the Act can be operated.  I am happy that the progress made has been achieved as quickly as is practicable.  The full allocations will be made and the full training and recruitment processes will be put in place.  The drawing up of the regulations and the enactment of whatever further legislative provisions are required are in hands at present.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 14 together.  I have reported in this House on a number of occasions that the inter-departmental working group on medical indemnity has completed the first phase of its remit and has submitted its interim report to me.</P>
      <P>A revised medical indemnity scheme has been introduced for non-consultant hospital doctors, dentists and community doctors, as a consequence of the first phase of the group's work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The group is now proceeding with the second phase of its remit and will be examining other aspects of medical <Col N="1831" /> indemnity including the feasibility of a State indemnity scheme.  I will await the presentation of the group's final report before deciding on any particular course of action and on whether the group's reports should be published.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> In view of the increase in the number of claims for medical negligence and the fact that a consultant who paid £120 for insurance cover in 1981 is now paying £21,000 for the same cover, does the Minister not think it is time to set up a medical review panel which would go through some of these claims in advance and weed out any frivolous ones?  Would this not help to save costs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's suggestion is one of a number of suggestions being considered by the review group at present.  One entire category of medical personnel &mdash; the non-consultant hospital doctors, the community care doctors and the dental staff employed in public health services &mdash; are covered under the existing scheme.  The cost to the Exchequer of running this scheme is very significant. The Deputy referred to the high insurance costs paid by consultants. Between 80-90 per cent of this amount is recouped from the public purse.  The total cost of medical indemnity to the Department of Health is approximately £16 million. I am anxious to do something about this.  A number of options for dealing with this problem present themselves, including the one to which the Deputy referred.  During the debate on the Estimates and in reply to questions I have outlined the other range of options being studied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Would the Minister not agree that the cost to the State of this scheme, £16 million, would provide many medical services which is all the more reason consideration should be given to ways of cutting down costs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>A working group is considering <Col N="1832" /> all the options.  There are no easy options.  Other countries have tried different schemes, some of which have cost more than the original schemes.  I do not want to go from the frying pan into the fire.  Some of the options being looked at are a State indemnity scheme, a select no-fault compensation scheme, an expert panel or tribunal, a change in social welfare codes to balance benefits to victims and a combination of all these options.</P>
      <P>A range of options is being studied and I hope to have the report sent back to me at an early date for decision.</P>

      <P>The report to which the Deputy refers was presented to me by a collaborative study group representative of my Department, Comhairle na nOspidéal and the Postgraduate Medical and Dental Board.  The main purpose of the report is to stimulate discussion and debate with a view to gaining concensus on an equitable mix and distribution of medical manpower in acute hospitals throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I have, therefore, circulated the report to all those with an interest in the subject and sought their comments by the end of October.  When these are received, I will have them considered in my Department before deciding on any particular course of action.  However, the overall objective will be to maintain and improve patient care and to provide a satisfactory working environment and career prospects for hospital doctors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I note that this discussion document has been with the Minister since March.  Will he indicate his views on the proposed reduction in overall hospital manpower?  While everybody welcomes the principle of a higher ratio of consultants to junior hospital doctors &mdash; it is recognised that this should improve hospital services &mdash; the proposal contained in the report would have major implications for hospital care.  Would the Minister not be concerned about an overall reduction of 500 in medical personnel? Recent media reports indicate that a saving of £10 million would be made if the recommendations of the report were implemented whereas, as far as I am aware, it is clearly stated in the report that there would be a cost to the Exchequer in implementing its recommendations. Will the Minister clarify that?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister, who has stated clearly he is in favour of equality in the health services, make a statement about the greatest inequity in our hospital service: public patients are treated so differently from private patients that it has a direct impact on their health.  This would no longer be the case if his predecessor, Erskine Childers, who introduced equity into the general medical services had succeeded in doing so in the whole service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has posed a range of questions.  I stated my opinion the last time we had questions and again when we discussed the Estimates for my Department.  This report is important to stimulate discussion and I circulated it to virtually every non-consultant hospital doctor, and to every consultant, to every acute hospital, voluntary hospital and every health board.  I hope I will receive a broad range of reaction to it by October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of issues arises from the report which I obviously would like to address.  I have already voiced opinions on them.  I believe there are too few consultants and that the training process, in other words the number of years that somebody serves as a junior hospital doctor, is inappropriate.  The average age of newly appointed consultants is 38, and <Col N="1834" /> that is too old.  I am also concerned about the gender balance in appointments.  The report points out that although 50 per cent of medical graduates are women only 16 per cent of consultants are women.  That is a cause of concern and needs to be addressed.  A number of issues will be addressed consequent on the report.</P>
    <P>There will be a cost to the Department of Health in implementing the recommendations of this report.  I am glad to have the opportunity to comment on newspaper headlines because last Sunday the headline for all to see was &ldquo;Department of Health to cut 800 jobs: 800 doctors to go in hospitals&rdquo;.  This is a report from a review group and is for discussion in relation to a rebalancing of consultant and non-consultant hospital doctors.  It was a totally inaccurate headline.</P>
    <P>On the issue of equality of treatment, it is my objective that every citizen, regardless of medical cover or financial position, will be treated on the basis of medical need and not on any financial supports they might have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister include the question of a new common contract for consultants when it comes to the end of the consultation process?  Is the Minister saying that he will propose this as the only way to ensure patients will be treated equally?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

      <P>The Government is committed under the Programme for a Partnership Government to reviewing the charter of rights for hospital patients so as to make any necessary improvements and to ensure that it provides a properly structured system of patients' rights.  The review is under way at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have discussed this directly with the medical organisations representing doctors at each level of the hospital services and am heartened by their response.  They share my view that a great many complainants can be satisfied on the spot if the patient has access to the doctor concerned.  The requirement to put complaints in writing often starts a process that neither the hospital consultant, the hospital nor the individual complainant wants.  I would prefer a system that defuses a complaint by having ready access to the hospital and all its staff regarding the treatment of the patient.  I am very glad to say that approach is accepted by the medical organisations I have spoken to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that, apart from being a good exercise in democracy to allow people to make their complaints, it contributes to <Col N="1836" /> diminishing the number of cases in the courts and the high cost of medical indemnity.  Does he agree that if a complaints procedure could be initiated at an early stage it would contribute substantially to reducing the problem of cases going to court?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I totally agree with the Deputy and in that context I discussed that suggestion with the medical organisation. They agree that often misunderstandings when not addressed immediately fester into something more serious.  A great many of the issues that end up in the courts, or at least in formal complaints and threats of litigation, could be defused if there was intervention at an earlier stage.  It is interesting that in the region of 85 per cent of cases threatening litigation never go to court.</P>

I hope the Minister will have that eliminated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

      <P>I certainly agree with the Deputy about the right of people to have access to their files.  When I was on the other side of the House I drafted a Bill in that regard.  Access to files is part of the charter.  If there are hospitals which are not complying with it I would like to know about them.  The Deputy will also be aware that in relation to other files held in my Department I have given instructions that they are to be released to any patient who seeks access to them.</P>

      <P>I ask the Minister to examine the problem in the context of the dearth of adequate post-natal services generally for women in Ireland. This is one area of women's health which has been neglected during the past number of years.  Because of the very short stay in hospital following a birth &mdash;<Col N="1838" /> usually three days &mdash; young women are sent home without any post-natal services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is some merit in looking at the antenatal and postnatal situation in relation to counselling, support services, proper preparation and counselling afterwards.  We have a commitment to establish a stillbirths register. It is very important for people who have lost children that there should be an official record of it.  That is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, who is actively pursuing the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms. McManus Ms. McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms. McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of a recent report indicating that in many cases of health education, women were considered by the medical profession as being very good at transmitting information and advising young mothers?  In Ireland there is a very good stillbirth association.  Would the Minister not consider investing in that type of care? Would he agree that in many circumstances a medical practitioner to advise a woman during the post-natal period is probably not the most appropriate use of funds?  It may well be that people who are not medically qualified but are committed to helping mothers &mdash; women who have had stillbirths &mdash; could be brought in by a paramedical service to advise people, particularly in rural areas, where it may be difficult to provide the full professional services that may be available in urban centres.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has raised two points which are worthy of consideration. Certainly, the whole issue of having non-medical advisers is something I will consider.  In regard to the gender of counsellors, it strikes me that it would be preferable that it be a woman.  I would refer to the lack of women in consultant posts which arose in the previous question. Both of those points deserve consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that much of the ongoing post-hospital <Col N="1839" /> counselling service could be delivered through family support centres in the community if they were given the resources and alerted to the need that exists in many communities?  Perhaps that would be the ideal vehicle through which to deliver the service on an ongoing basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure I agree with the Deputy.  Many of the family support services are involved with particularly vulnerable families.  A person who has lost a child cannot be regarded as vulnerable and in need of a family centre. They have a specific need for counselling during a period of crisis or trauma and the family centre may not be the best vehicle to deliver the service in all circumstances.</P>

Is the Minister convinced that a proper waste management policy is a priority with hospitals or with health boards or is it the case that in times of scarce funding patient care comes first and very little, if any, money is left over for a proper waste management operation? That being so there is an obligation on the Minister's Department to make funding available specifically for a proper waste policy management in hospitals for the elimination of problems arising in the case of incinerators, such as that in the Regional Hospital, Cork?</P>

      <P>There are two aspects to addressing the issue: a comprehensive policy of waste minimisation and a comprehensive and safe policy of waste disposal. I have approached the issue in three strands.  The preparation of a departmental health waste policy is complete. Then there is the preparation by the individual health agencies of their own plan.  The implementation of that plan will be the next phase.  I hope all that can be done within the next couple of months.  I am concerned that we should not always be dragged into fulfilling proper environmental standards by EC legislation.  A number of EC Directives impinge upon environmental protection and environmental purity.  More are being drawn up which will specifically address the issue of hospital waste.

As a member of the Southern Health Board, Deputy Allen is aware that, while the problem has existed there for some years and has been well analysed and documented, no action has been taken either by the health board or the hospital.  The Minister is aware of that also.  Will the Minister issue a special directive and provide the funding?  In what manner will the Environmental Protection Agency be involved so that we can put an end to the talk and the grumbling and start taking action to eliminate this problem which exists not alone in the regional hospital in Cork but in other hospitals in Cork and practically every health board area in the country?  This is a serious problem and it is time that the talking and the grumblings ceased and action commenced.</P>

The Department of the Environment informed my Department that an EC directive on hazardous waste will be published in December this year. Those regulations will cover such matters as the handling, transport and disposal of hospital waste.

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, seasonal summer closures have been a characteristic of the provision and organisation of hospital services throughout the country for many years.  They are generally planned to coincide with annual leave arrangements for staff, at a time <Col N="1845" /> when the level of activity has traditionally decreased.  An opportunity is also availed of, during this period, to refurbish wards.</P>
      <P>Details of summer service plans have now been received in my Department from hospital and health board authorities. On the basis of the information available to my Department at present, the national average number of beds proposed for closure during June-August is 530, compared with 934 during the same period last year.  The proposals regarding summer closures in 1993 should also be viewed in the context of the total of 12,000 acute hospital beds available in this country.  In addition, I would emphasise that all emergency and urgent services will continue to be provided.  As in other years, my Department will be monitoring the situation regarding seasonal closures and will remain in constant touch with health agencies about this matter.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> In view of the first priority Question relating to pressure on the number of beds, with 530 beds closing over the summer months, will we not be faced with further difficulties unless we can guarantee that people will not get sick?  Can we afford to close 530 beds during the summer?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the initiative I took in regard to hospital waiting lists and the allocation of an additional £20 million in that area, there was a 43 per cent reduction in bed closures this year. A total of 934 beds closed last year but not all for the full summer period. Hospitals close beds at different times of the year.  A hospital in the Deputy's home town closed a ward for refurbishment purposes and that is also taken into <Col N="1846" /> account in the general number of bed closures.  Upgrading and redecorating are other reasons for ward closures.  I am satisfied that there will be a significant throughput, much greater than in recent years, throughout the summer period and that every emergency and requirement for hospital services will be met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister admit that behind the figures he has quoted the reality is that some wards are mixed and public service patients, at a time when they are most vulnerable, are being humiliated and degraded by having to share wards with members of the opposite sex?  That is an affront to the dignity and sensitivity of patients at a vulnerable time in their lives.  Does the Minister believe that position is acceptable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question but I will address it.  Some wards are mixed, for example, intensive care units deal with both sexes at the same time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>That has always been the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally speaking, I do not support the idea of mixed wards.  If the Deputy had tabled a separate question on that matter I would have crawled through the country to discover where that is occurring.  I am pleased that a couple of health boards will have no bed closures this summer.  That is a significant new development.  The number of bed closures across the country this year will be insignificant compared with other years and some wards will close for refurbishment purposes.</P>
      <P>There is obviously a diminution in throughput during the month of August in particular.  We ourselves will not be here in this House in August, and hospital staff are entitled to their holidays the same as everybody else, obviously maintaining an essential level of activity that I have indicated will be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly hope that none of us will be sick during the month <Col N="1847" /> of August.  No ordinary general practice closes down for a couple of weeks in August in the hope that people will be looked after by somebody else.  Would the Minister not agree that the best way to prove his seriousness about cutting waiting lists &mdash; which have built up dramatically in recent years in part at least due to bed closures during the summer &mdash; would be to state that there will be no bed closures this summer? That would be a clear indication of his commitment to reducing the waiting list. Would the Minister not also agree that this closing down in the summer is a recent phenomenon and is not because doctors are on holidays but because they are not replaced when they are on holidays? Lastly, would the Minister indicate how many wards are closed because of refurbishment and how many because of cutbacks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no incidence of ward closures because of cutbacks.  The voted amount of money this year is up by 12 per cent and that is before taking into account the additional £30 million added in the budget that provides my £20 million for the hospital waiting list initiative, plus other initiatives on mental handicap services, dental services and so on.  It is quite misleading for the Deputy to introduce the notion of cutbacks.</P>
      <P>In regard to GP practices, no GP works 52 weeks of the year either.  If one looks for one's GP on some weekend or long holiday one may find that there will be somebody else covering for them or one may have to go somewhere else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my point.  Get the locums into the hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Similarly, not every bed will be open for the duration of the year but there will be sufficient beds in the country for anyone who needs hospitalisation. It is quite alarmist and quite wrong of the Deputy to say she hopes nobody gets sick in August.  Let me make it clear that anybody who requires hospitalisation in August, January or September <Col N="1848" /> will be provided with it. Obviously elective patients will not be called while the hospital is operating at its lowest level during the summer months. That is the way hospitals have traditionally operated.  There should be some appreciation of the fact that this year we will have the lowest level of bed closures in many years, a diminution of 43 per cent on last year which was not a bad year when one considers what happened from 1977 and 1988 onwards.  Bed closures are not a recent phenomenon. There will be extremely good cover and many hospitals will be working flat out in many health board areas on the throughput of an additional 17,200 extra procedures which I have funded on top of the normal 1992 input, thanks to the availability of £20 million for the waiting list initiative.  That should be applauded on all sides of the House.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Let me compliment the Minister on his efforts, lest he thinks we are completely against him.  However, I have to say the Minister is being carried away by &ldquo;lies, damned lies and statistics&rdquo;.  He gave a lovely figure there, 43 per cent, and since both of us spend years teaching sums, I will not argue about the accuracy of it. However, if 934 beds too many were closed last year, any bed closed this year is still too many.  Saying that things are only half as bad as last year is like the difference between saying a glass is half empty or half full.  If I get sick in August &mdash; the fact that I am out of here does not mean I will not get sick &mdash; it is no consolation to me to know that the staff who are entitled to their holidays are not being replaced by locums.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Deputy that if he does get sick in August he will be well looked after in his hospital in Kilkenny which is currently being extended at great cost to the State, or in the new regional hospital in Waterford which is now a state-of-the-art flagship hospital.  The Deputy need have no fears about his health throughout the summer or at any other time of the year.</P>

Approximately 25 hospitals that responded fall into that category and they would incluce all the main children's hospitals, including Temple Street Hospital, Harcourt Stret Hospital and Our Lady's Hospital.  The second category includes hospitals where there is no specific overnight accommodation but they would offer armchairs or chairbeds to parents who wish to stay by their children's side for the night.  About ten hospitals fall into that category.  The third category includes hospitals that have no overnight facilities, mainly because they treat no children or very few children during the year.  About six hospitals fall into that category.</P>

It was agreed to exclude several groups of workers from the provisions of the directive.  Among those excluded are doctors in training.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I am appalled that doctors in training are excluded from the terms of the EC directive. Doctors in hospital training are treated like slaves.  It is questionable whether patients can be helped by doctors who work such long hours.  This exemption under the EC directive is outrageous.  Will doctors have to work incredible hours each week?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been significant improvements in the working hours of non consultant hospital doctors in recent times.  An agreement was reached with the Irish Medical Organisation in 1989 on a reduction of the average working week to 65 hours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Until that time doctors were working up to 100 hours.  In the United Kingdom an 80 hour week is the norm for doctors.  Taking account of various forms of leave granted to NCHDs the average hours worked per week are 52.  Having regard to the fact that doctors are undergoing training that number of hours is not totally unreasonable.  This links in with a previous question regarding the training period for NCHDs.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that one of the most disturbing trends in the medical area is the level of litigation and the cost of medical indemnity insurance? Has the Minister or his Department carried out any study on the link between the duration of hours worked by health <Col N="1853" /> workers, the level of stress and level of litigious claims?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

      <P>Would the Minister agree that the exemption in respect of hours which was politically negotiated under the EC Directive was sensible given the state of the health services here?  Having regard to the consultation document on manpower services in hospitals, in the short to medium term it may be possible to reduce the hours worked by non consultant hospital doctors, but at present before any restructuring takes place it is politically correct to exempt medical services from the terms of the EC directive.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a priority to ensure adequate medical cover in each hospital. I would be reluctant to agree to anything that would immediately impact on the quality, cover and number of professionals available in our hospitals.  Significant costs were involved in reducing the number of hours worked in 1989. That cost is borne annually in the health services.  Any further reduction in the number of hours worked by NCHDs will have a cost implication as will any restructuring of the ratio between consultants and NCHDs.  They will be significant cost factors on an ongoing basis and must be viewed in the context of the available resources in the health care area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that it is desirable that stressful work should be carried out by doctors who are not over-stretched because of their working hours?  The EC directive is being introduced because it is desirable to have a shorter working week.  It is a shameful omission that the directive does not apply to health workers.  Could this matter be resolved through a job-sharing scheme?  There does not appear to be any job-sharing scheme for consultants.  The profession, especially women consultants, <Col N="1854" /> have signalled that job-sharing would be a welcome development within the hospital service.  The existing EC Directive provides that there should be a 48-hour working week limit for health care workers.  Would the Minister consider job-sharing as a solution to the problem of long hours worked by health care workers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be a dramatic improvement compared to our present working hours.  Doctors in training are excluded from the provision in the directive. The directive will apply to all other categories.  If the 48-hour principle is applied across the board to non-consultant hospital doctors the cost factor involved must be considered.  I would be willing to consider the issue of job-sharing. The issue relates not just to doctors but to nurses also.  I am sure many Deputies have been approached by nurses who wish to work on a part-time basis.  There appears to be some resistance to a job-sharing scheme in some areas of the health service, but I am addressing this issue.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I accept a reduction from 100 hours a week to 65 is a great improvement.  It is a case of lies and damn lies.  I am not accusing the Minister of telling lies.  Working 100 hours is absurd and 65 hours is just as indefensible.  The doctors working those hours are treating patients who are at their lowest ebb and those patients should be treated by doctors who are relaxed and not under stress.  I do not understand why doctors and the unions <Col N="1855" /> representing them agree to those hours of work.</P>

      <P>In the United Kingdom an 80 hour week for health care workers is the norm.  People assume that the United Kingdom has an advanced health service.

      <P>It is a training process and most people in training work longer hours than the recognised norm which applies to those who are qualified.  The training period for doctors is a more crucial issue and consideration must be given to reducing that period so that people may become consultants at an earlier age and work shorter hours.  I would favour a hospital system that is not only consultant led but consultant provided.  I would like more consultants available on the wards to treat patients directly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the 1970 Health Act national school children are eligible for dental treatment in respect of defects noticed at a school dental examination. Children who have left national school remain eligible for orthodontic treatment in respect of defects which were diagnosed while they were still at national school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In most instances, children are over 12 years of age before they are provided <Col N="1856" /> with orthodontic treatment because the individual's dentition has not sufficiently developed until that age.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms. O'Donnell Ms. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the general rule outlined in the Minister's reply there are cases of people identified as entitled to orthodontic treatment while at national school who have seen their entitlement lapse while on the waiting list. Would the Minister agree that it is fundamentally unjust that that should happen?  The parents of those children must pay very expensive fees for orthodontic treatment when those children attend secondary school.  Those parents are generally in the low to middle income brackets and have to pay for everything and get very little in return for their hard work and the taxes they pay to the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of orthodontic treatment raises a number of problems. It is an extremely expensive procedure and is relatively recent.  There was no great demand for orthodontic treatment ten years ago and now there is a significant demand for it.  It involves a significant cost.  That service must be funded by the health service.  Considerable resources have been put in place each year since 1990 and a number of initiatives have been taken.  Six consultant orthodontists were appointed to the Southern Health Board, the Western Health Board, the North-Western Health Board, the South-Eastern Health Board and the Eastern Health Board. The Midland Health Board and the North-Eastern Health Board are seeking consultant posts and they have the resources to employ consultants.</P>
      <P>There has been an increase in the number of orthodontic cases dealt with, from 3,400 in 1988 to more than 5,000 cases per year at present.  In the past few weeks I have allocated an additional £700,000 to health boards to further improve orthodontic services.  As resources become available I will strive to allocate them to this area.</P>

However, given that some people are not entitled to orthodontic and dental treatment provided by the State, will the Minister examine the high cost of these services in the private sector compared to Northern Ireland where similar services can be had for half the cost?</P>

That will cover the categories about which the Deputy has expressed concern.  I have no control over the cost of private dental services. If people are contracting a service on a private basis they can demand fees off the general public.  Unless they are acting in the public service I have no control over them.</P>

In fact, she is in the process of training additional dentists in orthodontistry and that is already having a dramatic impact in that area.  However, these matters are progressive and as more dentists are trained and skilled in this field the throughput will be better.  Also, as additional resources, in terms of people and equipment, are made available improvements will take place.  However, the more resources are provided, the greater the demand.  Once we have consultant orthodontists and trained dentists in every health board area a demand will arise for consultant periodontists.</P>

If we are interested in cost containment in the public service the Minister must take an interest in those people who have been driven from the public health service to the private health care service.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The report, <i>The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly</i> is the first official report to recommend comprehensive measures relating to the provision of respite places for the elderly. The report emphasised the importance of additional day care places and respite facilities to offer carers a break from caring during the day or for short and regular periods of time.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Years Ahead&rdquo; has been accepted by the Government as a policy towards the elderly.  In the years 1990 to 1992 the Government allocated an additional £9 million to the health boards to facilitate the implementation of the recommendations of the report dealing with the expansion of home nursing and home help services and of facilities for the elderly in the community.  These extra funds have enabled the health boards to recruit additional public health nurses, general nurses working in the community, home helps and home care attendants.  In addition, they have been able to provide more day care centres, respite places and extended care beds.  Each health board provides respite services.  It is the policy of my Department to encourage boards to extend these facilities.</P>
      <P>The Southern Health Board provides a full range of services for the elderly, from assessment and rehabilitation in the specialist unit in Cork Regional Hospital, to extended nursing care in long stay institutions and nursing homes, to community care services including services in the home and at day care centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present the Southern Health Board provides 21 respite beds for the elderly in Cork city in the following locations&mdash; St. Patrick's Hospital, Wellington Road, St. Joseph's Mount Desert and St. Luke's Home, Military Hill.  The provision of such hospital-based respite care has proven to be beneficial to the elderly <Col N="1860" /> person being cared for, in that assessment or treatment can be offered, as well as providing an important break for the carer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that 21 respite beds is grossly inadequate in a city of 138,000 people, a large percentage of whom are now over 65 years of age?  That number is growing because people are now living longer.  The result of this insufficiency of respite beds is that families cannot find a respite bed for their relatives even for one week of the year. Very often the people who suffer most are middle aged mothers trying to raise their children and coping with all the demands that entails while, at the same time, trying to care for elderly relatives at a time when their own energy and health is diminishing.</P>

      <P>Hundreds of families have requested me to assist in obtaining respite beds for their relatives for even one week of the year but there are none available.

What action does the Minister intend to take to increase the number of respite beds which would give some hope and assistance to these families?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of respite beds is relatively new.  Traditionally people cared for their elderly relatives at home and never thought of taking a couple of weeks holiday in the year.  That has been recognised in &ldquo;The Years Ahead&rdquo; approach.  That report has been adopted by the Government and significant resources have been put in place to provide not only respite care but a range of other services.  These include home care facilities, which are important to support people at home, home helps, an increase in the number of district liaison nurses, the employment of additional public health nurses, general trained nurses, chiropodists and physiotherapists, all of whom have been recruited in the past <Col N="1861" /> couple of years to provide a proper infrastructure. Community health facilities, including day care centres, short term, respite care and long stay care facilities are being improved also.  It should be noted also that in 1990 a consultant physiogeriatrician was appointed in Cork. Those measures were introduced in the past few years to improve general conditions for the elderly.  The most significant advance was the enactment of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act which will provide another alternative to the respite bed.  This is all part of a strategy rather than a single process.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister admit that it is not too much for a carer to expect one week in the year when they would not be required to stay at home looking after an elderly relative?  This is a crucial element in the programme that the Minister has outlined and there is a great need for an extension of that service to enable families to keep their elderly relatives at home.</P>

      <P>I concede there has been some improvement in this area. However, will the Minister agree that the consequent knock-on effect of the inadequacies in the system as outlined by Deputy Quill is that high cost acute beds are occupied by elderly patients?  Has the <Col N="1862" /> Minister considered treating other health boards in the same manner as the Eastern Health Board, by giving them a special allocation so that extra beds can be provided for elderly people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that, due to recent lack of nursing home beds, people were wrongly placed in acute beds and as a result those who should have been in these beds were denied access to them.  Within days of coming to office I took action to address the problem in the Eastern Health Board area, which was welcomed, even by people outside the Eastern Health Board.  The £4 million available to me from Government will enable the Health (Nursing Homes) Act to be implemented throughout the country.  I would use this opportunity to inform the House that negotiations have concluded with nursing homes organisations.  I will be in a position shortly to finalise the regulations and hope to have the Health (Nursing Homes) Act in place very soon.</P>

      <P>The woodwork theory paper presented to students who sat the 1992 junior certificate exam through Irish was riddled with mistakes.  I can identify at least 23 mistakes in the paper which I will forward to the Minister.  Needless to <Col N="1948" /> say students taking this exam were placed at a severe disadvantage &mdash; more than 200 students were affected, especially in the Gaeltacht areas and in the Gaelcholáistí.</P>
      <P>Because of the mistakes grades obtained by these students in woodwork do not reflect their true ability.  This is totally unjust and should be rectified. One method of rectifying the injustice would be to give all students who did the exam through Irish an extra grade, for example, B instead of C, etc.  The junior certificate which was issued recently could be recalled from those affected and the necessary adjustment quite easily made.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been made aware of the injustice on a number of occasions, as was her predecessor, Deputy Séamus Brennan.  It is frustrating for those involved, including teachers, students and parents, that no corrective action has been taken.  The seriousness and injustice of the situation has not been fully appreciated by the Department.  In a Dáil reply on 18 May the Minister admitted that officials of the Department of Education were at fault due to pressure of work.  She also stated in that reply that a senior inspector rechecked the &ldquo;cheachtaí saothraithe&rdquo;, that is the work exercises.  Obviously the Minister was referring to the practical part of the exam.  However, there was no problem with the practical test; the problem arose on the theory paper.  Of course it is pointless rechecking papers without taking the errors which appeared in the exam paper into account as it is obvious that the students concerned would perform much better under normal circumstances.  The grades obtained by students who sat this exam do not reflect their true ability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year the Department of Education has given a commitment that allowance will be made for one small mistake in the leaving certificate mathematics paper and the geography junior certificate paper.  Surely it would be fair and just to compensate those students who <Col N="1949" /> were presented with such a flawed woodwork theory exam paper through Irish in 1992.  I hope the Minister will rectify this injustice immediately by at least upgrading those students who sat the exam by one grade.</P>

      <P>Only four complaints were made to the Department about this matter.  However, it is regrettable that errors occurred in the Irish version of the junior certificate woodwork question paper in 1992.  I understand there was great pressure on the officers of the Department involved in the examinations that year as it was the introductory year for the junior certificate. I have been assured that suitable measures were taken to ensure this problem did not recur in the 1993 examination.</P>
      <P>An essential feature of any examination is that it allows candidates to demonstrate their knowledge of the subject being examined.  Therefore, when the difficulties experienced by the woodwork candidates were brought to the Department's attention the worked exercises of the candidates concerned were referred for re-examination to a senior inspector. The inspector involved looked at the questions chosen by each individual candidate to be answered.  He looked at any potential difficulties encountered as a result of the errors to ensure that each candidate was given full credit for his/her work.</P>
      <P>In regard to the reference by the Deputy to corrective action, the procedures outlined by me have ensured that no candidate was disadvantaged by what occurred.  In addition, in regard to future Irish versions &mdash; this includes the paper of 1993 &mdash; great care was and will be exercised to ensure there is no recurrence.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Ballymore (Westmeath) National School.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Ballymore is a small <Col N="1950" /> village in County Westmeath, built on the shores of Lough Sludy, one of the many lakes in County Westmeath.  It boasts an excellent community spirit and, on driving through its wide streets, the efforts of a hardworking tidy towns group are evident.  This picturesque village is located a short distance only from, geographically, the centre of Ireland.  Ballymore was once known as the village with two ends and no middle, but infill housing and development of the centre of the village has remedied that problem and the community is now a thriving, vibrant one.</P>
      <P>Past pupils of Ballymore national school have emigrated to all quarters of the world.  Missionary priests, brothers and sisters from Ballymore are in every continent and past pupils are in key positions throughout the country.  Indeed, the grounding in this school has stood all its pupils well, it can also boast of being the <i>alma mater</i> of this humble representative of the people of County Westmeath.</P>
      <P>Education has always been a priority in this village and the old primary school was replaced by the present building in 1954.  The building was typical of the design of that period and a classroom extension was built some years ago.  The school does not have the services of a remedial teacher and an application for this school and the adjoining ones was forwarded to the Department but turned down.  Drumraney national school, Boher national school and Ballymore national school have eight teachers between them and ideally could be serviced by a remedial teacher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a very high level of disadvantage in this area.  The Department has its own criteria for measuring disadvantage but we can measure disadvantage in any area by looking at some of the facts.  Twenty one per cent of the pupils attending the schools live in local authority housing, 45 per cent are in households where the parents hold medical cards and 33 per cent of the parents of the children are unemployed.  It should also be noted that a number of pupils in <Col N="1951" /> the school have speech difficulties and one child has a severe hearing difficulty. The school building is badly in need of upgrading and modernisation.  The roof leaks and the toilets, particularly the boys' toilets, are in a very unhygienic state.</P>
    <P>The input of parents to this school over the years has been tremendous and it will be a fatal blow if the Minister cannot find it possible to reappoint Miss Kelly to this school for 1993.  It will have sufficient enrolment to appoint a teacher in September 1994 but, unfortunately, the numbers for this year fell two short of the number required.  On behalf of the children, the parents, the board of management and the teachers I beg the Minister to appoint a teacher to this school commencing September 1993 bearing in mind the numbers that will be there in 1994 and the difficulties which could arise for teachers and pupils alike.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to reply to Deputy McGrath in all his humility on the issue of staffing at Ballymore national school.</P>
      <P>The staffing of all primary schools for a particular school year is determined by enrolment on 30 September of the previous year.  The enrolment in Ballymore on 30 September 1991 was 96 pupils which warranted a staff of principal plus three assistants for the current school year.  In September 1992 the enrolment fell to 91 which warrants a staff of principal plus two assistants for the 1993-94 school year.</P>
      <P>The junior teacher in the school opted to have her name placed on the Meath Diocesan panel for redeployment from 1 September 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only exceptions that can be made to the general staffing arrangements are in the case of developing schools or where my Department's guidelines on maximum class sizes are being breached. My Department has not received any correspondence from the board of management to indicate that the enrolment <Col N="1952" /> in the school is likely to increase in the 1993-94 school year.</P>
    <P>If the board of management feels that the school may qualify for the retention of the third assistant post under any of these exceptions, my Department will be happy to examine the position on receipt of the details.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfortunate that we have ten minutes only to discuss a report running to 120 pages.  This report makes very sordid reading for members of the public.  It describes a trail of transactions punctuated by misrepresentations, undisclosed conflicts of interests and downright deception.  At the end of the day the taxpayer was left carrying the can, not only for the substantial costs of disentangling that trail but through our company, Telecom Éireann, who paid £9.4 million for a site whose value is probably about half that.</P>
      <P>Many questions must be answered quickly by the Government.  It is not good enough for the Minister to wash his hands of responsibility by referring this matter to half a dozen State agencies.  We want a Minister accountable to the Dáil to come back to us before the end of the summer through the Employment and Enterprise Committee with specific recommendations upon which he is acting to prevent this recurring.  The Government must not use the referral to the Director of Public Prosecutions as a means of avoiding legitimate debate and report in this House about the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Telecom has been shown up in this report in the way it managed its affairs. It apparently purchased a site without investigating the price at which it had sold a short time previously and the property did not have zoning compatible with the planned headquarters.  Despite all this, it decided to proceed without a condition that the purchase should be subject to obtaining planning permission.  This seems strange, to say the least, and there <Col N="1953" /> should be a reform in the code of practice to ensure that it does not happen again. It seems that a warren of criss-crossing transactions was designed by the companies involved to drive a coach and four through our tax laws.  We need to know whether the capital gains tax and the stamp duty due on these transactions has been paid.  We also appear now to have moneys held in overseas accounts as part of a tax avoidance scheme.  The public deserve to know from the Minister whether these funds can enjoy the benefits of the tax amnesty.  This report reinforces the belief that there is one law for the ordinary PAYE taxpayer and quite another for those who can wriggle their way through various on shore and off shore shell companies to avoid legitimate tax liabilities.  The Government must produce a set of proposed transactions to deal with the issues involved. I am quite happy to allow time to the Central Bank, the Revenue Commissioners, the Minister for Transport Energy and Communications, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Stock Exchange and the Department of Finance to consider the implications of this report but I am not prepared to see it being left to gather dust without a clear set of proposals from the Government. I call on the Minister at least to give an undertaking that the Government will prepare a clear statement of the lessons learned from this transaction and the steps being taken to remedy the errors.  If we cannot have that statement, he should agree to report to the Enterprise and Employment Committee during the course of the summer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, Mr. John Glackin, the inspector appointed by the former Minister for Industry and Commerce, under section 14 of the Companies Act, 1990, to inquire into the Telecom affair finalised his report after 5.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 7 July and duly presented it to the Minister for Enterprise and Employment on the <Col N="1954" /> same day.  It will be recalled that the decision to conduct the inquiry was taken following public concern about the circumstances surrounding the acquisition by Telecom Éireann of the former Johnston, Mooney and O'Brien site in Ballsbridge at a cost of £9.4 million, a figure significantly higher than that at which the site had been sold a short time previously.  The Minister, Deputy Quinn, decided to proceed with the immediate publication of the report because it was in the public interest that the findings of the inspector should be made available to the public at the earliest opportunity. There has been much media speculation over the past week or so, apparently based on leaked confidential information, as to the likely findings of the inspector.  The Minister considered it desirable that all concerned with the content of this report, as well as the public generally on whose behalf the inquiry was undertaken, had a right to know the precise contents of the report, thereby minimising the possibility of subsequent speculative and perhaps misleading comments.</P>
      <P>A further important consideration in reaching his decision was the possibility that attempts might be made to obstruct or otherwise delay the publication of the report.  In that regard Deputies will recall that there have been numerous attempts to prevent the inspector from pursuing his inquiry most of which were not successful. Nevertheless they had the effect of greatly prolonging the investigation and, indeed, adding to its cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister, Deputy Quinn, indicated in the statement which he issued on publication of the report, he has decided on the following course of action: first, to refer the report to the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, under whose auspices Telecom Éireann falls, for detailed consideration of any aspects impinging on Telecom Éireann's role in the matter; second, to refer the report to the Director of Public Prosecutions in connection with the separate investigations that office is pursuing and <Col N="1955" /> for consideration of any other matters arising from the report which it would be appropriate for that office to pursue; third, to refer the report to the Revenue Commissioners for consideration of any issues which it would be appropriate for them to pursue; fourth, to refer the report to the Department of Finance for consideration, in consultation with the Central Bank, as necessary, of any exchange control issues or indeed any other general considerations relating to the operation and procedures of State-sponsored bodies and, finally, to refer the report to the Stock Exchange for consideration of any issues which may arise for that organisation.</P>
    <P>The Minister also indicated that in the period ahead his Department will take the findings of the report and the experience of the investigative process into account in the context of a review of company law generally which is already in train.</P>
    <P>I have listened with great interest to what Deputy Richard Bruton said.  The Government, and the Minister, Deputy Quinn, have no desire to see dust settle on this report.  The Minister acted immediately when he received it and everything has been done in accordance with proper procedures.  I am sure the House welcomes the fact that the Minister responded immediately on behalf of the Government to this major report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>It is significant that this matter is being addressed in the House this evening given that before it reconvenes in September the new scale of telephone charges will be applied.  I suggest that the Minister pause for a <Col N="1956" /> moment to consider the valuable work which is being done by voluntary organisations, its value to the community and the cost that would have to be borne by the State, that is the taxpayer, if voluntary organisations decided to cease operations as and from next September. In that event we would begin to wonder where we would find the money in the Estimates to provide an alternative service. These voluntary organisations give of their time, talents, skill and compassion to help those who are less fortunate than ourselves in society.</P>
      <P>The one service that is of most help to many of these bodies in assisting troubled people of every age within the community is the telephone service.  Even at the present rates, many of these organisations are being put to the pin of their collar to meet the charges.  Many of them will cease to operate if the proposed rates are applied next September.  To put it simply, they will not be able to meet the increase of 400 per cent.</P>
      <P>I should like to give an example.  Yesterday a voluntary group made a submission to a number of politicians in which they stated that the average &ldquo;cry for help&rdquo; call lasts 45 minutes.  At current rates this call made locally costs 33.51 pence.  If the proposed increases are applied this figure will increase to £1.42. On top of this, voluntary organisations have to pay VAT at a rate of 21 per cent, which tax cannot be reclaimed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Something has to be done between now and September to exempt voluntary bodies.  I do not have the answer but am calling on the Minister, and the Department, to find one.  However, it does not lie in the provision of a free of subsidised service for a limited period because the benefit to be gained lies in the assistance that the listener can provide to the person with a troubled mind, be they young or old, at the other end of the telephone line.  The provision of a reduced rate does not represent the solution either.  Perhaps the solution lies in <Col N="1957" /> the provision of a free phone number to a large number of registered bodies.</P>
    <P>The Minister's Department has an obligation to commence discussions immediately with voluntary organisations and Telecom Éireann to come up with a package before next September to enable these organisations to continue the good work they are doing for people with troubled minds, family problems and in distress.  These people are being kept out of homes, hospitals and rivers by voluntary workers at the other end of the telephone line who show them compassion.</P>
    <P>This is a serious problem and I appeal to the Minister to take action immediately to ensure that voluntary bodies which care deeply for the people they assist do not have this worry throughout the summer that they will be unable to provide a service from next autumn.  I remind the Minister again that if the State was compelled to pick up the tab and provide an alternative service from own resources we would be faced with a large budget next January or whenever the Estimates are put together.  The Minister should send a signal from the House to voluntary organisations, be they local or national, that it is the Department's intention to address the matter immediately to come up with a package to enable them continue the service next September.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Depputy to a speech the Minister, Deputy Cowen, made in the House on 18 May last when he advised that, arising from concerns which he had expressed to Telecom Éireann about the impact of the new charges on certain helpline services, Telecom Éireann had agreed to set aside the sum of £500,000 to provide free access to certain high priority services such as the Rape Crisis Centre, the Samaritans and Childline.  He also advised the House that Telecom Éireann would discuss with <Col N="1958" /> these and other helpline service operators how best to facilitate callers.  In his response to Parliamentary Question No. 104 from Deputy Noel Ahern on 10 June last he also advised that the administration of these funds was a matter for the company.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to be able to confirm to the House that Telecom Éireann has now advised that it has found it is able to extend aid to the Huntington's Disease Association, the Irish Motor Neurone Disease Association, the Muscular Dystrophy Association of Ireland, the Parkinson Disease Association of Ireland and the Irish Cancer Society.</P>
      <P>While I have every sympathy with the motives behind the Deputy's question, it has to be recognised that Telecom Éireann, in accordance with the statutory obligations placed upon it by the provisions of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, must act in a commercial manner.  Therefore, it is limited in the amount of funding it can provide for voluntary and charitable organisations.  It is for that reason that the provision of special access had to be limited by the company to what it regarded as the highest priority services. It is, of course, open to the other organisations concerned to make representations to Telecom Éireann to enable them obtain advice as to how best they can be facilitated.</P>
      <P>I trust that the intervention of the Minister, the consideration which has been given by Telecom Éireann to his request and the representations made by Deputy Quill and other Deputies has ensured a positive conclusion to this very important issue.  The door is open to other organisations which feel they should be treated in a similar fashion to put their case to Telecom Éireann.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 46 together.</P>
      <P>Figures for deaths from solvent abuse are recorded in the Annual Report on Vital Statistics.  The most recent report, just published, relates to 1990.  The report classified deaths from solvent abuse under International Classification of Diseases (ICD) Codes.</P>
      <P>The 1990 report records ten such deaths.</P>
      <P>The issue of drug and solvent abuse is always a cause for concern and I am keen that every effort possible is made to educate our young people with regard to the effects of misuse of drugs.  This implies not only the giving of information about the various substances of abuse at the appropriate age, but also means providing young people with opportunities to develop skills, awareness and self esteem that will enable them to resist pressures to become involved in potentially harmful drug using situations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To this end the Health Promotion Unit of my Department has in place a number of initiatives designed to combat drug misuse and these represent a comprehensive <Col N="1864" /> response to the problem. However, this is a constantly changing problem and we are vigilant to ensure that our prevention efforts are properly focused and effective.</P>
    <P>In addressing the complexity of this problem it is important that prevention efforts be multi-sectoral and multi-disciplinary in nature and for this reason our education efforts are often done in co-operation with other Government Departments and agencies.</P>
    <P>This approach has led to co-operation between my Department and other Departments and agencies in producing a substance abuse prevention programme, a drink awareness for youth programme, specific solvent abuse prevention materials and a community based training programme to tackle issues at local level.</P>
    <P>The most recent European Drug Prevention Week (November 16-22), which was co-ordinated by my Department and involved the Departments of Education, Justice and Labour as well as many nonstatutory and voluntary agencies served to raise awareness about the vast range of initiatives which are in place to help combat drug misuse amongst young people.  The week also saw the introduction of several new initiatives.</P>
    <P>A huge variety of consumer products contain solvents.  As it would be unrealistic to completely ban the sale of these products to children, a provision is included in the Child Care Act, 1991 to make it an offence for persons to sell solvent-based products to children where it is known or suspected that they are likely to be abused.  Persons found guilty of this offence would be liable to a fine of up to £1,000 or to 12 months' imprisonment.</P>
    <P>The Deputy can be assured that the position is being kept under constant review.  My objective is to ensure that the problem is tackled by programmes directed at young people and by initiatives which allow for parents and whole communities to address the issue in the most effective manner.</P>

      <P>The objectives of Government health policy, as set out in the report &mdash;<i>The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly</i> is to support the care of dependent elderly people at home for as long as possible and to ensure that when the elderly can no longer be cared for at home, there are appropriate specialist and extended care facilities to meet their needs.  The priorities of service development at present are to strengthen the capacity of the health services to care for the person at home, to provide more specialist facilities in acute hospitals and to meet the needs of the increasing numbers of elderly mentally infirm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of specialist geriatric <Col N="1866" /> departments in general hospitals and the appointment of consultant geriatricians in general hospitals has been one of the most significant advances in the care of the elderly.  Such departments ensure prompt admission of elderly persons, specialist assessment and treatment, rehabilitation and in many cases continuing support in a day hospital on discharge. In the past 12 months, six new departments of medicine of old age have opened, each with a consultant physician in geriatric medicine.  These departments are now operating in 16 general hospitals around the country.  This means that just under half our general hospitals have specialist departments of medicine of the elderly.</P>
    <P>It is the policy of my Department that all general hospitals should have the benefit of a specialist geriatric service.  There are proposals with my Department for the appointment of additional physicians in geriatric medicine which will be approved as resources permit.</P>

      <Col N="1868" /> The cardiac surgery waiting lists are validated and updated at least on a quarterly basis.  The number of patients who did not reply to the letters sent by the consultants to determine whether they wish to remain on the lists in the last validation exercise is 30.</P>
    <P>The ongoing review and validation of the cardiac surgery waiting lists ensures that comprehensive and reliable data on patients awaiting this treatment is readily available.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputies that I have allocated a sum of £1 million in 1993 to increase throughput of open heart surgery at the Mater Hospital which will bring the annual capacity up to 1,000 open heart operations per year.</P>
    <P>I am also providing for a doubling of capacity for cardiac surgery at Cork Regional Hospital from 200 to 400 patients.  The combined increased capacity in both Dublin and Cork will mean a new national annual throughput of 1,400 cases in the public sector which represents an increase of 47 per cent on current capacity.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 55 together.</P>
      <P>I would like to point out to the Deputies that the level of care and standard of accommodation in special hospitals, in the first instance, are the responsibility of the relevant health board.  I am satisfied that the special hospital service is adequately funded and staffed and that the accommodation provided is in good repair.</P>
      <P>In his report for 1988 and 1989 which was published last year, the Inspector of Mental Hospitals praised the standards of care in some psychiatric hospitals but was critical of the standards in others. The inspector's report for 1990, which will soon be ready for publication, shows that substantial improvements took place in many hospitals in that year, progress which has been maintained to date.</P>
      <P>In the light of the inspector's comments on his most recent visits made to psychiatric hospitals, I am reasonably satisfied with the quality of care given to patients in psychiatric hospitals while recognising that there is still scope for improvement.</P>
      <P>The health boards are developing a comprehensive community psychiatric service in line with Planning for the Future, published in 1984 and some older psychiatric hospitals are being replaced by acute psychiatric units attached to general hospitals.  Other community services being put in place include day hospitals, day centres and hostel accommodation. Specialist psycho-geriatric services are also being developed by health boards for the elderly with dementia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Significant progress has been made in recent years in the services available to people with a mental handicap resident in psychiatric hospitals.  There were 942 people with mental handicap accommodated in public psychiatric hospitals on 31 December 1991.  A further 447 <Col N="1873" /> people were accommodated in designated units associated with these hospitals but which are now part of the mental handicap service.  These figures compare with 1,495 and 310 repectively in 1990.  Additional funding of £200,000 has been made available this year to the Eastern Health Board to improve staffing levels for the care of clients with mental handicap in St. Ita's Hospital, Portrane.</P>

      <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board are unable, without undue hardship, to provide general practitioner services for themselves and their dependants.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are available to assist chief executive officers in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the Consumer Price Index. However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and health boards have discretion to issue a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.</P>
      <P>While I am of course anxious that every person who is in genuine need of a medical card should receive one, I do not think that it is justifiable to grant a medical card to any particular group without any reference to their means.</P>

      <P>The allocation of funds to each health board in respect of 1993 should be sufficient to continue the provision of services at 1992 approved levels, provided the measures identified in respect of pay, non-pay and income efficiencies are fully achieved. My Department is in constant communication with all boards regarding service provision and budgetary matters and is closely monitoring the expenditure savings targets that have been set for each board.  The effects of these efficiencies are already being realised but it is too early to indicate the full year impact of these savings.</P>
      <P>In my meetings with health boards earlier this year, I outlined Government policy in relation to containing public expenditure and the absolute necessity for boards to maintain expenditure within the approved limits.  Boards cannot anticipate additional funding for health services in 1993 over that already approved by Government, with the exception of demand-led scheme funding.</P>

      <P>I have considered the report of a survey conducted by the Oral Health Services Research Centre of University College Cork on the oral health of Irish adults in the years 1989-90.  This survey provides national clinical data on the oral health status of Irish adults and found evidence of a major improvement in the oral health of Irish adults in the previous ten years. The survey also found evidence of a lower level of oral health among some sections of the community such as medical card holders and women, when compared with other sections.</P>
      <P>The survey was carried out in 1989-90 and, as acknowledged in the report, there have been important improvements since then in the funding of dental services for medical card holders.  Since 1990 an additional £2.5 million approximately per annum has been provided by my Department to health boards for the development of adult dental services.  This additional funding has enabled health boards to significantly improve service levels to medical card holders.  Under the Programme for Government a further £2 million has been provided in the current year for the development of the health board dental services.</P>
      <P>I am currently developing a national health strategy for the next four years and a strategy for the development of the adult dental services is an integral part of this.  An underlying principle of the strategy will be equity in the provision of services to those who need them and, in this context, I wish to ensure that there is an equitable and effective adult dental service available throughout the country.</P>

      <P>All health boards have now established general practice units.  The Southern Health Board has established its units for Cork city and county and is in the process of setting up an interview board to examine candidates for the GP unit in Kerry.  The board hopes to have this unit established shortly.</P>
      <P>These units are essentially concerned with the raising of standards in general practice and all general practitioners recruited to support this objective have already extensive experience in that service. Some additional training may be required, however, and individual boards are at the moment assessing the position with a view to meeting these needs.</P>
      <P>One of the functions of the GP unit will be to facilitate an improvement in the interface between general practice and other health services, particularly hospital services.  In examining the interface between general practice and the hospital sector the unit will be identifying opportunities to extend the services of general practitioners where this can be achieved more cost effectively than at present.  Where such an opportunity can appropriately be pursued it will reduce pressure on hospital facilities and hopefully reduce waiting lists for certain procedures.</P>

      <P>My Department introduced a revised immunisation schedule in 1992 and all health professionals have been advised of it. Every opportunity is taken by health professionals to encourage and advise parents to immunise their children and the health boards liaise with health professionals and the parents of children to achieve and maintain the highest possible uptake of the primary vaccination.</P>
      <P>Current national uptake in the vaccination of young children as reported to my Department by the health boards ranges from approximately 90 per cent for diptheria, tetanus and polio to 60 per cent for diptheria, pertussis, tetanus and polio and 75 per cent for measles, mumps and rubella, MMR.  Approximately 200,000 does of the Hib vaccine, which was introduced in October 1992, were supplied up to the end of last year.  There are, however, variations in uptake between and within health boards and the Department is keen to ensure that the highest possible uptake levels are achieved in all areas.  In this context, the Department monitors the effectiveness of the programme, in conjunction with the health boards and takes action, as appropriate, to ensure that high uptake levels are achieved and maintained.</P>

      <P>Children with disabilities are covered by the child abuse guidelines which set out the procedures to be followed by personnel working with children in relation to the identification, investigation and management of abuse, including sexual abuse, of children.  These guidelines are currently being reviewed in the light of the recommendations of the Kilkenny incest investigation.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the recommendation of the report of the Kilkenny incest investigation that my Department should prepare guidelines on procedures for the identification, investigation and management of sexual abuse of people with disabilities.  These guidelines would cover adults with disabilities who are not included in the current child abuse guidelines.</P>
      <P>Draft guidelines on procedures for the identification, investigation and management of sexual abuse of people with disabilities have been prepared by the National Rehabilitation Board.  These draft guidelines are currently under examination in my Department.  It is my intention to circulate draft guidelines for comment to bodies representing people with disabilities in the near future before issuing the guidelines to health agencies and personnel.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 53 and 57 together.</P>
      <P>I share the Deputies' concern about the practice of children begging on the streets of Dublin.  The Eastern Health Board provides financial assistance to a number of services which have been specially developed for traveller children. The board, in conjunction with the Department of Education, support a school and pre-school for traveller children at Strand Street, Dublin 1.  The school is linked to Exchange House, Essex Street, Dublin 2 which is operated by the Dublin Committee for Travelling People and which provides a range of support services to the travelling community. In addition, the board also grant-aids residential centres for young travellers at Trudder House and Deralossory House in County Wicklow.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board is at present carrying out a review of its services for travellers within the board's area.  The aim of the review is to further improve these services, including those designed to assist traveller children.</P>
      <P>The specific problem of traveller children begging is being addressed by an <i>ad hoc</i> committee representative of Dublin Corporation, the Eastern Health Board, the Garda, Dublin County Council, the Dublin Committee for Travellers, Exchange House and Focus Point.  This committee has identified the small number of families who are principally involved in begging.  Though the law allows for the prosecution of parents in such instances, there is a reluctance, bearing in mind the overall welfare of the children, to take this course of action. However, the parents in question have been warned that these activities are illegal and have been made aware of the potential consequences of continuing to send their children out to beg.</P>

      <P>The position is that cardiac surgery for public patients is performed in three locations &mdash; at the National Cardiac Unit at the Mater Hospital, Dublin, Cork Regional Hospital and at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin.  Each patient is assessed by the consultant to determine his or her medical priority, and urgent cases always receive priority treatment.</P>
      <P>My Department has recently undertaken an assessment of the medium-term requirements for additional cardiac surgery. I have decided that the annual capacity at the National Cardiac Surgery Unit at the Mater Hospital should be increased from 750 to 1,000 and I have provided £1 million in 1993 which will be met from the waiting list fund.</P>
      <P>I am also providing for a doubling of capacity for cardiac surgery at Cork Regional Hospital from 200 to 400 patients each year.  The combined increased capacity in both Dublin and Cork will mean a new national annual throughput of 1,400 cases in the public sector which represents an increase of 47 per cent on current capacity.  I am satisfied that this increased level of service will be adequate to meet the medium-term requirements for cardiac surgery in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I am aware that Croi, the West of Ireland Cardiology Foundation, which is a local voluntary organisation dedicated to the development of cardiac services in the west, supports the development of a cardiac surgical unit in Galway.</P>

      <P>Protracted discussions on a draft EC Directive on the irradiation of food have not yet concluded.  The main provisions of the proposed directive are: (a) only categories of food which appear on a positive list may be subjected to treatment with ionizing radiation at prescribed doses; (b) the ionization units for foods are subject to prior authorisation by the responsible authorities, as designated by each member state; (c) the installations and procedure and the foods treated with ionizing radiation are subject to official controls; (d) irradiated foods must comply with specific labelling rules requiring detailed information and (e) irradiated foods from third countries are admitted into the Community provided that they fulfil the provisions of the directive.</P>
      <P>The Food Safety Advisory Committee (a committee of experts appointed jointly by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, and myself) reported in 1989 as follows:</P>

Subsequently a Consultative Committee was established to examine the possibility of extending the scope of these regulations, or of introducing other restrictions on smoking in the workplace.</P>
      <P>This committee decided that a voluntary code represented the most suitable means of introducing restrictions in the workplace and their suggested code was included in a booklet entitled <i>Clean Air at Work</i> which was widely circulated by the Health Promotion Unit of my Department late last year.</P>

      <P>The question of the pay of clinical psychologists was the subject of parliamentary questions and an Adjournment debate on Thursday, 24 June and I would refer the Deputy to the relevant Dáil records.  The basic grade clinical psychologist salary scale currently runs to a maximum of £20,697 per annum while the senior clinical psychologist scale provides a maximum of £23,740 per annum.  A claim for an increase in these scales has been served, as noted in the course of replies to the parliamentary questions and the Adjournment debate referred to.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 64 and 129 together.  The Eastern Health Board is responsible for the provision of services at St. Ita's Hospital, Portrane, County Dublin.</P>
      <P>Following an allegation that some patients with mental handicap in St. Ita's Hospital were receiving improper care, the Eastern Health Board established an inquiry team to investigate the specific allegations made.  The inquiry team concluded that practices in some parts of the hospital were a cause for concern.  In response to the findings of the inquiry team, the Eastern Health Board prepared a draft development plan covering the future provision of services to patients with mental handicap at St. Ita's Hospital.</P>
      <P>As part of this draft development plan, the board has appointed a director of mental handicap services to St. Ita's Hospital.  Other management changes have been made and staff have been reassigned within the hospital.  Patients to whom the allegation referred have been moved to new accommodation on site and the parents of the patients have been informed by the board of developments and of the reasons for the service reorganisation within the hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of the special funding made available <Col N="1892" /> to my Department in the budget to improve services for people with a mental handicap, an allocation of £200,000 has been provided to the Eastern Health Board to improve staffing levels at St. Ita's Hospital.

I can assure the Deputy that when the board's definitive plan for the development of services at St. Ita's Hospital is received in my Department it will be given a high priority in relation to additional funding made available to my Department.</P>

      <P>The Council of Ministers of the European Community in June 1992 designated 1993 as European Year of Older People and Solidarity between Generations.  The year is the culmination of the Community's programme for the elderly which was adopted as a result of the EC's Social Charter.  The main purpose of the year is to heighten society's awareness of the situation of older people, the challenges resulting from present and future demographic developments and the consequences of an ageing population for all Community policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The year, in Ireland, is being co-ordinated by a national co-ordinating committee, established by my Department, which is representative of the social partners and the statutory and voluntary agencies caring for the elderly. The committee is chaired by Mr. Larry Tuomey.  The committee has adopted the following core themes for the year: (a) <Col N="1893" /> the Positive Contribution of Older People &mdash; with the sub-themes past, present and future contributions; (b) All Ages Together &mdash; with the sub-theme of young and old working and playing together and (c) Meeting the Challenges of Older Age &mdash; with the sub-themes of caring for dependent older people, isolation and loneliness and elimination of discrimination against older people.</P>
    <P>I have made a sum of £400,000 available this year to the national co-ordinating committee to cover the operational costs of the year, a public awareness campaign and grants for events, projects and awards.  The committee has approved grants to 170 groups and organisations, mostly voluntary, which are running suitable events to celebrate the aims and spirit of the year. These projects are in addition to hundreds of others which will go ahead independently. The Deputy will be pleased to learn that some joint activities with groups in Northern Ireland have been organised.</P>
    <P>This important year is also being marked by improvements in the health services which will benefit the elderly, namely, the implementation in the immediate future of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 and the expansion of facilities for hip replacements, and cataract surgery as a result of the major action programme on hospital waiting lists.  The action programme provides for an additional 1,117 hip replacement operations and 1,506 cataract operations.</P>

      <P>My Department is in discussion with the Office of Public Works with a view to acquiring extra space for the Passport Office, Dublin to address current space constraints.  The public office is refurbished on a regular basis and there are plans to repaint it in the autumn.</P>
      <P>Consideration had been given previously to the provision of refreshments in the Passport Office; however, following examination, it was concluded that the central location of the office provides easy access to existing commercial outlets in the area and that additional facilities in the Passport Office would not be warranted.</P>

      <P>At end-May 1993, the latest date for which figures are available, there was a total of 93,865 persons on the Live Register in Dublin county.  This total represented 22.6 per cent of the labour force in Dublin as estimated by the 1991 Labour Force Survey.  Live register forecasts on a subnational level are not compiled in my Department and accordingly, an end-December 1993 Live Register figure for Dublin county is not available.</P>
      <P>The unemployment rate in Dublin is slightly higher than the national average but increased by less than the national average in the 12 months to end-May last.  There is already in place a very wide range of policies and specific measures at national and subnational level to assist employment growth and otherwise to deal with unemployment and others will come into effect over the rest of the year. These actions will have an increasing impact in all regions, including Dublin, into the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no current embargo on recruitment to the public service although a ceiling on overall numbers employed is in operation.  The Government's position on public service numbers for 1993 is that the numbers serving in the Civil Service and in the non-commercial State-sponsored bodies (NCSSBs) should not exceed the numbers serving on 1 January 1993.  Given that there is inevitably some natural wastage in these areas, recruitment can and will continue &mdash; provided that any such appointments will not bring a Department's or agency's staffing level above that of 1 January, 1993.</P>
      <P>Subject to approved staffing levels being adhered to, sanction to make appointments in the Civil Service up to HEO level has been delegated to Departments under the administrative budget initiative.  Above HEO level, the sanction of my Department is required for the filling of posts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of NCSSBs, the filling of vacancies requires the prior approval of the relevant parent Department and of the Minister for Finance.  In recent years, requests for recruitment were generally favourably considered where: (a) vacancies arose in revenue generating areas <Col N="1899" /> and could be filled on a fully self-financing basis; (b) where vacant posts arising as a result of natural wastage were considered essential to the functioning of the organisation and could not be filled by way of internal redeployment; and (c) where it could be shown that the impact of Structural Fund drawdowns had significantly increased the workload of individual NCSSBs.</P>
    <P>A review by my Department showed that some NCSSBs had circumvented existing reporting and sanctioning requirements, mainly by employing staff in categories other than on a full-time permanent basis, for example contract-consultancy staff and had not notified these new employees either to their parent Department or to the Department of Finance.  For the NCSSB sector overall, however, the number employed on a contract basis is not significant.  At end-1992, the latest date for which returns are available, a total of 622 staff were employed on a contract basis, less than 8 per cent of total numbers employed.</P>
    <P>Given our tight budgetary circumstances, the Government considered that the resumption of growth in civil and public service numbers which had become evident in recent years could not be allowed to continue and that action had to be taken to contain the situation in 1993.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The corporation sole doctrine derives from section 2 (1) of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924.  Legal opinion holds that while, under the corporation sole principle, a Minister is responsible for the actions of his civil servants carried <Col N="1900" /> out in the course of their duty, he is not responsible for all the wrongful acts or defaults of such civil servants.</P>
      <P>The corporation sole principle was enshrined in statute for good reasons: first, to secure continuity of title, and to obviate the need for the transfer of State property, rights and obligations from a Minister to his successor; and second, to secure that persons contracting with the Government through any of its Departments should have the ordinary remedy of action available in case of breach of contract.</P>
      <P>I believe that the corporation sole doctrine has served this country well; it has not prevented individual civil servants from bearing appropriate responsibility for their acts.  I am, however, anxious to ensure that management in Departments at official level should be able to manage more effectively; I am not, therefore, ruling out the possibility of a change in relation to formal delegation in the light of developments, for example, in regard to administrative budgets.</P>

      <P>The position in relation to a second phase of the INTERREG programme is that the Commission has just issued a Green Paper on new Community initiatives which proposes a set of initiatives covering five themes, including those of cross-Border, transnational, and interregional co-operation and networks, which would have the effect of continuing some form of INTERREG initiative.  A process of consultation with all relevant interests in each member state is now being put under way by the Commission. The Government strongly supports the extension of INTERREG and is confident that it will take place.

      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit on 23 March 1993. In order to qualify for this payment he needed at least 39 contributions paid or credited in the governing contribution year 6 April 1991 to 5 April 1992.  According to the records of my Department he had only 13 A1 contributions for that tax <Col N="1903" /> year.  He indicated that he was employed for the duration of this period and this was investigated by an officer of my Department.  Repeated efforts to contact the employer failed.  However, after further investigations, my Department is now satisfied that special contribution credits can be awarded for this period.</P>
      <P>His claim has now been authorised for payment and all arrears due will be paid this week.</P>

Seasonal adjustment of the live register series is carried out by the Central Statistics Office using standard statistical procedures. The impact of the change in the eligibility criteria for students on the live register seasonal adjustment factors has been negligible since the latter are calculated on the basis of seasonal patterns over a long number of years.</P>

    <P>I am, of course, concerned at the problem of larceny of motor vehicles and in particular at the problem of unauthorised taking of cars.  I am satisfied that the measures taken by the Garda authorities have been effective in dealing with this problem as is evidenced by the fact that the combined figures for recorded larceny and unauthorised taking of motor vehicles in 1991 show a decrease of almost 50 per cent on the level recorded in 1981 when the problem peaked and a decrease of over 47 per cent on the 1982 figure.  I can assure the Deputy that the Garda authorities are continuing to monitor the situation and will take whatever further measures may be appropriate to prevent and detect this type of crime.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that no new guideline has been given to gardaí in relation to the conduct of protests at the Kildare Street entrance to Leinster House.  It is normal <Col N="1905" /> practice for small protest groups &mdash; which do not impede access to and from the House &mdash; to be allowed assemble on the Leinster House side of Kildare Street and for larger groups to assemble on the Molesworth Street side.</P>
      <P>In the case of the protest referred to in the question the Garda authorities report that it was initially located at the end of Molesworth Street directly opposite the entrance to Leinster House.  However, the protest was allowed on the Leinster House side of Kildare Street as soon as it was found that the number of protestors was smaller than anticipated and would not impede access to and from the House.</P>

      <P>The roads plan for Celbridge, which was submitted by Kildare County Council in August 1991, would involve the provision of a new bridge over the River Liffey as well as the improvement of existing roads and the provision of a new distributor road.  As the plan relates to non-national roads which are the responsibility of Kildare County Council, the work involved would fall to be financed from the council's own resources, supplemented by the discretionary grants provided annually by my Department for such roads.</P>
      <P>The 1993 discretionary road grant to Kildare County Council amounts to £1.863 million and, in view of the special needs of the county, includes a supplementary grant of £600,000 for improvement works.  If the council decided to carry out the proposals contained in the plan from their discretionary grant, it would be open to them to nominate such works for co-financing from EC funds.  Any such funding would, however, be remitted to the Exchequer in partial recoupment of the road grants.</P>

    <P>*Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the Labour Force Survey data, employment in agriculture forestry and fishing has declined steadily over the last 15 years.  The downward trend in agricultural employment reflects a worldwide trend in developed economies in recent decades and is due primarily to improved farming technology and greater efficiency in agriculture generally. However, it should be noted that the rate of decline in agriculture in Ireland has slowed during the last decade compared to the 1970s and employment in agriculture is twice the average of EC member states.</P>
    <P>The wider issue of employment in rural areas in general is being addressed by <Col N="1919" /> my Department.  Within the Operational Programme for Rural Development under the aegis of my Department there are a number of schemes designed to encourage farm diversification including agri-tourism and horticulture.  In addition, other schemes like Leader are intended to help groups in rural communities take advantage of business opportunities.  These initiatives and others are designed to improve the employment position in rural areas.</P>

      <P>Under EC law, quotas are attached to land and are automatically transferred when land to which quota is attached is transferred.  There is, however, provision in EC law for some flexibility in this area in certain prescribed circumstances, including the transfer of land for non-agricultural purposes. National implementing legislation is presently being prepared to give effect to this provision.</P>

The tank containers comply with the International Union of Railways (UIC) specifications and trains transporting these substances must carry <Col N="1923" /> appropriate information notices and hazard labels.  Maximum speeds are restricted and all persons concerned in these operations are given special training.</P>
      <P>Times of the trains are advised to the various emergency services along the railway lines in question.  A scheme for alert and co-ordination of the emergency services in the event of an incident involving the carriage of dangeous substances by rail has been drawn up by an InterDepartmental Committee on the Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Rail, consisting of representatives of relevant Government Departments and agencies and of certain users of dangerous substances, including acrylonitrile and methyl acrylate.

      <P>I am aware of the report referred to by the Deputy.  I must point out that the number of births in Ireland decreased from 74,000 in 1980 to 52,690 in 1991.  Therefore, the inclusion of Ireland, with countries which together add a total of 13 million people to the world's populations, is entirely inappropriate and makes the survey, in general, questionable.</P>
      <P>I must also point out that the allegation that Ireland is a tragic example &ldquo;of countries unresponsive or actively opposed to the desires of women and men for greater control over their reproductive lives&rdquo; is both untrue and unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government's policy in relation to family planning is to give individuals the greatest possible freedom with regard to family planning, that is, deciding freely the number and spacing of their children. The family planning legislation enacted in 1992 requires health boards to ensure that a family planning service comprising a comprehensive service for the provision of information, instruction and consultation in relation to methods of family planning is available in their areas.  There <Col N="1928" /> is, in fact, a wide network of family planning services available throughout the country, some of which are funded by the Department of Health, through the health boards.</P>
    <P>As regards the Deputy's inquiry about legislating for the wider availability of condoms, she will be aware that the Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Bill 1993, which removed the restrictions on the supply of condoms, was passed by the Dáil and Seanad during the month of June.</P>
    <P>As I indicated during the Oireachtas debates on the legislation, I am currently reviewing family planning policy in the context of the National Health Strategy which is being developed in the Department of Health.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>As outlined in my reply of Wednesday, 30 June 1993, the Government has approved a new four-year agreement between my Department and the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries on the price of drugs.  The Agreement will come into effect on 1 August 1993.</P>
      <P>The main elements of the Agreement include:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;a reduction of over 6 per cent in the cost of GMS drugs.  This reduction is achieved through an immediate price decrease of 3 per cent on all drugs and an increase in the rebate payable on drugs supplied under the <Col N="1929" /> GMS Scheme from 2 per cent to 5 per cent;</P>
    <P>&mdash;a price freeze for a period of four years.  The price will be subject to review, however, if during this time there is an average movement in cumulative currency adjusted price indices across a basket of European countries in excess of 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>In addition, the industry has agreed to make a once-off <i>ex-gratia</i> payment of about £2 million to compensate for currency fluctuations over the last year of the current agreement.</P>
    <P>The new agreement sets the maximum price for all drugs prescribable and reimbursable in the GMS scheme and all medicines supplied to hospitals and health boards.  It provides that a minimum discount of 15 per cent shall be obtainable on supplies to hospitals and explicitly recognises the right of such bodies to negotiate better terms with individual manufacturers, importers or agents.</P>
    <P>Under the agreement the price of new products coming on the market will be linked to the lesser of the currency adjusted UK price and the average price of the same product in a basket of European countries.  In an innovative clause, the price of new chemical entities will be subject to review after two years to ensure that the cost impact of such products does not distort the market.</P>
    <P>This agreement is an integral part of my Department's overall drugs strategy aimed at containing the cost of drugs to the Exchequer.  It is estimated that the cumulative effect of the price concessions could yield savings to the Exchequer of up to £15 million per annum.</P>
    <P>The decision of the Government to approve the new agreement was taken after careful consideration of all the options available.  It is the view of the Government that the terms proposed provide the best available protection of the interests of patients and taxpayers.</P>
    <P>The use of indicative drug targets does <Col N="1930" /> not interfere with the right and duty of the doctor to prescribe as appropriate for each patient.  The arrangements agreed last November with the Irish Medical Organisation, for the provision of general practitioner services under section 58 of the Health Act 1970 to eligible persons, which included the area of prescribing, will be reviewed next year.</P>

Under these arrangements, consultants' private patients availing of public hospitals may not be admitted to a public bed, except where an emergency admission is necessary but private or semi-private accommodation is not available.</P>
      <P>These arrangements were considered by the Government and the Social Partners to provide more equitable access for public patients than the previous system under which public and private patients were admitted to public beds from the same waiting list, and I have no proposal to revert to the combined waiting list.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the Government's recent initiative which involves the allocation of £20 million for a major action programme to reduce waiting times in the areas of orthopaedic surgery (hip replacement and other procedures), ophthalmology (cataract), ear, nose and throat surgery, cardiac surgery (by-pass operations), vascular surgery (varicose veins) and plastic surgery.

      <P>In present economic circumstances, I am anxious that the cost to parents of the education of their children should be kept to a minimum.</P>
      <P>I was pleased to have been able to increase the 1993 allocation for free books for necessitous pupils by more than 8 per cent over that of 1992 in the case of post-primary schools and by 14 per cent in the case of primary schools.</P>
      <P>In second-level schools the amount of grant payable to any school for this purpose is related to the number of necessitous pupils on roll and is not distributed on the basis of a set amount per pupil. Principal teachers have discretion in the extent of assistance to be given to each necessitous pupil, subject to the overall amount of money made available to them.</P>
      <P>At primary level the rates of grant for 1993 are of the order of £10 for needy pupils in classes I-VI and £5.50 per pupil in infant classes.</P>
      <P>In conjunction with this scheme my Department has issued guidelines to school management authorities to assist in the implementation of loan-rental schemes, in co-operation with parents, which would ensure the efficient use of school books and minimise the cost to parents.  School authorities have also been advised that selected text books should be changed only to the extent that is absolutely necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the arrangements for necessitous pupils, my Department has <Col N="1940" /> commissioned a consultancy study on how the cost of school books generally might be reduced.  A consultancy study has been carried out and the report of the study is at present being finalised.</P>
    <P>I have no function in the matter of school uniforms; practices in this regard are established by the managerial authorities of individual schools.  For necessitous pupils, the back to school clothing and footwear scheme operated by the Department of Social Welfare provides financial assistance to necessitous pupils for expenses of this nature.</P>

      <P>The work of setting the question papers is a process which takes months from the draft stage to final printing.  The draft is carefully checked in the first place to see that the questions are a fair test of <Col N="1945" /> candidates' knowledge of the course.  In the case of the Leaving Certificate the draft is also examined by nominees of the Universities.  Following this consideration, the draft, as amended where necessary, is passed for press.  Before approval for printing is given the proofs of the draft paper will have been read at least twice and in many cases three times.</P>
      <P>Following printing the final printed version of the paper is further scrutinised. Any errors which come to light at this stage are included in a list which is given to superintendents for reading to the candidates concerned prior to the start of the relevant examination.</P>
      <P>A total of 336 separate question papers, including Irish versions, must be printed for the purposes of all levels of the Leaving and the Junior Certificate Examinations.</P>
      <P>It has happened that notwithstanding the great care which is taken at all stages of the process a very small number of errors has persisted uncorrected through to the final paper.  It is a matter of great regret to me that such errors have occurred despite the process which I have described.  I am aware that this can have an upsetting effect on some students.  I am happy to be able to assure the Deputy that where an error does come to light, examiners will be notified of the difficulties experienced by candidates and account of these difficulties will be taken in the marking.</P>
      <P>The total number of misprints for the certificate examinations in 1993 not notified in the errata list was three.  Precise records are not kept of errors in the previous years but it is estimated that they were of the same order.</P>

      <P>The minimum qualifications for recruitment by open competition to a lecturer's post in Carlow Regional Technical College are the same as those laid down by the Department for all Regional Technical Colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>
      <P>These are an Honours Degree (first or second class) from a recognised degreeawarding body or a recognised professional equivalent qualification in the subject(s) in question except for engineering, architecture, surveying and construction where an appropriate degree at pass level would be acceptable and not less than three years relevant whole time post-qualification experience and necessary Irish qualification.</P>
      <P>It is the function of the college authorities to recruit the most suitably qualified candidates for posts through procedures determined by the Minister for Education.</P>
      <P>Following an agreement reached between the Department and the teachers' union a limited number of college teachers were promoted to Lecturer 1 posts.</P>
      <P>There are no teaching assistants in Regional Technical Colleges or the Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>
