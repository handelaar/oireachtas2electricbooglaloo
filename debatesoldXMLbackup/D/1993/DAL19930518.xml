      <Quest>if, in view of the Government's commitment to gender equality, he will ensure that equal opportunities policies will be an issue in the next meeting of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress Central Review Committee.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This Government's commitment in the equality area is clear from our Programme for Government 1993-1997 and, with the appointment of a new Minister for Equality and Law Reform, we are determined to ensure that equality for all groups in our society becomes a reality.  In regard to people with disabilities, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform and I met recently with representatives of the Forum of People with Disabilities, when we confirmed that representatives of people with disabilities will be represented on the new National Economic and Social Forum.  In addition, the monitoring committee under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> on employment of people with disabilities will continue its work, and a Commission <Col N="1826" /> on Disability will be established, in consultation with interested groups.  In parallel, the process of establishing a permanent Council for the Status of People with Disabilities will begin.</P>
      <P>The Central Review Committee's area of work is determined by the provisions of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and the agenda for any particular meeting is set by the committee itself by reference to this and the current priorities as seen by the Committee.  I do not believe that it would be appropriate for me to dictate what should or should not be discussed by the Central Review Committee at a particular meeting but I will arrange to have the Deputy's question brought to the committee's attention.</P>
      <P>The issue of gender equality raised by the Deputy was recently discussed by the CRC in the context of its preparation of a progress report which details the achievements to date under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> including those in the area of equality and equal opportunity.  This report was published by the CRC last week.  It has been laid before the House and copies of it are available in the Library.</P>

      <P>In thanking the Taoiseach for his detailed reply, I should confess that I was startled at first at the direction he took.  While I know that being a woman can be a disadvantage to start with, a commission on disability is to take the problem too far.  I take it that the Taoiseach was covering the question of opportunities in general.  I would like to refer specifically to two of the recommendations made by the Commission on the Status of Women.  It recommended that a committee should be established at Central Review Committee level to monitor developments, and to make proposals in regard to the employment of women and narrowing the earnings gap between men and women.  Would the Taoiseach give an undertaking to bring this matter to the attention of the Central Review Committee?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will bring it to its attention.  While I cannot force any issue into the agenda I have no doubt that at some stage this issue will be discussed by the Central Review Committee.  In relation to the report of the Commission on the Status of Women, we have introduced a system of gender proofing to ensure that the probable impact on women is specifically taken into account in the decision-making process.  We have also set a strategy in train to establish a gender balance in the membership of the boards of State-sponsored bodies.  This will be implemented over the next four years to ensure that no one sex will hold more than 60 per cent of places on any of these boards.  Therefore the Deputy can take it that we are following up the report of the Commission on the Status of Women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I tabled this question is that the Taoiseach has been up front on the gender issue and has given a publicly stated commitment to achieve progress.  If one were to leave the matter to natural forces, progress on the many issues still on the table at Central Review Committee level could be slow.  Because of this we are looking to the Government to take a lead, given that it indicated it would.  Second, there is a need for all employers to adopt an equal opportunities policy and a regular review of the implementation of such a policy should form part of the ongoing review of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> or whatever programme may replace it in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy reads the progress report on the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> she will be pleasantly surprised at the level of progress.  The Minister for Equality and Law Reform has already set up a working group in the area touched on by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2, 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware of the agreement that the Taoiseach and British Prime Minister should meet twice yearly for discussions on matters of concern to our two countries.  As I indicated to the House recently, I expect that the next such meeting will take place in June.  In accordance with established practice, the date will be announced simultaneously in Dublin and London close to the time of the meeting.  The agenda has yet to be finalised but is likely to cover bilateral matters, including Northern Ireland, European Community issues and other questions of common interest.</P>
      <P>As regards Sellafield, the British Government is very well aware of our serious concerns.  In January of this year, a detailed submission was forwarded by the Government to the British authorities which reiterated our objections to operations at Sellafield and requested a full public inquiry regarding the proposed expansion plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply, but would he agree that it is by our actions that we are known?  Would he agree that our Government is doing more to support Sellafield at present than to oppose it?  For example, does the Taoiseach remember agreeing to a Sellafield protection clause in the Single European Act, at Article 30, section 6, which commits us to maintaining the technological and industrial conditions necessary for <Col N="1829" /> the security of each member state?  What excuse will the Taoiseach have to offer for sanctioning the money for THORP during Ireland's so-called Green Presidency since these are definite actions? How does the Taoiseach stand over the Green 2000 report presented to him in February which states, on page 166, that the role of nuclear power must inevitably be re-examined?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to reply by way of a whole series of statements as the Deputy sought to do.  I have made it clear that we have made our case to the British Authorities.  There are approximately 80,000 objections to the expansion of Sellafield in the THORP area, about 40,000 of which enamated from Ireland.  I am sure the Deputy will be glad to know that President Clinton has also expressed his concern in relation to it.  We are doing all we can.  I do not think anybody needs to question any more our concern, opposition or indeed our endeavours to keep the British authorities fully aware of what is our position.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach say whether it is intended that the United Kingdom position paper on Northern Ireland will be discussed at his meeting with the British Prime Minister or, alternatively, or perhaps additionally, does the Taoiseach intend to take any initiative or launch any proposals which would <Col N="1830" /> help to get the Northern Ireland talks process restarted?</P>

      <P>I do not think Deputy O'Keeffe, or anybody else, is under any illusions about our total commitment to the restoration of the process of political talks, indeed to having the whole dialogue restarted as soon as possible.  We expect to be consulted in relation to the so-called British paper, about which we hear and read so much.  That remains our position.  In regard to initiatives regarding it, the Deputy can be assured that, when the talks process resumes, we will avail of every opportunity, as we have done, to produce papers in an endeavour to making progress within that overall area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach expect that the talks might be resumed before he may have an opportunity of meeting the British Prime Minister in June, given that the Northern Ireland local elections will be over and their results to hand by the end of this week which will mean that that obstable will no longer obtain?  Would he agree that every effort should be made to get these talks under way?  In addition, can we take it that the Taoiseach will not use the matter of being consulted or otherwise on the British proposals as a reason for not proceeding with those talks?  I understand that the Taoiseach is anxious that the talks would proceed but it would be unfortunate if they did not go ahead simply because some question arose about consultation on the British proposals?</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach say whether he will be raising the fact that the British Government's opt-out on the Social Charter may be likely to have serious implications for Irish industry and jobs and whether he will be urging the British Government, when it does ratify, to include the Social Charter in their ratification process?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can be assured that the Irish Government will not lay down any pre-conditions for starting talks or indeed resort to any such opportunity or excuse.  We are totally committed to the resumption of the talks process.  It may be that too much emphasis is being placed on the question of the production of a paper for the future &mdash; a blueprint.  As I understand it, it will be neither but merely an attempt by the British Government to focus on the particular issues involved; no more than that.  Having said that, we do expect to be consulted.  Indeed the way forward, leading to the possibility of progress there, is to ensure that we all consult very closely with each other in order to achieve, first, the resumption of the talks. I would hope they would be resumed at the earliest possible date.  I am not prepared to give a date or to predict whether they will be back in action before I meet the British Prime Minister.  Let us hope they will but I can assure Members we will not put any obstacle in the way of their resumption.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Social Charter, we should await the decisions in the House of Commons and House of Lords before meeting that particular challenge.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that circumstances in which justice does not appear to be even-handed &mdash; and I am not being specific here &mdash; in which one British soldier only has served time for activities in Northern Ireland since the troubles began and was released very quickly, creates an impression that justice does not appear to be even-handed, <Col N="1832" /> which is not in the furtherance of the cause of peace and that the only gainers in such circumstances are the men of violence on all sides?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The alienation of any communities and/or their faith in the administration of justice certainly is deplored by the Irish Government at all times.  The type of incident about which the Deputy speaks is indeed a matter that is brought up on a regular basis at the intergovernmental conference meetings held under the Anglo Irish Agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach seemed to indicate that, after the talks resume, there might be some Irish proposals or initiative taken by him or his Government.  In that event, I suggest that he consider, in advance of the talks being restarted and with a view to helping to get them restarted, such an initiative, or launching proposals to help get that process restarted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of choice how one approaches the talks process. Our view always has been that the talks process can make more progress within the confines of the conference rather than endeavouring to debate initiatives in the open which tends to do more harm than good.  We believe that progress can be made through all of the people concerned sitting around the table, exchanging views, without any preconditions being attached.  We believe that is the best way to make progress.</P>

      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>if he will review the legislation setting up the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions with a view to making it possible for the director where public interest so requires to make a statement setting out the reason he has not proceeded with a prosecution in certain cases of serious crime.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy was informed in answer to a similar question by him on a previous occasion, such statements are not issued by the director because a policy of giving reasons would inevitably, in very many cases, mean inflicting distress and serious damage to the reputation of individuals.  Before the coming into operation of the Prosecution of Offences Act, 1974, which established the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, Attorneys General dealt with criminal prosecutions.  They also considered themselves precluded from making any such statements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Taoiseach rightly said, I have been raising this matter for some time and my question is not related to any particular case.  Would the Taoiseach agree that independence is not necessarily affected by proper accountability procedures?  Would he agree &mdash; for instance, where there has been loss of life, or multiple loss of life, in circumstances I came across in the past &mdash; that the Director of Public Prosecutions should be authorised in some way, even if it necessitates amending legislation, in the public interest, to give reasons he did not proceed with a prosecution since this matter gives rise to much public concern?  Would the Taoiseach reconsider the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell would be the first to agree that, if reasons were to be given in one case &mdash; even in circumstances in which public controversy surrounded such a case &mdash; such explanation would have to be extended to all cases.  I do not think any of us &mdash; and neither, I am sure, would Deputy Mitchell &mdash; would want to interfere with the independence of the Director of Public Prosecutions in such cases.  Members should remember that we could be creating circumstances in which the perception of guilt could well be associated with somebody in relation to his or her conviction if one were to announce a <Col N="1834" /> particular reason for not proceeding with a prosecution.</P>
      <P>There could be many reasons for the decision.  For example, if a witness had disappeared from the jurisdiction and that was the reason given for not proceeding, some people could draw the conclusion &mdash; and this would be contrary to natural justice &mdash; that the person was guilty but the evidence was not available to convict him.  One would want to tread very carefully before making changes in this area.  I believe strongly in accountability but I have to be very careful in proceeding along a particular line.  The reasons for non-prosecution do not necessarily relate to guilt or innocence and in that regard we should be concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that no one in Irish society should be so independent that he is not accountable? Further, does he agree that the DPP finds himself bound by legislation which he agrees should be changed?  Is he aware that the then chairman and vice-chairman of the Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism, Deputy Woods and Deputy Gay Mitchell, were asked by that committee to meet with the Director of Public Prosecutions and that it was agreed at their meeting that some formula should be found where the public interest so requires, in the case of serious crime or loss of life, to show that justice is being done and is being seen to be done?  I have been pressing this matter since 1986.  Will the Taoiseach review the legislation or at least cause the DPP to be consulted on whether he agrees that the legislation should be changed?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I read the report in front of me and I could not draw the conclusion Deputy Mitchell has drawn in relation to legislation.  The answers given at that time are not in accordance with what he now says &mdash; may be there is an inadequate report in front of me, but I <Col N="1835" /> doubt it.  Having said that, however, I think the House will agree with me that withholding reasons for not proceeding with a prosecution is not based on a reluctance by the DPP to be accountable, but on policy.  If we were to establish a policy of giving reasons in such cases, this could in many circumstances mean serious damage to the reputation of individuals. One has to be extremely careful in that area.  This is the strongly held view over a long period of time.  I know the matter was discussed at the Committee of Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism some time ago but I cannot see where the committee came up with a recommendation outlined by Deputy Mitchell.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Accepting the Taoiseach's anxieties in relation to individual cases, would he agree with me that the Prosecution of Offences Act, 1974, makes provision for the Attorney General to consult in certain circumstances with the Director of Public Prosecutions about the discharge of the Director's duties?  Does he further agree that in certain cases, such as those Deputy Mitchell has in mind like dangerous driving causing death, at least the policy principles upon which it is decided to proceed or not with those prosecutions should be made clearly known so that people, generally speaking, can have confidence that the indictable offence of dangerous driving causing death is not set aside in favour of summary offences, where it is not appropriate?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think any of us would point the finger at the Office of the DPP and say that in reaching such decisions he does not take full account of the circumstances surrounding it.  If you once give a reason you cannot get away from giving reasons on subsequent occasions.  There will be questions day after day in the House about reasons for this, that and the other.  The issue of protection for the individual has to be very much in our minds when considering this issue and we should not rush into rash decisions.</P>

What procedures can be put in place to deal with that situation, particularly in circumstances where the people concerned are not in a position, financially or otherwise, to pursue civil proceedings?</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach has explained why he is unwilling to accept public accountability by the DPP, but would he consider some form of private accountability, whereby after the event the DPP might be asked to account to three assessors, to whom complaints could be made on the decisions he has reached so that there would be at least some means of discussing the policy he has implemented, without the publication of the results in an individual case?</P>

      <P>The thrust of public service reform since 1987 has been directed towards enhancing the capacity of civil servants to manage the resources of the State and the programmes for which their Departments are responsible with maximum efficiency and effectiveness.</P>
      <P>Given the scale and scope of public expenditure programmes overseen or implemented by different branches of the Civil Service and the continuing pressure on the Exchequer, their process is of such fundamental importance to the finances of the State that I consider it to be part of the overall budget policy function of the Minister for Finance which he must personally supervise.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that nothing has been done in the last ten years; a number of initiatives have been taken.  The Government's position is very clearly set out in the Programme for Government, one aspect of change being a broadening of democracy.  The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> 1991-93 includes an agenda for agreed change, not only in the Civil Service but in the wider public service, aimed at creating a climate conducive to greater efficiency and job satisfaction.  As Minister for Finance, I introduced a system of administrative budgets over a three year period in the administrative area which was designed to improve management and efficiency and reduce the real costs of administration.</P>
      <P>Changes were also made in computerisation of the Civil Service, introduction of a high speed telecommunications network within the system, linking of Civil Service offices in all parts of the country, the establishment of the efficiency audit group, the introduction of performance related pay for assistant secretaries and the development of senior management conferences and network structures.  The joint programme contains a number of reforms in the Civil Service such as a register of interests for senior civil servants and privilege and compellability of witnesses, mainly civil servants, to come before Oireachtas Committees.  A whole range of improvements was made and we will continue along those lines.</P>

I do not accept that everything done results from the White Paper to which the Deputy referred.  For instance, I do not think Deputy O'Keeffe would claim that decentralisation was a policy of the Government in which his party was a partner.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 12 and 91 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I met Amdahl Corporation on 16 March during the course of my recent <Col N="1844" /> industrial promotion schedule in the United States.  At that time the company outlined its difficulties due to highly competitive pricing in the mainframe computer market.  The company indicated that if the market did not pick up it might then become necessary to look at a reduction in the Swords workforce.  Since that meeting, Amdahl announced losses of $240 million for the first quarter of 1993.  The company now finds itself in a situation that, to ensure its continued survival, it must reduce production capacity with resultant consequences on staff numbers.  Amdahl is in the process of cutting 1,200 jobs from its 8,700 workforce worldwide.  As the plant in Swords is Amdahl's only manufacturing operation outside the United States, it is inevitable that Swords would have to bear some of the cutbacks.</P>
    <P>During my meeting with Amdahl, we also discussed the possibility of the company introducing some non-manufacturing activities to the Swords plant and this is being actively pursued.</P>
    <P>All segments of the electronics industry are kept under constant review and future assessments as to potential and risk are made regularly both by my Department and IDA in conjunction with outside analysts.  Digital and Amdahl operate in the mainframe computer market.  Although this market is currently depressed, as personal computers and network systems are becoming more adaptable and price competitive, mainframes are here to stay for the foreseeable future.  However, there is excess capacity and companies have been responding to this through restructuring.</P>
    <P>Other areas of the computer industry, such as personal computers, continue to show strong growth up to and beyond 1996, as new applications are devised.  Likewise, microprocessor, semi-conductor networking and telecommunications companies involved in electronics are preforming extremely well. Companies engaged in these growing sectors are well represented in Ireland.  We will continue to seek to be in the growth <Col N="1845" /> segment of the market to maximise employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that our electronics industry, particularly the hardwear side, employs 28,000 people and that in the space of three months we have lost 1,000 of those jobs, has the Minister sought from the IDA or elsewhere an assessment of our portfolio of electronics companies with a view to ascertaining whether there may be similar problems as experienced by Amdahl and Digital?  Rather than sit passively waiting for something to happen will he take the initiative to head off, in a timely way, any potential closures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I never sat passively waiting for anything to happen and neither do I intend to in this job.  I assure the Deputy, and the House, that the IDA, on an ongoing basis, is monitoring the rapidly changing nature of the electronics industry and is seeking to be ahead of changes so as to maximise our position and to cushion the effect of those changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the rapid change in the computer industry with developments in mainframe softwear, and given Ireland's need for an expansion of the electronics industry, would the Minister accept that a special investigation by the IDA of developments not only in Ireland but worldwide is warranted to ascertain how we can compensate for the loss of jobs in the mainframe area such as in Digital and Amdahl?  To what precisely was the Minister referring when he mentioned the non-manufacturing side and replacement jobs for Amdahl?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to assure the Deputy that the IDA and my Department, with the help of outside analysts, are monitoring, on a regular basis, the rapidly changing profile of the electronics-computer industry.  There are three fundamental changes taking place.  First, at present nationally and worldwide there is an over-capacity of mainframe computer facilites.  That is not to say that mainframe <Col N="1846" /> will disappear but it will have to reduce somewhat in size.  Second, there is an increasing sophistication of personal computers and mini-computers.  We are very much to the fore in capturing more than our fair share of that market in manufacturing terms.  In relation to manufacturing generally there is a drift from Europe, particularly from western Europe, of manufacturing activity to the south Pacific.  Third, we are in the lead in regard to softwear.  Due to the telecommunications evolution in the European Community generally we are better positioned than most to maximise our location for softwear development.  In that context we opened up discussions with Amdahl.</P>

      <P>Can we take it from what the Minister said that there will not be any further job losses in the sector?  Is the Minister not painfully aware that the electronics sector in Ireland has not located any of its primary business functions, such as research and development, in Ireland which leave us vulnerable when the new product cycle comes on and we do not have Irish located capacity to produce new products?  Is the Minister concerned that even in the softwear sector the might of the public procurements cheque book in other countries may well render our companies vulnerable?</P>

      <P>I shall take the questions in reverse order.  I hope the operation of competition law within the European Community, specifically in the area of public procurement, will obviate if not eliminate the kind of distortion in the marketplace to which the Deputy refers. Second, we are attracting increasingly into the Irish economy softwear headquarters and softwear development for most of the main operators and developers of computers worldwide.  Third, no Minister could give any assurance of the kind the Deputy sought to the effect that there would be no further job losses in an industry whose shelf life is manifestly much shorter than any other.</P>

      <P>I agree with what the Minister said in regard to softwear.  Would he accept that our greatest weakness in this area is that we do not have the same level of research and development on which this industry depends and which is the life blood of the development of the computer industry and will continue to be in the foreseeable future at an even faster pace?  Can he comment on whether the IDA has examined the relationship between our universities and the industry with a view to engendering a greater level of research and development from these major companies?  Would he accept that if we had a better balance and investment in research and development, coupled with expansion in the software sector, this would create a more secure base for the softwear industry in the future?</P>

      <P>I disagree with the Deputy.

I invite the Deputy, or any Member to contact the Univerity of Limerick, University College Dublin, Trinity College or Dublin City University where there is an interactive relationship between the industrial and the electronics sectors on the one hand, the IDA and the academic institutions. I have been informed that we are in the lead in Europe in this regard but I invite Deputies to satisfy themselves in that respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Programme for a Partnership Government sets out the steps that this Government is taking to improve employment and employment opportunities.</P>
      <P>The response of the Government to the Culliton report on Employment through Enterprise published on 3 May, is directed at introducing structural changes which will make it more efficient and more attractive for business to do more business.  It is only by doing more business and by doing it more successfully that firms can expand the numbers they employ.  In addition the country enterprise partnership boards will further facilitate small business development.</P>
      <P>The main element of the strategy to assist the long term unemployed is the social employment scheme and the community employment development programme which will provide opportunities for an average of 15,500 long term unemployed persons during the year compared with 12,000 in 1992.  Exchequer funding of £97.311 million is being made available this year for this activity.</P>
      <P>Subject to the social employment scheme being eligible for European Community Funding under the Community Support Framework for 1994 to 1999 and to the general budgetary position, it may be possible to increase participation levels still further next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the Deputy will be aware that the area based strategy to combat <Col N="1849" /> long term unemployment is operating in 12 designated areas.  An interim report to the Central Review Committee on the evaluation of the strategy in 1991 and 1992 undertaken by the Combat Poverty Agency was published yesterday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed the Minister in his reply has not set a target for a reduction in the number of long term unemployed.  Is he committed to the target he set of reducing long term unemployment to 25,000 over the next decade?  Would he agree that none of the proposals for the long term unemployed has been acted on?  For example, would he agree that the £80 per week subsidy, promised in the Programme for Government, has not been introduced and that FÁS received an instruction earlier this year to cut participation in the CEDP and the SES which, hopefully, has now been reversed?  Finally, will the Minister not agree that the Culliton approach will not result in &ldquo;trickle down&rdquo; opportunities to the long term unemployed and that if he is to realise his target something more is needed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me start with the last of the four or five questions.  We do recognise that Culliton proposed the establishment of a very positive framework within which business could function, that the level of net additional job creation would be limited and that the group least likely to benefit in the short term would be the long term unemployed. Second, the changes in the CEDP and the instructions, which were subject to budgetary adjustment, have been confirmed and clarified.  The original retention of secondary benefits has been confirmed and this has been well known for some time.</P>

Perhaps the Deputy would remind me of the other points.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 71 together.</P>
      <P>The Government is at present drawing up a national plan for submission to Brussels in connection with the next round of Structural Funds.  The plan will include proposals for expenditure on training and employment programmes by FÁS and other appropriate agencies both for the unemployed and those in employment.</P>
      <P>Primary responsibility for training those at work will continue to rest with employers.  However, FÁS will play an important role in promoting and encouraging the provision of training by employers for their employees.  Increased investment by employers themselves in training for their workers is, I believe, of paramount importance in the context of the Single Market and the ever-increasing competition in the market place.</P>
      <P>Industry will be assisted by the new industry division set up in FÁS in line with the Culliton recommendations to concentrate on training for those at work, and to quote from the recently published <i>Employment through Enterprise,</i>&ldquo;to realise the objective of training the level of skills for work to best international levels&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree with the Culliton analysis that the allocation of 10 per cent of the funds within FÁS to people in employment in industry is inadequate?  Does she propose to increase that and, if so, by how much?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is in broad agreement with the Culliton recommendations.  Their implementation in cash terms is a matter of ongoing discussion within FÁS and particularly within the new structure in FÁS to deal with those in employment in industry. <Col N="1852" /> The matter will evolve as time goes on. The discussions are at a preliminary stage, but I assure the Deputy that very great attention is being paid to training for those in employment and the unemployed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that it would be impossible for anybody in this House to discern from her reply whether she is saying we should shift more or less money to industry? Which is it to be?  Are we to have less money or the same proportion of money for schemes for the unemployed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>

One does not arrive at answers to questions like that overnight.  We are going about our business in a consultative and comprehensive way.</P>

      <Quest>if he will give details of the progress of the CEDP; if all places approved by the Programme for Economic and Social Progress monitoring committee have been sanctioned; the plans, if any, he has to expand the scheme beyond the 12 partnership areas; and the manner in which the participants will be involved in the evaluation of the programme.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>At the end of March, 1993, there were 3,098 people on the community employment development programme. There is no <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> monitoring committee for the programme. However, all projects under the social employment scheme and the community employment development programme must be approved by a national monitoring <Col N="1853" /> committee.  The actual commencement of approved projects is then a day to day matter for FÁS in line with available funding.</P>
      <P>With regard to an expansion of the programme, the Programme for a Partnership Government indicates that EC support for the programme will be sought in the context of the Community support framework over the period 1994 to 1999 with the aim of moving towards a participation level of 30,000.</P>
      <P>The interim report to the central review committee on the evaluation of 12 pilot area-based partnerships in Ireland 1991-1992, carried out by the Combat Poverty Agency, forms the first stage in the evaluation of the CEDP.  I have no doubt that the views of participants will be an essential part of the overall evaluation and development of the programme.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the Government's intention to try to persuade the European Commission of the value of this programme having regard to its focus upon the long term unemployed and the remit the Commission now has to combat what is referred to as social exclusion.  Twelve area-based companies were established on a pilot basis for 12 months and the expiry date in regard to that is in September this year.  I met yesterday with the chairpersons and the managers of the 12 companies.  I indicated to them that it was the Government's decision to extend the operational remit of these 12 companies for three years up to 1996, independent of whether or not EC money is available.  As to whether there would be an expansion either in the number of companies or in the operational area of the existing 12, that is a matter that is <Col N="1854" /> being considered and no decision has yet been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that there are already positive indications that, even given the limitations of this scheme, it has succeeded in attracting the long term unemployed and that demand for this programme already exceeds the places sanctioned so far?  Will the Minister take steps to ensure that the training content in this programme is emphasised to ensure that the programme does not become a cheap labour scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with the Deputy's observation that the scheme has been very successful and is performing perhaps more successfully than many people envisaged.  It is successful because there is a very good mix between training, social development, community focus and real or economically viable employment.  The whole basis of the programme would be undermined if it were to become what the Deputy fears it might become, that is, some form of cheap labour.  That is not the intention or the desire of the people who operate the programme or of my Department.  I can assure the Deputy that will not happen.  The programme certainly appears to be successful and we would hope to consolidate that success.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Enterprise and Employment</askee>
      <Quest>the cost per job created in indigenous industry and in foreign industry; and if he will give the basis on which the cost per job is calculated, including the way in which tax relief, training grants and other such reliefs and grants are treated.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from the IDA that the cost per job created and sustained for IDA companies over the period 1986 to 1992 was £10,832 for indigenous firms and £17,986 for foreign firms, including overseas companies in the mid-west for which IDA has responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These cost per job figures reflect, in <Col N="1855" /> constant 1992 prices, the sum of all IDA grant payments over a seven year period, divided by the number of first time jobs created and still in existence at the end of that seven year period.</P>
    <P>The IDA defines a first time job as the increase in employment in a company in excess of the peak employment level in the previous five years arising from a specific investment programme agreed with the IDA.  For the purpose of the cost per job exercise, sustained first time jobs for 1986-92 are calculated against the peak employment level in companies in the period 1981-85.  First time jobs created but lost prior to the end of the seven year period are excluded.</P>
    <P>All grants paid by the IDA are included in the calculations including capital, leasing, training, employment, interest subsidies, rent reduction, research and development, technology acquisition, feasibility grants, loan guarantees and equity.</P>
    <P>Tax reliefs which are allowed by the State are not incorporated in the calculations. Likewise, tax revenues from the companies are not included.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister consider this cost per job represents good value for money or does he still support the Labour Party's manifesto prior to the general election which indicated that industrial policy had failed?  Does he consider that a 66 per cent higher grant per job in the foreign industry section than the indigenous industry section is justified and worthwhile?  Does he agree with the figures indicated by Culliton that only 40 per cent of the job announcements, which he and other Ministers are so keen to make, survive?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to the Deputy's first question, I am informed that on a comparative basis &mdash; there are sufficient agencies in Western Europe upon which a comparative basis can be made &mdash; the cost per job figure I have quoted is reasonably good value for money taking a reasonable time frame in which to analyse it.  I agree with the Labour Party's <Col N="1856" /> manifesto that industrial policy has failed.  With 300,000 people unemployed one does not need the Labour Party's manifesto to illustrate that fact, but how we respond to it is another matter.</P>
      <P>We must examine ways in which investment can be stimulated here and get better value for money than is currently the case and we are examining ways in which that can be done.  To that extent, the onward attraction of international investment capital and related job creation is something we will continue to pursue, but not exclusively and not to the detriment of the promotion of indigenous industries.</P>

That detailed analysis showed that during the ten year period 1981-90 the cost of grants was £1.6 billion or £228,000 per job and that when the cost of tax reliefs was taken into account the cost of a job could be in excess of £500,000.  Those figures may seen astronomical but they are contained in that detailed paper which was presented to that conference by an official in the former Department of Industry and Commerce.

      <P>I wanted to ask the Minister to reveal where advance factories were available for industries but that question was disallowed.  As a follow up to that, will the Minister ensure, in relation to the annual reports of both the IDA and SFADCo, that it is possible to reveal the actual jobs created by the companies? The usual information supplied relates to a company and the amount of grants paid to that company, but the most pertinent issue relates not alone to the company and the grants paid to such companies, <Col N="1858" /> but to the number of jobs they create.  A vacuum exists regarding that important information.  Will the Minister examine that issue?</P>

      <P>The Minister gave a figure of £10,832 for indigenous industry and £17,986 for foreign industry, but what are the total figures for each sector and is there a major difference between the two sectors in regard to the total amount of money made available?  Is he satisfied that there is a serious imbalance in that regard and what does he intend to do to achieve a better balance between the emphasis on indigenous industry and foreign industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the total figures, but I will supply the Deputy with the information at a later date.  I have comparative figures for the years 1982-88 between indigenous and foreign industries which are as follows.  For the years 1982 to 1988 the figure for indigenous industry was £15,488 as against £26,798 for foreign industry.  For 1983 to 1989 the figure for indigenous industry was £13,037 and £22,994 for foreign industry. In the years 1984 to 1990 the figure for indigenous industry was £11,761 as against £20,184 for foreign industry.  In the years 1985 to 1991 the figure for indigenous industry was £11,480 as against £19,182 for foreign industry and for 1986 to 1992 the figure was £10,832 for indigenous firms and £17,986 for foreign firms.  There has been a pattern of relative reduction in the cost of foreign investment per job created relative to indigenous firms, but if the Deputy would like the total figures and puts down a question in that regard I will get the information for him.</P>

Is he aware that we are increasing our emphasis on foreign industry within the industrial budget?  Why should we pay 66 per cent more for a job in foreign industries located here than on Irish industry?  Is the Minister aware that we are paying more than twice as much for a job in foreign industry located here compared to a job in small Irish industry?

      <P>Thank you, Sir.  I want to make it clear to the Minister that I was not suggesting that he or his administration was hiding anything.  I gave him the only public reference I know for the paper in question and I am asking him if he can explain in any way the massive <Col N="1860" /> discrepancy in cost per job as produced in the internal departmental document concerning an open conference in Kenmare. I gave the Minister the reference and the figures he gave to the House today.  It is such a huge gap between even the high figure of £17,000 and the figure in the paper of £228,000 per job that it is a matter of public interest to the taxpayer that it should be examined.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The last paragraph of my reply stated that tax reliefs, the subject referred to by the participant in Kenmare who took into consideration the cost of tax reliefs to job creation, which were allowed by the State are not incorporated in the calculations of the cost per job. Likewise &mdash; and this must be taken into account &mdash; tax revenues from the companies are not included.  If the participant in Kenmare put on a balance sheet the tax reliefs as against the cost per job as set against the tax revenue generated by that job for the State, we might have a more balanced picture.  However, I am not aware of the precise details to which the Deputy has referred.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputies to my replies to parliamentary questions on February 18 and March 31 1993 in connection with county enterprise partnership boards and regional tourism organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputies will be aware I have asked my Department to undertake a fundamental review of the original proposals to establish county enterprise partnership boards.  That review process involves consultations with the social partners and local bodies together with a <Col N="1863" /> wide variety of other relevant interests. I have also been keeping Government colleagues informed as to progress. While the review has yet to be finalised and approved, the Government has nevertheless decided to establish enterprise boards on a county basis which would have effective local representation and a non-bureaucratic administrative structure.  By establishing the boards on a county basis I am striking a balance between the need for scale on the one hand and the need to retain a local element.  The boards must not be remote from the communities which they represent. There will be special arrangements for the Dublin region and other large urban centres.  The boards will work in harmony with existing State agencies and will not, as far as is possible, displace or duplicate the existing local enterprise initiatives, including regional tourism organisations.  Certain operational details for the boards, including their composition and staffing, are nearing finalisation and the boards should be operational in the latter half of 1993.</P>
    <P>The allocation of funds as between boards and the criteria for disbursal of these funds by the boards will be determined by a national enterprise council in consultation with my Department.  Membership of the council will reflect a similar balance to that at county level.  As is the case with the boards, operational details, including composition and staffing of the council, are still under consideration and have yet to be finalised by Government. I hope to be in a position to make a fuller statement on all of these matters in the near future.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has asked a number of questions and I shall attempt to answer as many as I can.  The structure which will be launched and established will be different from the structure originally annouced prior to the general election. I have already said that.  The Cabinet is very close to finalising the details of this structure.  The private sector commitments which we made in the autumn of last year are still on the table and there has been no indication from the financial institutions who made them that those commitments have been withdrawn.  At a recent meeting with the chairpersons and chief executives, or their representatives, of the associated banks, I confirmed that that was the position. <Col N="1867" /> I ask the Deputy and the House to await the announcement of the full details of the structures in a few days.  It is my intention &mdash; I respect the traditions of this House &mdash; to make an announcment of the details within this House or within the environs of this House.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister tell us anything about the special arrangements for Dublin and the urban areas to which he referred?  What measures will be included in the structures to protect against displacement in an economic sense?  I congratulate the Minister on winning back on some of the dafter aspects of the original proposal at the time it was under the umbrella of the Taoiseach and the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Treacy.  Is it true that this bureaucratic quagmire will be avoided, as is rumoured, and that it will be left in the hands of a few officials, to administer efficiently and report to some central body?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the arrangements for Dublin this issue is still in the proceess of negotiation and it will not be finalised until we have had consultations with the relevant authorities, including the public representatives in the four emerging local authorities, so to speak, in the Dublin area.  A final decision has not yet been made but I am satisfied with the progress we have made to date.  I believe that any fair and reasonable-minded person who is concerned about the promotion of community enterprise will welcome the formation and structures of the boards when they are announced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the case, as it seems from his replies, that only £5 million is left of the money set aside for the county enterprise boards?  The Minister indicated earlier that he had increased the budget for social employment schemes from £78 million to £97 million. Does this indicate that £20 million has been taken away?  In regard to the special arrangements for Dublin, would the <Col N="1868" /> Minister agree that the best way to tackle the problems in Dublin is through a single economic authority?  Is the Minister aware that Dublin's industrial base has collapsed, with a decrease of 22 per cent in the number of industrial jobs over the past ten years, a decrease of 30 per cent in the number of building construction jobs and a decrease of 20 per cent in the number of public service jobs?  Does he agree that it is now time to reverse the bias against Dublin in the strategy of both the IDA and Government Departments?</P>

      <P>With regard to his last question, I can assure the Deputy that I strongly share his concern for Dublin. I expressed this concern on a previous occasion in reply to a question from Deputy Gregory.  I am acutely aware of the assaults which have been made on the perceived economic viability of Dublin city and its regions by people outside the region, in the mistaken belief that Dublin is an economically viable part of our economy.  There is a need for some kind of special structure on how we promote enterprise in the Dublin region. However, I am not going to dictate to or prescribe for the four local authorities in Dublin exactly how this should be done as I believe that the essence of the county enterprise partnership boards is that some degree of design and, consequently, ownership must come from the local authorities or the local communities.</P>

      <P>The Government has endorsed the view of the Moriarty Task Force on Culliton that greater competition should continue to be promoted in all markets for goods and services in Ireland.  The Competition Act, 1991, is the primary instrument for the implementation of this policy.</P>
      <P>We are also aware that there are many areas of economic activity where competition is prevented or hindered through regulatory measures or administrative restrictions.  Our aim is to examine all areas, including existing legislation, which act directly or indirectly to limit or restrict competition, while at the same time respecting the public interest criteria which may have given rise to the regulations in the first place, if these criteria are still relevant.</P>
      <P>Regulation is so far as it is necessary must be proportionate in its intent and the regulatory environment must not prevent effective competition.  Many regulations, including licensing arrangements, need to be re-evaluated in the context of a changing economic environment. Regulations formulated decades ago and in different market conditions may not be the most suitable for today.</P>

      <P>That is an appropriate <Col N="1877" /> question.  It is clear, as we consider what is happening in other European countries in particular Britain and Northern Ireland in regard to the consumer issues that consumer interests and rights cut across a number of Departments.  When we have acquired all the necessary information it will be a question of what the Government wishes to include in the consumer's charter.  If it is to live up to its name various Departments will have to make an input.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State has been asked a number of questions about the pro-consumer charges announced by the Minister, Deputy Cowen.  Was she not embarrassed by this announcement? Furthermore, was she not embarrassed by the fact that the Director of Consumer Affairs had to go so far as to threaten court action in dealing with a Department of State which should have communicated with the Minister of State before the new charges were announced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs was set up on a statutory basis.  By taking such measures the Director of Consumer Affairs is showing clearly that he is independent and acting as a watchdog.  It is my understanding that he had consultations and made statements on the question of misleading advertising.  He was quite right to do so.  We should be glad that there is an independent watchdog and while I know that the Deputy does not seek to denigrate it everyone, on all sides of the House, is glad that there is a person with such a responsibility and who has been given such a remit.  To answer the first part of the Deputy's question, as I said to Deputy Rabbitte, there is a separate question on the Order Paper dealing with consumer interests in regard to Telecom Éireann. We are all consumers in the home or in business.  The Minister, Deputy Quinn, and I have promised that this matter will be the subject of an ongoing review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that for the last 20 years at least the sectoral industries division of the Minister's Department has brought together all the relevant agencies to discuss firms which may be under threat and pool confidential information in that regard?  How will the job protection unit represent an advance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct but his information is out of date.  With the abolition of Fóir Teoranta, for which the old Department had responsibility, the sectoral industries division, with its early warning system to which the Deputy referred, was disbanded.  Apart from the <Col N="1880" /> Industrial Development Authority there is no equivalent body and it is, therefore, our intention to re-establish such a body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister telling us therefore, that the establishment of a job protection unit announced by the Government amounts to a reversal of one of the most foolish decisions made by the Taoiseach when Minister for Finance to abolish Fóir Teoranta and a long established procedure, whereby we got an early warning of potential job losses, involving many other agencies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may have misunderstood the intention in regard to the employment protection unit; it will not operate an early warning system in regard to jobs at risk, it is a much broader proposal which is currently being developed in consultation with a number of agencies, including the social partners. Regard will be had to changes in technology, work practices and markets as distinct from the narrow based early warning system whereby we focused exclusively on financial difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister have any sympathy for Members on this side of the House who have been bombarded with information about consultations and discussions during Question Time today? In practical terms, what does this mean to those who feel their jobs are threatened? Does the Minister accept what is implicit in Deputy Bruton's question, that the main function of the employment protection unit is the early warning system? As a former Minister for Labour, is he familiar with the effective early warning system which was in place and which, depending on a person's point of view, had a limited impact on job protection? Does the job protection unit about which he is still engaged in consultation deserve its name?  What will it do, in practical terms, for those whose jobs may be at risk?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I draw the attention of the Deputies to the fact that there are 1.1 million people in the labour force.  The <Col N="1881" /> entire complement of personnel of the Department of Enterprise and Employment, FÁS and the Industrial Development Authority amounts to fewer than 5,000 persons.  In gathering information on changes in the labour market and in identifying employment at risk rather than individual jobs, the co-operation and active participation of people in the business world will be required.  They must be allowed to feed into the system on a confidential basis.  In the first 120 days of this Administration we could have rushed ahead and set up such a unit without first entering into consultations but there would have been howls of protest from the other side of the House that we were not taking into account the contributions which people in the labour market could offer.  We are trying to establish, with limited resources and against a background where employment in the public sector must be curtailed or maintained at its present level, the most effective and efficient system.  We are very close to putting such a system in place.</P>

      <P>Even then it did not carry it out very well given that the level of redundancies in the early 1980s was appalling.  In many cases the change in technology, work practices and markets were not properly or accurately conveyed to the unit because it had been focusing exclusively on the monetary difficulties of companies, not on the changing technologies which are at the root of job <Col N="1882" /> displacement and employment-loss threats.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The measure we are now considering, the Jurisdiction of Courts and Enforcement of Judgments Bill, 1993, has one overriding objective, namely, to ensure a structured and coherent approach to the international recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial law matters.  Since 1988, we have had the benefits of this approach in relation to all the EC member states, with the exception of Spain and Portugal.  This <Col N="1997" /> Bill extends these benefits to a wider territorial area.  It does so by enabling Ireland to ratify the convention providing for the accession of Spain and Portugal to the 1968 Brussels Convention, and also to ratify a parallel convention, known as the Lugano Convention, which was negotiated between the member states of the European Communities and those of the European Free Trade Association.</P>
    <P>The impetus behind the original Brussels Convention, which was drawn up in 1968, was to give meaningful effect to Article 220 of the Treaty of Rome.  That article called on member states to secure &ldquo;the simplication of formalities governing the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments of courts or tribunals.&rdquo;  At the time, it was perceived that the economic wellbeing of the Community required a legal framework which would ensure that commercial relationships, in particular, would not be unduly hampered by the absence of a uniform system of law throughout the participating member states.</P>
    <P>The original convention did succeed in simplifying legal formalities of enforcement in the areas of civil and commercial law.  Of course, as the Community has developed closer links with other countries, such as those which form part of the European Free Trade Association, the EFTA group, the need for such simplification has grown and not lessened.</P>
    <P>It will be recalled that before Ireland's accession to the EC no Irish judgment was enforceable in another country by any simplified procedure &mdash; apart from a number of minor exceptions in the United Kingdom &mdash; nor was it possible for any foreign judgment to be enforced here.  Before our accession to the Community an Irish person who wished to bring a claim in France, Germany, Italy or some other EC country was obliged to retain lawyers in that country and bring separate legal proceedings there and go through the panoply of the legal procedures in that country and obtain a separate judgement in each country.  The fact that the Irish citizen might have had a decree or a judgment of an Irish court was of little or no value save in the couple <Col N="1998" /> of minor exceptions in the United Kingdom.  Likewise, a debtor in Ireland who owed money to a resident of another country had to be sued separately here and a judgement obtained in any other country was not enforceable here but it could be used as a basis for bringing a claim but of itself it could not be enforced in this country.</P>
    <P>In Ireland, after joining the EC in 1973, we took on board the obligation to accede to the Brussels Convention, as did Denmark, the United Kingdom and, subsequently, Greece.  The convention was modified both in 1978 and in 1982 to accommodate these accessions.  In our case, the force of law was given to the amended convention by the Jurisdiction of Courts and Enforcement of Judgments (European Communities) Act, 1988.  A further amendment is now necessary because of the more recent accession of Spain and Portugal.</P>
    <P>In the context of that accession, an opportunity was provided to take account of some important issues which had emerged during the course of the earlier negotiations on the Lugano Convention. These issues arose as a result of experience of the working of the Brussels Convention and of decisions of the European Court of Justice on the interpretation of its provisions.  Part III of the Bill deals specifically with the Lugano Convention.</P>
    <P>Part II consists largely of a series of technical adjustments to the 1988 Act. They reflect the changes brought about by the 1989 convention on the accession of Spain and Portugal known as the Convention of San Sebastian.  But the more significant changes are those that have been incorporated from the Lugano Convention. For example, in the area of employment contracts, the position of an employee who is in dispute with his or her employer will be appreciably improved as a result of those changes.  Under the Brussels Convention, the employee had to sue the employer in the courts of the state where the employer is domiciled or where the contract is to be performed. Such an individual will now have a right to sue the employer in the place where he or she habitually works or, if this is <Col N="1999" /> not appropriate, in the place where the business which engaged the employee was or is now situated.  The right of an employee to sue in a member state, to which the business which engaged him or her has moved, is a benefit particularly to the amended Brussels Convention.</P>
    <P>This concern to protect employees is also seen in an amendment to Article 17 of the Brussels Convention.  That article allowed parties to a contract to agree on the court of the contracting state that would have jurisdiction in the event of a dispute.  The amendment provides that in the case of an individual contract of employment the agreement will have legal force only if it is entered into after the dispute has arisen.  The employee also has the option under the convention of using a pre-dispute agreement to sue in the courts of any other state.</P>
    <P>Another change of note is one which will impact on individuals who wish to rent short-term holiday accommodation abroad.  An Irish resident might let a holiday home he or she owned in, say, France, to another Irish resident for part of the year.  If the tenant defaulted in payment of the rent or damaged the premises, the proceedings up to now would have to be taken in the courts of the state where the property was situated, that is, in the local French courts.  Now the action may be brought in the territory of the member state in which the defendant is domiciled, provided the tenant and landlord are natural persons and domiciled in the same member state.  The corresponding provision in the Lugano Convention for the EFTA countries allows the plaintiff in such cases to proceed in the courts of the state where the defendant is domiciled, provided only that the tenant is an individual and that neither party is domiciled in the country in which the property is situated.  So, in the example I have taken, the aggrieved Irish owner will be able to get redress in the appropriate circuit or district court just as if the holiday home were located in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill gives the force of law to the Lugano Convention.  This convention <Col N="2000" /> is identical to the Brussels Convention in all essential respects and its implementation does not require any substantial adjustments to our domestic law.  As already indicated, the main advantage of ratification is that it ensures that the judgments of a greater range of countries will, within the relevant categories have more or less free circulation throughout a wider territorial area.</P>
    <P>It may be worth recalling briefly the essential principles which govern both conventions.  Of primary importance is the fact that we now have the framework for a procedure of virtually automatic enforcement of judgments given in 18 individual states.  Provided the court giving the judgement sought to be enforced has jurisdiction to entertain the case under the rules of the conventions, the judgement can be enforced simply and quickly in any of the other states which are a party to their terms.</P>
    <P>There is a very limited number of grounds upon which recognition and enforcement of a judgement can be refused. The main ones would be where it would be contrary to public policy to do so or where the defendant was not made aware of the proceedings against him or her.  In Ireland, the usual way of securing enforcement of a judgement under the Brussels Convention is by way of application to the Master of the High Court. From the information available to me, it appears that this aspect of the procedure has worked well to date.  While there has not been an enormous number of such applications, there has been a relatively steady stream of applications to the Master from time to time.</P>
    <P>A number of matters are excluded from the scope of the conventions.  These include matters of an explicitly criminal nature, revenue, customs and administrative matters, status issues, social security and arbitration.  Nevertheless, their scope is extremely wide, covering the whole spectrum of international business transactions and litigation between individuals.</P>
    <P>Special provision is made for individual litigants in areas such as insurance and consumer contracts, matters relating to <Col N="2001" /> maintenance and personal injury actions. In these areas, the plaintiff is the acknowledged weaker party and so he or she may commence proceedings in the country in which he or she resides.  That is an exception to the general principle that proceedings must be instituted in the country where the defendant is resident.  Other exceptions of this kind occur in matters relating to a contract &mdash; where a person may be sued in the courts of the place of performance of the obligation in question &mdash; and in tort cases, where a person may be used in the courts of the place in which the tortious event occurred.</P>
    <P>The protection afforded to the weaker party is particularly important in maintenance matters where the expense of obtaining a judgement in a foreign country could place a very difficult obstacle in the path of most maintenance creditors.  I fully accept that extending the enforcement &ldquo;net&rdquo; is only a partial solution to the problems which such creditors face. Indeed, for that reason I am pressing ahead with a Bill which will allow Ireland to accede to the EC Maintenance Convention, thus making it unnecessary for Irish maintenance creditors to initiate enforcement proceedings themselves in the relevant member states.  That Bill will also facilitate our accession to the 1956 UN Convention on the Recovery Abroad of Maintenance.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill which I will introduce is to enable Ireland to accede to two conventions dealing with the recovery of maintenance payments from abroad.  The first is the convention between the member states of the EC on the simplification of procedures for the recovery of maintenance payments, signed in Rome on 6 November 1990, known as the EC Maintenance Convention. This convention will provide for a much more readily available, simplified procedure in the area of maintenance applications.  The second convention is the United Nations Convention on the recovery abroad of maintenance, signed in New York on 20 June 1956, known as the UN Maintenance Convention.  Those conventions will be enforced under the central authority procedure whereby a <Col N="2002" /> central authority court official or Government Department will be appointed in each relevant country.  The enactment into law of such an authority will represent a further major improvement in the recovery of maintenance procedures and will apply to countries outside EC and EFTA countries.</P>
    <P>The Brussels and Lugano Conventions also seek to introduce an element of legal certainty into business and commercial relationships.  More than 70 per cent of our trade is currently with other EC member states.  A further 5 per cent is with the EFTA countries.  These markets are very important to our future prosperity and, with regard to the EFTA countries in particular, there is obviously scope for additional market opportunities. A speedy method for enforcing legal remedies for breach of contract, supply of goods and other commercial relationships, such as that offered by both conventions, will be of practical benefit in developing our trade relationships with these countries and I hope, will be one factor which will encourage an increasing interplay of trade and commercial transactions with the EFTA countries.</P>
    <P>It is perhaps unfortunate that the contents of this Bill will not immediately strike many people as particularly relevant to them.  However, despite its apparent complexity, the fundamental principle of the Bill is essentially very simple.  People, in their daily lives, often confront problems which require legal remedies.  Sometimes these remedies may need to be availed of outside this jurisdiction.  In such cases, the approach reflected in the amended Brussels Convention and in the Lugano Convention will greatly ease the task of an individual plaintiff in obtaining justice.</P>
    <P>The maintenance issue will strike the most familiar chord with people.  The plight of individuals who are unable to recover maintenance payments properly due to them is all too familiar to most of us.  A partial solution is extending the enforcement net and in reducing the number of countries in which enforcement may be difficult or impossible.  As a result of this Bill a further eight countries <Col N="2003" /> will be added to the &ldquo;ease of enforceability&rdquo; net and it will be more difficult for recalcitrant spouses to escape their personal and social responsibilities to other dependent members of their families.</P>
    <P>If business and commercial arrangements are to function to maximum efficiency, people, firms, manufacturers of goods and contractors must have an assurance that legal remedies will not be bungled by national frontiers.  It is not extreme to say this Bill will make a valuable contribution to fostering a climate which will help to increase our export growth, especially in non-EC countries.</P>
    <P>The Brussels Convention has operated well to date without giving rise to any specific difficulties.  This is important because the familiarity which the courts and practitioners will have gained in operating its provisions, and the limited extent to which it has operated to date, will smooth the implementation of this measure for the remaining EC countries and the EFTA countries now being brought within the ambit of this legislation.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and ask that it be given a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that this legislation is now before the House. Everyone recognises it in the context of commercial relations in the European Community and other nations with whom we trade, such as the EFTA countries.  It is important to have the maximum co-operation between the judicial systems and the courts within those countries and that court judgments handed down in one State are enforceable in another State, to which they are relevant.  In the past this has been a cause of substantial difficulty; frequently, because of the distance between the countries, the different legal systems and the costs involved, people in the business community and outside have not sought to enforce their legal rights. This will provide for greater respect for our courts system.  I agree with various remarks by the Minister as to the importance of this measure.  The only gripe I <Col N="2004" /> have is the length of time it has taken to introduce this Bill before the House.  The Accession Convention of 1989 resulted in the accession of Spain and Portugal but it has taken until 1993 to implement arrangements which ensured the mutual enforceability of court orders made in this State between ourselves, Spain and Portugal.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt this Bill like other measures, which presumably we will see in the next few weeks, has been swimming a relatively slow course, in the Department of Justice and has not been perceived, as the Minister said, as a relevant measure, which is unfortunate. There is little point in extending the membership of the European Community if it takes a small State &mdash; such as Ireland which is dependent on exports &mdash; this length of time to bring this measure into the Dáil.  I welcome the having of law reform from the Department of Justice to a separate Department if it will result in a speedier legislative approach to these measures.  I would be very interested to know at what stage this Bill was when the Minister assumed office.  Were the heads in place, had it been fully drafted or was it on a departmental shelf gathering dust because the previous Minister for Justice did not regard it as urgent?  Being aware of the length of time it takes to produce measures I would be surprised to learn that most of this Bill had not been drafted prior to the creation of the Minister's Department.  It was probably sitting around with a few i's to be dotted and a few t's to be crossed.  If the Minister tells us he did not even have the heads of a Bill when he assumed office and that he managed to produce this measure within those few short weeks then I will pay due credit to him.  Somehow I doubt that is the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One wishes that the constipated legislative processes we operate would free themselves up.  The true test of whether things are up and running or still truly hidden in corners, and not being addressed, <Col N="2005" /> will be in the context of the legislation the Minister brings before the House in the second part of this year and early next when, presumably, some of the newer initiatives contained in the Programme for a Partnership Government may see the light of day.  I have no doubt we will pay tribute to the Minister when he produces a Bill on joint matrimonial property.  That Bill has only been in preparation in the Department of Justice since 1983 and I suppose we should not cheer if we see it in 1993 but if the establishment of this ministry results in the speedier production of this and other Bills it will be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The Minister is correct in saying that the part of the Bill with which the general public will identify and perhaps see as most relevant &mdash; though the other aspects of the Bill are of equal relevance and importance &mdash; relates to the mutual enforcement of maintenance orders.  In this country many husbands have deserted their wives, failed to comply with maintenance orders and have gone to live in the south of Spain.  If a message goes out from this House to the Marbella set who have left their wives in Ireland unsupported, and who feel that by staying in Marbella they can escape the maintenance orders by our courts.  I welcome the fact that this Bill should, at least in theory, allow maintenance orders to be pursued.  Maximum international co-operation is essential for the enforcement of maintenance orders at a time of huge international travel, high unemployment in Ireland and when men may see it as expedient to leave this country to avoid making payments for the support of their wives and children.  Legislation we put in place which allows for the possible implementation of our orders in other states and for the implementation of other states' orders in this State is welcome. Nevertheless, we should not over-exaggerate the impact this type of legislation has in that area.  I would be very interested to hear the Minister's comments on this.</P>
    <P>We have had reciprocal arrangements with the United Kingdom since 1974 and, <Col N="2006" /> more recently, with other European Community states.  The problem is that if a recalcitrant spouse who is intent on not paying maintenance leaves this jurisdiction and goes to one of the countries with which we have reciprocal arrangements and the wife does not know his address or location, all these legal rights are largely theoretical and do not have any real relevance or impact.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>That also applies if a spouse disappears in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.  There is a move afoot in some EC member states for the enforcement of maintenance orders by the relevant social welfare authorities.  We now have legislation which allows the Department of Social Welfare to pursue a husband who is not making maintenance payments and to become a primary enforcer.</P>
      <P>One or two other countries have taken the matter further.  For example, in Great Britain the relevant Department responsible for social welfare co-operates with the tax authorities to trace a spouse who is reneging on support payments to his family if his name, and particularly his social welfare number, is known and he is working in Great Britain.  Maintenance payments will only be enforceable on an EC basis when each country has a central authority that co-operates with the relevant Departments and the Revenue authorities in tracing the whereabouts in their country of foreign nationals reneging on their commitments.</P>
      <P>In the case of foreign nationals obtaining employment in other EC or EFTA states they will register for tax and social insurance and deductions will be made from their earnings by their employers, so their whereabouts will be traceable through the relevant authorities.  With all these matters being computerised, it should, at some time in the future, be possible to trace the whereabouts of individuals within the EC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this context we are not talking about invading people's privacy.  The right to privacy in regard to the places where one is working must be balanced against the <Col N="2007" /> right of a wife and children to receive the support payments to which the courts have judged they are entitled.  The use of information available in a foreign State to detect a person's whereabouts is not an invasion of privacy but a means of enforcing court orders properly made.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister say what discussions there were at EC level in regard to taking legal rights for the enforcement of maintenance orders throughout the EC out of the broad region of legislation, which gives theoretical rights, into the practical area of implementation where the relevant authorities in each State co-operate in pooling information that can identify the whereabouts of spouses seeking to evade their obligations?  What is the current position with regard to the reciprocal enforcement of maintenance orders? How many applications have been made, using our legislation in each of the years since it has come into force, to the United Kingdom and the other EC states, excluding those with which we are dealing today, seeking to enforce Irish maintenance orders within those states?  I would be interested to know the effectiveness of these applications, how many resulted in Irish orders being enforced in a foreign State and moneys payable pursuant to them being remitted to Ireland.  Will the Minister also tell us on how many occasions applications have been made, using the relevant legislation, to enforce in Ireland orders made in the other states with whom we have reciprocal arrangements against a spouse living in Ireland, being obliged to make payments?</P>
    <P>There is always a danger in building great legal monoliths setting out all sorts of wonderful principles because when we look behind them, we discover they are not being utilised to any great extent.  We must examine the reasons, in that regard. Although I welcome the main thrust of this legislation, for the overwhelming majority of people many of the provisions are theoretical and do not greatly improve their position.  This is not the Minister's fault.  However, we can now <Col N="2008" /> deal with these issues in a more sophisticated way.</P>
    <P>Equally relevant in the context of maintenance and support payments are the problems that arise when people's financial circumstances change.  Much of this legislation &mdash; and previous legislation &mdash; is designed in the context of maintenance in dealing with what is known as an enforceable maintenance order; an order is made in a foreign court that may be enforceable in Ireland or an Irish order is made which will be enforceable in a foreign court in one of the countries with whom we have reciprocal arrangements. In the context of Irish domestic maintenance orders, it would be quite usual, two or three years down the line, for the wife dependent on payments to seek an increase.  She may be entitled to that by virtue of the ravages of inflation which, over a two to three year period, could seriously affect the value of the payment she is receiving &mdash; at times of high inflation one would need to look for an annual increase through the courts if one was not voluntarily made available. It may also be that a maintenance order is made at a relatively low level at a time when the husband is working in Ireland in a low paid job, but the husband may subsequently travel to, say, Germany or, in the context of this legislation, Spain, and get far better paid employment.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister, therefore, clarify the relevance of this legislation, not simply to the enforcement of maintenance orders but to their variation, because this is as big a problem as enforcement where one spouse is in one jurisdiction and the other spouse in another.  If a husband living in Spain and required to pay maintenance pursuant to a Spanish maintenance order to a wife who has now returned to live in Ireland seeks to have the maintenance varied because his financial circumstances have deteriorated, what is the position?  Will he have to bring variation proceedings in Spain?  Will the wife have to find the money to fly out to Spain to defend her position in the Spanish courts, or can the husband bring the application in Ireland?  If the wife in Ireland wants her payments increased, <Col N="2009" /> does she have to bring a variation application in the Spanish courts or can she use an Irish mechanism?  As someone recognised as having familiarity with the area of family law, I have found the conventions in this area particularly complex and obtuse in their application.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about the idea of putting legislation in place to ensure that husbands meet their obligations to their wives and families, regardless of where they reside in the EC or EFTA countries, we must do more than make decisions about the enforcement of orders: the variation of orders is of considerable importance.  It is important because in the absence of agreement about variation the only mechanism available to a wife seeking an increase in maintenance payments is to go back to court.  If a husband's circumstances change or deteriorate and he seeks a decrease in maintenance payments &mdash; to which his wife does not agree &mdash; the only mechanism available to him is to go back to court.  Will the Minister address that area in the context of this Bill or in future plans he may have or that may be put in place at EC level.</P>
    <P>I will make a practical proposals which may help resolve some of those difficulties. When a couple separate by agreement usually an automatic annual cost of living increase is provided for in the financial arrangements between the couple in regard to maintenance.  Of course, there is always a protective exception to that if such increase is beyond the capacity of the person making the payment.  In my view the time has come for our domestic legislation to provide that on the anniversary each year of the making of a maintenance order an automatic cost of living increase should be applied unless the paying spouse notifies the recipient of the maintenance that he lacks the financial capacity to make such a payment which would leave each party open to go to court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Based on the cost of living index.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Based on the Central <Col N="2010" /> Statistic's Office consumer price index. We should have done that a long time ago and in doing so we would substantially reduce the number of court applications for variation applications and at the same time we would probably reduce some of the pressures on the Government law centres who frequently act in regard to such applications in District Courts.  That is a practical proposal which would be relevant to domestic legislation and would also be relevant in the context of the difficulty that arises when spouses live in different jurisdictions.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to delay the House by engaging in repetition.  The Minister set out well the intent of the legislation.  It may have a simple intent but it is complex and technical and, of course, its contents are largely dictated by the words of the convention contained in it.  There is little this House can do by way of amending this Bill in so far as it implements provisions consequent on the 1989 Accession Convention and the Lugano Convention.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister refer to our relationship with the United States with whom we do extensive trading?  He referred to the enforcement of maintenance orders in the United Nations Convention.  We have large commercial relationships with the United States and I think I am correct in saying that, in the context of reciprocal enforcement of judgments, the same type of sophisticated legal arrangements that exist between countries in the EC do not exist between here and the United States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>This has always amazed me and it is an indication of our lack of initiative in such areas.  What we are doing today is the result of something which happened at EC level and not a result of our own initiative.  In the context of the important commercial relationships we have with the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, all of which are common law countries and operate a judicial and legal system similar to ours, it is amazing that simplified arrangements for the mutual recognition of our court orders are not in place. <Col N="2011" /> Before Deputy McDowell tells me that recognised systems are in place under common law and the international rules of law, I am aware of that and I accept that we can make applications in foreign courts to implement our judgments. However, there is much to be said for putting in place a treaty which would at least embody other countries with whom we have substantial trading relationships, who have common law jurisdictions and with whom we could implement simplified procedures for the mutual recognition and enforcement of judgments which would be of great benefit in the commercial field.  In regard to family law matters, it would be particularly beneficial for us to have special arrangements in place with the United States.  Before having to be kicked, as it were, by other member states in the EC, perhaps the Minister might take the initiative and examine this matter during his term in office with a view to putting the necessary treaty arrangements and legislation in place between here and the countries I mentioned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a confession to make.  When the Whips conferred on the time to be made available for the passage of this Bill and indicated that it was proposed to deal with it in one day, I objected on the basis that, in principle, the House should be given adequate time in which to consider matters of such complexity. However, I regret that objection now and as far as I am concerned I will not be tendering amendments on Committee or Report Stages.  Even if the order of the House does not allow us to deal with all Stages today &mdash; although it might be unfair to other Members who may have taken another view &mdash; as far as the Progressive Democrats and I are concerned the remaining Stages can be taken without debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill. I agree with Deputy Shatter's view that it is regrettable that even relatively uncontroversial matters in relation to party politics in this House take so long to go through the period of gestation <Col N="2012" /> from our originally conceiving &mdash; if I may use that term &mdash; the international law obligation in question to ratification in Irish law.</P>
    <P>A significant number of changes seem to have been made to the Brussels Convention and I would like the Minister to deal with those amendments and say how they will affect this Bill.  For example, some features of Article 5 of the convention which is annexed to the Bill mystify me.  Does the convention cover libel suits being brought in Ireland in relation to libels which occur here regardless of where the publication was originally printed or disseminated?  Article 5.3 states that a person may be sued in another state in matters relating to tort, delict or quasi-delict, in the courts for the place where the harmful event occurred.  If publication takes place in Ireland by disseminating a document here, can an Irish person sue <i>Paris Match</i> or <i>Time</i> magazine &mdash; assuming they are based in a convention country &mdash; and have a judgment made here against such publication?  If that is the case, it is a great step forward and people will be wary about what they print about Irish people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is the position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Directors of companies are sometimes directed under Irish companies legislation to make compensation to companies in circumstances where they have been in breach of their director's duty.  It is not clear under Irish law whether that amounts to a tort or whether it is merely a compensatory jurisdiction under our company law which does not amount to the commission of a tort.  If a foreign director of an Irish company loots the company, makes improvident contracts or enriches himself unfairly at the expense of the company's creditors and such a company ends up being wound up, is an Irish court order requiring him to reimburse money to the company capable, under sections 197 and 198 of the Companies Act, 1963, of enforcement abroad under Article 5, paragraphs 3 or 4?  Would the Minister enlighten me in that regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2013" /> Another frequent problem for practitioners in relation to contracts is that jurisdiction is vested in the courts in the place where the performance of the obligation in question must be carried out. There are different rules internationally in relation to the contractual obligation to pay.  Under Irish and English law the obligation to pay is regarded as being one which lies to be discharged at the payee's address.  In other words, payment must be made to the payee at his place of residence, whereas under continental systems the position is the opposite.  The obligation to pay is applicable where the person making the payment lives.  In other words, somebody must present themselves to that person and make a demand.</P>
    <P>The Irish courts interpret the Brussels Convention as giving an Irish creditor under a contract the right to sue here because he is not being paid here, whereas courts in some continental countries take a different view and consider the obligation to pay to be only where the debtor resides and jurisdiction is conferred in those circumstances.  I ask the Minister and his Department to raise this issue with the competent authorities under the Convention and the high contracting parties to it to achieve some clarity for practitioners.  The Irish courts take the view that the obligation to pay is at the place of address of the creditor, whereas under continental systems the obligation to payment is at the debtor's address.  There appears to be a different legal treatment of that aspect of Article 5, paragraph 1.</P>
    <P>I now refer to trademark law.  I welcome the fact that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has written to me indicating that the Government proposes to adopt and take over the Private Members' Bill on trade mark law which I tabled and will proceed with it as though it were its own draft Bill.  The Government will preserve its structure and content as far as possible while pushing it through under its aegis.</P>
    <P>In relation to road accident cases it used to be the case that one could sue where the accident took place or where <Col N="2014" /> the person responsible lived.  If I were involved in a car accident in Spain and injured a Spanish person, under Article 5.3 I could be sued in Spain and would be liable for the damage I caused there. Alternatively it is open to a Spanish person to come to Ireland to avail of more generous compensation principles and sue me here in the High Court and obtain increased damages over that which he or she might obtain in Spain. Would the Minister indicate if it is the case that I could still be sued in Ireland by a Spaniard who comes here, even though Article 5.3 provides his or her local court with perfectly competent jurisdiction to deal with the case in Spain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it would not obligate him or her to do that, but the unfortunate position arises that people can effectively choose between wholly different principles of compensation and wholly different compensation levels and that seems somewhat unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Under traditional Irish law an Irish person resident here in those circumstances would always have been suable here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes and this obviously would not change anything in that regard.  I am making the point that a decision can be made by a person's lawyers which affects the level of compensation awards by forum shopping and that is ridiculous.  If I knocked down a child in Spain while on holidays I do not see why that child should be awarded higher damages because I live in Ireland than if a Spaniard living in the apartment next door to mine were responsible.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shatter stated that perhaps we should take a similar initiative to that of the United States regarding the enforceability of court orders between common law jurisdictions.  I do not know if it would make sense for Ireland unilaterally to go to common law jurisdictions and seek to conclude a separate convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2015" /> I do not know if Ireland and Britain would be in agreement on that.  Perhaps some agreement would be reached in this regard between high contracting parties to this convention <i>en bloc</i>.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>An EC-based convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>On an EC basis. I would be slightly wary and I know Deputy Shatter would probably agree with me in this regard.  I do not want some Louisiana jury to award $1 million against me on some pretext and find that as a result of some enlightened action by the Minister I would be liable to pay it and it would be enforced against me in Ireland.  There must be some form of mutual understanding between the parties as to the principles of compensation that apply.  Representative actions or actions for punitive or exemplary damages on the American scale are measures we could not live with on the basis of mutually enforceable decrees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would the Minister agree that even punitive damages which might arise, for example, in assault or libel cases or in some other form of action which are acknowledged in the court order and proceedings to be a claim for punitive damages, are enforceable under this convention?  It seems that the principle was not to make punitive damages internationally enforceable.  It seems to me that a query exists as to whether our Constitution would permit awards of punitive damages to be made by foreign courts against Irish citizens and not to allow the Irish citizen to resist that in any way.  There is justice in making compensation and tort damages, which are designed to be compensatory, generally mutually enforceable when it comes to court orders.  I cannot see the logic that people should be entitled to enforce punitive style damages such as are sometimes awarded by the Irish courts, especially when there is no uniformity between the courts of the high contracting parties as to the circumstances in which punitive damages are awarded.  I will be interested to hear the Minister deal with that issue <Col N="2016" /> because I believe there might be a constitutional landmine in this regard.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister wholeheartedly for introducing this measure and I reiterate that the quicker this legislation is enacted, the better.  As far as I am concerned, since I do not propose tabling amendments to the Bill, the remaining Stages of the Bill may be debated as a matter of course.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the two previous speakers I also welcome this Bill and indicate my party's support for it and I express the hope that the legislation before us will be the first of many legislative measures that will emanate from the Department of Equality and Law Reform.  The Minister has already signalled other items of legislation which he expects will be before us in the not too distant future.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that this is essentially technical legislation giving effect to the extension to the Brussels Convention and the Lugano Convention.  Deputy Michael McDowell is perhaps being ambitious in expecting that he might be tabling amendments to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>No, to the Bill section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not got that far and I wonder whether there would be much merit in doing that given the effect that essentially we are merely rubber stamping conventions and amendments to conventions that have already been agreed.  We will be dealing increasingly with legislation in this kind of manner where conventions and international agreements are negotiated in the first instance and are then presented here to the House &mdash; in some cases many years later &mdash; for their approval.  I question whether that is the best way to deal with this kind of issue.  For example, this is a Second Stage debate where we are expected to address the general principles of the Bill.  It is difficult to address the general principles of an issue that has already been agreed and where it is simply a question of saying yea or nay to <Col N="2017" /> the legislation.  As it happens, the legislation before us is not contentious but as the years progress we may have conventions or agreements presented to this House for ratification that may not be as uncontentious as this measure.</P>
      <P>Would it not be more productive to debate the issues of substance contained in these conventions at a more advanced stage before commitments have been entered into and before they have been negotiated.  Title VI of the Maastricht Treaty, dealing with provision for co-operation in the fields of justice and home affairs, provides a new dimension to our membership of the European Community, which received little attention during the public debate here on the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty and the referendum which approved the treaty.  It contains a whole range of areas where agreement is to be entered into at intergovernmental level and where co-operation is to be encouraged at intergovernmental level in the judicial and home affairs area which will inevitably give rise either to agreements and conventions of the formal type now before us or perhaps agreements at intergovernmental level which may never come before this House for ratification.</P>
      <P>We must have a mechanism in the Legislature whereby the general principles of those issues which are being discussed at intergovernmental level are debated in this House before they are discussed at intergovernmental level and before commitments are entered into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to this legislation, there is a number of points which I would like the Minister to refer to when replying. One of these is the question of when the legislation will come into operation.  As I understand it, it is a mechanism whereby Irish citizens who have been offended in some way can take an action against people who, for example, have absconded to Spain and who are avoiding litigation here or the effects of litigation. Will it be possible, for example, for somebody who has a grievance here to pursue it through the Irish courts even though the issue had arisen before the enactment of this legislation?  May that be enforced <Col N="2018" /> under the arrangements we are enacting here?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy mean would it have retrospective effect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I am aware of the argument generally made concerning retrospective effect but let us take the case, for example, of an employee whose employer did not pay him wages for a period of time and who then goes to Spain and cannot be sued in the normal way. Let us assume the problem arose one or two years ago.  In the normal course of events if that person were still resident here it would be open to the employee concerned to pursue that person in the courts and perhaps obtain an award against his employer even though the problem may have arisen a couple of years ago.  Will it now be possible under this legislation for a case such as that to be pursued and enforced in the country where the former employer is now resident even though this legislation is only being passed here today?  In other words, if it can be enforced in Ireland can it be enforced in Spain of elsewhere?  I would like some clarification from the Minister in relation to that.</P>
      <P>The second area I wish to refer to concerns the issue of maintenance orders and the Bill that the Minister has promised is forthcoming to deal with the wider issue of the enforcement of maintenance orders and the ratification and the accession to the 1956 United Nations Convention.  Both of these measures are referred to in the White Paper on Marital Breakdown.  As I understand it, they are referred to as the type of legislation which would have to be put in place in advance of a referendum on divorce.  The Government has promised that a referendum on divorce will be held.  I understand that this referendum will be held in June 1994.  If the referendum is to be held on that date obviously the various pieces of legislation will have to be put in place relatively quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that the Minister is not very long in office and many matters obviously require his attention, but I <Col N="2019" /> would have thought that our accession to the EC Maintenance Convention and the 1956 UN Convention would have required mainly technical legislation, the substance of which would already have been drafted and put in place.  I wonder why the opportunity has not been availed of in this legislation to provide for our accession to those Conventions.  Reference to the Bill before us and the promised legislation in relation to our accession to the EC Maintenance Convention and the 1956 UN Convention is made in virtually the same paragraphs of the White Paper on Marital Breakdown. Why did the Minister not avail of this opportunity to wrap up all these issues and put the legislation in place?  As I said, I expect that such legislation would be mainly of a technical nature and would not require a great deal of policy consideration on the part of the Government. In any event the Government is already committed in the White Paper on Marital Breakdown to the introduction of such legislation.</P>
    <P>The final point I wish to make relates to citizens who wish to obtain redress through this legislation.  In his speech the Minister &mdash; he has made similar references on previous occasions &mdash; referred to the practical difficulties involved in enforcement of court orders and obtaining legal aid.  In regard to any citizen, particularly poor citizens, wishing to obtain their rights through the courts in this jurisdiction, not to mention the enforcement of court orders outside this jurisdiction, the first and most painful problem they encounter is the cost and the potential risk involved. It is virtully impossible for poor people to get their rights through the Irish courts.  We have a very unequal system of access to our courts.  Reference has been made on a number of occasions in this House to the disgraceful situation which exists in regard to access to civil legal aid, the long waiting periods before one can even get an appointment with a lawyer in the civil legal aid scheme.  This means that we can pass all the legislation we want &mdash; and it may be of great comfort to somebody who has the wherewithal to <Col N="2020" /> pursue an action in this jurisdiction to know that they can ultimately enforce it against someone who is living in Marbella &mdash; but there will be little consolation for someone who cannot even initiate the simplest of legal actions due to a lack of resources.</P>
    <P>The most critical need in the law reform area is the need to extend the civil legal aid scheme and ensure that sufficient funds are made available.  The £100,000 which has been promised is really only a drop in the ocean and in many respects will serve to undermine the staff already working in the civil legal aid scheme.  There is a critical need to properly staff and fund our civil legal aid scheme so that people, particularly poor people, can have access to the courts and have their rights vindicated in the courts in the way provided for in law.</P>
    <P>As I said, I support the legislation and I assure the Minister of my co-operation in having it enacted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the points made by Deputy Shatter towards the end of his contribution &mdash; I only came into the Chamber at that stage.  It is not much good if we introduce Bills which are good in theory but which leave much to be desired in practice.  Deputy Shatter referred to the enforcement of maintenance orders.  Deputy Gilmore referred to a deserted spouse who may receive maintenance of only £20, £40 or £60 per week.  It is not very practical for a woman in this position to chase her spouse around Europe, presumably with the assistance of our civil legal aid scheme or the legal aid scheme in another jurisdiction, in an effort to obtain more money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that Deputy Shatter has much more experience in this area, but I wish to refer to a case which occurred in my constituency a few months ago.  A woman who had been deserted by her husband got 48 hours' notice of his intention to return from England to kidnap her children.  When this woman sought an appointment at the free legal aid centre in Mayo she was informed that she could be given an appointment in one month's <Col N="2021" /> time.  Accordingly, she had to consult a private lawyer about her rights.  This woman, who was absolutely destitute, was not receiving social welfare as she had only returned from England.  Fortunately, a solicitor in private practice, who took on her case in the full knowledge that no remuneration would be received, obtained the necessary interim and final injunctions for this woman.</P>
    <P>I question the possibility of the reciprocal enforcement of maintenance orders in such circumstances when resources are not made available to our free legal aid centres.  I have read that £1 million is being made available for solicitors in private practice who take on such cases. One has to recognise that the legal profession in the main has done tremendous social type work without any recognition or remuneration.  The time has come for the Minister &mdash; I know he has looked at this issue &mdash; to make more resources available to our free legal aid scheme to ensure that spouses have quick recourse to our courts so that their rights can be fully vindicated.</P>
    <P>This House has already passed the Jurisdiction of Courts and Enforcement of Judgments (European Communities) Act, 1988.  The Judgments Convention is a Community convention for the purposes of Article 220 of the Treaty of Rome.  Its object is to create a form of unified law district throughout the European Community whereby on the one hand leave to serve proceedings out of the jurisdiction will no longer be necessary and on the other there will be simplified enforcement procedures in respect of judgments given by the courts of contracting states.  At present all member states, with the exception of Spain and Portugal, are parties to the convention. This Bill will enable Ireland to ratify the convention providing for the accession of Spain and Portugal to the convention. It will also enable Ireland to ratify two international conventions.  It will give effect to the Lugano Convention, a so-called parallel convention, which is almost the same as the Judgments Convention save that the European Court in Luxembourg has not been given any <Col N="2022" /> jurisdiction in relation to this latter convention.</P>
    <P>The effect of the Lugano Convention is that the EFTA countries will operate a similar system so that in practical terms the Judgment Convention will shortly begin to apply to virtually the whole of western Europe.  It is important to be reminded that the scope of the convention is confined only to civil and commercial matters.  These are terms derived from civil law concepts and do not necessarily equate with our own conceptions of these terms.  In effect, matters pertaining to public law and criminal law are excluded from the scope of the convention. The Act further excludes revenue, customs, administrative matters, social security and arbitration, bankruptcies and winding up and the status or legal capacity of natural persons, rights and property arising from matrimonial relationships, wills and succession.</P>
    <P>The question has to be asked whether further progress should be made to ensure that some of these practical day-to-day matters that affect our lives should not also be the subject of conventions with enforcement rights.  As I understand it, this means that lump sum orders made by foreign courts in relation to matrimonial property cannot be enforced <i>via</i> convention procedures.  Accordingly, on the face of it the Bill appears to be very limited in regard to the enforcement of reciprocal rights.  However, it will be of assistance to persons doing business in this country with foreign customers in so far as debtors resident in any of the affected countries cannot avoid their responsibility as they did in the past.  I have come across cases where small firms have had their fingers burned when dealing with foreign business people who took advantage of complicated and long drawn out legal proceedings in this country to avoid their responsibility to discharge lawful debts due to Irish firms. Many small operators know how difficult it was in the past, particularly in the sale of agriculture and aquaculture products, to collect debts especially from French firms with which they were dealing.  We have also heard of the complicated procedures <Col N="2023" /> an injured party would have to go through in countries such as Spain and Portugal following a car accident.  This Bill will facilitate persons or firms in enforcing judgments obtained and will not allow frontier borders to prevent or prohibit the enforcement of judgments.</P>
    <P>We have all come across deserted spouses who have been left dependent on the State.  This Bill provides that maintenance proceedings can be initiated in the jurisdiction of the woman.</P>
    <P>Since joining the EC in 1973 Ireland has obtained many benefits.  We must also assume our responsibilities with the force of law.  There is now free movement of persons and goods.  This Bill is a step towards harmonisation of arrangements between European partners.</P>
    <P>This Bill is very technical but it substantially eases right of access to our courts for injured parties.  Due to the free movement of persons and goods there is greater contact with European people. It is imperative that our procedures are updated to permit ease of access to our courts.  We must ensure that procedures are simplified and are not costly.  This imperative is reflected in the Bill.  One must make only an <i>ex parte</i> application, which is expeditious and does not cost much.  The fact that we have specific enforcement of judgments &mdash; and commercial organisations are well aware of it &mdash; might explain the relatively small number of requests for enforcement of judgments made in the Irish courts.  I understand that fewer than 100 such applications were made since 1988 when the legislation was passed.</P>
    <P>The convention proceeds on foot of a presumption in favour of the enforceability of all foreign judgment and convention cases.  The courts take the view that the non-enforceability of such judgments is very much the exception rather than the rule.  The basic structure of the convention favours a cheap and expeditious mechanism where foreign judgments may be enforced.  This Bill internationalises justice for all our citizens. I commend the Minister for introducing <Col N="2024" /> the Bill and I expect to see it enacted quickly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms F. Fitzgerald Ms F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this complex technical Bill.  It is an important Bill and I congratulate the Minister on introducing it.</P>
      <P>Irish judgments in civil and commercial matters will be enforceable in Spain and Portugal and throughout the EFTA countries.  It will mean that we can reciprocate enforcement of judgments in this country from the countries mentioned. This should mean simpler and speedier arrangements for those who have got judgments.</P>
      <P>I welcome the internationalisation of the law as seen in this Bill.  The furthering of uniformity of standards and arrangements will help all who seek justice.  The type of arrangement we see detailed in the Bill should increase confidence in the law and give some solace to people who have obtained judgments in our jurisdiction but who were unable to seek enforcement of those judgments if a company or a person had left the jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>People are often overwhelmed by the law, by the cost, the complexity, the difficulties in enforcement and the difficulties of access.  They then lose confidence in and respect for the law. This is very bad for our democracy because respect for our laws is an essential component of respect for and belief in democracy.  Justice should not have borders.  The more the principles of this Bill can be extended the more respect for the law will develop.</P>
      <P>This Bill will benefit people in business and in their private lives.  In the long-term this should help business relationships and where difficulties emerge we should be able to get a quicker solution to them. The Bill will also mean that the weaker party can commence proceedings in his or her jurisdiction if, for example, a company has moved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maintenance enforcement has been touched on by several Deputies.  This is an important area and I welcome the sections dealing with this.  The whole area of maintenance enforcement has been a source of great personal distress for many <Col N="2025" /> individuals, particularly women.  I hope the envisaged harmonisation in the law will reduce this distress and that maintenance orders given in one country will be enforced in another with minimum fuss.  I agree that extending the net is not the only action needed to make this procedure more efficient, less costly and less stressful.</P>
    <P>What we see in this Bill is an example of the sort of co-operation which greater unity in Europe can bring.  It is a practical example of that, although in order for the information in this Bill to trickle down it will need a little work.  I hope the Department will produce some sort of explanatory memorandum which could be sent out to free legal aid centres, the AIM group for family law reform or various other groups working in this area. In terms of access to information that will be very helpful.</P>
    <P>When our citizens see what should be in essence the very practical application of this Bill it will increase respect for European co-operation.  We would like to see an extension of co-operation beyond Europe to the US and to New Zealand, where we do not have this type of arrangement.</P>
    <P>This Bill raises the whole question of access to the law.  The law here is inaccessible to far too many people.  The lack of free legal aid, the waiting lists and so on mean that it is difficult for people to get basic information about the law.  I spoke to the AIM group about this. They have produced a series of information leaflets and they could do one in this area.  To ensure that people have information about the law is the first step in ensuring that the law is working for people.  Too many people find it very difficult to get basic information on how the law can protect them and on how it can be accessible to them in the difficult personal circumstances in which they often find themselves.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister would agree &mdash; we discussed this matter last week &mdash; when we debated the Estimates for the Minister's Department &mdash; that if people are to benefit under the provisions of <Col N="2026" /> this legislation we must ensure they have access to the law and that the information is clear and readily available.  I have made a suggestion to the Minister in this regard and I hope that he will be able to act on it.  Theoretical rights are one thing but practical rights require more work if they are to be meaningful.</P>
    <P>Like my colleagues, I welcome this Bill, which will be of help in the areas I have mentioned.  On the issue of maintenance, I ask the Minister to take on board some of the suggestions made by my colleague, Deputy Shatter, in relation to the variation of maintenance orders and linking such orders to the cost of living index.  The various groups who help people in this area waste a great deal of time in trying to ensure that maintenance orders are enforced and are appropriate, having regard to the circumstances of the people involved.  Those are the main points I wish to make and I congratulate the Minister again on introducing the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Fitzgerald, I compliment the Minister on introducing what is complex legislation.  It is most desirable that it be implemented into law.</P>
      <P>When one considers the history of this legislation and recalls the tortuous process of endeavouring to get the member states to bring their legislation into line, this is a major step forward which will probably not be fully appreciated until people reap the benefits in the years to come.  I agree with Deputy Fitzgerald when she says that there will be a need to provide comprehensive information on family planning etc. to advisory groups and support agencies so that they will be familiar with the ways in which injured parties can benefit under the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The history of this legislation dates back to the 1968 Brussels Convention when the original six members of the European Community recognised that there was a need for them to have a common purpose.  In 1978 provision was made in the Accession Convention for Ireland, Denmark and the United Kingdom to adhere to the 1968 Convention. In 1988 the conventions and the <Col N="2027" /> Protocol were incorporated into Irish law with the result that Irish judgments covered by the conventions were enforceable in the other nine member states.</P>
    <P>In regard to commercial matters it is absolutely essential, as we rapidly move towards the point where I hope the Maastricht Treaty will be endorsed by all member states, that in the large free and open market protection is provided.  The downside could be in the field of commerce in regard to patents, labelling, quality, uniformity of product and weights and measures, unless adequate legislation is introduced in member states and there is potential for enforcement. For this reason it is most desirable that the Bill has a speedy passage through the House so that we can avail of the benefits to be gained following its enactment. Given the multiplicity of languages and peculiar market traditions, it will be a difficult task to ensure uniformity.  I hope that in implementing the legislation detailed information will be provided to manufacturers and, more importantly, that their rights in other European Community markets will be protected.</P>
    <P>One of the advantages is that there will be a quantum leap on the civil side.  I agree with those who say that the Minister for Equality and Law Reform is faced with a demanding and difficult challenge. The availability of resources will dictate the speed at which he will be able to move forward.  This is the first Bill to be introduced on foot of the White Paper on Marital Breakdown.  There will be a need for speedy action on a number of other fronts, in particular in regard to legislation dealing with the family home.</P>
    <P>All of us have been visited by unfortunate constituents seeking guidance and assistance who were entitled to maintenance and support but which was not forthcoming because their spouse had moved to another country.  I hope that issue will be addressed speedily under this legislation.  In that regard I agree with Deputy Shatter when he says that there is a need to find a simplistic and easy but rational and reasonable way of calculating maintenance, taking inflation <Col N="2028" /> and other important aspects into account to ensure equity, and a fair transfer of resources to injured parties.</P>
    <P>The Minister has shown that he is committed and determined to ensure that there is equality in the shortest possible time on a number of fronts.  This is a major step forward at a time when we are likely to see people travel throughout the European Community in greater numbers due to low cost air travel.  As we are aware, many of our young people, some of whom had good jobs here at home, have moved abroad to seek employment opportunities.  In many respects the European Community is virtually a village in the sense that it is easier to travel to Germany than to Cork or Galway.  I have no doubt that this trend will continue, but many difficulties will arise as a result.  For example, people may fail to live up to their responsibilities in certain areas.  For this reason I hope the Bill will have a speedy passage.</P>
    <P>Having read the explanatory memorandum, I believe the Minister has covered all aspects of the matter.  The legislation is in keeping with what has been agreed in the Lugano Convention and, more recently, in the provisions of the San Sebastian Convention which more or less gave effect to the technical amendments of the 1968 Convention. Therefore, it has taken since 1968 until now to bring about conformity and the implementation in law in this jurisdiction of what is most desirable on two very important fronts.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, I compliment the Minister on the introduction of this Bill.  I look forward to its going on the Statute Book and the necessary information and statutory detail supplied to the various agencies, in the commercial and civil sectors, so that there will be real advantages and equity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Members, I welcome the introduction of this Bill and wish it a speedy and effective passage through the House.  Its provisions are progressive and necessary <i>vis-à-vis</i> maintenance orders, which have been referred to by other speakers.  In relation to maintenance <Col N="2029" /> orders, I hope that the provisions of this Bill will not be used by another Government Department as a means of delaying decisions, which can also happen.  As in the case of applicants for one parent's allowance, for example &mdash; when an individual's means may be very slim indeed when, under the provisions of the ordinary, domestic legislation, an applicant is required to make reasonable attempts to identify the location of the erring party and so on &mdash; the one aspect about which I worry is that applications could be put on the proverbial long finger resulting from legislation introduced to help and assist in such circumstances.</P>
      <P>I have advised many people, women in 99 per cent of cases, to devote more time to obtaining their rights under existing legislation and then to deal with the secondary aspect of identifying the location of the erring party when they have sufficient financial resources.</P>
      <P>We must all welcome the provisions of this Bill for the business and commercial sector.  Most Members of this House will, in recent times, have had the experience of a constituent bringing to their attention the fact that a runaway businessman or woman has vanished from this jurisdiction and is now living in some exotic, sometimes erotic location in far-flung, sunny, sandy places&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or sometimes both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or sometimes both, when they appear to scoff and laugh at the unfortunate victims of their exploits, the former being well nigh beyond the reaches of the law in so far as this jurisdiction is concerned, if not well beyond the reach of the law of some of the locations and havens to which they may have flown.  The sad thing about it &mdash; and this still obtains in the financial area &mdash; is that some countries almost welcome an intruder who comes bearing somewhat dubious financial burdens for placement in a secret, safe hideaway which will yield a good return in due course.  I am sure the Minister knows quite to what I refer although I do not have a specific case in mind.  Of course, the result is a destabilising <Col N="2030" /> effect on the business and financial life not of one country within Europe only but on the entire European structure resulting from the perceived success of people who invest ill-gotten or so-called hot gains in secret or numbered bank accounts, in far away places.  I hope the provisions of this Bill will also be of some benefit in countering that practice.</P>
      <P>One or two areas have been excluded from the relevant conventions.  In his introductory remarks, the Minister said that these include matters of an explicitly criminal nature, revenue, customs and administrative matters, status issues, social security and arbitration.  One can readily recognise some of those issues as being beyond the provisions of the relevant conventions and so on.  I wonder whether there are offences, not necessarily readily recognisable as criminal offences, which could mature into or ultimately become criminal offences.  How will offences be dealt with under the provisions of the Bill?</P>
      <P>The other area to which I wanted to refer is insurance, an interesting one, which will become even more interesting as markets are freed up since, the more freedom prevailing within the markets, the more difficult it will be to monitor or keep a tab on all the likely happenings. The invention of the computer was a godsend to the financial services but it also caused headaches.</P>
      <P>It is amazing that, on the one hand, the computer has been a boon while, on the other it has led to a ready escape route for unscrupulous people.  I hope that the provisions of this Bill will provide the means to trace and punish them for their crimes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also referred to contracts and consumer law in his introductory remarks.  This is another area which, with the opening of the internal market and the broader base of contracts likely to arise in future, will present greater opportunity for exploitation.  The day is long gone when the furthest point for the supply of goods and services from rural areas was to Dublin, Cork or perhaps Belfast and London.  That base now extends to Bonn, Amsterdam, Brussels, <Col N="2031" /> Paris and elsewhere.  In a certain overseas television programme, which I presume is still being shown, there were indications that business people in another jurisdiction were less than attentive to the finer detail of commitments to their consumers and in relation to contracts which they had no intention of honouring good, bad or indifferent.  A certain blonde-haired lady used to present that programme, I presume she still does.  Its contents brought to our attention that a group of shady dealers managed to con people into believing implicitly in what they were selling or saying.  They were only found out after considerable time had elapsed.  I have seen outrageous exploitations, whereby people entered into contracts with consumers &mdash; in other words, they sold something or proposed to sell something, or had given an indication as to the delivery of goods or services &mdash; and failed to deliver.  I hope that practice will be stamped out under the provisions of this Bill.  Like other legislation we are often sure at the time of its introduction that it will resolve the problems in respect of which it has been introduced but it does not always work that way.  I hope that the provisions of this Bill will be sufficiently broad to encompass vagabonds who perpetrated those kinds of activities over the years and that there will be no necessity to come back to the House in a few years time to improve the legislation.</P>
    <P>It is very irritating for business people to see on television, hear on the radio or read in the newspaper, reports of the present life style of someone who for business reasons had to leave the country in a hurry &mdash; especially when he does not seem to want for anything &mdash; for sunshine and all that goes with it.  I hope the introduction of this legislation will remove that irritant and will ensure that people who have a tendency to go down that road will be a little more careful in their dealings with their customers and be more conscious of their duties to their business associates.  I hope the existence of this legislation will act as a damper so <Col N="2032" /> that we will not have as many hideaway millionaires as at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Taylor, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, on introducing this Bill.  The Bill provides for the incorporation into Irish law of the Lugano Convention of 1988 and the San Sebastian Convention of 1989 and, as a result, judgments in Irish civil and commercial law will be enforceable in the areas designated, as well as in Spain and Portugal and the six European Free Trade Association countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The genesis of this legislation goes back to 1968 when the Brussels Convention of that year provided speedy procedures for enabling judgments in the six founding member states of the European Communities to be recognised throughout the Community.  In 1971 a Protocol provided for the interpretation of the Brussels Convention by the European Court of Justice.  In 1978, we had the Accession Convention which provided for Ireland, Denmark and the United Kingdom to adhere to the 1968 Convention. Another Accession Convention of 1982 provided for Greece to adhere to the 1968 Convention.  In 1988 the Jurisdiction of Courts and Enforcement of Judgments (European Communities) Act provided for the incorporation of previous conventions and Protocols into Irish law.  The result was that the Irish judgments covered by the convention became enforceable in nine of the EC states and <i>vice versa</i>.  The Lugano Convention of 1988 provided for the reciprocal enforcement of civil and commercial judgments between countries in the EC and the six members of the European Free Trade Association, namely Austria, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland and, as I said, the San Sebastian Convention of 1989 provided for Spain and Portugal to adhere to the 1968 Brussels Convention and some technical amendments of the 1968 Convention.  In a recent High Court case the judgment was not enforceable because it was discovered that some aspects of Irish law <Col N="2033" /> were not in conformity with European law.</P>
    <P>The main features of this Bill apply to civil and commercial matters only, including maintenance orders, and does not include Revenue, Customs or administrative matters, the status or legal capacity of persons, property rights arising from marriage, wills, succession, bankruptcy, insolvency, social security and arbitration.  It provides that a defendant must generally be sued in the country where he or she is domiciled.  However, there are some exceptions, for example, an insurance policy holder may sue in the country where he or she is domiciled as can a consumer who is party to a contract for the sale of goods or supply of services, as well as a maintenance creditor.  Matters relating to tort can be dealt with in a court in the place where the damage occurred and matters relating to contracts may go to court in the place where the contract is performed.  Actions regarding land, except certain short-term tenancies, are also to be heard in the country where the land is located.  This Bill provides that the courts of another contracting state are generally obliged to enforce a relevant judgment of another contracting state with some exceptions, for example, where the judgment is contrary to public policy or where the defendant is not given notice of the proceedings.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a speedy enforcement procedure.  In Ireland this is carried out by the Master of the High Court.  This is a technical Bill which is necessitated by our membership of the Community.  It is appropriate that we will be able to update our laws to take account of changes that have taken place.  It is ridiculous that we could not enforce penalties for the use of angel dust because it was found in court that the State did not have the right under EC law to enforce it.  When the State is seen to be negligent because it has not tidied up its laws it is appropriate&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">

      <P>On a point of order, I wonder if the Minister will do me the luxury of preparing a script when we have legislation such as this in the same way <Col N="2034" /> as clearly he has prepared one for the Deputy who is now speaking.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Shatter would not be aware of where I received my briefing. I am perfectly entitled to make a contribution in this House, as indeed is any other Member.  As I said on a previous occasion when Deputy Shatter interrupted me, we are not all privileged to have the resources of the Four Courts available to us when we need back-up in this House.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that a Minister from the Labour Party is bringing forward this legislation.  It is essential that this Bill is introduced in order to ensure a coherent approach to the international recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters.  It is appropriate that as a rightful member of the European Community the State carries out its legislative role and I am sorry if Deputy Shatter considers he is the only Member who can make a contribution in this House on any subject on which he seems to specialise.  Thankfuly we have the right to free speech, the right to make representations and the right to make contributions in this House.  Members have the right to be informed on legislative proposals.  I, as the Labour Party Chief Whip, have the responsibility to speak in this House.  I intend to speak whether Deputy Shatter considers this a matter on which to raise a point of order or not, or that his own sources of information do not allow him to make a proper contribution.</P>
      <P>Having said that, let me congratulate the Minister for Equality and Law Reform on bringing forward this technical Bill.  During the Whips meetings there was unanimity that this Bill would be brought forward as expedituously as possible and I am delighted to be associated with its passage through this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>As has been said by other speakers, this is a technical Bill.  People such as myself who are not technically <Col N="2035" /> minded find it difficult to understand the contents of the Bill.  However, having studied the Minister's Seanad speech of 29 April and his contribution today, I understand what we are dealing with here.  This Bill enables us to ratify two conventions.  From the first day of the third month after deposit of the instruments of ratification civil judgments and court orders will be enforceable on a reciprocal basis in Spain and Portugal and in the EFTA countries, namely, Austria, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland.  Most people are well aware of the many chancers who make a killing here and then run off to the sunny climes of Spain to enjoy their illgotten gains.  It is not before time that this legislation, which will formally ratify our signature to the agreements, is introduced.  Perhaps when replying the Minister would state whether in the event of other countries joining the EC further legislation will be required &mdash; in the Minister's Seanad speech he referred to the EFTA countries &mdash; whether this legislation will suffice, or whether we will deal with the matter by way of an Order of the House.</P>
      <P>In his speech today the Minister said:</P>
      <P>The impetus behind the original Brussels Convention, which was drawn up in 1968, was to give meaningful effect to Article 220 of the Treaty of Rome.  That Article called on member states to secure &ldquo;the simplification of formalities governing the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments of courts or tribunals&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I read that statement to focus the attention of the House on the simplicity of the manner in which the Treaty of Rome was written &mdash; in a language that ordinary laymen can understand.  Jean Monnet requested that the Treaty of Rome be drafted in a way that would be understood not only by lawyers but by lay people and legal experts had a difficult job drafting it in such a way.  I mention that because sometimes legislation from the European Community is drafted in a way that only lawyers can understand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this legislation which provides <Col N="2036" /> that spouses who flee the country to avoid paying maintenance may be followed for that money.  This measure will be welcomed by people on the receiving end of such trickery and roguery.  I wish the Minister well.  I am glad he has introduced a non-controversial Bill, which all of us agree is necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Members who welcome this Bill.  This is a matter of which many of us who are not lawyers have no great knowledge.  It is a very important matter, especially in the context of a united Europe.  It is not before time that the Lugano Convention of 1988 and the San Sebastián Convention of 1989 were set down in legislation.</P>
      <P>Lay people may ask what this legislation will mean to them.  There is a number of issues with which people will identify, one of which is the following of spouses for maintenance.  All of us are aware of instances where husbands against whom maintenance orders have been made leave the jurisdiction.  This legislation provides that these people may be followed for maintenance. However a problem will arise for spouses in the cost of following these people.  I am sure the Minister and the Government will consider this problem because while such a law is welcome, in practice it must be followed through.  It is important not only for the individuals involved in maintenance cases but also for society that people with means are not allowed avoid their responsibilities.  I am sure the Minister will take cognisance of that fact and ensure that finances and resources are made available for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter of importance to the general public is the pursuing of cases in countries where an offence occurs.  For example, if an offence occurs against an Irish person who has rented a residence abroad to another Irish person the case may be taken here.  That is an important element of this legislation.  This Bill brings our legal system more into line with that in Europe.  This is very important in the context of a united Europe.  I join with other Members in congratulating the Minister on bringing forward <Col N="2037" /> the Bill expeditiously and wish him success in bringing it into operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all Deputies for their constructive contributions on this legislation.  Following a request I wish to assure Deputies that certain aspects of the matter will be re-examined and followed up.  Deputy Shatter asked about the status of the Bill when I received it from the Department of Justice.  A draft was in existence but it was revised and that is now before the House.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shatter referred to the delay in bringing forward the Bill.  Perhaps there has been some delay on our part in acceding to the conventions but, if so, we are not the worst among European countries.  So far as the San Sebastián accession convention is concerned, to date eight countries &mdash; France, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and the UK &mdash; have ratified. The four which have still to deposit their instruments of ratification are Ireland, Germany, Belgium and Denmark. That convention entered into force on 1 January, 1991 after ratification by Spain, France and the Netherlands.  The Lugano Convention only entered into force on 1 January 1992 following the lodgment of instruments of ratification by Switzerland and France.  To date the position is that apart from France only five other EC countries &mdash; Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and the UK &mdash; have ratified.</P>
      <P>A query was raised by Deputy Shatter concerning the matrimonial home Bill. This Bill gave rise to a number of complexities but it is reaching completion and I hope to have it circulated in the current session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Shatter raised the very important question of the tracing of maintenance defaulters through the medium of the Department of Social Welfare. There is no doubt that it is the weak link in the chain.  I take the view that procedures ought to be developed where all appropriate resources of each State &mdash; the police authorities if necessary, social welfare authorities and social security <Col N="2038" /> numbers &mdash; ought to be directed to locating defaulting maintenance debtors. Some years ago it was the proud boast of the British police that they could locate anybody anywhere within 24 hours by using their networks.  That probably does not apply today.  There is no point in having any laws, whether in Ireland or elsewhere, if those who owe and are evading cannot be located and thereby cannot be made to pay up and meet their responsibilities.  I take that point and I will try to ensure as far as possible that all the resources of the State are made available to locate defaulters abroad, of whom there is an increasing number.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter queried the number of applications for maintenance orders.  The information I have been able to obtain at short notice is that approximately 120 maintenance orders were applied for under the 1974 Act.  That includes those emanating from Ireland for enforcement in England and <i>vice versa</i>.  I am informed that under the Jurisdiction of Courts and enforcement of Judgments (European Communities) Act, 1988, approximately 40 applications are made annually to the Master of the High Court.</P>
    <P>The question of the variation of maintenance orders was also raised.  The position appears to be that if the circumstances of the maintenance creditor change, she can obtain a variation order from her local court in Ireland which can be enforced in Spain or wherever. By the same token if the circumstances of the paying party worsen they too could go to their local court and have the enforcement order varied.  I take the point that that presents a difficulty for the spouse in Ireland but equally it presents a problem for the spouse in Spain, if such is the case, in responding to an application for an increase or a variation coming from here.  That is part of the system for mutual enforcement.</P>
    <P>The question of automatic increases being provided for in maintenance orders and being linked to the cost of living index merits careful attention.  When drawing up separation agreements prudent lawyers usually, though not always, provide for automatic increases under the <Col N="2039" /> cost of living index in setting out maintenance payments.  I will examine that issue when we come to review that aspect of family law when the divorce question is out of the way.  There is a number of matters dealing with barring orders, protection orders and the extent to which they will apply.  Perhaps this issue could be taken on board and examined carefully in the context of that legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Michael McDowell raised a number of very interesting and challenging legal questions to which I would not presume, at short notice, to give authoritative responses.  He asked about the case of a person defamed, say, by a Paris journal and whether that person could sue in our courts.  It would appear that Article 5.3 of the Brussels Convention covers that situation and that it gives jurisdiction to our courts.  If any dispute arose at the end of the day concerning the final interpretation it would be a matter for the European Court.  On the question of a Spanish person being injured by an Irish resident either in Spain or here, Article 5 covers that situation. I take the point that it gives rise to the question of choice of forum, as Deputy McDowell rightly put it.  It is an inbuilt part of the system that if choices and rights of enforcement are given, that type of consequence on occasion will be unavoidable.  Ideally there would be a uniform damages position applicable throughout the Community.  Perhaps that position will be achieved in the fullness of time when more uniformity in the law itself is achieved as distinct from the actual procedures and enforcement methods.  At present it appears there would be a choice of forum.  The United States position is an important one.  I would be inclined to agree that if it is to be advanced it should not be done on an Irish unilateral basis: an EC position would be the appropriate one to examine. He raised also the question of punitive damages.  My off-the-cuff view would be that they would be enforceable unless it came within the ambit of being contrary to public policy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore and a number of other <Col N="2040" /> Deputies raised the question of the practical need for implementation of rights through a more effective and well-financed civil legal aid system.  I thoroughly agree with that prospect.  As I said when the Estimates for my Department were being debated at the committee last Friday, this is being given very high priority by me and it will be advanced to the maximum possible extent within budgetary parameters.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore asked if claims commenced before the passing of this Bill could be maintained when it was passed and became an Act.  I would think that once a person was in a position to obtain an order or a judgment in an Irish court, it would be enforceable in the EC or EFTA country concerned, even though the claim would have arisen before the passing of the Act.</P>
    <P>Deputy Durkan said he was anxious lest a deserted wife might have her application for maintenance delayed because she might not know exactly where her husband had gone.  That is a matter for the Minister for Social Welfare and I will consult with him on that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Frances Fitzgerald asked about access and I dealt with that in the context of legal aid.  She raised a very important point in regard to information. I fully support the work of AIM and I will do whatever I can do to spread information about the effects of this legislation and the two conventions being adopted.  That also applied to other important aspects of family law.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take remaining stages today.</P>
    <P>Bill put through Committee and reported without amendment.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the few minutes remaining I would like to thank Deputies Shatter and McDowell for facilitating the passage of all Stages of the Bill.  It is largely a <Col N="2041" /> technical measure but it has many important implications with further downstream developments.</P>
      <P>I will undertake to bring into the House as quickly as possible the other measure that many Deputies referred to and which will probably be known as the Family Law (Recovery of Maintenance) Bill.  It is at an advanced stage and it will have the effect of bringing the number of countries in which the new simplified procedure will apply to some 40 countries worldwide.  That will include Australia and New Zealand.  That new procedure will be much simpler and much speedier and will present even fewer problems for maintenance creditors.  It will be up to the central authority appointed in each state to determine what action should be taken and initiate the necessary legal procedures.  It is a nineties development involving a minimum of expense and putting the responsibility for enforcement and maintenance procedures where it properly belongs, that is, with the State authorities themselves.  The maintenance creditors simply reports the matter to their central authority which then prepares the details of the application. Translations have to be provided and that service will be provided by my Department, which will be the relevant central authority here.  Transmission then takes place to the central authority of the other state and the proceedings are taken from there.</P>
      <P>The United States is not involved in that convention.  That is regrettable because it is a country where we would have need of it.  Perhaps something can be done to get the United States in on convention positions.</P>
      <P>Finally, let me thank the Members again for their contributions, which were appreciated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week's announcement of changes in telephone charges for domestic and overseas users has brought a new level of Orwellian-speak to Government announcements in this country, which is becoming a particular trait of this coalition Government.  We saw its first manifestation with the mantra-like declaration of a &ldquo;partnership&rdquo; Government which has to be uttered by every member of Government, Cabinet member, junior Minister and back-bencher alike, whenever they string even a single sentence together.</P>
      <P>Even when there are deep divisions between Ministers, and between the Government parties everything has to be described as a &ldquo;partnership&rdquo; operation. They sometimes forget that the legal essence of a partnership is that each partner is liable for all the acts and faults of the other whether they are aware of them or agree with them.</P>
      <P>This ludicrous abuse of language of course reached new heights with the announcement by the Minister, Deputy Cowen, of his telephone charge proposals, when increases of up to 400 per cent for an existing service are labelled &ldquo;pro consumer&rdquo;, and are euphemistically summarised as nothing more than a &ldquo;rebalancing&rdquo; exercise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed, the public's outrage at the level of price increases they will face, as both private and business users, is exceeded only by their sense of anger at this blatant attempt to pull the wool over their <Col N="2043" /> eyes, and to confuse and deceive them, by the us of bland PR-jargon, notably by the Minister, Deputy Cowen, and by his colleague at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn.</P>

      <P>Nor, of course, does the misrepresentation end there.  We are also told that the new telephone pricing structures represent the implementation of the Culliton report in relation to telecommunications services in Ireland. This, of course, is wholly inaccurate.  Culliton never recommended any increase in local calls.  Similarly, there is not a line in the entire set of ministerial proposals which tackles the central tenet of Culliton in relation to this matter; namely, the creation of competition in the provision and delivery of telecommunication services and the reduction of Telecom Éireann's costs.</P>
      <P>Last week, after the Minister, Deputy Cowen announced his proposals, I stated on behalf of the Progressive Democrats that while we welcomed the reduction in our totally uncompetitive international telephone charges, the associated increase in domestic charges, which was not consequential, as suggested by the Minister, was completely excessive.  That remains the kernel of our approach to this matter.</P>
      <P>Yes, there are welcome features; most notably the reduction to normal levels of our overseas telephone charges, and also the creation of an effective local call tariff system for the entire island at weekends.</P>
      <P>However, what is notable about the reduction in our international telephone charges is the fact that this is the single area where, of course, Telecom Éireann do face competition, and where, on the Minister's own admission, the company is actually losing revenue because of its uncompetitiveness &mdash; at a growing rate of at least £15 million a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I dare say that if this were not the case, Telecom would have been in no hurry to reduce its international charges to Irish businesses, and other users of the service. <Col N="2044" /> We should take with a high degree of scepticism the pro-user declarations on the part of Telecom, and the Minister, that all of this is being done solely for the benefit of Irish exporters.  It is being done primarily for Telecom's benefit.</P>
    <P>However, it is when we turn to the implications of the new regime on domestic telephone users, for both business and private calls, that the present proposals are seen to be so totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Firstly, let us take the private phone user.  I find it incredible that the Minister has persisted in arguing that the average bill, even after the additional VAT increase, will only increase by 4 per cent. He states this, notwithstanding the fact that, elsewhere, he and Telecom Éireann are agreed that domestic users will face cumulative price rises of over £60 million, £29 million of that from increased VAT charges, and more than £30 million arising directly from the increased cost of calls, where the duration is greater than three minutes.</P>
    <P>Last week, in the Dáil, when replying to a short Adjournment Debate on this topic, the Minister declared that the average domestic subscriber would find an increase of just £3 per bill, even with the increased VAT charges.  I do not believe that the Minister's figures reflect the likely scenario facing the vast majority of the 750,000 private telephone users in the country.</P>
    <P>I suggest that a much more accurate picture of the increased charges, which most people will face from next September, is reflected in a very interesting report in last Sunday's edition of <i>The Sunday Press</i> newspaper.  One of the paper's reporters, William Rocke, had his most recent telephone bill recalculated by Telecom on the basis of the new charges which will apply from September next, and also the further revised charges of April next year, when the VAT rate of telephone bills will go up by a further 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>The figures from that pertinent and timely exercise are most revealing.  They would reflect the experience of the average householder in this country, rather <Col N="2045" /> than the obviously, entirely selective approach of Telecom and the Minister in their PR-pronouncements to date.  Incidentally, Telecom's enormous and illegal advertisements are very costly, and are being paid for by all telephone subscribers.</P>
    <P>Under that exercise, Mr. Rocke's present bill of £70.66 will go to £85.96 from next September, when the new charges, and the first 5 per cent VAT increase, will take effect.  That is an increase of more than £15.00, or 21 per cent plus on the present bill.  When the further 5 per cent increase is applied from April of next year, the same bill would go up by a total of £19.10, compared to its present level, which is a price rise of 27 per cent.</P>
    <P>These are huge increases, and they give the lie to Minister Cowen's PR-sanitised claims of a mere 4 per cent average rise. Of course, in the case of <i>The Sunday Press</i> reporter, Telecom's observation was that it was unfortunate that the person concerned was not making calls to Europe, Australia or America, where he could have saved a great deal of money.  What a stupid and specious argument this is. The reality is that there are hundreds of thousands of domestic telephone users who would have very little reason to make overseas calls.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Telecom and the Minster might as well adopt an attitude of suggesting to telephone users that they get rid of the telephone altogether, and that they would thus save an enormous amount of money.  Their argument is that ridiculous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reality is that, from next September, Ireland will become the second most expensive country in the European Community in which to make a peak-time local call of nine-12 minutes duration. And even for calls up to six minutes, we will be the fourth most expensive country within the Community. Compounding the situation further <Col N="2046" /> is the fact that on top of the charge increases and the VAT rises, we also have to endure the highest line rental charges within the Community, which are exactly 50 per cent dearer than the Community's average.</P>
    <P>Besides the Minister's claim that the average phone bill will only rise by 4 per cent being incredible, his, and Telecom's, assertion that 72 per cent peak time calls within the Republic are of less than three minutes duration does not reflect the experience of anybody I have spoken to about this matter.</P>
    <P>It may be that many unsuccessful phone calls are very short, in the sense that people hang up having been informed that the person they are seeking is not available.  However, it is equally certain that 72 per cent of local call time is not spent on calls of less than three minutes duration.  I would like to know much more about the Telecom survey on which this figure is supposed to be based. I would like to know why it was conducted in the month of December last which, given the extended Christmas holiday period, is bound to have a distorting effect compared with other months of the year.</P>
    <P>Exhortations, too, by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Cowen, and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, to domestic telephone users to alter their calling habits are of little comfort to firms and industrialists who do the bulk of their business here.  The implications of this suggestion are that companies would have to work late at night and at weekends and have to retain staff on costly overtime rates.  They might also be seeking to do business with people who probably would not be available on the other end of the telephone line in any case.</P>
    <P>I would like now to turn to the claims by those two Ministers that the new telephone charges represent the implementation by this partnership Government of the Culliton report in so far as it relates to telecommunications services.  I would remind the Minister that the section in the Culliton report on telecommunications <Col N="2047" /> begins with a commitment to competitiveness and declares that &ldquo;a pro-competitive approach is also in order in the field of telecommunications&rdquo;. The Culliton report goes on to state that &ldquo;the complex question of providing competition for as many of Telecom's services as is feasible, in order to ensure downward pressure on these price levels, should be actively explored&rdquo;.  This urges competition in such areas as the resale of leased lines and the establishment of a proper regulatory framework to control those services which are not open to competition to ensure that they are being provided on a cost effective basis.</P>
    <P>On the other matter of a regulatory authority, it is simply amazing that the Minister relies solely on data provided by Telecom on the impact of major price rises for what most people, both business and private users, now see as an essential service.  Why did the Minister not use outside consultants to examine Telecom's price structures?  Does the close relationship between Telecom and the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications not directly conflict with the European Community's mandate that the operation of telephone companies should be totally separated from their regulation?</P>
    <P>In short, there is no doubt but that the Minister's latest proposals, far from representing the implementation of Culliton, are nothing more than a gross distortion of the most fundamental objective of Culliton in this area, which is the creation of competition in the provision of telephone services here for both private and business users and downward pressure on the cost of those services. The Minister's statements made no reference whatsoever to the installation of competition in this vital area despite the fact that Telecom has already shown plenty of evidence of some of the worst features of State-owned monopolies.  Yet there is nothing in the Minister's pronouncement to indicate anything but that he is entirely happy with the operations of this company and with its management's <Col N="2048" /> performance.  On the contrary, it is evident that this Government is happy to see the company proceed with the expenditure of a further £900 million in capital spending over the next five years on top of the £1 billion debt which it has already accumulated.</P>
    <P>I would remind the Minister and the Irish public generally that this is the same Telecom company and the same Telecom management that presided over the Ballsbridge site debacle, which has now ended up being a £12 million white elephant derelict site.  The people who bought the Ballsbridge site have brought you a 400 per cent increase in charges.  This is also the same Telecom management that saw nothing wrong with paying a fee of £40,000 to an auctioneer for simply driving around the same Ballsbridge site.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder then that Telecom originally proposed to the Minister that he should allow it charge local calls at the rate of 5p per minute?  Clearly this is a management either not in touch with the real world, or who feel so cosseted by its monopoly situation that it does not need to take day-to-day market realities into consideration at all.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, I believe that one of the sorry fruits of this so-called partnership Government is that the Minister, Deputy Cowen, dare not even look at the major organisational defects in Telecom which result in its productivity level being well below that of comparable telephone companies in Europe.  Its operating cost per line are the highest of all telephone companies in the world for which data is available and the company has not developed a proper customer ethos essential to the kind of service operation it is.  Telecom needs a revolution in its culture, in its procedures and in its management approach and none of these will happen while it remains a monopoly supplier and is answerable to such a captive and complaint partnership Government.</P>
    <P>Of course, we will be faced during this debate with the particular irony of the Labour Party, on the one hand, standing four square against any prospect of competition being introduced against Telecom in the provision of telephone services. <Col N="2049" /> while on the other hand it will shed crocodile tears for the hapless consumers faced with these exorbitant increases in telephone charges, whether they are business or private users.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, as this is Private Members' time, I cannot call a quorum in the hope that one or two Labour Deputies might wander into the notoriously empty Labour benches.</P>

I believe it is a safe bet that, come tomorrow evening, those same Labour Deputies will all troop through the lobbies in support of the Minister, Deputy Cowen, and his selective, cynical and excessive telephone price increases.</P>
      <P>Apart completely from the policy aspect of this con job on the public is the disaster that lies in wait for these changes on a legal basis.  The fact that Bord Telecom proposed at the diktat of the Government to effect a deliberate policy of cross-subsidy which involves greatly increasing domestic charges, where Telecom has a monopoly, to reduce international charges, where Telecom, is ineffective competition internationally, raises significant questions of European law and domestic law.  It seems to me to be inevitable that these charges will be successfully challenged in the European Court of Justice.  That court has ruled, under Article 90 of the Treaty of Rome, that state bodies to whom special or exclusive right are given by national laws of a member state cannot use those powers to engage in differential price structures which are not commercially decided and which have the effect of abusing a dominant position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2050" /> I am advised that these new charges if challenged before the European Court of Justice by an aggrieved party, whether a consumer body, a business, or a competitor, will probably: (a) be struck down by the court, (b) become the subject matter of a large fine, and (c) become the basis for a compensation order to the Irish telephone users.  If that happens, as I believe it will, we will find that the Minister's incompetence has cost us all dearly.  And once again we will thank our lucky stars that there is a European Court in existence to correct our own misdeeds and our own foolishness.  I call on the Minister now to withdraw this proposal before it is struck down.</P>
    <P>Even if the European law dimensions were not there, I am advised that the Postal and Telecommunications Act, 1983, and section 90 in particular, does not authorise the cross-subsidy of services proposed now by this Government. On the basis of several established cases it would appear that the logic of the &ldquo;Fares Fair&rdquo; decision in the English House of Lords in the <i>Bromley Local Borough Council v Greater London Council (1982) 1 All ER 129</i> would prohibit this scheme of charges in Ireland as well.</P>
    <P>These legal objections are quite apart from the provision of the Competition Act, 1991, which may or may not, because of the statutory instrument aspect of this scheme, have application to these facts.</P>
    <P>I am calling on the Government to withdraw this proposed scheme now in the name of jobs, in the name of social justice, in the name of the law and above all in the name of simple common sense before it is struck down by the courts, both Irish and European.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important motion this evening.  The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, speaking on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; yesterday evening stated that the Government were implementing these charges because the Culliton report stated it must be done.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The Culliton <Col N="2051" /> report and its back-up reports do not state that we must reduce international telephone charges here by increasing domestic charges to an exorbitant amount.  That is an indication of how this Government is trying to defend the indefensible in the actions taken by it since coming into Government.  A more significant point made by the Minister of State yesterday evening was that competition cannot be created in the telecommunications area without selling the instrument, in other words the telephone. In her opinion that was as much as could be done.  If that is the Government's understanding of competition and the depth of its knowledge of the telecommunications industry it is a poor indication of how the industry and all of the other semi-State companies will be developed.  I believe the future for these companies will be hopeless and they will, effectively, have no future whatsoever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where is Telecom Éireann going and where should it go?  Nothing of what has taken place in the past few days would lead anyone to believe there is a clear development role for this company.  Will opportunities for expansion and the embracing of competition, both international and domestic be sacrificed totally in defence of the local patch to the detriment of everything else?  This would appear to be what is happening now in Telecom Éireann both within the management and in some of the comments being made by David Begg through the CWU.  These people are not looking to the future.  I would liken it to the opportunities that existed in the air traffic sector for Aer Lingus but which were not grasped when competition was available. The airline became defensive and has ended up in an extremely difficult situation. If it succeeds in getting over its difficulties it will at best become a small regional operator.  Is that to be the future of Telecom Éireann also?  This is a company that has opportunity, that has been held up by all sides in this House as having developed well in the past number of years and which has the capacity to compete at international level.  I agree <Col N="2052" /> with my colleague, Deputy O'Malley, that the only reason these changes have been brought about is that Telecom Éirenn faced competition in one area only, namely the international sector. Can we not look to developing this company on a much broader scale?  Can it not become what I believe Culliton intended, a major player in the international communications area rather than a domestic player?  A future in a domestic sense will not sustain that company when it has to face real competition from overseas.</P>
    <P>What should this company do?  It should look to become a healthy, dynamic organisation.  If David Begg and the people who work in Telecom Éireann examined the long term opportunities they may decide they would rather be representing workers in a company which is developing internationally, which will create sustainable jobs and which will offer challenges and opportunities.  Why should a company like Telecom Éireann, with its expertise, not be involved in either a joint venture or on its own developing telecommunications systems in Poland, Hungary or elsewhere rather than always defending the indefensible in terms of its own patch?  That is not the way for this company to develop and the Minister and his Department are failing to encourage Telecom Éireann to become a major international player in terms of the telecommunications industry.</P>
    <P>We can take the example of Cable and Wireless and consider how it is developing. One could not compare Telecom Éireann to this company in terms of size but the direction in which that company is going is also open to Telecom Éireann. It should develop into a substantial company that is not afraid of competition whether it comes from the domestic or international market.  If Telecom Éireann does not embrace the ideals and value of competition the company and its workers will have no future because of the mistakes being made and the decisions being taken by this so-called partnership Government of Labour and Fianna Fáil.  The decisions this Government is making do not offer any real <Col N="2053" /> future to the Telecom Éireann workforce. They will be reduced in size as competition increases rather than facing competition and adapting to it.</P>
    <P>One may ask how this can happen. Singapore has a population of two million people but developed its airline, Singapore Airlines, into one of the greatest in the world today.  That is an example of how proper policy, direction and facing of competition can develop companies into substantial players in the world market.</P>
    <P>The major talking point of people today is the effect of these charges on the domestic consumer, local businesses as well as the private telephone user.  What about the effect of these charges on small businesses such as auctioneers?  Anyone familiar with that area will be aware that much of the business is conducted on the telephone involving potential purchasers and people wishing to negotiate and renegotiate.  That is domestic business which occurs within defined rural areas. Bigger companies may operate nationally but very few will operate at this level. This is a clear example of a service industry facing major increases without any thought by this Government for decisions made by it in the past few days.</P>
    <P>Many retail shops, particularly small family run businesses throughout rural Ireland, purchase from wholesalers. Much communication takes place involving price checking, where the best deal is operated and where the best advantage can be obtained to be competitive with the major multiples.  Much of that business depends on fast communication and being at the head of the market so as to face the enormous competition created by these multiples.  The companies that are trying to survive and create sustainable employment in local areas are being crucified by the actions being taken arbitrarily by the Minister and his Department.  Charitable organisations have filled the void created by Governments' lack of action here in the past 20 years.  I could not begin to count the number of organisations here who operate on a voluntary basis.  These people give of their time to provide much needed <Col N="2054" /> services to their own communities and communities nationwide, filling the void created by Governments in this area over the past two decades.  What about people who desperately need to talk to a friendly voice at the other end of a telephone line?  They will not be able to afford the increased cost of local charges proposed by the Government.  Many organisations who phone people who have called them seeking help will also not be able to afford these charges.</P>
    <P>The Government seems to have forgotten the ordinary citizens.  It is justifying the proposed increase in local charges on the basis that the cost of international calls will be cheaper for industry. The Government has forgotten the ordinary citizens who have to survive and who have been under enormous pressure for the past number of years.  Many people do not burden the State with their needs; rather their families look after them.  This fact has also been ignored by the Government in proposing these increases.  Will a person who cannot afford these increases have to wait until off peak-time or the weekend before telephoning a family member for help in a time of crisis?  Even children in school would regard that as nonsense.</P>
    <P>The reasons for these increases do not stand up.  County council managers are trying to defend the indefensible on behalf of the Government.  Who decided that the telephone rental charge should be as excessive as it is?  Is this charge laid down in legislation or did the public demand that we should have one of the highest telephone rental costs of any country in the world?  Why has this charge not been looked at by the Government? The reason is that there is no competition in this area.  The only way of eliminating this type of interference by the Government is through the introduction of competition in the marketplace.  This has been proven time and again in various industries through the world.  Of course, no consideration is being given to the introduction of competition in this area. The typical attitude of the Government in many areas has been to latch onto, for example, the Culliton report and use it <Col N="2055" /> to defend every ill thought out and ill conceived initiative it has taken.  If the Government continues to treat semi-State companies in the way it has done to date it will have ruined this sector by the time it leaves office.</P>

    <P>Mar sin iarraim ar an Aire deireadh a chur leis an dallamullóg.  Tá sé ag iarraidh a chur ina luí gur mhol Culliton na hathruithe seo.  Níor mhol.

Caithfear é a dhéanamh sul i bhfad.  Ach níl aon rud i gceist ag an Aire chun Telecom Éireann a dhéanamh níos éifeachtaí, chun na costais a ísliú taobh istigh den chomhlacht sin, nó chun táirgiú a mhéadú ann.  Tá sé chun iarraidh ar ghnáth-mhuintir na hEireann íoc as an ísliú chun go mbeadh tairbhe éigin ag an lucht gnó a dhéanann gnó idirnáisiúnta.  Mar sin iarraim ar an Aire anois ath-smaoineamh a dhéanamh ar na moltaí.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>Notes and approves the action of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications in authorising the implementation of a package of telephone tariffs which will improve competition and assist in job creation in the economy, allow Telecom Éireann to further develop and update our national telecommunications infrastructure and provide incentives for maximising public usage of the telephone system; further approves of the Government decision to recommend State and Local Government agencies to maximise the use of freefone facilities and welcomes the decision to establish the Telephone Users Advisory Group to monitor the impact of the rebalancing of the telephone tariffs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2058" /> Ní aontaim leis an argóint shimplí a dhein an Teachta Molloy.</P>
    <P>The Opposition motion before the House is a further selective misrepresentation of what is a fair and balanced overall package.  Before going into a discussion on tariff changes let me set out the underlying facts.  The facts are that overall telephone charges are being reduced.  The total revenue of Telecom Éireann will fall by £15 million perhaps more; the tariff for 75 per cent of all calls, local, trunk and international is being reduced in some cases by as much as 60 per cent including 80 per cent of local calls; the increase is confined to 15 per cent of all calls, that is those local calls over three minutes peak and 15 minutes off peak.</P>
    <P>To highlight a particular change in those circumstances is selective and biased and intended to mislead the public.  What counts at the end of the day is not the change in the rate for any particular call but the overall effect the tariff has on customers' bills as well as the contribution it can make to job creation by lowering costs and improving competitiveness; and the opportunities and incentives it gives to all customers to control their own costs and utilise the phone system fully for social and business purposes.</P>
    <P>The tariff structure that I have approved of will achieve these purposes. It also introduces fairness and more equality between different user groups and moves towards ending discrimination that exists in our existing tariff structure. What I set out to do in the course of this address is to outline once again for the benefit of this House and the public, what I am doing, why I am doing it and the effect it really will have on customers' bills rather than the selective impact highlighted in the motion before the House. It is against this background that the tariff must be examined.</P>
    <P>In looking at the overall changes I will pose two issues for consideration: Is the tariff fair; are the changes justified?  We must consider too the effect on bills stripped of all the emotional and misleading comment that has confused the issue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2059" /> There is much that is both unfair and outdated in the current tariff structure. The cost structure has been changed beyond recognition by technology with costs no longer determined by distance but by duration of calls.  There is a great deal of artificiality in the present structure and competition is beginning to play an increasing and welcome part in determining tariffs.</P>
    <P>My objective is to bring fairness and economic reality to bear on an outmoded tariff.  Let me give examples: The public seem to want unlimited time on local calls throughout the day.  If this is to remain there is a price to be paid by many for the benefit of the few.  Over 70 per cent of peak calls are concluded within three minutes and I regard that time interval as reasonable period in which to apply the lowest unit charge.</P>
    <P>Why should a message conveyed in a short 15 seconds cost as much as a 15 minute call?  Why should the majority of phone users who want to conduct urgent business calls at peak hours feel frustrated and delayed while exchanges and lines are tied up and clogged by long duration calls, many of which could be postponed to off peak hours?</P>
    <P>Another example of unfairness and inequality is the imbalance between international, trunk and local charges.  A local call extending to a range of 20 to 25 miles can cost less than 1p per minute for a 15 minute call.  Going another 20-30 miles beyond that costs 12.1p per minute, nearly 15 times as much for a call that costs very little more to set up and transmit than a local call.  Calling beyond about 50 miles doubles the cost again, and calling internationally, for example, to Britain, the cheapest destination, costs two and a half times as much again:&mdash; 59p per minute peak time as against under 1p per minute for a 15 minute local call, a ratio of nearly 80 to 1.  If I were introducing such wide discrimination in tariffs now there would be an outcry against it.  Yet that is the tariff structure that has evolved; that is what we have inherited and which I propose to remedy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of all this is that international and trunk callers are subsidising local calls.</P>
      <P>These changes will narrow the differences between tariffs, introduce more equality, more choice and more balance in relating charges more closely to usage and costs.  It is only in this way that equality and fairness will prevail.</P>
      <P>This is the acid test of the changes. While there are considerable changes in the new tariffs to remedy the discrimination and unfairness I have spoken of, most of these changes tend to cancel out and leave bills considerably less affected than is feared by many.  I accept the concerns of those who are worried and anxious and will do my best to allay them.  I have taken a great deal of trouble to analyse the effect on bills and have ruled out proposals which I have regarded as too severe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In approaching the effect on bills let me say straight away that the reductions in international and trunk calls benefit most residential customers.  These reductions come to £35 million per annum and considerably exceed the increase in local calls of £18 million for residential customers.  There is therefore a net reduction in the average charge for calls on residential bills.  For the business sector the reduction in international and trunk charges come to £43 million very comfortably exceeding the additional cost of local calls of £16 million.  To check the effect on bills I had Telecom carry out an analysis of all bills in a recent billing period, broken down in as much detail as possible.  This analysis shows that most customers benefit from reductions and when increases occur they are not excessive.  This is why I approved this tariff package because its overall effect is counter balanced and moderate despite the exaggerated claims made as in the case of the proponents of this motion.  To put the matter beyond doubt, I propose to circulate tables showing the breakdowns available to me of different forms of bills.  It may surprise Deputies <Col N="2061" /> to know that the average bill for trunk calls and international calls combined for the average residential customer is almost twice as high as that for local calls. The relevant figures in the sample of all bills were: local &mdash; £7, trunk &mdash; £5.70, international &mdash; £6.56 almost as much as local calls.  Trunk and international charges are being reduced by an average of 30 per cent.  Within the local call category 80 per cent of calls are being reduced by 15 per cent.  It should be obvious therefore that the overall effect of an admittedly substantial increase in the remaining local calls is going to be limited for the average customer.</P>
    <P>In a further breakdown it emerged that less than 10 per cent of residential customers made no trunk or international calls in that billing period.  Making such calls is not the prerogative of a minority or of the better off.  Old age pensioners, for example, spend considerably more on trunk and international calls than they spend on local calls, yet the cost of local calls is being highlighted by those who propose to protect their interest.  I am all in favour of protecting their interest when it is based on facts not sentiment.</P>
    <P>For the 43,000 pensioners who made international calls the relevant details were: local&mdash;£8; trunk&mdash;£9; and over £15 for international.  These are the customers who are most victimised by the present unfair tariff paying unreasonable charges in trying to keep in contact with family and relatives in different part of the country and abroad.</P>
    <P>As I said last week, the focus has been on the 15 minute local call and this type of phone call constitutes one call in 25 while conveniently ignoring the 20 calls which are now cheaper.</P>
    <P>Since 1990 Telecom Éireann absorbed 10 per cent of the residential VAT charge.  It is legally entitled to pass this on to customers.  What I have asked it is to phase in the VAT; 5 per cent in September and 5 per cent when the 25 per cent reduction in A trunk rates takes effect next April.  While it might have been wiser to pass on taxation as soon as it arose it is clear that Telecom Éireann could no longer absorb it while giving the <Col N="2062" /> substantial price cuts proposed resulting in a net overall loss of £15 million to themselves.  The choice therefore to Telecom Éireann was between a VAT pass through over which I have no control or smaller reductions in charges or higher increases elsewhere both of which would not have approved.</P>
    <P>There are areas of genuine concern among the public and I am taking the following measures to deal with them. The Government has decided to establish a telephone users advisory group to provide independent monitoring of the operation of the new tariff, its effect on different categories of customers and report to me on its deliberations.</P>
    <P>As a further step towards reducing costs for persons calling public offices, the Government has decided that all Government Departments, State agencies and local authorities will be obliged to facilitate a fast and efficient service to their callers involving the maximisation of the freefone service and a call-back service where queries cannot be answered speedily.</P>

      <P>In my discussions with Telecom Éireann before announcing its rebalancing of telephone tariffs proposals last Tuesday I had expressed concern with Telecom Éireann regarding the impact of the new charges on certain helpline services.  I am pleased to inform Deputies that Telecom Éireann is setting aside £500,000 to provide free access to certain high priority services&mdash;no charge to callers &mdash; namely, the Samaritans, Childline and the Rape Crisis Centre. Telecom Éireann will now discuss with these and other helpline service operators how best to facilitate callers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The importance of competitive international telephone charges to job creation and retention cannot be over stressed.  Deputy O'Malley did not mention this.  More than 2,000 &ldquo;back office&rdquo;<Col N="2063" /> jobs have been created in Ireland by both Irish companies and international or US companies.  These typically operate by processing, for example, insurance claims on personal computers in Ireland or American Express data relating to foreign currency purchases in Europe and transmitting the data to a mainframe computer in the customer's home country. Such firms have created employment in small urban areas like Loughrea, Fermoy and Killorglin as well as disadvantaged areas of Dublin to name just a few locations.  I understand that the IDA estimates that there is the potential for the creation of 1,000 to 2,000 jobs per annum in this area if conditions are right in the nature of telecommunications services and prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>There are also some 6,000 jobs in the overseas international services of which some 3,500 are in the software development field.  Other jobs in this sector include data processing, consultancy and so on.  There are a further 3,000 jobs in the Irish owned software development field.  I am advised that the latest development in the software industry is remote software development where the software developer, rather than mailing his package to his customer or having it delivered by courier, transmits it over the national and international telecommunications networks.</P>
      <P>Telemarketing is also a developing industry which has been described to me as the IDA's biggest new product.  This is an industry where the market is reached only by telephone and where it is primarily outside our shores.  The importance of competitive international tariffs in such an industry, if it is to develop, is obvious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In more traditional industries there is a move towards what is termed just in <Col N="2064" /> time deliveries and this is of vital importance to the export industry in such areas as fresh foods and so on where the freshness of the product, the delivery of a stated amount at a stated location at a specific time is all important.  Similarly, industry generally is moving to just in time processes for the delivery of components from sub-contractors.  All of these industries are dependent on not only high quality communications to service their customers abroad but also competitive international telephone tariffs.</P>
    <P>In the service sector area industry is highly mobile and its location is of little importance to the customer.  Given the importance of telecommunications charges to this sector it is imperative that our international charges are more closely related to cost.</P>
    <P>This package is necessary now to support employment creation and retention in Ireland.  It is necessary that we all adapt.  The urgency of taking all possible measures to alleviate unemployment means that change can no longer be leisurely and gradual and await further efficiency gains in Telecom Éireann. These will come in time but will be needed to fund other tariff adjustments in future.</P>
    <P>Turning now to that portion of the motion which alleges that the Government has failed to address the issue of overall cost levels of Telecom Éireann or to encourage greater competition as recommended in the Culliton report, I would again refute the charges made. Telecom Éireann has taken many steps to improve efficiency since 1984.  It has, through voluntary programmes, reduced its workforce by more than 25 per cent not only without disruption of service but at a time when both its customer base and its quality of service increased dramatically.  I am aware that much more needs to be done.  I have already spoken with the chairman of the board of Telecom and the company's chief executive on the need for greater efficiency.  In short, I am insisting that the continuing drive for higher productivity in Telecom Éireann be pursued with even greater urgency and that the gains of such productivity <Col N="2065" /> be translated into reduced charges for all consumers.</P>
    <P>The Culliton report has been quoted by the Opposition in support of this motion and quoted selectively.  There were no less than five recommendations in the Culliton report, three of which are the subject of this debate.</P>
    <P>The first of Culliton's proposals was for a radical rebalancing of the current telephone tariff to bring our tariffs into close alignment with the actual cost of making connections.  This is a recommendation which has been acted upon within the past week and which has been the subject of deliberations and examination within my Department over the past seven months or so.  The second proposal, which is related, requires that our telephone charges be brought into line with cost-based charges in Europe at the least and again this has been done.</P>
    <P>The third recommendation relates to the cost structure within Telecom Éireann and I have already outlined both Telecom Éireann's past actions and my own in this respect.  This package imposes a burden of £15 million on Telecom which will have to be met by increased efficiency.  I will be having the matter examined in greater depth and, within the resources available to my Department, I would hope to meet with the deadline proposed by Culliton.</P>
    <P>On the subject of competition Deputies will note that the Culliton report recommends that competition should be encouraged on all of Telecom Éireann's services.  I would draw Deputies' attention to the Government decision on that issue which is as follows:</P>
    <P>Competition across all services and areas of the telecommunications system will be encouraged, subject to correspondence of public service obligations on all competing service providers to the fullest extent possible.</P>
    <P>Deputies will appreciate that it is not possible to take such measures overnight but I can promise Deputies that the fullest possible competition will be made available at dates not later than those required under EC legislation and, where <Col N="2066" /> possible, at earlier dates.  There has already been the fullest possible liberalisation given the current state of telecommunications development in Ireland and competition now exists in terminal equipment supply.  There is also a licensing system which authorises the provision of public value added and data transmission services by licenses.</P>
    <P>In 1983, this House created Telecom Éireann and gave it a mandate to operate in a commercial manner.  If the House does not wish to withdraw the commercial mandate given to Telecom Éireann it should allow it to operate in a manner which enables it to compete on something approaching an equal footing with its competitors in Europe and the USA.  The tariff proposals which I approved are a major step in updating and reforming our telecommunication network.</P>
    <P>As regards the amendments tabled by Deputy Gilmore I would say that of course everybody would be delighted if the increases in local charges were revised and all the other reductions kept in place.  The tariff proposals and it is not possible to reject the downside and keep all the upside.</P>
    <P>I have already explained that the VAT adjustment is a matter for Telecom, and I have insisted that it be introduced on a phased basis.  I will be addressing questions of competition and liberalisation and the developments in EC policy in the months and years ahead.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish to restate that the overall package will not be an onerous and severe imposition on customers.  Its effect on average bills will be limited.  A majority of users who make trunk and international calls will break-even and the overall increase should be limited to between 4 per cent and 5 per cent, if calling patterns do not change.  I envisage that most customers will avail of the off-peak incentives to minimise their costs. The new telephone users advisory group will advise on any particular issues that may arise.</P>
    <P>If the overall flow of revenue from the new charges exceeds the projected budget I will expect Telecom to come <Col N="2067" /> forward with new proposals for further reductions.  I am also confident that most customers will exercise the choice and options now open to them to reduce their costs and increase the value and benefit they get from the overall significantly cheaper tariff.  I recommend that the House adopt the amendment to the motion which I have tabled.</P>

      <P>The Government last week announced changes in the tariff structure for telephone calls made by users of Telecom Éireann installations effective from 1 September this year.  I support these changes for a number of reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The present tariff structure reflects the needs of the telephone system before its modernisation when the two main factors involved in pricing a call were distance and time. Timing was not applied to low value local calls with the result that international and national trunk calls were particularly expensive compared to lengthy local calls.  Developments in technology have reduced the cost of carrying calls over distance and the bulk of the cost of any call is now incurred in setting it up in the subscriber's local exchange.  The introduction <Col N="2068" /> of the new tariff means that all subscribers are being asked to pay equally for this service.</P>
      <P>Modern business at international level or ambitious nationally-based companies need ready access to this international market.  The most direct method of communication is via telecommunications. However, the relatively high cost in recent times of international calls from this country has caused and continues to cause a loss of international traffic to Telecom Éireann through business people here using leased line or call-back facilities to route international and crosschannel calls through British Telecom and the United States telephone systems at those countries' international call rates.  Despite the cost of the leased line, it continues to be a cheaper option for large companies than placing a call through Telecom Éireann.  for example, calls to Ireland from the United States of America are now running 2:1 in favour of United States' telephone companies, the effects of which are that Telecom Éireann is losing some £15 million cumulatively per annum in international telephone traffic.  In time this could have predictable negative effects on employment in Telecom Éireann.  Therefore, this loss cannot be allowed to continue. Telecom Éireann needs a tariff that is internationally competitive, cost-related, flexible and which promotes the efficient use of the telephone system.  The new tariff has been designed to do just that.</P>
      <P>The new tariff structure will reduce business costs in line with the stated objectives of the Programme for Government and the recommendations of the Culliton and Moriarty reports.  I regret there is so much opposition to a recommendation of those reports by the people on the Opposition benches.  Henceforth business calls to Britain will be cheaper than from any other country.  In addition, rates to our main export markets in Europe will match rates in those countries. Calls to North America will be cheaper than those made from any other country except Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that the effect of the introduction <Col N="2069" /> of the new tariff structure will be felt most by domestic consumers at local level and that the money gained from local calls will be used to reduce the cost of international calls.  However, the tariff structure has been carefully devised to provide a method whereby, given efficient use of the telephone on the part of domestic consumers, the cost of local and trunk calls can be rendered cheaper than at present.  Including the new VAT rate on domestic calls, bills based on the current pattern of usage would increase by an average of 4 per cent.  However, the reduction in short distance peak rates from 1 April next year by 25 per cent and the introduction of special rates at weekends and public holiday periods mean that trunk call costs will fall by over 11 per cent, a point Opposition Deputies neglected to mention.</P>
    <P>In answer to consumer's questions as to why Telecom Éireann cannot fund the reduction in international call charges from its annual profits in excess of £90 million, there is a simple answer in that such would be counter-productive.  In 1992 Telecom Éireann paid £56 million of its profits to the State in the form of dividends and advance corporation tax. Telecom Éireann also has an extremely high level of debt, in excess of £1,000 million, which must be repaid and spend some £180 million annually on maintaining and improving their services. Investment experts have stated that Investment should be in the region of £225 million annually.  Therefore, it will clearly be seen that Telecom Éireann simply cannot absorb the cost of reducing international tariffs, which must fall to the consumer for whom the service is provided.</P>
    <P>At this point I should take the Opposition to task for their shameless opportunism regarding the new charges.</P>

      <P>Therefore, Telecom Éireann, with the aid of this tariff system, will have an opportunity to improve its services, expand its business and equip the company to meet and match increased competition at home and abroad.  Through this revised tariff structure Irish business can remain competitive, develop their international links and attract more foreign investors, ultimately generating much needed employment.

      <P>Fine Gael opposes the Government decision to rebalance telephone charges announced by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications on Tuesday afternoon last.  Fine Gael will support the motion tabled by the Progressive Democrats Party when this debate concludes at 8.30 p.m. tomorrow evening.</P>
      <P>The decision of the Minister announced on Tuesday last was an appalling one.  It transfers a huge liability onto the shoulders of those who use the telephone principally for local calls and does not seek to differentiate in any way between local calls made for business rather than social purposes.  The decision has reduced the cost of international calls.  The Government claims that this will be of major benefit to Irish industry. However, it ignores the consequences for business on the home market.</P>
      <P>The Minister on his own figures has made concessions to the value of £81 million and decisions which will raise extra revenue of £67 million.  The shortfall of £14 million is to be carried by Telecom Éireann in the short-term, but according to the Minister's statement will be regained subsequently through elasticity of demand.  It is clear from the Minister's own figures that Telecom Éireann intends collecting £34 million extra from local calls, that it will save an additional £29 million by transferring liability for VAT from Telecom Éireann to its customers and intends gathering an extra £4 million by charging 30p for each directory inquiry after the second such inquiry in any one month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, it is quite clear that the <Col N="2072" /> ordinary householder and business person who conducts his or her business on the home market will have to pay for this package.  We may quarrel about the actual amounts but it is quite clear, again from the Minister's own figures, that at least £18 million extra will be collected from ordinary householders on local calls and that an additional £10 million approximately will be collected from the same people by way of VAT liability. This is a huge increase in charges which will have enormous consequences for the social and economic life of the country. Families with a number of teenage children will find themselves in a permanent state of warfare&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Those agencies which offer helpline services, such as The Samaritans, will have their services seriously disrupted under the new scale of charges.  We should remember that many persons who avail of counselling on helplines ring in on a confidential basis from a family telephone. A scale of charges which allows conversations of up to 15 minutes for 11p. preserved that confidentiality.  Now that the cost for the same call will be increased by 425 per cent, their confidentiality within the famly will disappear as soon as the telephone bill arrives.</P>

The Minister conveniently forgets about business people who conduct their business by way of local calls every hour and <Col N="2073" /> minute of the day and how the new scale of charges will add to their costs at peak time from Monday to Friday.</P>
    <P>The Minister's selective quotation of statistics does not take from the fact that in many cases by the time one will have heard two verses of &ldquo;Home on the Range&rdquo; or &ldquo;Greensleeves&rdquo; while waiting for a call to be put through, one will be into the second ten pence halfpenny.</P>
    <P>The effect on business in the larger cities will be particularly servere.  For example, the 01 area comprises over one-third of the population of the country. An enormous amount of business is conducted, day in day out, by way of local calls.  Therefore, the costs of these businesses will increase, leading to a loss of jobs rather than their creation.  This will be during office hours, at peak times, as specified by the Minister.</P>
    <P>In this regard it is very difficult to believe the Telecom Éireann statistic that 75 per cent of local calls last for less than three minutes.  The Telecom Éireann statistical base is poor, their figures unreliable. The fact that they are the State agency about which the Ombudsman has received most complaints tells its own story.  Of course, quite a large number of calls are ineffective when a person sought is not available.  Naturally, those calls are of very short duration.  I have no doubt that they are all included in the Telecom Éireann statistics.</P>
    <P>Business calls last much longer than three minutes and every additional three minutes on the telephone will cost 10.5p when VAT is included, to which Telecom did not refer when advertising the charges.  It is clear, therefore, that there is a huge cost to the ordinary householder and the local business person, the bulk of whose calls are local.  The Minister will claim he rejigged the charges to reduce the cost of international calls so that Irish business can be more competitive.  This is a sound argument in so far as it goes but it is quite clear that this was not the motivation of Telecom or the Minister when the action was taken.  Telecom was beginning to feel the breeze of international competition.  The EC Directive 93/88 will add to this competition.  Telecom's <Col N="2074" /> charges for international calls are no longer sustainable.  It has already lost a tranche of the international market and had to move before its losses were unsustainable. One would expect 50 per cent of international calls in any country to be outgoing and 50 per cent incoming.  That normal flow of traffic is not the pattern in Ireland where 60 per cent of calls are incoming and 40 per cent outgoing.  It is quite clear that the effects of international competition are already being felt.</P>
    <P>Ireland and Spain have the highest rates for international calls in the EC and many businesses have already switched to more competitive services.  The narrow interpretation of the Department of Transport, Energy and Communication of EC Directive 93/88 will shore up the situation for some time but the spirit of the Directive, which requires telephone monopolies, such as Telecom Éireann, to sell lines in bulk to the private sector which they, in turn, break down and sell to the business community is frustrated by the narrow interpretation of the Directive by the Minister's Department.  The Department insists that the Directive requires Telecom to provide a facility prescribed for the transmission of FAX and data only, there is no requirement to provide the facility for voice transmission. I believe it is in error in this interpretation and I doubt if even Telecom believes in the position it has adopted. It is simply another restrictive practice to defer the day when competition must apply to the industry.  I have no doubt that in the short to medium term Telecom will voluntarily&mdash;or as a result of a decision of the European Court&mdash;be forced to allow competition and follow the practice in the UK, France, Germany, Belgium, The Netherlands and Spain as a result of the Directive which came into effect on 1 January this year.  Telecom and the Department know this and because competition is already in place Telecom has transferred £67 million of revenue from areas which were becoming increasingly subject to competition to the local call area where there is no competition&mdash;and unlikely <Col N="2075" /> to be any &mdash; in the foreseable future. That is what this increase in charges is about.  It is not about Culliton, job creation or cutting costs to internationally traded goods and services business in this country but the protection of Telecom from competition, some of which is already blowing through the economy and more which will follow as a result of the Directive of 1 January last but which the Department is frustrating on behalf of Telecom.  As access to new competitive networks will be by way of local calls, Telecom, by loading the new schedule of charges against local calls, is ensuring it has the potential to squeeze further competition out of the international lines because it will not be possible to access international lines except by way of local calls in the first instance. Telecom will maintain its stranglehold.</P>
    <P>All through the sorry saga of last week the Minister insisted that he was merely following the recommendations of the Culliton report in respect of Telecom Éireann.  He is, of course, doing nothing of the sort.  Culliton recommended the rebalancing of telephone charges but in the context of a number of other proposals in respect of Telecom.  The Minister has taken one proposal out of context and distorted the intent of the Culliton report which recommended that the Government bring forward a three year plan to enable Telecom Éireann to become more commercial.  Why has the Minister not brought forward this plan? Culliton also recommended the sale of extra capacity on trunk lines to provide competition and pressure to keep prices down.  This is not being done.  He also advised that the Government should, if the circumstances required it, bring forward legislation by June this year to enable Telecom to trade in a fully commercial fashion and to provide a competitive service to its customers.  Why did the Minister not mention this?  It is clear that the committee chaired by Culliton was deeply concerned about the cost of communications.  It pointed out that Telecom's revenue accounted for 2.75 per cent of GDP, by far the highest of <Col N="2076" /> any EC country in 1989 with most other member states having a revenue in the range of 1.3-1.8 per cent of GDP &mdash; almost twice the amount of GDP can be ascribed to telephone revenue in this country compared to the EC average. Quite clearly this is not due to the incidence of telephones per head of population, indeed we have a comparatively low incidence in that regard, but to the fact that the charges are very high across the whole range of services, particularly in respect of international calls.  This will change as a result of the Minister's decision, the charge will now be transferred to local calls with a resultant imbalance.</P>
    <P>The manner in which the Minister and Bord Telecom handled the announcement was intended to be misleading. Extravagant claims were made that the new scale of charges would benefit all consumers but it is clear that financing the package, from the Minister's own figures, depends on a huge extra take from local calls.  The reduction in charges was exaggerated by not including VAT. Telecom's newspaper advertising was probably illegal because VAT was not included in the charges initially quoted and when it was included late last week it was calculated at the rate of 16 per cent instead of 21 per cent.  Even in Leinster House the Minister sought to disguise his intent.  Extensive briefing material was provided to Government backbenchers but other Members, did not have access to information.  When the Minister makes an announcement he has a responsibility to inform all Members and not to be selective on a party political basis.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party is committed to Bord Telecom.  We believe that the question of its ownership is not relevant.  It should continue in public ownership but must become competitive.  The winds of competition are blowing from Europe and the Department of Transport, Communications and Energy should not try to organise a Custer's last stand in defence of Telecom's uncompetitive practices.  Telecom's future will be guaranteed, not by trying to hide from these competitive forces but by gearing <Col N="2077" /> the company to take on competition in Ireland and to complete for business throughout the EC and in Eastern Europe where its skills and expertise will be in high demand.</P>
    <P>One of the failings of industry in Ireland is that we have very few large indigenous companies.  We have the semi-State sector, however, and the commercial semi-State bodies such as Telecom Éireann and the ESB should be encouraged to expand their business either in traditional areas of expertise or in new areas.  Telecom has experience and expertise and if it takes the decision to operate on commercial lines it will expand, any loss of jobs will be more than compensated for by opportunities for extra jobs in new areas of activity and by generating new business.  That is the way forward, not the very limited proposal which the Minister has brought forward.</P>
    <P>The Minister has done a bad job, he has let down the Irish consumer, the small businessman and &mdash; probably most seriously &mdash; Telecom Éireann by not allowing it to face the new Europe which came into being on 1 January of this year.</P>

      <P>I listened with great interest to Deputy O'Keeffe's contribution in which he said he had received only one telephone call of protest &mdash; from a member of the Opposition.  I thought Deputy O'Keeffe was a realist but I am beginning to wonder now.  I received numerous calls from concerned small businessmen and from a great many ordinary consumers.  I hope to reflect their views in my contribution.  It is interesting that the announcement of the dramatic increase in charges was made against the backdrop of Bord Telecom Éireann's annual report in which it announced annual profits of £91 million and its success in installing over 125,000 new telephones, it now has over one million lines. The blurb was very interesting but I was surprised by the changes in telephone charges.  I was also surprised at the Government's insensitivity to the older people in our community, who number over 100,000.  A great many public representatives <Col N="2078" /> are approached by older people seeking a free telephone, as they perceive it who discover later when they are concerned about the charges, that only the telephone rental is free.</P>
      <P>The telephone is a lifeline for older people, especially those in rural Ireland's by which to keep in contact with their families.  The Garda are trying to encourage communities to keep in contact with these people.  The telephone is essential for them and the Minister's proposal in this regard is particularly cruel and insensitive. So much for the social conscience always championed by Fianna Fáil on behalf of the older community.</P>
      <P>I will read what I regard as a very hollow statement from Telecom Éireann's annual report in which the chairman states: &ldquo;Customers will be consulted periodically about all aspects of the services we provide and their experiences in dealing with the company&rdquo;.  That is a very interesting quotation.  It is a pity it is not transferred into the world of reality.  Apart from a select number of Fianna Fáil and Labour Party members who were consulted and issued with briefing documents on this matter, to everybody else the announcement of increased charges was a surprise.  There was no consultation with interested parties or local communities about the charges.  For that reason I regard that statement as very hollow and insincere. The chairman should not include unnecessary rhetoric in annual reports because by doing so he is duping the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the 15 minute call and the increase of 425 per cent has been mentioned.  An increase from 11.17p to 47.5p is excessive.  Regardless of what the Minister may say about limiting calls, people have become used to spending time on the telephone.  The Irish people are gregarious and like to talk; this is a desirable quality.  Increased charges will lead to rows in families.  It will result in a return of the traditional egg-timer, used in years past, to measure the length of time teenagers spend on the phone.  Parents will become very frustrated when their sons and daughters spend more than <Col N="2079" /> three minutes on a call.  It may even result in a spin-off business whereby people with an entrepreneurial spirit who can afford to make phone calls&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I read in last Sunday's newspaper comments from Labour backbenchers on these increases, many of them extremely critical.  They said they were reflecting the views of their rank and file supporters.  I wonder whether those same backbenchers whose names were mentioned in the Sunday newspapers will support the Government on these proposed charges.  They want jam on both sides of their bread on issues such as this.  They want to appear publicly as if they are distancing themselves from these issues but when they come in here they vote with the Government.  It is time for these people to stand up and be counted. They should not continue with unnecessary rhetoric in newspapers in relation to their intent and ideas while taking a different stand in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>These increased charges are ill-considered and ill-conceived.  It was interesting to hear the Minister of State, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, supporting these charges; she said she hopes she reflects the viewpoint of her party.  There is none of that party here tonight, which of course is the tradition when dealing with contentious issues such as this.</P>

      <P>When one considers that these increased charges were announced the same week as the implementation of the 1 per cent levy, it shows how uncaring and insensitive this Government has become.  However, the public can see through what is happening. These increases are a scandal.  The Minister talks about the international scene and industrialists but ignores the small Irish businesses who are the backbone of our economy and who depend on the telephone.  In many cases international companies move on when profits begin <Col N="2080" /> to fall but Irish business people remain here.  I appreciate that these people feel they must lobby in regard to these charges because they will greatly impact on their businesses.</P>
      <P>The Minister should realise he has made a mistake on what he considers a rebalancing of telephone charges.  This is a retrograde step and I ask him in the interests of the people I have mentioned to reconsider his decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is easy to understand the deep sense of public outrage about Telecom Éireann's increased telephone charges.  It is very obvious that the Government is simply using Telecom Éireann to generate revenue for the Exchequer.  Telecom Éireann claims it is engaging in this price rearrangement in order to meet the demands of the Culliton report, but Culliton did not support increases in local phone calls.</P>
      <P>Irish domestic local and long distance calls are among the most expensive in the OECD.  This rebalancing act will make them even more expensive.  From figures produced by the consumers association, Irish consumers already pay the highest rental charges in Europe, at £10.23 per month or £122.76 per year.  That compares with £75.84 per year in Britain.</P>
      <P>The cost per minute of local calls will be increased by in the region of 325 per cent.  This will be a devastating blow to rural Ireland, especially to senior citizens whose only communications with the outside world is in many cases the telephone. It will lead to increased isolation for this, the most vulnerable sector of society.  The increased cost of local calls from 11.17p for 15 minutes to 9.5p for three minutes will be a further cruel imposition on this sector of the population.  It is an insult to say that these people should wait until off-peak times to make their calls.  As the Minister should be aware, old people may need help at any time during the day and may not be able to wait until off-peak times to make a call.  As emphasised by Deputy Finucane, the advantage of the free telephone allowance will be eroded by this draconian measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Increased charges will affect all sectors <Col N="2081" /> of the population.  They will result in added cost to domestic businesses unless they transact their business in less than three minutes, which is unlikely considering the amount of business conducted over the telephone.  We are all familiar with the regular slow responses from Government Departments, banks and several other business places &mdash; in some cases people may have to wait ten to 20 minutes before a call is answered.</P>
    <P>Of even greater concern was the statement that the company will pay 5 per cent of VAT due on residential customers' bills until next March when the full 21 per cent will apply.  On the other hand the Minister emphasised that the corporate sector will pay the net amount &mdash;as virtually all companies are registered for VAT most of them will pay the net amount and will not be penalised to the tune of 21 per cent.  The private customer cannot claim a refund so that they will pay 16 per cent more than a company up to March and 21 per cent thereafter.  The increases will have a devastating effect on small business whose bills are expected to double every two months. Whereas it will help exporting firms it will do serious damage to firms selling on the home market.  So far as I am concerned the proposed new charge is a kick in the teeth for small business and the domestic user.</P>

      <P>Deputy Paddy Harte gave me notice of his intention to raise the matter as to the delay caused to the County Donegal football team supporters at the Aughnacloy British Army Border check-point on Sunday, 9 May 1993, on their return from the national league final, which caused inconvenience and resentment to many people; and the need for better arrangements to be made at all check-points on occasions such as the one in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2082" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment. Better planning with more emphasis on public relations by the British Army and the RUC would achieve much and there would have been less resentment on the part of football supporters returning from the league final.  I should explain that Aughnacloy takes all the Donegal supporters north, west and east and, therefore, over half of the Donegal supporters attending Croke Park would have gone through Aughnacloy.  Aughnacloy is a big and well developed check-point.  There is no reason extra army and RUC officers could not have been on duty, bearing in mind that security will always be a problem so long as the IRA is a threat. Had extra personnel been on duty there would have been no unnecessary delays.</P>
      <P>I should like to put on record that the Army personnel and the RUC officers with whom I came in contact were mannerly and polite and understood the anger being expressed by supporters because of the four miles tailback on the Monaghan road.  This was totally unnecessary.  This was the first time British Army soldiers saw supporters &mdash; not IRA supporters but ordinary law abiding people &mdash; carrying the Donegal colours of green and gold.  In many cases people were carrying green, white and orange flags.  I think it came as a shock to the British soldiers to see motorists going through displaying these colours who were not aggressive or hostile but were merely football supporters with no interest other than to support their team on the day of the national league final. That is getting a message across which is not reciprocated by the British authorities. They could easily overcome the traffic difficulty by providing better arrangements and they should know well in advance that matches are taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cross the Border at Strabane and Aughnacloy every time I travel to Dublin and there is never much difficulty or delay at Strabane.  The arrangements there are such that there is no excessive delay but the same cannot be said about Aughnacloy. While there have been improvements at Aughnacloy the position is still <Col N="2083" /> far from normal.  I would ask the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, to take up the matter with the Secretary of State in Northern Ireland because we have now reached the stage where such things should not cause offence to people crossing the Border.</P>
    <P>Donegal supporters have also to cross the Boyne bridge at Slane where there are traffic lights.  This is a long narrow bridge and no special arrangements are made for switching the lights from red to green.  A half dozen cars approaching Dublin are given the same time to cross the bridge as 600 cars going in the opposite direction.  The authorities in the Republic have a lesson to learn also.  On occasions such as this, the Garda Siochána should make arrangements at the Slane bridge to facilitate large numbers of motorists.</P>
    <P>I travel twice and sometimes three times a week on the Dublin-Donegal road and I seldom see a Garda patrol car but there were two Garda patrol cars checking the Donegal supporters going through County Monaghan on that Sunday morning.  I put it to the House that if there had been two RUC cars stopping the Donegal supporters in County Tyrone a very different view would have been taken of it.  I was stopped for a minor violation of traffic rules but nothing that warranted a patrol car pulling me in.  I am asking that better arrangements be put in place at the Border check-point.  Perhaps the Minister would take note of the fact that the Garda Síochána also have a lesson to learn.  It is not helpful to see 40 to 60 cars in a convoy heading in the direction of Dublin on such a celebratory occasion and Garda patrol cars checking them out.  On a return journey of 400 miles it is not pleasant to have to wait an hour to get through the British Army check-point. The matter will have to be dealt with in a more civilised way.</P>

      <P>The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, has asked me to <Col N="2084" /> reply to this debate.  I am grateful to the Deputy for bringing this matter to my attention.  I understand there were substantial delays to traffic travelling through the British army check-point at Aughnacloy on 9 May which affected many of the Donegal supporters travelling back to the county following the national football league final replay in Dublin.  I appreciate these delays were a cause of disruption and inconvenience to large numbers who were travelling on this route on the date in question.</P>
      <P>On being informed of this delay the matter was immediately raised with the British authorities through the Anglo-Irish Secretariat in Belfast.  In the response which we have now received the British side have expressed regret for the inconvenience caused to the travelling public by the delays at Aughnacloy to which the Deputy has drawn attention. They have indicated that on occasions, such as apparently occurred for a period on Sunday evening, when there is a heightened threat to security forces it may be necessary to carry out more rigorous checks than is normally the case.  I can assure the Deputy that matters relevant to the operation of vehicle check-points have been raised on numerous occasions with the British authorities within the framework of the Anglo-Irish Conference.  The Government has stressed the necessity to keep under review the need for such installations and to consider what alternatives might be provided which might be equally or more effective from a security viewpoint. Where the British authorities decide that permanent check-points are unavoidable we have stressed they should be operated with the minimum possible disruption to the travelling public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has also emphasised to the British authorities that on occasions such as the recent league final when it is known that large volumes of traffic will be travelling through the check-points they should ensure that appropriate measures are taken to avoid unnecessary delays and disruption.  We have also stressed that where delays do occur it is important that the motorists <Col N="2085" /> concerned be informed promptly of the reason for the delay and the likely length of the delay involved.</P>
    <P>In this regard it was found, for example, that the arrangements made at the time of last year's All-Ireland final were generally satisfactory.  We will continue to urge that appropriate arrangements be made in respect of such future occasions.</P>
    <P>While there appears generally to have been some improvement in the movement of vehicles through the check-points in recent months, this incident indicates delays can occur.  The Deputy can be assurred that we will continue to press the British authorities to ensure that everything possible is done to keep the disruption to the public to the absolute minimum.  I will pass on the Deputy's comments concerning Slane to the Minister for the Environment.  In regard to the Garda check-point I do not know whether they were checking if the Donegal supporters had been drowning their sorrows.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I would like to thank you very much, Sir, indeed for giving me the opportunity to raise this very important matter.  The recruitment of additional speech therapists in County Kerry is now absolutely essential and Southern Health Board members and officials accept this.  The present position is critical.  At present there are only three speech and language therapists appointed by the Southern Health Board in County Kerry and estimates are that at least 13 would be required if a reasonable level of service is to be provided.  The sanction of additional posts is currently awaited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The average waiting time at the moment for a child awaiting speech therapy in County Kerry is in excess of two years.  When one considers that early intervention in a disorder of this kind is absolutely crucial if a child is to be able to communicate properly in later life, two years is much too long.  I am seeking an <Col N="2086" /> increase in the number of speech and language therapists in the county.  I would seek as well the establishment of a special language unit and the appointment of special resource teachers for children with language difficulties who are receiving mainstream education.</P>
    <P>Bad and all as the situation is for children in mainstream education, the position in relation to moderately handicapped children attending the Nano Nagle School for the moderately mentally handicapped in Listowel, County Kerry, is absolutely scandalous.  Children attending special schools or special classes are generally not considered for therapy by the board's speech therapists. A large part of the curriculum in this school centres on the development of self-care skills, the enhancement of physical appearance and overall general presentation, all with the ultimate aim of having the child assimilated and accepted as much as possible into the local community. Obviously, acceptance very much depends on ability to communicate, and children with communication difficulties are very much at a disadvantage.  In this particular school the scandalous situation exists that 42 children have been assessed as being in extremely urgent need of therapy and another 20 are in urgent but not very urgent need, but the position as of now is that they receive no therapy whatsoever. That needs to be remedied without delay.</P>
    <P>I have received representations from parents about this.  Some of them have informed me that they have children who are moderately mentally handicapped and who have not received therapy for in excess of nine years.  This in turn leads to tremendous anger and frustration in the child, leading to temper tantrums and making it extremely difficult for parents to cope.  It all comes back to the essential ingredient, that is, the necessity for an individual to be able to communicate.  It is terrible that when a child is unable to communicate and these situations develop, the powers that be do not take the necessary action to resolve the matter.</P>
    <P>I am calling upon the Minister to make <Col N="2087" /> additional speech therapists available in the county so that children in mainstream education can get a proper opportunity in life and those in the school I have mentioned can get what is their right.  It would be a humanitarian gesture if the Minister were to accede to my request tonight and I strongly urge her to do so. The situation as I have outlined it merits a favourable reply.  The present situation cannot be allowed to continue.  If it does, hundreds of children who would otherwise have perfect communication skills will be damaged for life.  I do not think that would be the wish of the Minister. In those circumstances I strongly urge that my request be considered favourably.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Health has asked me to reply on his behalf.  I am aware that there are wide variations in the availability of speech therapy services in different parts of the country.  The Southern Health Board employs 11 speech therapists, three in County Kerry, one principal and two basic grades.  The board recently made an application to the Department of Health for the appointment of six additional speech therapists and this is being examined in the context of other applications for staff improvements in the board's area.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons for the inadequacy of speech therapy services is the lack of adequate numbers of trained speech therapists.  The Department of Health has taken steps to remedy this by arranging for six extra training places to be provided at the School of Clinical Speech and Language Studies at Trinity College, Dublin, commencing in the current academic year.  The total student body will increase in phases from 80 students this year to 104 students in 1995-96.  I am confident that the increased level of graduate output resulting from this important development will, in the medium to long term, ease difficulties in the area of speech and language therapy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to point out that officials of the Department of Health <Col N="2088" /> have had discussions with the Irish Association of Speech and Language Therapists and have provided assistance towards the preparation by the association of a review document of speech and language services throughout the country. This document is currently being finalised by the association and I hope it will be of assistance to the Minister and the Department in bringing about further improvements in the service.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health recently announced that he is making available £1.5 million this year for improvement in services for people with physical and sensory disabilities.  The Department of Health will be having consultations with health boards and other agencies and it is the intention of the Minister that a proportion of this will be devoted to improving and expanding community based therapy services, including speech therapy.</P>

      <P>Steps will be taken in relation to third level grants to ensure that no student is deprived of access to third level education because of his or her financial circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us consider for a moment what has happened in the meantime.  Less than three weeks two of the colleges, UCD <Col N="2089" /> and Trinity College, announced that they were seeking a fee increase of 8 per cent for new entrants to their colleages at the beginning of the next academic year.  The other colleges have indicated that it is their intention to follow suit.  Moreover, at the same time the National University of Ireland has announced that it will be imposing a charge of 70 per cent on students who wish to matriculate on the basis of their leaving certificate results, thereby putting another barrier to those who would aspire to enter third level education, despite the fact that when the matriculation examination was abolished it was the belief of all of us that with the abolition of the examination would go the abolition of that fee.  That is what has happened to the cost of third level education.</P>
    <P>The 8 per cent that is now being sought is 8 per cent on top of a previous 8 per cent hike on last year's fees.  Consider the impact that will have on parents and students at the commencement of the next academic year.  It is sometimes said that third level education is the preserve of the middle class.  That is no longer true, because I know of nobody in the middle class who will now be able to afford to send their child to third level education unless something is done to arrest these escalating costs.</P>
    <P>Parents in the PAYE sector are forced year after year to borrow large sums of money from banks to pay the fees of their third level student children.  As for children who come from what is loosely called working class families, the percentage attendance of such young people at third level is a scandal and an affront to those who support social justice.  All the fine sentiments in the Programme for Government about increasing access to third level education are worthless in the light of what has happened in the meantime. I call on the Minister to take all appropriate steps open to her to ensure that no fee increase will be passed on to students, whether grant-aided or otherwise, at the commencement of the next academic year.  I call on her to talk to the heads of universities and the people in the Higher Education Authority in that <Col N="2090" /> regard.  If it involves using the new Structural Funds, what better way could they be used?</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister also to instruct the National University of Ireland to abolish the 70 per cent registration fee as it is both unjustified and unfair.  It is one more barrier to the possibility of less well off students advancing to university courses. I ask the Minister of State to convey my deep disappointment to the Minister at her failure to be present tonight.  Week after week she has told us here that this matter is under review and that a body is deliberating on those matters.  When will it publish its decisions?  How much more anxiety will be visited on students, who have less than three weeks to go the commencement of their leaving certificate examinations and have enough to worry about without having additional financial worries inflicted on them?</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Quill for raising this matter and giving me the opportunity to respond. The fee increases for the 1993-94 academic year are currently the subject of consultations between the committee of heads of Irish universities and the Higher Education Authority and a meeting in that regard took place today.  My Department will review the position in the light of the outcome of those consultations. I assure the Deputy that the Minister is mindful of the position and it is because of her concern that meetings are taking place.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the Programme for Government, we are committed to widening access to third level education and, as the Minister accurately quoted what is contained in the programme in that regard, I will not repeat it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's approach to ensuring greater access to third level for students from disadvantaged backgrounds will encompass a number of strategies, including increasing retention up to the end of second level through curricular initiatives and the development of support services in schools &mdash; for example student counselling and guidance services <Col N="2091" />&mdash; tackling out-of-school factors, particularly, through the development of home-school liaison in disadvantaged areas; further building on links between universities and second level schools in disadvantaged areas in collaboration with the institutions; and encouraging and supporting institutions in the development of access courses for students who require special assistance in making the transfer to third level.</P>
    <P>The third level student support schemes are currently under review as part of the process of preparing the 1993 schemes.  In this review all relevant matters, including income eligibility limits and the rates of grant payable, are being examined.  In addition, and in pursuance of an overriding concern to examine the fairness and equity of student support schemes, the Minister for Education has set up a special expert advisory group on third level student support with a mandate to recommend appropriate criteria for assessment of eligibility on grounds of means, with reference to equity and the financial capacity of parents and applicants to pay, and to examine and make recommendations for the most effect and efficient organisational arrangements for the administration of the scheme.  The group, which has invited submissions from all interested parties, is due to report in July 1993 and the Minister has undertaken to publish the group's report at that stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that she will.  She has given that commitment. In the current year the total third level student support for fees and maintenance is more than £83 million compared to £75 million in 1992, a 12 per cent increase. The available figures indicate that more than 56 per cent of all students currently in third level are receiving some form of grant assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the higher education grants scheme alone, as a result of the very significant package of improvements introduced last year there are now some <Col N="2092" /> 18,477 students in receipt of grants in the current academic year.  This is a marked increase of some 21.5 per cent on the comparable figure, 15,211, for the 1991-92 academic year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Approximately 1,000 students, staff and others use Dunshaughlin Community College regularly. A recent study by an environmental consultant from Great Britain showed that significant quantities of asbestos were found in the atmosphere and in dust particles on surfaces in the college.  In particular a trace element of chrysotile and a medium level of amosite were found to be present.  Those test results confirm that asbestos is present in the school and that a hazard exists.  The major hazard from asbestos is extremely serious &mdash; the inhalation of fibres which cause lung cancer and mesothelioma, both potentially fatal diseases.  The consultant stated that without further investigation he cannot assess the likelihood that the presence of asbestos will result in such diseases in students or staff in the college. However, he stated that there is no known threshold level of exposure to asbestos below which there is no risk. That is a very serious statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Asbestos was used in the building of Dunshaughlin Community College in the seventies.  It was used in five other schools at that time also and in many other buildings in the sixties and seventies.  The problem did not arise from its use at that time but from the dust discharged into the atmosphere when the asbestos was being removed during the summer of 1992.  The college was reopened in September 1992 after Eolas, who was employed by the contractors, stated that this college was clear of asbestos.  Eolas was not an independent body; it was paid by the contractors.  Furthermore, the certificate indicating that the school was clear of asbestos by Eolas was not seen by the teachers and has been contradicted by the survey to which I referred.  That <Col N="2093" /> survey was conducted in May, many months after the work was completed last September.  It has transpired that the tests carried out by Eolas at the time were of undisturbed air.  Apparently, this is not the correct testing method.</P>
    <P>Under MDHS 39/3 standards, tests for asbestos presence should be carried out in disturbed air.  In other words, there should be a normal amount of agitation and movement in the room to rise dust up into the atmosphere where it is capable of being inhaled.  That level of disturbance was not done while Eolas was carrying out its tests.  It was done when the British consultants carried out their testing and as a result they found asbestos present in hazardous quantities while the Eolas test did not.  There is also the question of whether Eolas staff were present when the contractors did the work, or did they come along afterwards and carry out a test?  I understand that, under Statutory Instrument 34 of 1989, they are required to be present while consultants carry out their work.</P>
    <P>This is a very serious matter and of great concern to the teachers.  The teachers are not satisfied that the Department of Education is handling the matter adequately.  The Department proposes that Eolas staff will carry out another test next week.  However, given that Eolas carried out tests last September that were demonstrated to have been incorrect and given that they have a contractual and commercial relationship with the contractor, the teachers and staff are not satisfied that it should be the body to carry out the independent test on this occasion.  The teachers demand on behalf of the students and themselves that the premises be thoroughly cleaned, tested and certified by competent independent agencies, not Eolas.  They request that a register of all persons who were allowed use the school last September be drawn up and that those exposed persons be provided with a free annual medical test.</P>
    <P>There is a number of serious questions arising from what I have described. Are Eolas's procedures adequate for dealing with this problem?  This issue <Col N="2094" /> does not relate to just Dunshaughlin; it is likely to arise in respect of many other buildings, not all schools, where this type of material may be removed in future. Why was the school allowed to be opened last September?  Was there nobody in the Department of Education capable of looking over the tests and saying they were not carried out in a fashion that is satisfactory?  What guarantees will be given in regard to the health of the people concerned?  Who will be financially liable for putting the matter right?  It is suggested that the vocational education committee may be asked to do this, but it was the Department of Education who in 1977 specified that this material be used. The vocational education committee did not design the school; therefore it would be unfair to ask it to deal with the matter. There is also the question of liability in the event of anybody suing.  Who will be liable in such a case?  These are serious questions that must be asked.</P>
    <P>It is sad that this issue is coming to a head at a time when students are concerned about their exams.  There are two teaching weeks left and the students and staff should be concentrating on examinations and not worrying about asbestos. I am surprised that no officials are present for this debate to provide the Minister with any supplementary information on questions which I have raised and of which he may not have notice.  I hope the Minister will be able to provide comprehensive answers to the questions I have raised, because this is a serious matter and must be dealt with quickly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it gives me an opportunity to clarify the position.  I share the Deputy's concern in regard to this matter because before my entry to politics I was involved in the building industry and trade and I have experience of damage that may be caused by asbestos dust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Firstly, I would like to outline the background to this matter.  When Dunshauglin Community College was built asbestos panels were used in certain areas of the building.  Because of concerns about this material the Department <Col N="2095" /> sought advice from Eolas and, on receipt of its report, it was decided that while there is no immediate risk, it would be preferable to remove the panels in question from the school.  The work was carried out in the summer of 1992 by a specialist firm in compliance with the relevant legislation.  Eolas was engaged as an independent assessor to ensure that the prescribed standards were met, to approve disposal arrangements and to carry out clearance tests on completion of the works.  On completion of the contract the buildings were cleared as satisfactory.</P>
    <P>However, concerns have been expressed about the continuing presence of asbestos particles in some areas of the school and because of this my Department is arranging, in consultation with the vocational education committee, for further investigations to be carried out this coming Saturday, 22 May, to establish whether there is a problem.</P>
    <P>I accept that the Deputy has made a valid point in relation to proper testing procedures and the disturbance of dust. It is important that testing be carried out to the strictest criteria and I understand <Col N="2096" /> that will be done and the points raised by the Deputy will be dealt with.</P>
    <P>The testing procedure will be agreed with the vocational education committee and its consultant architect and if the asbestos levels are found to be above prescribed limits, the areas in question will be closed, decontaminated and retested until cleared.  On completion of this work a clearance certificate for the entire school will be issued.</P>
    <P>I wish to assure the Deputy that because of dangers associated with this material, I am anxious to eliminate any possible risk to the pupils and staff of Dunshaughlin Community College. Therefore, if it is found that the levels are above the prescribed limits, any work necessary to deal with the problem will be carried out immediately.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to stress that every effort will be made to ensure that there are no further doubts about the safety of the building and to allay any fears parents or staff may have.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 19 May 1993.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Commerce and Technology has had some general approaches from representatives of Independent Newspapers plc regarding the application of the Competition Act.</P>
      <P>I wish to point out that no proposal has been received by my Department under the mergers and take-over legislation in respect of the Independent Group increasing its shareholding in the Tribune Group, since the order prohibiting such an increase was made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, in January 1992 Independent Newspapers plc made a formal notification under the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978 (as amended) of its proposal to increase its shareholding in the Tribune Group from 29.99 per cent to a possible <Col N="1883" /> 53.09 per cent.  This proposal was referred to the Competition Authority by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The Competition Authority, in a majority decision, recommended that the proposal be prohibited.</P>
    <P>When the Minister made the order in March 1992 prohibiting the proposal, the reasons were that the proposal would operate against the common good, and that in particular competition in the market for Irish Sunday newspapers and, to a lesser extent, in the market for all Sunday newspapers and for advertising in all Irish newspapers could be so restricted as to operate against the common good.</P>
    <P>I should point out to the Deputy that Independent Newspapers plc and Tribune Newspapers plc have initiated legal proceedings by means of an appeal to the High Court.  In these circumstances I feel constrained from saying anything further until the High Court makes its decision.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the right of local authorities to attach conditions to planning permissions requiring contributions towards expenditure incurred or to be incurred for works facilitating the proposed development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the amount of development contribution varies widely throughout the country and even within planning authorities.  This is inevitable given different costs of providing services for different types of development.  I also understand that prior to 1 November <Col N="1884" /> 1992 Dublin Corporation charged development contributions on a case by case basis related to particular works required e.g. sewer connections, waterworks, etc.  I am advised however that the new development contributions regime, effective from 1 November 1992, applies a uniform levy, with some limited exceptions, on all development.</P>
    <P>I understand that the IDA have, in fact, already written to the Lord Mayor on the subject.  Obviously I would be concerned if such charges were likely to hinder enterprise development and the creation of new jobs in the city.  In my view it is important that the right balance is struck between asking for a reasonable contribution to developments while at the same time ensuring that employment generating projects are not inhibited.</P>

      <P>At present the cost of international telecommunications from Ireland is, on average, 40 per cent higher than that of our major trading competitors in Europe.  Under the re-balancing package, all international calls will be reduced by 40 per cent on average. The competitiveness of industry will be enhanced considerably through this rebalancing.</P>
      <P>To achieve long term sustainable growth in employment in Ireland, competitive operating costs are essential.  As a small export oriented trading nation, telecommunications is clearly a major means of communicating with our potential export markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1887" /> I expect that the reduction in international tariffs will be of particular benefit to the international services and tourism sectors which are particularly dependent on telecommunications for their operations.  On a global scale, these sectors continue both to grow significantly, and to be a major source of employment.</P>
    <P>Other sectors and activities which, I anticipate, will benefit significantly from the changes in charges include: central reservation centres, consumer service centres, technical and consulting services, European administrative headquarters, research and development services, financial services, and direct marketing and telemarketing.</P>
    <P>The rebalanced tariffs will place Ireland in the forefront of the competition for attracting employment from these sectors.  The Government will seek to encourage the creation of employment in telecommunications-based services firms, telemarketing and other related areas.  The Industrial Development Authority and Telecom Éireann will work together to create an extra 2,000 jobs in such services by 1997.</P>

      <P>I do not plan to ask FÁS to change this arrangement.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Oral Question No. 36 and Written Question No. 159 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Programme for Government contains a number of measures which come within or touch on the remit of my Department.  The programme provides for changes in the area of industrial policy, which I am in the course of implementing.  The objective is to improve both the formulation and management of industrial policy and its <Col N="1889" /> implementation; to further facilitate agency efforts to assist small businesses, County Enterprise Partnership Boards are to be established shortly.  Community-based employment schemes will allow for the participation of 15,500 people; in the area of training and manpower development I am introducing new apprenticeship and training schemes for those at work and increasing the level of direct interventions to train and upgrade the skills of the unemployed; targeted wage subsidies are being considered under the Community Support Framework 1994-1999; a national certification board will be established as part of the process of upgrading training standards; a study of the opportunities and scope for work sharing is being undertaken as part of the approach of the Government to increasing participation rates; the legal framework of employment law is to be updated and, in this connection, the Unfair Dismissals Bill is currently under consideration in the Seanad; provision has been made for an extra public holiday in May and improvement of consumer rights is under consideration. In this connection a Bill is being prepared to regulate all forms of consumer credit, including money lending. I hope to have it enacted before the end of this year.  A consumers' charter is under consideration also and preparatory work in this connection is underway.</P>
    <P>Most, though not all of the measures I have mentioned will have a direct impact on job creation.  They will all contribute to improving the efficiency and effectiveness of both the economy and of programmes and measures for assisting industry to create employment.  The extra jobs that will come from all of the structural interventions and changes that this Government is undertaking will come about as a result of business selling more at home and abroad, as a result of their increased competitiveness and their ability to increase market share.  Clearly then, jobs growth in business is something that Government policy can faciliate and assist, through not bring about.  The Government's programme and its decisions on implementing Culliton/ <Col N="1890" /> Moriarty recommended structural reforms will be a major facilitation, assistance and improvement of the opportunities and potential for creating and sustaining jobs.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Oral Question No. 37 and Written Questions Nos. 141, 142 and 143 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EC is party to the Multifibre Arrangement, generally referred to as the MFA, which regulates access to the <Col N="1891" /> Community market for textiles and clothing from Third Countries.  Ireland has obligations under the MFA by virtue of its membership of the Community.</P>
    <P>The MFA, as a derogation from general GATT rules, has been in operation since the early seventies and has been renewed on a number of occasions since them.</P>
    <P>The latest position is that, in accordance with the mandate given by the Council of Ministers, in October 1992, agreements have been concluded with many supplier countries for the next two to three years or until such time as eventual agreement is reached overall, on the Uruguay Round.</P>
    <P>Ireland and the Community are fully aware of the obligations to provide special treatment and market access for least developed countries which is taken fully into account in agreements with these countries.  For example, Bangladesh is dealt with as a least developed country and is treated in a very favourable way by the Community in the agreement signed in mid-December, 1992. There are no quota limits in this agreement but a number of sensitive categories is subject simply to surveillance.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the campaign being conducted by Comhlámh in Ireland, and that a similar campaign is being conducted in other member states.  The objective of this is to facilitate access to the EC market for Third World producers of textiles and clothing.</P>
    <P>I have received many representations in this regard.  In addition, officials from my Department have met with representatives of Comhlámh and explained the matter in detail to them.</P>
    <P>I have taken careful note of the points made by Comhlámh and can assure the Deputy that these will be taken into consideration in the context of Ireland's input into the determination of overall EC policy in relation to clothing and textiles in the future.</P>

      <P>The social employment scheme/community employment development programme is the primary manpower intervention aimed at helping the long-term unemployed, aged 25 years or over, re-enter the active workforce while assisting voluntary groups and public sector bodies to do worthwhile work which they would not otherwise have undertaken.  About 15,500 persons on average in 1993 would have been assisted under the programme.</P>
      <P>The employment incentive scheme is also targeted at the long-term unemployed as well as early school-leavers and disadvantaged persons.  It is proposed to provide about 1,400 places on the scheme in 1993.</P>
      <P>FÁS offers a wide variety of training programmes which cater for all unemployed groups, including the long-term unemployed.  More especially, FÁS runs an alternance programme which is specifically targeted at the long-term unemployed, aged 25 years or over, and those people wishing to return to the labour market after a prolonged absence. Special measures, operate in the 12 areas set up under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which focus on eliminating difficulties for the long-term unemployed in these areas.  Three of these areas &mdash; Tallaght, Dublin Inner City and Cork City North &mdash; receive special EC funding.  The assistance of the Co-operative Development Unit of FÁS is also available to unemployed persons with an interest in co-operative development. In total FÁS expects to provide some 16,000 training places in 1993.</P>

      <P>The 1 per cent employment levy was introduced as a temporary measure by the Minister for Finance in the 1993 budget.  The levy does not apply where an employee's income for the year is not greater than £9,000.  This income threshold ensures that, in addition to the 290,000 taxpayers who are exempted from income tax, a further 217,000 taxpayers will not be affected by the levy.  This threshold will also ensure that many employees in lower paid labour-intensive, indigenous industries will not be affected.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the levy has to be seen against the background of the income increases and tax improvements of recent years, which have produced a significant increase in real take &mdash; home pay and incomes generally.  The revenue from this temporary measure has helped to maintain a sound budgetary policy which, in turn, has contributed to the significant reductions in interest rates which have occurred since the budget.</P>
      <P>It is my view that the levy as a temporary measure is unlikely to be a serious handicap to existing employment.</P>

    <P>I would reaffirm what I said in my reply to a similar question on 31 March last, that the Government has not taken any decision to withdraw from the European Space Agency.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 55, 87 and 158 together.</P>
      <P>The creation of employment and the reduction of unemployment are the primary economic policy objectives of Government.  In the Programme for a Partnership Government, the Government set as Ireland's biggest challenge the need to increase the number of sustainable jobs within the economy and to reverse the rising trend of unemployment.</P>
      <P>The National Development Plan for the new round of structural funds will have employment and job creation as a key determining factor.  The Plan is being finalised at the moment and will be published shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objective of industrial development policy is to promote the development of strong internationally competitive industrial and international services sector in Ireland comprising both Irish and foreign owned companies endowed with the attributes which will enable <Col N="1898" /> them to compete successfully on international markets and which will make the maximum contribution to employment growth.</P>
    <P>Achievement of this objective will be reflected in</P>
    <P>&mdash;a greater integration of industrial activity with other sectors of the economy in order to increase the Irish value added share of industrial output;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the development of our natural resources as a foundation for increased industrial development;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the achievement of a satisfactory regional balance in economic development.</P>
    <P>The Plan will reflect a continuing need to strengthen the fundamental competitive capability and innovative capacity of the indigenous sector of industry.  A strong, competitive, outward-looking indigenous manufacturing and traded services sector is of fundamental importance to the development of the economy as a whole and to the creation of employment. The central focus of the measures being proposed for the period 1994-99 will be to develop the indigenous sector through an integrated development programme with each of the specific measures serving to complement the overall policy objectives.</P>
    <P>The objectives of industrial policy will be pursued through measures to upgrade and improve the capabilities and capacity of firms and of personnel to compete in the EC Single Market for goods and services as well as in third country markets.</P>
    <P>The attraction of mobile, manufacturing and services investment projects to operate in Ireland has been a major source of employment and a means for transferring high quality skills and capabilities to Ireland.  It will continue to be an important source of such benefits.</P>
    <P>In line with the approach of the Cullition report on Industrial Policy an important emphasis in policy for the years 1994/1999 will be to co-ordinate and, where possible, to integrate the <Col N="1899" /> measures to upgrade marketing, design, process and product technology and training for indigenous firms.  Unlike the generality of internationally mobile firms attracted to Ireland, indigenous firms tend to have development needs in areas of marketing, technology, skills and finance for expansion/marketing which represent an obstacle to their development and expansion of trade.</P>
    <P>While the primary emphasis must be on competitiveness and the creation of viable jobs, the plan will have to take account, as does the Programme for Government, of the large numbers of long-term unemployed who have to be reintegrated into mainstream economical activity.</P>
    <P>I cannot be more specific at the moment about the contents of the Plan as it is still under discussion but as I have already said it will be published shortly.</P>

      <P>I am assuming that the Deputy is referring to the job creation targets under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  Under this programme a target has been set to create 20,000 gross jobs on average each year in the manufacturing and international services sectors for the years up to and including 1993.</P>
      <P>These targets are set on a national basis and their implementation at a regional level is essentially a matter for the relevant industrial development agencies i.e. the IDA, Shannon Development and Udarás na Gaeltachta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as Shannon Development is concerned, their end of year statement last year indicated that their gross job creation target for 1992, 1,200 had been <Col N="1900" /> exceeded and that job gains of 1,697 were recorded during the year.</P>
    <P>This compares with a total of 12,056 first-time jobs across IDA supported industry, in 1992.</P>

The estimate provision is £83.811 million for an average participation this year of 13,500.  Consideration is being given to making further funds available for this purpose.</P>

      <P>The latest figures available show that in the EC we are in eight position ahead of Spain, Portugal, Greece and Luxembourg.  Within a broader band of 17 European countries compiled by the OECD, we are in thirteenth position.  Research and development expenditure in Ireland as a percentage of GDP was 0.55 per cent in 1991, as compared to 2.02 per cent for Germany, which tops the EC league table.  The EC average is 1.3 per cent.</P>
      <P>The latest EOLAS survey shows that in 1991, research and development expenditure by Irish business was £176 million.  This is 20 per cent up on the 1990 figure.  I believe that with the increasing awareness of the vital importance of research and development to the competitiveness of Irish industry and with the introduction of the new Industry Research and Development Initiative, research and development expenditure in Ireland will continue to show positive growth.</P>

      <P>On 30 April, 1992, the Taoiseach announced that the Government had accepted recommendations, which emanated from the 12 Area Partnerships and which had been endorsed by the Task Force on Employment, identifying a number of special additional measures to tackle various cash barriers and other disincentives which prevented people from availing of employment, training, educational and other opportunities.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, I presided at the launch of a report on the activities of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress Partnerships</i> which provides, <i>inter alia,</i> details of the extent to which progress has been made under these special measures.</P>
      <P>I also had the opportunity yesterday to hear from the chairpersons and managers of the twelve Partnerships about their experience of the implementation of these measures.  It is clear that the pattern of implementation has been uneven and I acknowledged that we have some ground to make up across the central Departments if we are to realise the full potential of the area allowances.</P>
      <P>Already significant progress has been made in implementing arrangements for the continuation of secondary benefits for long-term unemployed people engaged upon projects in Partnership areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whereas the area allowances strategy has made considerable impact in enabling the long-term unemployed to maintain a <Col N="1907" /> family income while starting out in self-employment, I am disappointed about the lack of progress to date in proceeding to full implementation of a parallel system of area allowances for long-term unemployed persons taking up paid employment on the one hand, and persons participating in recognised education or training schemes, including VTOS and FÁS courses on the other. There has been no particular problem in ensuring that participants retain their entitlement to secondary benefits.  I understand, however, that the Department of Social Welfare encountered initial difficulties in devising the administrative arrangements which would enable a standardised rate of Family Income-Supplement (FIS) to be paid to persons in receipt of the area allowances associated with paid employment and with education and training schemes.</P>
    <P>I am pleased, therefore, to be able to confirm that arrangements are currently being finalised by the Department of Social Welfare for FIS to be paid to persons availing of these special programmes in Partnership areas who fulfil the existing eligibility criteria for FIS.  I have assured the Chairpersons and the Managers of the twelve Partnerships that it is my intention to ensure that the outstanding features of the area allowances strategy will be resolved as soon as possible and that a co-ordinated strategy will be developed to publicise the special assitance these measures offer to long term unemployed persons seeking to return to work or avail of education/training opportunities.</P>

      <P>Since there is no requirement on Irish citizens to register at Irish diplomatic missions or consular offices, there is no accurate means of measuring the number of Irish citizens in any particular country.</P>
      <P>Estimates by the Australian Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs put the number of Irish-born people living permanently in Australia at around 100,000.  However, as the number of Irish citizens would include children and grandchildren of Irish-born people, the total number of Irish citizens living in Australia would be much greater.</P>
      <P>There is also no accurate means to measure the number of people of Irish descent living in Australia.  Academic experts differ in their estimates, but a generally accepted figure would be in excess of 6 million or something approaching one third of the population.</P>

    <P>With the exception of 1992, the picture since 1989 has been one of steady upward movement.  However the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-1997</i> recognised the need for an increase in our voluntary contributions to UN agencies. In line with this commitment our contribution to UNICEF this year has increased to £600,000.  This represented a three-fold increase over the 1992 figure and is the highest annual contribution made to UNICEF to date.</P>
    <P>As well as our annual contributions, Ireland frequently channels emergency funding for specific purposes through UNICEF.  An example is the recent donation of £100,000 to UNICEF for use in Southern Sudan in the framework of Operation Lifeline Sudan.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the probate tax is to increase the yield from capital taxation by applying a relatively modest charge on a wide base to estates passing on inheritance, of which only a small proportion attract a Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT) charge.  To increase the exemption threshold beyond the £10,000 provided for in the Finance Bill would undermine this purpose and would necessitate a higher rate of tax to achieve the same Exchequer yield.  Having regard to the fact that the rate of tax is only 2 per cent, that probate tax will be regarded as an expense of the estate for CAT purposes, and the payment arrangements which cater for illiquid estates, I am satisfied that the provisions of the probate tax strike a reasonable balance between the wider objectives of its introduction, particularly to increase revenues by broadening the base for capital taxation, and the desirability of avoiding an onerous charge on the transfer of businesses.</P>

      <P>The designation of Wexford Harbour as an SPA was agreed with the Department of Marine, the owner of the State foreshore area involved.  A further 11 areas were also agreed.  Because of the diversity of interests involved, it was decided to place a Public Notice in the four main daily papers requesting public submissions within a one month period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This notice was placed in the four main <Col N="1916" /> daily papers on 7 April 1993.  The same notice was placed in &ldquo;The Shooting and Angling News&rdquo; and &ldquo;he Marine Times&rdquo;.  A copy of the notice, information note and maps were sent to the following:</P>
    <P>(1) Relevant local authorities, county councils and corporations including Wexford County Council and Corporation.</P>
    <P>(2) Relevant harbour authorities, commercial and fishery.</P>
    <P>(3) Headquarters of all commercial fishing organisations as well as the Main Sea Angling Association.</P>

    <P>(5) The Irish Shellfish Organisation.</P>
    <P>(6) The National Association of Regional Game Councils.</P>
    <P>(7) Irish Wildbird Conservancy and Irish Wildlife Federation.</P>
    <P>(8) BIM and ESB</P>
    <P>(9) Information was supplied to any member of the public who requested it.</P>
    <P>A formalised right of appeal was not envisaged as the Department of Marine, the Government body responsible for State Foreshore areas, had agreed the designation.</P>
    <P>I will endeavour to re-assure all users of the area that the current usages of Wexford Harbour will not be affected, nor will foreseeable developments of these activities.  The sites currently proposed for SPA designations (including Wexford Harbour) are of international importance for wildbirds, and will remain thus so long as significant pollution, deterioration, or disturbance of habitat are avoided.</P>
    <P>It is in the interest of all users of the area that such deterioration would be avoided.  The designation of SPA's is an obligation under the EC Birds Directive.</P>

      <P>While there is no specific legal protection as such for Areas of Scientific Interest there is an administrative arrangement whereby grant-aiding authorities e.g. the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and Local Authorities consult the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Office of Public Works where proposed developments are to take place within Areas of Scientific Interest.  This is in accordance with EC regulations which state that grant-aid should not be paid where a development will adversely affect the environment.  The full implications of the recent Supreme Court ruling on the Clifden Airport case on the legality of designating ASI's are being examined by the Commissioners at present.</P>
      <P>Government approval was given in December last year to designate 1.25 million areas of land as natural heritage areas.  These are the most important areas for conservation of Ireland's native flora and fauna.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>In April 1991, I extended social insurance to part-time workers earning £25 or more per week.  This measure brought 27,000 part-time workers into the social insurance system for the first time and means that they are now insured for the full range of social insurance benefits and pensions.  The vast majority of these workers now have sufficient PRSI contributions to qualify for short-term contributory benefits such as Disability Benefit and Unemployment Benefit.</P>
      <P>Changes in the benefits system were required to accommodate this group. One of these changes related to Unemployment Benefit.  The purpose of Unemployment Benefit is to provide a replacement income for people who have lost their full-time jobs.  Now that so many part-time workers, some of whom normally work only a day or two per week, are covered by social insurance, it was necessary to review the conditions for unemployment benefit to ensure that they were in line with the scheme's objectives. The new arrangements require the claimant to have suffered a loss of employment in order to qualify for benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Initially, regulations provided that the employment lost had to be at least two days for persons normally working four or more days in the week and one day's loss for persons normally employed from one to three days.  In March of his year, <Col N="1923" /> I reduced this requirement to one day in all cases.</P>
    <P>Any person who is adversely affected by the provisions of these regulations may instead claim unemployment assistance for the days of unemployment. From April 1993, I revised the regulations governing the asessment of insurable earnings for Unemployment Assistance purposes to improve the position of workers with earnings from part-time work.  A person can now earn an amount equivalent to the normal daily rate of unemployment assistance plus an additional £15 per day for each day worked.  This, for example, means that a married man with two dependent children can earn up to £34.42 per day without affecting the rate of unemployment assistance payable for each day not worked in the same week.</P>
    <P>In the case of certain casual workers, including some dockers, the new provisions for the treatment of part-time workers may result in a reduction in their overall income when their period of entitlement to unemployment benefit is exhausted.  I am currently examining this situation with a view to further improving the position of these workers.</P>

      <P>Under current regulations a person who fails to qualify for an old age contributory or non-contributory pension is entitled to a refund of the old age pension element of any social insurance contributions paid provided the person was aged 56 or over when entering social insurance for the first time.  These arrangements apply equally to employed and self-employed persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the records of my <Col N="1924" /> Department the person concerned was over 56 when he first entered social insurance in 1988.  He paid contributions over the next three years.  On reaching age 66 in 1991, he qualified for an old age non-contributory pension at the maximum rate plus an adult dependants allowance for his spouse.  He is, therefore, not eligible for a refund of the social insurance contributions paid by him.</P>
    <P>However, the three years contributions which were paid gives his spouse a life long entitlement to a widow's contributory pension.</P>

      <P>The free electricity and free natural gas allowance schemes operated by my Department are available only to recipients of social welfare type pensions who are living alone or only with certain exempted persons.  In the case of the free electricity allowance scheme, the allowance covers the cost of the standing charge for a meter and 1,500 units of electricity per annum.  The number of units should cover the needs of an elderly person living alone.  Where the allocation of free units in any one billing period is not fully utilised, the surplus can be carried forward to the next billing period. A similar arrangement in regard to gas therms operates in the case of persons availing of the free natural gas allowance scheme.</P>
      <P>Eligible persons can choose whichever of the two schemes best suits their own particular circumstances.  There would be no monetary gain to the person in splitting the allowance between electricity and gas but practical, administrative and accounting difficulties would arise for the two utilities concerned.</P>

      <P>The annual report of the Garda Síochána Complaints Board for 1991 was received in my Department on 1 May, 1992 and was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas on 2 July 1992.  The Garda Commissioner's annual report on Crime in 1991 was submitted to my Department in August, 1992 and was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas on 30 September 1992.</P>
      <P>The annual report of the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests for 1991 has been received in my Department, on 16 December 1992, and has been submitted to Government and will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas shortly.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the annual report of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal for 1991 will be submitted to my Department very shortly and will then be submitted to Government as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 29 of the Video Recordings Act, 1989, requires the Official Film Censor and the Censorship of Films Appeal Board to submit annual reports on their activities beginning in 1990. Because of the added pressures in the Film Censor's Office arising from the implementation of the Video Recordings <Col N="1928" /> Act, 1989 delays have arisen in the preparation of the reports.  However, I hope to receive the reports for 1990 shortly and those for 1991 within the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>I am informed that the 1992 annual reports of the above bodies are in the course of preparation and will be presented to my Department as soon as possible and when received will be submitted to Government and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas at the earliest opportunity.</P>

In addition, there are three Juvenile Liaison Officers based in Coolock and two in Raheny. These members are closely involved with local community groups, schools, youth clubs and other youth-related activities in these areas.  The provisional crime figures for both the Coolock and Raheny sub-Districts for 1992 show a decrease over the previous year.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities inform me that they are satisfied that the current policing arrangements for Coolock and Raheny are operating satisfactorily.  However, they are keeping the situation there under continuing review.</P>

      <P>No funds have been allocated to-date by my Department under any of <Col N="1930" /> the above headings to the courthouses in County Meath.</P>
      <P>The provision and maintenance of courthouse accommodation outside of Dublin City is the responsibility of local authorities under the Courthouses (Provision and Maintenance) Act, 1935.  Any expenditure under the above headings would accordingly be borne by Meath County Council.</P>
      <P>While the statutory position is as set out in the 1935 Act, the Government decided in March, 1990 to relieve local authorities of the financial burden of providing and maintaining courthouses, the cost of which would be borne by the State.</P>
      <P>Because of budgetary constraints however it has only been possible to implement this decision to a very limited extent.  The provision for capital expenditure has had to be allocated to those courthouses where need was greatest.  It has not been possible either to recoup local authority expenditure on courthouse running costs.  Accordingly they are expected to make provision as heretofore.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that of the provision for Courthouses in the Book of Estimates only the provision for capital expenditure relates to provincial courthouses. Responsibility for the upkeep of the Dublin centre city courthouses was devolved from the Office of Public Works to the Department of Justice some years ago and the provisions for maintenance, heat, light and fuel, furniture and fittings and miscellaneous expenditure relate exclusively to those courthouses.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 137 and 138 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have indicated in the House and elsewhere recently, I am at present reviewing policy in relation to the operation of prisons.  That review will comprehend prison facilities and regimes together with, of course, issues such as the wider development of community-based sanction as an alternative to prison custody, the assessment of temporary <Col N="1932" /> release arrangements, etc.  The Recommendations of the Second Commission on the Status of Women, relating to female offenders, will be fully considered in this context.</P>
    <P>Refurbishment of the existing Women's Prison in Mountjoy, which I viewed recently, will bring about a significant improvement in the conditions which pertained for female offenders over the years.  So far the cellular accommodation has been refurbished to a high standard, including the provision of sanitation facilities in each cell.  This has already been achieved in D Wing of St. Patrick's Institution where female offenders are being housed while refurbishment of the Women's Prison is being undertaken.</P>
    <P>Planning for the upgrading of the remainder of the accommodation to cater for ancillary facilities, including education, work-training and recreation, is at an advanced stage.  The cost of the work undertaken so far is approximately £2.5 million.</P>

      <P>The Employment Appeals Tribunal made an award of re-instatement to the employee concerned under the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977. When the employer failed to implement the determination, the employee made a complaint to my Department.  My Department referred the matter to the Chief State Solicitor's Office for consideration as to the institution of legal proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have now been advised that, as the employer in this case has ceased trading, <Col N="1937" /> the re-instatement of the employee, as awarded in the determination, would now not appear to be possible.  However, my Department is currently consulting with the Chief State Solicitor's Office to establish if there is any other means by which the determination might be implemented.</P>
    <P>The employee concerned also made a complaint to my Department that he had not been paid his holiday entitlements under the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1973.  Having investigated this complaint, my Department referred it to the Chief State Solicitor's Office to consider the institution of legal proceedings against the employer.</P>
    <P>Legal proceedings were issued and the case was heard in the District Court in January, 1993.  While the court was told by solicitors acting for the employer that the company had ceased trading, and could not offer anything towards holiday money, the employer was convicted of offences under the Act and ordered to pay the employee £151.16 for holiday entitlements due.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, as the company has ceased trading, there are no assets from which to recover the sums owing.  My Department is currently examining the situation in consultation with the Chief State Solicitor's Office in conjunction with the examination of the employee's unfair dismissals complaint.  My Department will keep the employee informed of any developments as they may arise.</P>

      <P>The proposed source is considered satisfactory with regard to the quality and quantity of supply.  The scheme was redesigned and expanded, at the suggestion of Galway County Council, in order to integrate the reservoir and distribution system more fully with the Council's planned water supply network for the area.  As a result, group scheme grants and contributions from group members are unlikely to suffice to finance this scheme which, in consequence, would require a substantial contribution from the provision for public water and sanitary services schemes.  Having regard to the overall demand on that provision, I cannot say when it may be possible to approve this scheme.  Group water schemes do not qualify for any EC funding at present.  The question of their eligibility for future EC funding is being pursued.</P>

      <P>All adult residents, regardless of citizenship, are entitled to vote at local elections in Ireland.  Similarly, all adult resident EC nationals are entitled to vote at elections in Ireland to the European Parliament.</P>
      <P>Adult Irish citizens resident in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands are entitled to vote at local elections and elections to the European Parliament held in those countries.  Irish citizens resident in Denmark have this right at local elections while Irish citizens resident in Belgium have this right at elections to the European Parliament.</P>
      <P>Article 8b of the Treaty on European Union provides that every EC national shall have the right to vote and stand for local and European elections in the member state of residence, subject to detailed arrangements to be adopted by the Council and any derogations warranted by problems specific to a member state.  The Treaty provides that these detailed arrangements will be adopted by the Council, in the case of the European Parliament, by end-1993 and, in the case of local elections, by end 1994.</P>
      <P>As the Council of Ministers has already commenced preliminary examination of the extension of these rights throughout the EC, I do not consider that approaches to individual member states would be appropriate at this stage.</P>

      <P>The informal meeting of EC Environment Ministers of 15 May, 1993, which I attended, was concerned with the following subjects on which Presidency/Commission papers had been presented: transport and the environment, environment protection and employment, and environmental aspects of Community Structural Funds.  Discussion of these questions was wide-ranging, and generally concentrated on the direction of future Community policy in these areas rather than on national situations. The Presidency did not formulate informal conclusions of the meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Transport and the environment was the principal subject of discussion. Ireland shared in the general consensus that environmental considerations should be adequately integrated into <Col N="1945" /> transport plans and policies, while emphasising the considerable differences between transport conditions and needs of peripheral and central European member states.  There was a wide view that a joint Environmental/Transport Council should be convened at a future date to progress this matter further.</P>
    <P>On environment protection and employment, there was consensus on the gravity of the unemployment situation throughout the Community and the need to harness environmental protection policies and the growing environmental industry to alleviate this situation.</P>
    <P>On the Structural Funds, there was a shared view that the environmental credentials of regional development plans (the National Development Plan in Ireland's case) should be clearly demonstrated, as envisaged in the draft Framework Regulation for the Structural Funds.  There was also an exchange of views on monitoring requirements in this area, and in particular, the operation of environment impact assessment.</P>

      <P>An application for a road freight carrier's licence was received from the applicant in question on 2 September 1992.  The applicant designated as a transport manager an individual who already had full-time employment elsewhere.  It is my Department's general policy not to approve transport managers who by virtue of such employment, are unable to continuously and effectively manage the transport business.  This difficulty was communicated to the applicant by letter of 22 December 1992.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 216 and 217 together.</P>
      <P>I do not have available in my Department the information which would enable me to calculate the average duration of a domestic telephone call made in the Dublin (01) exchange area on Telecom Éireann's network.  As I indicated in my statement on Telecom Éireann rebalancing package a special survey of all local calls made on Telecom Éireann's network during a week in September last indicated that 72.5 per cent of all local calls throughout the country made were of three minutes duration or less.  I have no reason to believe these percentages in the (01) area were significantly different. The average duration of all calls was about 3.7 minutes ranging from under three minutes for peak business calls to over five minutes for off peak residential calls.  I might add that details such as average duration of calls made come within the operational responsibilities of Telecom Éireann and it would not be appropriate for me, under the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1993, to intervene in such matters.</P>
      <P>I presume the information sought in Question No. 216 relates to the cost of local calls in Ireland and in the other countries mentioned and this information is set out in the following table:</P>

      <P>There are 12 beds in the day ward at Beaumont Hospital.  I understand from the hospital that this ward has not been fully operational as a day ward since January 1993 as many of the beds had to be used to accommodate patients admitted through the Accident and Emergency Department when there were no beds available elsewhere in the hospital. Despite these difficulties, the hospital has treated 149 day cases in March and 109 in April.  In addition, the hospital has recently transferred some of its day case waiting list to the five-day surgical ward which will further relieve the pressure on the day ward.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>The last census of people with mental handicap was carried out in 1981 and indicated a population of 22,979.  It is estimated that the present mental handicap population is approximately 25,000.  Of these, about 15,400 have a moderate, severe or profound degree of mental handicap and most require extensive support from the health services.  The remainder have a mild mental handicap.  A minority of this group require ongoing support from the health services.</P>
      <P>Agreement has recently been reached between my Department and statutory and voluntary agencies providing services to people with mental handicap on the adoption of an information system which will be set up in the coming months.  This system will provide information, on an ongoing basis, on the numbers of people with mental handicap in each region, the number in services and awaiting services, their current and future needs and the level of support which is required to meet those needs.</P>

      <P>Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991, provides for the inspection and supervision by health boards of pre-school services for children under the age of six years and for the making of regulations in relation to such services.</P>
      <P>As I have previously indicated to the House, the next phase in the implementation of the Child Care Act will involve the commencement of Parts III, IV, V and VI which deal with the taking of children into care, court proceedings and the powers and duties of health boards in relation to children in their care.  The commencement of these provisions will greatly strengthen the powers of the health boards and the gardaí to intervene effectively in cases of child abuse.  It is my intention that they will be brought into operation as soon as the necessary staff, services and facilities that are required to underpin them have been put in place.</P>
      <P>When these provisions have been successfully implemented, I will proceed with the commencement of Part VII and the remaining provisions of the Act.</P>

However, the wide variety and turnover of workers in this industry, and the part-time nature of much of the employment, would make a compulsory scheme very difficult to enforce.  This consideration is recognised in the current draft EC Directive on Food Hygiene which does not propose compulsory training but rather would put an obligation on food business operators to ensure that staff are supervised and instructed and/or trained in food hygiene matters commensurate with their work activity.</P>

      <P>In the primary sector, the conditions of service of substitute teachers have improved substantially in recent years.  The current daily rate is £60.22 for a qualified substitute compared to £38 in January 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Due to the separate nature of the post-primary sector, my Department recoups schools the cost of substitute teachers in accordance with the Worker Protection (Regular Part-Time Employees) Act, 1991 which includes payment for leave and public holidays.  In the case of a part-time teacher time-tabled for a minimum of 11 hours per week for the full school session, my Department generally sanctions an eligible part-time teacher contract. <Col N="1981" /> This allows for benefits in excess of the minimum amount under the Worker Protection legislation including <i>pro-rata</i> payment for all school holidays.</P>
    <P>Where possible, in the case of replacement of one year's duration, the Department sanctions the employment of a temporary incremental/whole-time teacher.  She/he enjoys conditions very similar to her/his permanent colleagues. Common to both sectors, such service will reckon for incremental credit purposes and may also reckon for pension purposes.</P>
    <P>In all of the above circumstances, the teachers are liable for class A1 PRSI contributions which entitles them to the full range of the social welfare benefits though this is ultimately a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 249 and 253 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the schools in question have recently applied for inclusion in the disadvantaged areas scheme.</P>
      <P>As I have recently announced to the House, I am allocating additional ex-quota teaching posts to the disadvantaged areas scheme with effect from September, 1993.  As part of this arrangement, additional schools will be newly included in the scheme.</P>
      <P>All national schools were recently circularised and invited to apply for inclusion in this allocation.  On the basis of information submitted, schools will be assessed and prioritised in order of need.</P>
      <P>The applications submitted by the schools mentioned by the Deputies, together with applications received from all the schools that responded to the circular, will be given full consideration in this context.</P>

      <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the fact that, because of lack of school places for children wishing to attend St. Brigid's, Castleknock, Dublin 5, children are being denied an opportunity to commence school in some cases until they are at least five-and-a-half years of age; and if she is responsible for this change in policy which essentially makes school starting age five years or over.</Quest>

      <P>The enrolment policy of a primary school is a matter for the board of management. Generally, decisions on enrolment take account of the accommodation available, the pupils and staff already in the school, and the pupils nearest the school.</P>
      <P>My Department provides grant assistance for extra accommodation based on the number of places already provided and the projected enrolment for the area. In this instance no request for extra accommodation has been received in my Department.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a national school is determined by the enrolment on 30 September of the previous year.  In the case of City Quay national school, Dublin 2, there were 198 pupils enrolled in the school on 30 September 1991.  This enrolment warranted a staff of Principal plus six assistants.  The school also has the services of a full-time remedial teacher and a concessionary teacher under the special scheme of teaching assistance for schools serving disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>There were 189 pupils enrolled in the school on 30 September 1992 which warrants a staff of Principal plus five assistants for the 1993-94 school year.  An enrolment of at least 198 pupils was required on that date in order to retain the post of 6th assistant for 1993-94.</P>
      <P>The only exceptions that can be made from the agreed staffing arrangements are in the case of developing schools or where my Department's guidelines on maximum class sizes are being breached. If the school authorities feel that the school might qualify for the retention of the post of 6th assistant under either of these exceptions, my Department would be happy to examine the position on receipt of details.</P>
      <P>The school continues, of course, to retain the concessionary post allowed for schools in disadvantaged areas.</P>
